0,TheLittleSongbird,Doesn't float quite as brilliantly,7,5 December 2019,"Stephen King's novel is a masterpiece, didn't properly appreciate it on first read but with King's style being much more familiar to me (whereas it was a bit of a shock at first) it still stands as a genuinely scary, nostalgic, at times very funny and very powerful book and one of his best. The 1990 mini-series is an uneven one, with a great first half and disappointing second half with the ending and IT's true form having notoriously poor reputations for good reasons. Absolutely loved the first 'IT' film from 2017 and consider it better than the mini-series personally.'IT Chapter 2?' Not so much. Actually did find a lot to like about it, with a lot of what was great about the first film still here, and for me it is better than has been said. The mixed reception is more than understandable but it is not as terrible as the more negative reviews say in my view. Chapter 1 is the better film, but the second film is better than the second half of the mini-series on the whole and again it is a more than admirable and brave attempt at adapting an extremely difficult and near-unfilmable book.While there is a good deal to recommend, there are some glaring problems. There are problems with the pacing here. Especially in the middle act, where it meanders due to being too flashback heavy. Some flashbacks being more interesting than others, with Ben's and Richie's being quite unnerving, Eddie's (the too long adult encounter not much better) was neither scary or memorable. The special effects are more variable this time round and suffer too from overuse. IT's true form comes off worst and is as bad, am not kidding here, as that in the mini-series which is notoriously universally panned.The defeat of IT is beyond dumb and really undermines a final act that actually started off quite powerfully despite also being a bit too drawn out. Henry Bowers is also extremely underwritten, and both has little presence when having barely any screen time and quite badly overacted. Lets not get started on his very rushed, too easy and quite stupid defeat.However, as was said before there is a lot to like. The production values mostly are terrific, not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting, taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. Epileptics be warned though, there is a scene towards the end of the middle act that is heavy in strobe lighting effects. The music is haunting without being over-scored, ever since the first film it has been impossible to hear ""Oranges and Lemons"" in the same way again and that opinion has not changed. Andy Muschietti directs with suspense, potent realism, confidence and affection, while the writing (which is also remarkably true to King's style) has a great balance of hilarious comedy, touching drama and affectionate nostalgia. Richie getting the best lines.Much has been said about the film being too long, am mixed on this consensus personally. The book is huge and both the child and adult time-lines need a quite long length to do it justice, having said that the middle act definitely could have done with a trim. The story is not just a horror story, but also blends humour (mostly from Ritchie), emotion and a 'Stand By Like' like nostalgia. There are memorable moments here, the Mrs Kersh encounter, the Fortune Cookie scene and the very freaky beginning (am amazed they managed to film this scene) being standouts. There is one improvement here over the previous film, Mike is much more interesting here which was necessary as this time as an adult he is something as the glue of the group.Cannot fault the performances. All the adults are very well cast, with Bill Hader absolutely killing it as Richie, and the children are great again especially Finn Woolfhard and Sophia Lillis (the standouts in the first too). Bill Skarsgaard is again the stuff of nightmares as Pennywise, filling giant clown shoes with aplomb and putting his own spin on it. If asked who is better between Skarsgaard and the unforgettable Tim Curry, mainly because of more familiarity Curry gets the edge but they are both must sees in their own way.Summarising, not brilliant and uneven but enjoyed it on the most part. 7/10",It Chapter Two
1,Leofwine_draca,Crushed,4,31 October 2021,"I approached IT: CHAPTER TWO (2019) with some trepidation having heard of its poor reputation beforehand, and it turns out every bit of criticism was totally justified. Whereas the first chapter was a solid and enjoyable 8/10 for me, this sequel misses the mark in every respect and feels like it was made by a totally different team who had no idea what they were doing. It's a dragged-out, silly, and ultimately padded follow-up story that has no need to be three hours long; I thought it would just tell the adult story but it turns out we keep getting unnecessary flashbacks to the kid stuff too, which slows things down no end; as far as I'm concerned the kid story was done and dusted by the end of the first film.The book is my favourite of Stephen King's for the way it brings 1950s small town America to life but this is updated to the present so we miss all that. The cast members do their best with the characters given, but they all feel so bland here and quite interchangeable so there's no peril surrounding their predicament. I found Pennywise over exposed and a little silly, like Freddy in the NIGHTMARE sequels as they went on, and the oddly bloodless CGI scares become repetitive after a time. In the end, it just goes the way of mindless CGI action like most Hollywood stuff these days, so I'll be sticking with the 1990 miniseries methinks.",It Chapter Two
2,SnoopyStyle,I understand,7,16 October 2019,"It's 27 years later. Mike still lives in Derry, Maine. He's tracking suspicious deaths and calls up the rest of the Losers' Club. Pennywise is back.I understand what the movie is trying to do. It is definitely far superior to the 1990 mini-series. It's very apparent from that 90 movie that the kids' side is the far superior part. The adult side is a real problem that this movie is trying to solve. The solution seems to be to inject as much of the teen actors as possible with the constant flashbacks. First, the Chinese restaurant is better than ever. With more artistic cuts and great creatures, that section is lots of fun. The structure is still everybody gets their own scare section which can be repetitive and not that scary. The entire movie is not scary but it is fun to revisit this world. There is a reason why the movie goes back to kids on bikes. The new adult cast is great. The kids are a little older although it is supposed to only be that later summer. It's all fine but a step down from the first movie.For the third act, there are some good, some bad, and some I'm not sure. The spider-Pennywise looks good. It couldn't get worst than the 90 spider. I really question the sacrifice of the tokens mostly due to the battery acid line being lost. There is so much potential in using the tokens as weapons against Pennywise. Beverly's postcard could be used as a shield and Pennywise would break her shield by pointing out that she doesn't even know its true origins. It's crazy that Mike didn't bring his sheep-killing gun. I don't know about Mike. He did that to the artifact and I don't know why. I don't get his problem. I do like Richie's token story. As far as big final battle, it's mostly fine and I really like the bathroom. All in all, I wonder if a whole new rewriting of the franchise wouldn't be more compelling. I would have been interesting with a whole new cast of kids doing their Scooby gang while they research the old gang. This franchise works much better with kids.",It Chapter Two
3,claudio_carvalho,The Reunion of the Losers Club,6,31 December 2019,"When residents in Derry disappear, Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) summons his childhood friends from the Losers Club from twenty-seven years ago. Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain), Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy), Richie Tozier (Bill Hader), Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) and Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) head to Derry while Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) commits suicide. They reunite at a Chinese Restaurant and soon they recall their oath and the evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård). Meanwhile Mike tries to convince his friends to fight the clown again.""It Chapter Two"" is the sequel of the 2017 film based on the novel by Stephen King. The cast is impressive, with names such as Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy; the long production has great but excessive special effects; but the film is less scary that the first part. Bill Skarsgård steals the show in the role of the evil Pennywise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""It: Capítulo Dois"" (""It: Chapter Two"")",It Chapter Two
4,nogodnomasters,Sometimes we are what we wish we could forget,10,26 September 2019,"This is a well-acted horror sequel. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy add some names and class to the gig. Steven King had a minor role as a storekeeper. As in most films, it sticks to the book in some cases while it deviates in others. The special horror effects were excellent. There were too many characters to get emotionally connected to their personal drama, although they made an effort to try as they gathered their tokens.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",It Chapter Two
5,kosmasp,It ... concludes,8,25 September 2019,"Now there are talks about an even bigger overall cut (the second movie is almost 3 hours as it is), so I can't talk about that right now of course, but I for one am looking forward to that, if it comes to fruition. Having said that and from what I remember from the 90s ""It"", this was consistent! I liked the first chapter and I really like what they did with this one too.There may be things in the book that are still not included (some being a bit too adult or even sick from what I've heard), but this is quite extensive. And while this is quite predictable to some extent, it still manages to scare and entertain at the same time. This is not hardcore horror and I acknowledge that some may feel cheated, but if you can just watch it for what it sets out to do, you may be thoroughly entertained",It Chapter Two
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"It was fair, it just lacked true horror.",7,15 September 2019,"I made the decision to watch the first part just prior to seeing this second chapter, as for me it's one film. I'm glad I did, it's a direct continuation.I think the ups and downs of the first film apply here. On the plus side it looks wonderful, it's slick, well produced, overall it was visually appealing. Bill Skarsgård makes a wonderful Pennywise, he's terrifying and captivating, I loved how he moved and spoke. Very well acted, I especially loved James McAvoy, clever casting.On the downside, it's the scariest, most messed to book I've ever read, that horror didn't translate well, I felt like I was watching an adventure thriller for teens at times, it had lots going on, lots of thrills, but horror? No. It was a bit formulaic, each character hot their respective item, and each was terrorised one by one, it needed more surprises, more shocks.I preferred the first part, but I think they did a good job here, I hope it's released with both chapters linked. Overall, I enjoyed very much.Chapter I 7.5/10
Chapter II 7/10",It Chapter Two
7,classicsoncall,"""If it ever comes back, we'll come back too.""",7,1 October 2019,"After what I thought was a brilliant first installment of ""It"" by director Andy Muschietti, I felt this follow up was somewhat anti-climactic. While the first film had some genuinely horrifying and unexpected moments, this one seemed to tread on the borders of the phantasmagorical with a make it up as you go sensibility. As adults, the members of the original 'Loser's Club' didn't appear to have the same camaraderie so much as a duty to return to Derry and battle the malevolent evil that resurfaced after twenty seven years. I did get a kick out of the Stephen King cameo, and it would have been neat if the name of his character's antique shop was called 'Needful Things'. There was also that nod to ""The Shining"" with the 'Here's Johnny' sequence played a couple of times during that frantic exchange. It probably didn't help that I had a hard time with the theater's sound system causing me to miss some of the dialog, and I probably missed some nuance with the characters. IMDb reviewers as I write this give the film a 7.0 rating compared to part one at a 7.4 which I guess is fair enough, though as I mentioned, my top rating of a '10' for 2017's ""It"" diverges somewhat more compared to this flick.",It Chapter Two
8,jboothmillard,It Chapter Two,8,15 September 2019,"The original 2017 It was a fantastic adaptation of the Stephen King novel, much slicker than perhaps the 1990 TV-made Tim Curry movie, and it became the highest-grossing horror movie of all time. The first film ended with the words ""It Chapter One"", so naturally a sequel would follow, which also served as the conclusion to the story, directed by Andy Muschietti (Mama). Basically, in 2016 Derry, Maine, Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and his boyfriend Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) are attacked by a group of homophobic youths. Adrian is then thrown from a bridge, suddenly Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård, Stellan's son) appears at the side of the river, Don watches helplessly as the demon kills Adrian. A grown-up Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), now a librarian, overhears the incident on a police scanner and rushes to the scene. Mike realises that ""It"" was not defeated and has resurfaced, so he calls the other members of the Losers Club back to Derry. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a successful mystery novelist in Los Angeles and is married to a English actress Audra (Jess Weixler), Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan), formerly overweight, is fit and a successful architect living in Nebraska, Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain), now Rogan, is a successful fashion designer in Chicago and endures an abusive marriage to husband Tom (Will Beinbrink), Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) a successful stand-up comic in Los Angeles, Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) is a successful risk assessor living in New York City and is married to Myra (Molly Atkinson), and Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is a firm accountant in Atlanta, Georgia and married to teacher Patty Blum (Martha Girvin). Most are amnesiac about their childhoods and disturbed by the calls but agree to return. Stanley, however, commits suicide after his call. The Losers reunite at a local restaurant and slowly begin to recover their memories, but are terrified by disturbing visions of fortune cookies coming to life or containing hideous creatures, created by It. The group is then informed of Stanley's suicide. Richie and Eddie decide to leave while Mike tells Bill about meeting a Native American tribe who showed him a vision of It arriving to Earth from the stars, and about the Ritual of Chüd, a way of destroying It once and for all. Bill and Mike convince Richie and Eddie to stay and finish what was started, reminding them of the blood oath they made as children. It is revealed that bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived the fall down the well, he was arrested by police. Since then Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) has been confined to a mental hospital, but he escapes, with the help of It, and makes his way to Derry to find and kill the Losers. For the ritual to work, each Loser must have an artefact from their past. Beverly goes to her old home and finds the love letter Ben wrote for her, though she still believes Bill wrote it. Bill goes to the storm drain where his brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was killed and recovers Georgie's paper boat before meeting a boy named Dean (Luke Roessler) who says he hears the voices of children and sees a clown. Ben goes to the town's high school and, he realises that his artefact is his old yearbook page, which Beverly was the only person to sign. Eddie goes to a pharmacy and recovers an inhaler. Richie goes to an abandoned arcade where he finds a game token. While finding these objects, it flashes back in time to see young Bill (Jaeden Martell), young Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), young Beverly (Sophia Lillis), young Richie (Finn Wolfhard), young Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), young Stanley (Wyatt Oleff) and young Mike (Chosen Jacobs). The flashbacks reveal other frightening encounters the Losers had with Pennywise and It's other guises, but also the happy memories they shared together. After escaping individual encounters with It, the Losers use a shower cap from their childhood clubhouse for Stanley and Mike finds the rock that started their fight against the Bowers gang ago. Bill realizes that It is going after Dean and rushes to a carnival to save him, but he helplessly watches Dean be devoured by It right in front of him in the hall of mirrors. Traumatised by his failure to save both Georgie and Dean, he returns to 29 Neibolt Street to murder It. Bowers attacks and wounds Eddie and Mike but is killed by Richie. The rest of the Losers head to the Neibolt house to help Bill. The group descends into a massive cavern beneath the sewers and complete the Ritual, throwing their artefacts into the fire inside an ancient ornament. This only summons It, unaffected by the ritual, It becomes a giant, spider-like form with Pennywise's head. Mike is pressured by It into revealing to the Losers that the Natives who attempted the Ritual in the past all perished. The Losers are then thrown into nightmarish scenarios while in the cavern, but they each escape. Richie is hypnotised and paralysed by It and is about to be killed, but Eddie saves him, being impaled by It in the process. The Losers regroup and realise It can be killed if they stand up to him and make him feel smaller, so they insult It over and over, making him physically shrink and weaken. When small enough, they are able to tear out It's heart and crush it, killing It once and for all. Eddie dies from his injuries despite Richie's attempts to save him. The remaining Losers are forced to escape, as the Neibolt House collapses to the ground. The remaining Losers return to the quarry where they once swam together. Beverly realises it was Ben who wrote the letter all along, they share a kiss and start a romantic relationship. Richie returns to the bridge where he had once carved his initials, alongside Eddie. Mike decides to move out of Derry to start a new life. The Losers all receive posthumous letters from Stanley, explaining that he believed he would have held them back, he believed his death would reunite them, and he knew they could defeat It if they were brave without him. Also starring Owen Teague as Patrick Hockstetter, Logan Thompson as Victor ""Vic"" Criss, Jake Sim as Reginald ""Belch"" Huggins, Peter Bogdanovich as Peter the film director, and Stephen King as the Shopkeeper. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader and the others do well as the Losers Club grown up, the young actors make a welcome return as their childhood counterparts, and of course Skarsgard steals the show as the disturbingly nasty shape-shifting clown. It recreates a few of the moments from the 1990 version, the special effects are fantastic at bringing the sinister demonic images to life, I agree the ending is maybe not as dramatic as it could have been, and some complain it is too long, at almost three hours. But it uses its time well, like the first film you feel for the characters, and it draws you in, a most enjoyable supernatural horror. Very good!",It Chapter Two
9,BA_Harrison,The killer clown from outer-space is back.,8,6 September 2019,"The otherworldly creature that terrorises the Maine town of Derry every twenty-seven years is back, reuniting the now grown-up members of the Loser's Club, who swore to try and defeat the evil once and for all should it return.Chapter two of IT is, unsurprisingly, very similar to part one: effectively creepy, occasionally gory, and slickly directed, with excellent performances from both the young actors from the first film (who appear in flashbacks) and their adult counterparts. Also putting in another superb turn is Bill Skarsgård, who returns as the monster's quasi-human form, scary clown Pennywise: he's just the right mixture of unsettling and humorous. Hell, even Stephen King delivers a decent cameo as the owner of an antiques shop (the mega-wealthy author making a funny about writers being rich).Despite numerous attempts by director Andy Muschietti, I can honestly say I didn't jump once (I've seen more than enough horror movies to not fall for the obvious scare tactics), but I was suitably impressed by the inventive designs of IT's many forms, from the creepy old naked lady to the disembodied spider-head (a nice homage to John Carpenter's The Thing) to the final massive monster. Besides, the lack of genuine frights is more than made up for by the comedy, which was great throughout, with Bill Hader as Richie being particularly amusing, the best scene involving three doors and a very cute dog.At 169 minutes, I can imagine that the film will be a touch on the long side for many, but I found that it whipped by with nary a dull moment and kept me entertained throughout, which is more than I can say for some of the much shorter, more recent and more lauded horror movies of the past couple of years (Us and Halloween, to name but two).",It Chapter Two
10,paul_haakonsen,Not as good as the first chapter...,6,6 October 2019,"In comparison to the first chapter of this remake, then the 2019 ""It: Chapter Two"" was just a massive step back in the wrong direction.Why? Well, first of all, Pennywise wasn't scary at all. In fact, it was progressively getting more and more difficult to take him serious as an embodiment of evil as the movie progressed, because he was just too goofy. And whereas he was genuinely disturbing in the first chapter, the clown was just loosing it in chapter two.And running at close to three hours, ""It: Chapter Two"" was just too long, and too much of a drag to sit through, especially when so much of the contents just felt like it was there to fill in the movie and add to the play time of the movie. There were so many things that could easily have been trimmed away without the storyline suffering.The CGI was good, and definitely carried the movie a long way. But some of the CGI such as the long-limbed old woman chasing Beverly was just too comical and didn't really feel like it fit into the movie.It was nice that they actually had Stephen King himself in the movie for a short cameo.They had a good selection of casted actors and actresses to perform in the movie as the adult versions of the children that Pennywise stalked and fought. It was really nice to see James McAvoy in the movie.All in all, this wasn't really a fulfilling conclusion of the first chapter, and I was left with a feeling of 'was that really it?' when the movie ended. The movie was not as intense and interesting as the 2017 ""It: Chapter One"" movie was.I am rating ""It: Chapter Two"" six out of ten stars.",It Chapter Two
11,CinemaSerf,CGI on steroids....,5,24 November 2019,"I watched the two films in a double bill and I really did want to enjoy this as much as I did the first - but boy, could this have been much more of a let down? The original has a far better cast; snappier direction and a much tighter script. This just rumbles along with a staccato, portmanteau-style storyline that robs the narrative of much of the cohesion of it's earlier iteration. The ending is straight out of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" without the roller skates!. Sadly disappointing.",It Chapter Two
12,Calicodreamin,Scary!,7,28 September 2019,"I was definitely hiding behind my jacket for most of the movie. The scares are for sure there, and the pennywise make up and acting are spot on. The storyline plays out well, and I enjoyed the transitions from the adults to children. The ending is a bit weird and doesn't always make sense. But I would consider the scare level on par and the storyline well developed.",It Chapter Two
13,george.schmidt,Still floating ....,7,7 September 2019,"IT CHAPTER TWO (2019) *** Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, Andy Bean, Bill Skarsgard, Jaeden Martell, Wyatt Oleff, Jack Dylan Grazer, Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, Chosen Jacobs, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Teach Grant, Nicholas Hamilton, Xavier Dolan, Taylor Frey (Cameos - Stephen King and Peter Bogdanovich) Follow up sequel to the remake of the Stephen King chiller with The Losers' Club re-uniting reluctantly 27 years later to their hometown of Derry, Maine to kill-off once and for all the demon clown Pennywise who has reawakened slaking his thirst on anyone within its reach, and all the more better for the seven friends who attempted to extinguish it's existence. Director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman reteam to deliver the shivery goods if it is a tad padded (nearly 3 hours long) with the young cast as well and their older alter egos (all well served overall).",It Chapter Two
14,neil-476,Good but long,7,22 September 2019,"6 of the 7 members of the Losers Club which defeated It have left Derry and, in the course of 27, have found success but forgotten their childhood trauma. Mike Hanlon remained behind however, and when the child murders start up again, he contacts his old friends to remind them of the blood vow they made when they were kids.Part 1, which told the story of the kids getting together and defeating It (as manifested in the form of creepy Pennywise the clown) was very successful, Chapter 2 completes the story. The climax takes some liberties with the book. To be frank, I found the climax of the book to be somewhat lacking, and the film recognises this criticism and has some fun with hit with, one assumes, Stephen King's approval, given that he cameos in the film.That's about it, really. The cast are moderate adult representations of their younger incarnations (Bill Hader is wonderful as Richie Tozier), there is a surprising amount of humour, the kids also appear (digitally de-aged) and the film incarnation of monster-It as appreciably better than the book or TV miniseries version.Watching both movies will consume 5 hours of your life, so plan carefully.",It Chapter Two
15,morrison-dylan-fan,IT:The Dud Chapter.,4,4 September 2019,"Having found the first IT (2017-also reviewed) to be fantastic when I caught it on disc,I was happy when a friend told me a IT double bill was taking place at cinema. Finding the first to be even better than I remembered,I got set for the second chapter.View on the film:The lone person to return from the writers club of part one, the loss of Chase Palmer and Cary Joji Fukunaga is one greatly felt in Gary Dauberman's adaptation of the second half of the novel,, where once each member of the Losers Club was given a progression in their character arc of defeating their fears and a growth in maturity, is here replaced by Dauberman with keeping them all largely in one place, (with only Richie being given the sliver of change.)This is most notable in the poor writing treatment of Beverly,whose suffering of parental/spouse abuse is revealed to leave her with deep scars, none of which leads to a cathartic release that the films had appeared to be building towards.
Staying true to the opening of the adult time-line in the novel with a horrific homophobic attack from thugs, Dauberman begins a recurrent theme of presenting what should be major events in the Losers Clubs lives,only to leave them hanging,from the opening attack, to Bill trying to save a child who gets killed by Pennywise, leading to Bill crying for five minutes, only to completely move on and no hint of the psychological effect it has had on him being offered. Bringing a new Comedy element into the tale, for the first hour Dauberman actually makes it work, via the sarcastic jokes they share actually establishing the bonds the adult Losers Club share, which builds to a Chinese meal reunion set-piece (the highlight of the film) that balances laughs with Pennywise shocks.Digging ""going underground"" (both physical & mentally) as being the main theme of the title, Dauberman shovels up the suppressed memories of the Losers Club,and buries the film. Going into long individual flashbacks,Dauberman takes them to a repetitive dead-end,due to Pennywise clearly not being a threat in the sequences due to it being flashbacks,and all of them going round in circles which instead of adding depth to the characters, lands on miss-placed gags.Running a gag across the film that people hate the ending,Dauberman ends the adult time line in the Losers Club epic fight on a hollow note, because of a failure by Dauberman to build arcs underground, but incredibly,at the last minute finds the spirit of the first IT,and delivers a touchingly poetic quality to the fading childhood days of the Losers Club.Craning down to the Losers Club on their bikes, returning director Andy Muschietti displays in his close working with cinematographer Checco Varese, (replacing Chan-wook Park's regular cinematographer, the far superior Chung-hoon Chung,who did IT 1) a striking skilfulness in capturing a fading memory of childhood summer days atmosphere, spinning on long crane/panning shots of the Loser Club kids cycling down the sun-lit streets of Derry.Continuing a motif first drawn in Mama, (2013-also reviewed) Muschietti links the chapters with excellent, highly-stylised transition shots/ overlapping images,turning the pages to the unresolved childhood traumas overlapping in the adult lives of the Losers Club,and in the two stand-out jump-scares, (in a house of mirrors and at a sports game) Muschietti offers a glimpse of using shadows in making Pennywise an imposing figure.Making a drastic change from the first, Muschietti places most of the jump-scares to take place in daylight,which without the aide of the gloomy lighting from part 1, in the cold light of day look shockingly poor, amateur hour,flat CGI creations. Going underground for the final, Muschietti and Varesecharge at the End of Level Boss the films have been building towards, and ruins it all by covering the entire 40 minute set-piece in strobe lighting which jabs the viewer in the eyes,and makes it almost un-watchable.When not masked in a overload of naff CGI, Bill Skarsgård makes a chilling return as the animalistic Pennywise, whilst Bill Hader gives the stand out performance in the Losers Club as Richie,thanks to Hader using his comedic skill of giving out dead-pan one-liners,to actually build a character arc for Richie,with Hader capturing Richie's gradual fear that they are all about to write their final chapter in life.",It Chapter Two
16,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Substandard follow-up that doesn't have a lot to like,4,20 January 2020,"Returning to their home-town, the now-adult group of friends finds they've been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown Pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town, forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all.This was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort. Among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there's just no reason for the running time to last this long at all. So much of this one could've been cut down or outright removed, from the introduction of the gang one-by-one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could've been accomplished easier, to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown's influence. That these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever, serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through. It highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen-time as we're focusing on the kids' flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times. The other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat. The CGI here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the Chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob-like mess that's incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works, much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start. Likewise, flashbacks to show the kids interacting with Pennywise, featuring the confrontation in the apartment, the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are. It's pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear, really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort. There are only a few select aspects that work here. Despite generally being underwhelming, the encounter with the kid in the hall-of-mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting, the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes. As well, the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of Pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over-the-top action that at least puts some life into things. Combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results, these are all that work for this one.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underage smoking and continuous violence against children.",It Chapter Two
17,trashgang,too long but still worth seeing,7,16 October 2019,"So close after part one already a next step into the story. But people said it's better then part one but clocking in at 3 hours I was wondering if it could deliver.It (no pun intended) did here and there. Some scenes were too long, especially when we have throwbacks to explain stuff. That's okay if yoy haven't seen the first one but not needed if you have seen it. Some humor thrown in here and there surely adds towards the rating of It chapter Two.But still, it's a horror. And it's in that region that it's better than the first one. Full of jump moments and some really well done effects. Even so good that you started to forget Pennywise himself. But when he comes in he surely brings in the horror. The end is a bit the same of sigh the forst one, same house, same things to destroy him.Is it all that good, not all. Nope, what the hell with the killing of the child in the beginning. Nothing happens afterwards with her story. Still, I enjoyed it but a bit too long as said before.

18,mm-39,Lacking!,3,8 September 2019,"It Chapter Two is lacking. Many cliche here for an audience here: Gay couple which gets beat up by town toughs. (there is always the town tough angle) The black family burned out years ago ( there is always a bad town secret) The old tribal ritual which will get rid of the creature. ( there is always some ancient ritual. How and why it works is never explained) Well It Chapter Two becomes a formulated movie, which turns into story about childhood PTSD, and bad dreams. Every past memory must have the chasing dream sequence. Yet another cliche, which turns into another C G I fest. We never find out what, why of the clown, and or the history behind it. The remake is different from the book and other movies. The end is like a therapy session of shrinking down bad feelings and memories. Nothing about the clown, and more about the characters growing up and past. The first movie was what the second was not. Maybe the joke about not knowing how to finish a story is a joke about the movie. Maybe the break between part one and two made the story lacking. Well 3 stars there is something just lacking.",It Chapter Two
19,deloudelouvain,For the coulrophobics it's going to be a nice scary evening.,8,1 December 2019,"Pennywise, probably one if not the most recognizable clown ever seen on a big screen. Stephen King's character scared so many people almost everybody knows him. I enjoyed the book, I enjoyed the television mini-series, as well as the the first It on big screen. It Chapter Two is even better to me, and apparently after reading some reviews I must be one of the only ones. I don't get what people expected from this sequel. To me it was spot on, with a great cast, good CGI's, and a story that is never boring and that while the movie is almost three hours long. For a movie that long to not getting bored is already quite an accomplishment. It's one of those horror movies I will watch again, not really for the scary moments as clowns are just not scary to me, but just to watch my wife who has a serious case of coulrophobia.",It Chapter Two
20,siderite,"Stellar cast, great acting, good material",8,19 January 2020,"... but not much else. I may be tired of all the sequels and remakes and prequels and all this regurgitated crap. I mean, we all knew how the story was going to unfold, even if the ending is slightly different and now Maturin is an Native American drug root and Pennywise sprouting spider legs prompts a The Thing reenactment.My point is that the first film was always the better one, even in other adaptations. The children's fear is huge because they are children and their courage is so much more important. Pennywise was barely articulate in the first film, now he is talking and having agents that do his bidding. The rules have changed dramatically. It's not a creature that devours every 27 years, it's one that is rebooted every 27 years. In the first film they were all friends, in this they are adults that have not seen each other in decades. How am I going to feel anything for them, regardless of the quality of the acting?Bottom line: the experience has to be different for people who don't remember the Tim Curry version or that have not read the book. Perhaps waiting a few years and then watching both films back to back offers a different enjoyment level. For me, it was just a better version of something that had already been done and brought nothing new to the table. It was scarier, but somehow it felt less meaningful. And yeah, the ending was always going to suck.",It Chapter Two

Set 27 years after the original all of the kids the losers club has grown up and moved only strangely after a call all return to the small Maine town to reunite and you guessed it face the evil clown himself. The cast has memories of yesterday and their fright moments of childhood as the flashback scenes capture culture and times of the 80's and 90's so well with the clothes, movies, music and other things.

22,cherold,Fun followup,8,8 December 2019,"I enjoyed 2017's It, an exciting though not scary horror movie with good special effects and an interesting cast of characters, and to me, It 2 is very much in keeping with the first one. It's got a lot of fun, exciting, clever moments and keeps your interest.I was surprised when I read the user reviews and found a notable consensus that the movie wasn't as good as the first. But I do see their points, now that I think about it. Separating the characters to go on their episodic journeys of discover does keep the movie from flowing as smoothly. And I did find the ending somehow anticlimactic, even as it strived to be otherwise.That being said, I still thought it was, generally speaking, as fun as I remember the first one being. The cast is quite good, particularly Bill Hader, and it's interesting to see how they've changed and not changed from childhood.I'd say the best way to watch this is immediatly after watching the last one. I had years between them, but now people don't have to watch one then wait. So have at it!",It Chapter Two

24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Imperfect but still admirable concluding part to the story,7,9 September 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWhen a series of child killings start again in the small town of Derry, Maine, Mike Hanlon, the one member of the 'Losers Club' who stayed behind, is forced to summon the other six back to defeat the monster they swore a blood oath to defeat. They have all gone and carved highly successful lives for themselves, but all make good on their promise to return, with the exception of Mike Hanlon, who commits suicide. Fuelled with a burning desire to honour his memory, they band together to defeat Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the evil clown, once and for all.When the remake of the original TV adaptation of Stephen King's epic novella was released two years ago, it was easy at first to anticipate it being another throwaway, cookie cutter remake of the sort getting churned out on a pretty regular basis these days, but lo and behold it went and became the most successful horror movie of all time. This was especially appreciated by viewers like me, to whom the original novel and TV film had a special impact on their early years. And so, this essential second part, from the same director Andy Muschetti, has rolled around, wrapping up his interpretation of Stephen King's original source material. At just under three hours, no one could accuse him of being anything less than thorough, and while it's quite flawed, it's still a fairly satisfying endeavour.Once again, Muschetti has gone all out and strove to include parts from the book that were absent from the TV series, including Adrian Mellon's brutal homophobic murder and the Ritual of Chud (although strangely the Bradley Gang slaughter is missing, odd since I'm sure I saw it featured in the trailer...editing floor), making it a more in depth and accurate account. But the best thing about it is....Pennywise. Or, more specifically, Bill Skarsgard's performance. He really comes into his own in the role here, bringing it alive and electrifying the screen with his presence. If his version of the role, and Tim Curry's from the TV film had been around at the same time, I would have struggled to differentiate which was more terrifying on the basis of this.Unfortunately, this is not enough to detract from the hammy, over the top delivery of the grown up Losers (a problem with the child stars in the 2017 film too!), an equally roughshod description of some of the important side characters (most notably Henry Bowers, whose pact with Pennywise to bring down the Losers is never properly hinted at!), an uneven balance between horror and humour and an overly excessive use of loud, harsh jump scares that get too much after a while.It scores more hits than misses, though, and is a more than satisfying closing chapter in this phenomenally successful 21st century reimagining (with even Stephen King himself making a self referential cameo.) ***",It Chapter Two
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An imperfect part two.,7,8 September 2019,"'It Chapter Two (2019)' is larger than its predecessor in almost every way, most notably in its record-setting run-time (it is, after all, the longest horror film to date). As we all know, bigger doesn't always mean better. Thankfully, its inflated length doesn't necessarily feel like a misstep. Its pacing is pretty consistent and, despite a slightly baggy second act, it manages to remain engaging throughout. Even though it never quite captures the rag-tag spirit of the first flick, the piece seems like a genuine continuation of the overall story. Its cast are basically dead ringers for their young counterparts, recapturing their personalities within minutes of being on screen. The group dynamic isn't as strong as before but it still feels tangible, affected by a shared history that no member can quite remember alone. Plus, some scenes capture a real sense of child-like joy or heart-wrenching camaraderie, further highlighting the characters' indelible chemistry. When all the actors are together, the movie works rather well. This is especially true of its climax, which is exciting and entertaining in equal measure. It makes you care about every member of the losers club and, this time, the stakes are real. It helps that most of the key players have somewhat of a character arc as they each reveal their repressed, more real-world fears and struggle to overcome them. Of course, the flick has its issues. Firstly, it's really over the top. Most of the time, the on-screen horror just comes across as a little silly (people were laughing in my screening). Some of its horrific imagery works well, don't get me wrong. Pennywise is meaner and almost more menacing this time, leading to a villain that's not so much frightening as straight-up despicable. The picture is at its most successful when it pulls back on the CG and focuses on what you can't quite see, slowly tugging at what the characters fear most. Occasionally, it's rather suspenseful. However, it's never scary. Its second major issue is its tendency to aim for, and usually miss, comedy. Obviously, the odd bit of levity is in its DNA but, here, the humour doesn't always feel character-based and is often quite clunky - especially since the piece has an overall darker tone than the prior title. It takes you out of some key moments, as opposed to grounding you within them, and is only successful when it's the kind of uncomfortable laugh used to alleviate tension, one that comes strictly from a place of character. The film also has a slightly repetitive structure, primarily in the aforementioned baggy second act. For all its issues, though, it's still an enjoyable experience. By its end, it satisfyingly wraps up the saga. In a way, it's more than the sum of its parts. It's fun, but it's an imperfect part two. 7/10",It Chapter Two
26,ThomasDrufke,Derry Never Leaves You,8,15 September 2019,"I don't know that I've ever anticipated a horror film more than It Chapter Two. The first film transcended the genre and created a thrilling and captivating small universe inside of Derry. So inevitably it was going to be difficult for Andy Muschietti and company to capture the same magic they did in 2017. The sequel doesn't necessarily live up to the high expectations of the first film, but it very well may be scarier. The Losers Club 27 years later contained just as much charisma and chemistry as the young kids, including a standout performance from Bill Hader (who continues to prove why he's one of the best talents Hollywood has), and I can never get enough of Bill Skarsgård as the titular It/Pennywise. However, the film is probably about 20 minutes too long and the ending doesn't necessarily stick the landing. But I would be very curious to see if Muschietti puts together one long cut of the film that could almost work as ""mini-series of sorts"", coming full circle with the first adaptation in 1990.8.0/10",It Chapter Two

I will admit that the movie probably is too long. It's the longest horror movie I've ever seen!The characters are still pretty likeable. Richie's my favorite and I could have sworn that was Dana Gould playing him. I liked seeing their future careers as I could totally see them doing those kinds of things as adults.

33,ironhorse_iv,"This movie did clown around a little too much in the gutter. Regardless, it was amusing enough to overlook most of the flaws even if the story didn't quite flow right.",6,13 November 2019,"Considering the source material of the same name from author Stephen King is a muddled, excessive and highly gimmicky 1000+ page novel about a shadowy extraterrestrial being that exploited the fears and phobias of its childhood victims, by disguising itself with the form of Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgard) to devour them. It makes sense for director Andy Muschietti to try to split the work into two films 2017s 'It' & 2019s 'It: Chapter Two' with the first one focusing on a group of kids known as the Loser Club standing up against Pennywise with the other with them as adults returning to finish the job of trying to kill it. For the most part, the first part kinda work, as it wisely cut off nearly all the outrageous dated or highly offensive stuff like the under aged gangbang, cosmic turtles and the Universal Monsters cameos. Instead they smarter use unique newer scares, swim in a quarry as symbolic baptism and working as a team as the main reason they achieve defeating the creature. However in the sequel, it brought back certain parts really didn't work & wrote new stuff that seem really jarring. One of them was the whole date clichés stereotypical homophobic attack with a plucky individual has nothing to do with the main plot. It felt unrelated. Also, what is with all the focus on sexuality orientation? That was never the main focus in the novel. It felt a little tack on especially with Richie Tozier (Bill Hader). To add on that, why is Pennywise targeting fearless adults in the first place!? The film could do better if it start with the naive girl gone missing. It would keep true to the lore. Nevertheless, that wasn't the only problem. Another was the Ritual of Chüd which like the novel doesn't really go anywhere. As an excuse for Losers to help gain their childhood memories back, it's pretty weak & lame. They seem pretty well knowledge for the most part of the gang's own history before trying to seek their tokens. To add on that, the awkward flashbacks to their younger selves was somewhat annoying & highly repetitive. The callbacks to the previous film just add to the sequel's bloat and erratic pacing. Muschietti has over 4 hours of footage because of that. He states that he plans to use the unused footage for a possible future film or a super cut. Either way, the child performances in this movie didn't stand out as much as the last flick. Also the young thespians grew tremendously in the 2 years following filming. Because of that, they had to be digitally de-aged in some scenes. The final effect came across as uncanny valley bizarre for some audiences. In short, it's probably best that all the kid's scenes should had been cut to focus more on the adults for a tighter film. After all, I miss the catatonia kidnapping subplot involving actress Audra Phillips (Jess Weixler) than the group clumsily running around. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy much of their undertakings across town even if some of the clichés loud jump scares involving the creatures were pretty hokey and fake-looking like the CGI Paul Bunyan statue coming to life or like the leper attack with the oddly place random Juice Newton's pop song 'Angel in the Morning' playing in the background. Some of them had potential of being really scary like the witch. That's only if the filmmakers went 1980 'the Shining' room 237 route of showing a more realistic dead old woman rather than a silly wacky troll doll. Nevertheless I did had the most fun with the fear doors and the Pomeranian in spite of it not being that scary. It was funny. Even the bloodbath and being buried alive sequences were somewhat well done. However, there was still a tone problem. The way, the film intermixed comedy with the disturbing imagery aspect was a bit odd. Despite that, one thing the film should had drop was Henry Bowers (Teach Grant)'s subplot. Unlike the book, his presence here doesn't really add anything to the film. Plus it's really hard to believe that the character survived his giant fall from the last movie. At least, the film made the right decision by not adding abusive husband Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink) to the mix. The movie only needed one villain: Pennywise. Once again Bill does a great job. Nevertheless the climactic battle between him and the Losers felt a little bit recycled from the last movie with the individuals overcoming their fears again. I would rather have the flood scene from the book. To top it off, I hate the film for making suicide seem like a good thing like some sort of noble sacrifice. Suicide is an incredibly tragic act and to frame it here as a calculated, heroic move is not only irresponsible, but dangerous. In truth, it doesn't make the group durable, it only passes the pain onto them, making it harder. To romanticize suicide, is going against the previous film's core message that working together make them all strong. As for performers playing the Losers. All of them individually were great in their roles with Isaiah Mustafa's performance being the weakest as he is given all the exposition dumps lines when it should had been Jay Ryan's character. Regardless all were great with their on screen chemistry with each other especially Hader, James Ransome, Ryan and Jessica Chastain with James McAvoy being the weakest due to his character not interacting much with the others. As for the cameos. I love Stephen King the best, but in the end, there's a recurring joke in this movie about a writer who cannot write a satisfactory ending to any of his novels. This is what I felt about this movie. Overall: While, watchable & lightyears better than the 1990 miniseries of the same name. This sequel didn't can't quite find the It-factor. It was mediocre.",It Chapter Two

35,The-Sarkologist,"So Long, so flat",3,9 September 2019,"Honestly, this movie was just ultimately boring. Personally, I'd probably leave it at that, and also, in a way, I feel that I have certainly been dragging my feet when it came to writing this review (though a part also has to do with a lot of other work that I have had to do as well). Mind you, it isn't as if the sequal was unplanned when the first movie was released - for those who are familiar with the story would have known that the movie actually would need to take up two parts, and this is the second part is where the heroes of the first movie return as adults.The story goes that most of them have left Derry and made their way in the world, some of them in good positions, others of them not so good. However, one of them has remained, just to keep his ear to the ground, and to see if Pennywise decides to return, as he suspects he would namely because there was a consensus that they didn't quite beat him as kids. Not surprisingly, twenty-seven years later, the reports start to emerge that Pennywise has indeed returned.
One interesting thing is that one of the guys has become a successful author (and in fact it seems that they have all gone out to become quite successful, another one of those rather annoying tropes that seems to appear throughout Hollywood films, though to be fair, the original novel also had then quite successful as well). Well, the thing is that even though he is successful he simply does not know how to write an ending. Mind you, I do sort of wonder whether it is actually possible for an author to be able to become successful it the author can't write an ending - I thought that was a necessity when it came to penning good literature.Yet, the thing was that with the original film, we all absolutely loved it, but when the ending came along, we pretty much all rolled our eyes and cried out 'we waited four hours for THAT!'. Actually, some of King's best works are pretty awesome books, but have pretty abominable endings (such as The Stand). So, it turned out that they decided to try a make the ending of this film somewhat more engaging.I'd have to say it did work. I did actually appreciate Pennywise's true form much, much better than the original, though it does seem to suggest that we aren't really all that sure as to what is actually his true form. Remember, Pennywise is a master of illusion, and that is the theme that is constantly running through the film. We never quite know what is real, or what is not real. Still, the thing was that this film simply did not seem to be anywhere near as thrilling as the original - Pennywise was so much scarier in that one.Yeah, I had to admit that I really, really wasn't all that impressed. In fact it certainly did feel as if this film was a complete and utter waste of almost three hours, though I do have to admit that the ending to this one was a little better, even though we never truly found out what Pennywise was, beyond an alien that is - that was something that was pretty clear.Oh, the other thing that really annoyed me with this film - there were so many cut scenes back to the first film. In fact the number of cut scenes really did feel as if the producers suspected that most people wouldn't remember the first film, so decided to rehash some of the scenes from that. Granted, that was the case with me, but honestly, I'm not all that sure if it was really all that necessary. In fact, it was these cut scenes that really did make me feel as if the film was overtly long, and as soon as I realised what was happening, my immediately thought was 'I've already seen this!'. Then again, I also suspect that without the cut scenes, we might not have quite realised what was going on, especially if we hadn't seen the first one for quite a while, and would have simply been confused, and scratching out head. I guess you can't have it either way.",It Chapter Two

I loved the first movie with a terrifying Pennywise stalking Derry and a group of kids trying to stop it. The plot follows 27 years later, Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), and the rest of the Losers club return to Derry to stop It once and for all.The film opens with a haunting beginning about a young guy getting attacked and stalked by Pennywise. The rest of the film builds up the characters with the Loser club being adults. Bill is a famous writer for Hollywood and writes books with terrible endings. Beverly leaves an abusive relationship. Richie is a comedian. Ben works for a corporate company. Eddie is still a neat and health freak. Stanley is living a normal married life. And Mike still lives in Derry while investigating the current disappearances. Their own worst fears comes back to haunt them when they reach Derry. One by one they face this mysterious clown. While trying to save other children from being lured by the clown.The film is a little bigger than the last movie. It is longer and a lot more happens with the plot. The origins of It and how they are supposed to stop it. Some past bullies comes back to haunt the Losers club. I am not sure how faithful this film is to the novel. But it is nearly similar to the original movie/series with Tim Curry. The film has plenty of thrills and scares to make this film one of the best horror films of this year. The cast ensemble is perfect. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, and Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise. They all were great with their characters. The film brings back the original children actors back as it explored more of the events of that summer when they first encountered It. Those kids personality and the adults were a perfect combo.There is also one suspenseful scene with Bill going into a haunted walk through house ride at a fair. Trying to save a kid with mirror maze hallway. Which is thrilling. The climax of the movie is epic. There fight against Pennywise is insane. Characters are separated and faced with their own fears. The ending is satisfying with a conclusion to the characters and the story itself.Overall, It Chapter 2 is a great film. Even though it was 2 hours and 48 minutes long. The story is well spread out to develop the characters and their encounter with Pennywise. The cast is perfect.

It may not have been a perfect film by any means, but it did utilize a great cast of child actors and achieve a sort of cultural-zeitgeist ""Stranger Things""-esque appeal. When it comes time to bring in the adults and execute the ending of Stephen King's iconic story, however, ""Chapter Two"" fails miserably in a number of key areas.For a basic overview, ""It Chapter Two"" sees the Loser's Club reunited in Derry 27 years after It was presumed dead. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), now the town librarian, has called them all back because the evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) has sprung upon Derry once again. So, Bill (James McAvoy), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Ben (Jay Ryan), and Beverly (Jessica Chastain) return to their childhood abode to try and finish It off this time around.There are three major problems with this second part that make it a pretty abject failure...First and foremost, director Andy Muschietti (and presumably writer Gary Dauberman) do not grasp why, as audience members, we should care about the adult Losers. It's easy to root for a group of young kids chumming around together and then trying to stop a ferocious evil. The reason we care about the adults, however, is because 27 years later they are each dealing with relatable ""adult problems"" (abuse, addiction, job failure, etc.). King expertly captures this in the novel, whereas this film pays it lip service (and even paltry lip service at that). Here, the only reason we are given to care about the Losers is that ""they were once kids"". It is very telling that the best parts of ""Chapter 2"" is when it flashes back to the ""kid scenes"".Secondly, the scenes involving the adult Losers having their own ""voyage of discovery"" just don't make any sense. It was almost more of an excuse to create hideous CGI monsters than it served the plot whatsoever. For example, Bev's meeting with an old woman living in her apartment was legitimately creepy...until it turns into a giant hulking monster straight out of a fantasy piece. In these moments, the filmmakers seemed to forget that ""It's"" horror is as much psychological as visceral.Finally, the ending is severely disappointing for fans (like myself) of the King novel. Not focusing on spouses robs the movie of the books' incredible coda, while the final battle with Pennywise/It is almost laughable. To even call it an adaptation of the book's ending is a stretch. While I realize that some of the narrative ""punch"" would always be taken away by splitting the story into the ""kid half"" and ""adult half"", even then this ending doesn't elicit even the slightest emotion or any sense of gravitas.It seems like what may have happened over the course of these two movies is that the filmmakers were so focused on the mechanics of adapting King's brilliant (yet rather unwieldy) story that they sort of lost track of the ideas behind what made it all work in the first place. This wasn't on display nearly as much in the first part, as that installment was just so much fun, but in this one that failure is as plain as day. Putting the kids in the 80s was a great narrative choice, but other than that almost all the other changes are for the worst.Perhaps the worst thing I can say about this big-budget production? If forced, I'd still have to call the 1990 TV miniseries ""It"" adaptation my favorite. While that production certainly had warts of its own, it much more accurately captured both the physical and psychological horror of King's original intent. Besides some great child acting performances, this two-film duo doesn't accomplish either of those things.",It Chapter Two
41,eddie_baggins,An over-long sequel that floats rather than fly's,5,6 September 2019,"2017's It was a genuinely surprising smash-hit that faithfully adapted the first half of Stephen King's famed novel, seemingly coming out of nowhere to take the box office by storm and receive raves from critics, now two years on the stakes are higher than ever with It Chapter Two arriving with a raft of expectations attached to it.They're expectations that are impossible to ignore and that aren't met here in returning director Andy Muschietti's bloated, at times great, at other times just plain bland sequel that sees us re-join the Losers Club 27 years on from their initial terrifying battles with Pennywise the demonic (alien?) clown.Most glaringly detrimental to Muschietti's horror outing is the fact there's no justifiable need for Chapter Two to be 169 minutes long.Featuring one of the most overblown and long-winded finale's I can remember laying my eyes on, there's a lot of great individual scenes in this new clown filled ride (another effectively creepy opening, a visit to a tea drinking grandma and a baseball game encounter particular highlights) but Muschietti over estimates how much we want to see of this film that outstays its welcome and gets overly sentimental on the past far too often, easily becoming 40 - 50 minutes too long in the process.Hot off the heels of the cultural phenomenon that was and still is Stranger Things, the first It also benefited hugely by our likeable Loser Club being filled with a rag-tag group of mismatched buddies and misfits, a squad of kids and teens that got caught up in a terrifying ordeal and while our protagonists remain the same characters, having them now become tortured adults doesn't quite give us the same experience the first outing offered up.It's not to say the casting is bad, on the contrary, by having interesting casting choices such as James McAvoy as the stuttering Bill Denbrough, Jessica Chastain as the tortured soul Bev Marsh, James Ransone as the easily scared Eddie Kaspbrak and MVP Bill Hader as the wise-talking Richie Tozier, Chapter Two gives us some great character beats that are well played by its cast but there's a lot of filler in amongst all the necessary development, holding back the film from making us care as much as we did previously for this group of acquaintances.Elsewhere in the film the returning Bill Skarsgård is on point again as Mr. Pennywise but used in intriguingly short bursts that make you wish he had a little more to do overall, whenever his on screen the film feels unpredictable and more than a little unnerving, bringing an excitement and energy that lights up the screen, just when you think you can't take any more of our Loser's looking back to the past or wandering around their old town of Derry.Some other elements of Muschietti's film that also fail to fire outside of the overdone extended final stretch are the lack of genuine scares that are to be found in the film that seems to want to focus on spectacle rather than memorable scares, some really quite bad CGI work, while the bizarre decision to have old-time foe/bully Henry Bowers to return once more to terrorize our gang is a seriously odd one as his reappearance is so unneeded and underdone you wonder what on earth the whole point was.Final Say -Fans of 2017's It will find enjoyable moments within Chapter 2 while newbies will be wondering what on earth is going on in a film that is far too long for its own good. Filled with some great scenes scattered around a lot of filler, It Chapter Two really does float rather than fly.2 ½ Fortune Cookies out of 5",It Chapter Two
42,leonblackwood,Preferred the first movie! 4/10,4,20 January 2020,"Review:
Well, that's 3 hours of my life that I won't be getting back! I was really disappointed with this film because the plot is all over the place, and the whole back and forth in time thing, made the movie drag. The horrific Pennywise scenes were a bit random, and I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters like I did in the first film. On the plus side, there are some ""jump out of your seat"" moments, which were pretty scary, but you don't get to appreciate the attention to detail because it's mostly shot with a dark palette. I did enjoy the first movie, which is why I was so disappointed with this sequel, and I personally don't know why it's nearly 3 hours long. Anyway, in 2016 Derry, Maine, Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by Pennywise after a gang of homophobic teenagers beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner, Mike Hanlon (Isiah Mustafa) discovers It has returned and calls his childhood friends, Bill (James McAvoy), Eddie (James Ransone), Richie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan), Stanley (Andy Bean), and Beverly (Jessica Chastain), back to Derry to honour the promise they made in 1989, to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories, while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death. Richie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to Its Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail to leave town without fulfilling their promise. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that they can stop It for good. After the others agree to perform the ritual, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from there past to be sacrificed. Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the Neibolt house and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. Meanwhile, in the Losers old clubhouse, Mike advises the others to find their artefacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly finds Ben's love letter at her old home, still believing Bill wrote it and encounters It posing as Mrs. Kersh. Ben recalls his childhood encounter with It at high school before realising his artefact is the yearbook page Beverly signed which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artefacts, a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise taunts Richie about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size. Bill finds his childhood bicycle and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed. The group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, and they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after It emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Will the Losers finally kill It with there new ammunition? You have to watch the 3-hour epic movie to find out! Although they used established actors in this movie, and they gave each of the characters some depth, I didn't feel the emotion that I did in the first film. Also, the storyline didn't seem to flow properly because it looked like various sketches pieced together. In terms of a horror film, it didn't have the same shock value as the first film, and for a movie in this genre with a 15 rating, I don't know what type of audience this was made for. With that aside, it still made a profit so I wouldn't be surprised to see a third movie in this franchise. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Andy Muschietti, who also brought you Mama and It. With only 3 major releases, he has done a good job, in terms of box office takings, and now that he's working with established actors, the only way is up for this newcomer. With 9 movies in development, which include Dracul, Time Machine, Attack on Titan, The Howling, Robotech, and DC's, The Flash, which is due to be released in 2022, he's obviously become a bankable director that studios are willing to take a risk with.Budget: $79million
Worldwide Gross: $473millionGenre: Drama, Fantasy, Horror

43,TheMovieDiorama,It: Chapter Two clowns around attempting to adapt a seemingly unadaptable second half.,5,7 September 2019,"There's a cruel irony that haunts the now all grown-up Bill, a screenplay writer, that represents my opinion of King's infamous conclusive half. ""The ending kinda sucked"". Having read the novel, watched the original miniseries and survived my own nightmares, I came to the conclusion that the adult section of 'It' is terribly written and highlights the very worst of King's writing techniques. It's balls-to-the-walls insanity with a thematic presence that loses its ingenuity built lovingly from the first half, in this case 'Chapter One'. Unfortunately, as hard as Muschietti tried, not much of the near three-hour runtime made any impact and produced a seemingly forgettable ""horror"" riddled with more disappointment than Pennywise's ruthless attempt in capturing the Loser's Club. Twenty seven years after the events of the first film, the Losers Club reunite in Derry once more to try and destroy ""It"" permanently before it devours any more children.Before I express my predictably overwhelming level of disappointment, it's important to note that I knew I was not going to be truly enamoured with the narrative. I've always loathed it. Thematically, there is a tepid amount of exploration into the manifestation of guilt and how it haunts us on an emotional level. The inner turmoil that is buried within us and the repercussions of suppressing them. Despite the overall absence of psychological complexities within each character, that is somewhat present in the novel, there's enough impact within each loser to illustrate guilt. Bill, for example, being the perfect thematic bridge as he comes to terms with Georgie's death.The inherent issue, which is an immediate negatory result of the surprisingly fantastic first chapter, is the lack of characterisation. As kids, the Losers Club were inseparable, with each character fleshed out to maximum potential. Twenty seven years on, naturally the reunion is to be intermittently spiky, but to not reproduce the intrinsic flavour that made these losers so memorable and relatable was a huge misstep. Take Bev and Ben, or Eddie and Richie. Aside from the conclusive ten minutes, there's no tangible emotion between them. A true lack of friendship that, even if they are unable to remember, showed no humanity. Just quick lines of dialogue to keep the overstuffed plot moving, with an excessive amount of quips that rapidly transformed this horror into a comedy.Mike had the misfortune of resorting to the mechanical character of ""exposition man"", where every spoken word explains the ritualistic storyline and the absurdity of King's mind. The Ritual of Chüd, the origins of ""It"" and the recovery of fragmented memories. Diabolically destroyed as a character. Which is a shame, as the casting of the adult losers was sublime. Hader stole the entire show with his ornate use of comedic timing and emotional distress. Chastain and McAvoy, despite their star status, wasn't given enough substance to give truly captivating performances. Especially the former who was grossly underused.Of course, if you are wanting to watch 'It', then you're praying to be scared, right? Ehhh. Wrong. The horror traits that should've been at the forefront, were completely ineffective. Nearly every single jump scare, except for one furry canine that annoyingly infiltrated my impenetrable skin the moment I let my guard down, was pointless. A host of CGI creatures that, whilst creatively showcase the fearful capabilities of ""It"", smelt of so much fakery that they proved to be tame and forgettable. Heck, even visualised effects on some of the character's faces, like child Ben, were incredibly noticeable and off-putting.Which nicely brings me to Pennywise himself. Skarsgard gives yet another tantalising performance. But just one teeny problem. He isn't scary anymore. Whether that be due to the uninspired use of said clown or the lack of freshness that made the first chapter massively frightening, remains to be seen. The audience were laughing instead of looking away! Either way though, Pennywise was ineffective. And the conclusive science-fiction blah-fest highlightedThis is a frustrating chapter. It really bloody is. Muschietti can create tension. He proved it in the first chapter and occasionally embedded scenes of suspense within this sequel. The old woman inviting Bev into her apartment? Yes please! CGI Bev's head spontaneously combusting? Nah, I'm out. It's overstuffed, overlong (seriously, three hours? Chop atleast forty minutes off!) and overly tame. And when the flashbacks to the child losers are the greatest aspects of the sequel, a sequel predominantly focused on the adults, well something's not quite right. It's not entirely Muschietti's fault, as the source material is just as terrible. It's just a case of ""the ending kinda sucked"".",It Chapter Two
44,pmtelefon,This one just misses,7,27 September 2020,"""It Chapter Two"" is a near miss for me. There is a lot of good stuff going on but the movie drags quite a bit at times. The movie is too long by at least twenty minutes. ""It Chapter Two"" throws so much at you that at times it's just too much. The last half hour or so is pretty chaotic. Still, I enjoyed a lot of ""It Chapter Two"" and I think there's a chance it will grow on me. Honorable mention: a dreamy Jessica Chastain.",It Chapter Two
45,digitalbeachbum,Definitely a lost opportunity,4,18 September 2021,"IT is one of those Stephen King stories which is taken from Three Billy Goats Gruff, which was modified to fit modern times. It is a clown of evil which echoes childhood drama, and the challenges of the children who are now adults to overcome that evil together.This version of the story is completely lacking in suspense. Clowns are inherently creepy even when they are used for children's parties. The idea that you invite one of these people in to your home to perform for your kids is ridiculous. This version of the clown, Pennywise is almost all CG and there is nothing left to the imagination.Alfred Hitchcock used to make his movies suspenseful by letting the viewer create their own fears. This movie leaves nothing for the viewers imagination.There are different versions or segments of this story which have been produced. Some have the youthful kids only, others have them older returning to the town to fight Pennywise again as adults.I'm not sure if this is true, but based on my experience and knowledge fear is universal and that is what Pennywise feeds on, so it is a lot like the various stories which have creatures which try to use the victim's memories to trick the victim in to producing the emotion of fear. I think that is what Stephen King is trying to explain in this story. In that, people who live in fear are subject to the suffering of monsters of fear.",It Chapter Two

This film has amazing cinematography, direction n acting. The only thing missing is the camaraderie of the child actors but we do have some flashbacks.
Some scenes r very scary, especially the small girl, the mirror one n the Pennnywise's daughter one.
This film has lots of jump scares too.

47,matthewssilverhammer,Struggling with this review...,7,13 September 2019,"It was a cool, confident 80's-style throwback, whose strong visuals and rare timbre made it a standout among the lame high-concept, overly dark excuses for terror we normally get. My enjoyment led to reading the novel, and I'm glad I did. Not only because it's great, but because I think I would be emotionally lost by Chapter Two otherwise. While it certainly hasn't lost any of the boldness of the first film, much of the actual storytelling skill and tonal control has been lost under an effort to shove 6+ hrs of story into 3. What we're left with is ultimately not a very ""good"" movie, but one with enough sincerity and fantastic individual moments that it's sloppiness can almost be overlooked.
We find The Losers all grown up, returning to Derry when their clown-friend begins wreaking havoc again. Despite perfect physical casting, the chemistry among these grown up performers comes nowhere near the endearing heights of the younger cast. When the kids return, it serves as a cheap but effective reminder of why we love these characters. The gentle naivete and fear of a young outcast teen proves to be paramount to the success of the horror, so this sequel seems to choose to either move away from scares altogether, or it falters.
Instead its strengths lie in individual scenes and unique themes. The Losers must relive their traumatic pasts, which not only provides the best 45 minutes of the movie, but beautifully and tenderly speaks to the effect childhood has on identity and engrained fear. It's a brave movie, even if kind of a ""bad"" one, which is a combo I prefer to safe (boring) ""good"" movies.",It Chapter Two
48,marmar-69780,it 2,5,8 September 2019,It has quality in it but isnt good as first at to me its little to long and unnecesery flashbacks but casting for older versions and perfermances are good,It Chapter Two
49,arfdawg-1,Not Even Close to as Good as Chapter One,4,7 September 2019,"The suspense and thrills of Chapter One are virtually all gone in Chapter Two. The gang doesnt interact in the same seamless way they did as children in the first movie.Lot's of holes in the story telling. For example none of them has seen each other for twenty some years and yet the black guy who re-assembles them has all their cell phone numbers (and they have no idea who he is when he calls so how did he get the numbers? You can't look up cell numbers).Further the clown is back for some time before the gang comes back and yet he seems to be eating people, not floating them like in the first movie. Why is that?When they get to the lair from the first flick it's devoid of floaters even tho the black guy tells them the clown has been active for some time.And then there's a really stoopid ending to the clown. It actually ruins the movie completely because it's laughable.And then there's the gay agenda from frame one to the ending with Ritchie's little secret. Why do we need this? Does this crap really have to be shoved in our face in every freaking movie? Does it? I for one, am tired of it.On the plus side, the film moves quickly with little down time, except that it's about a half hour too long. It reminded me of LOTR Part Three when it kept ending and then there was more ending and then there was more until you just wanted to leave the movie theatre already.",It Chapter Two
50,southdavid,".. but doctor, I am Pennywise.",6,13 September 2019,"I said in my review of Chapter one, that though I really liked that film, one of my concerns was that this was the easy half of the story to tell. Though I didn't like Chapter 2 as much, I did feel it mostly avoided the potential pitfalls and was an OK conclusion.27 years after the children of Derry forced Pennywise (Bill Skarsgaard) into an early hibernation, Mikey (Isaiah Mustafa) the only one of the gang to have stayed in town, recalls his friends to honour the oath they swore, should Pennywise remerge. With the town in their past, their memories of their horrific battle have magically dissipated, but as they return, the recollections and the horror come back.I feel like this might be another review where I say that a film was alright, and then just list a series of my problems with it. So I'll try and be clearer.... The film is fine. Perfectly acceptable. Performances are solid, the story is decent enough and some of the pitfalls of the more outlandish (or perhaps offworld-ish) areas of the plot are dealt with as well as they could be. It is, again, reasonably funny - in fact there are more laughs than screams.That, perhaps, is one of the principle problems though. Again, it's not particularly scary, especially when Pennywise is inhabiting something else and not present in his clown form. There's a lot of CGI creations some of whom are more successful than others. Whilst on the subject of CGI, in some of the flashback scenes, they used software to make some of the young actors more closely resemble themselves from a few years back, this occasionally looks awful and gives poor Jeremy Ray Taylor in particular a plastic face. I don't feel like the adults had the same chemistry that the children had as a group either, despite the big names amongst them.These failings, along with the lengthy running time, mean I'm probably not going to revisit ""It"" very often, but I do feel this is as strong a version of the story as you are every likely to get on screen.",It Chapter Two
51,Vartiainen,Improves slightly upon the first film,6,10 May 2021,"Whereas I found the previous film, It (2017), to be something of a letdown when compared to the original TV mini series, I'd say this film is about on par with it. That being said, the child actors and the childhood of the so called Loser's Club were definitely a highlight of the mini series and the adult actors were easily its weakest point. So I'm not praising this film to high heavens here.That being said, there are some definitive areas where this film improves upon its predecessor. It was more of an identity, it's not quite so dead serious all the time and it's not afraid to get weird from time to time. All of which are good things when your monster is an actual clown child eater from outer space.I also think the adult actors are still pretty good in their roles, like they were in Chapter One. There's chemistry between them and while this film has flashbacks as well, so we see the child actors, they're integrated into the plot quite seamlessly. The ending is also a veritable feast of cool concepts, interesting imagery (although too often concealed by poor lighting), and good character moments.It's not a masterpiece by any means and it's still rather reliant on jump scares, but at least its imagery has evolved to a point where I'll most likely remember it even after some time has passed.",It Chapter Two

Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy and Bill Hader are featured. I like chapter one a little better, but this is a pretty good follow-up with a decent cast, good score and creepy moments.

53,jtindahouse,Not your average horror movie,8,4 September 2019,"Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can't see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn't your average ""fast-food"" horror like the 'Conjuring' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I'm talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn't just a case of blink and you'll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn't sure whether 'It Chapter Two' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well.",It Chapter Two

The longest book Stephen King has written to the point where it had to be spilt into two movies. The actor playing the adult versions of the kid characters are well done, not quite who I would I thought about casting but still good.
Bill Skarsgard is still great has Pennywise, I mean he was so good, makes me wonder why was he not cast has The Joker. On some levels the 1990 mini series did some things better, then this film did. But there are other things that this film did better then the 1990 mini series. Some times the humor overshadows the horror parts.

The film is an awkward and uneven mix of horror and comedy. The open scenes show a graphic, brutal, and very real-looking assault on a couple of gay men (a nasty sequence apparently irrelevant to the plot) that was at odds with the rest of the fanciful, silly, and sometimes tongue-in-cheek boo-movie. While there are some effective scenes (Beverly in the apartment of the old women is really creepy until the goofy looking CGI monster shows up) but a lot of the 'scary moments' are pretty limp (the thing with the protruding tongue that chases Eddie in the pharmacy basement looks like it snuck over from a Beetlejuice remake). The cast was fine considering they were all playing 'characters', not people, but I found the bickering, banter, and bro-bonding between them tiresome (the scene in the Chinese restaurant is especially bad). There is not much to the story: as the premise allows 'It' to be constantly terrorising the 'Losers' in novel ways, most of the film is simply an interchangeable series of CGI moments strung together to set up the inevitable final showdown. I'm not sure if the references to one of the character's books as having awful endings was supposed to be meta-humour, but I found the 'climax' of the film a let-down (the showdown with unspeakable terror degenerated into a CGI-rich horror version of a 70's afterschool special about dealing with bullies) and the post-climatic scene, in which the 'Losers' re-bond is boring and endless (perhaps because I didn't care about any of the characters). Author Stephan King is pretty good in a cameo appearance as a pawn-store owner but once again the visceral menace, gripping narrative, and authenticity of his writing seems to have eluded film-makers.",It Chapter Two

Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. It starts off with a brutal homophobic attack and I found myself wondering how on earth this was rated 15 as opposed to an 18. Chapter Two is simply too long, I found my eyes closing a few times near the end (admitably it had been a long day), Pennywise is not as scary this time and I found the final battle to be disappointing. The adult cast works well but it's the younger selves that steal the show. I'll certainly watch this again when released on DVD, perhaps a second viewing may earn a more generous rating.

This is not really a sequel but more of a part 2 to the 2017 remake. It is best if you have seen chapter one because the kids from that one are in this one too, both in new and old scenes from chapter one. The adults playing the kids are all pretty good matches in looks-you might think that it is what they would really look like as adults. This is also not one to take the little kiddies to-I saw several people with little ones in tow, including a few babies. I guess they couldn't get a babysitter. Anyway, if you saw chapter one, you know that Pennywise pops up every 27 years and terrorizes the citizens of the little town of Derry. Jessica, James and Bill H, along with the rest of the Losers, get a phone call from one of their group, telling them it's been 27 years and it's time to come back to Derry to put an end to Pennywise, played magnificently by Bill S. All except for one of them have moved away and moved on with their lives-the one that stayed in town is the one that called them all back. Some of them are reluctant to come back but they did make a blood pact when they were kids. The violence is much more graphic and there is some partial nudity-don't get too excited, it is not a very pretty site. You do get to see Bill S out of his Pennywise make_up and Stephen King makes a cameo appearance-keep an eye out for the shop owner selling a bicycle.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.

Mike, the only member of The Losers who stayed in Derry invokes their oath to return to Derry if Pennywise the Clown returns - which of course he does.This is a film whose total does not equal the sum of its parts. The adult characters spend a vast chunk of running time coming back together, deciding whether they should stay and then revisiting what Pennywise did to them. This is well structured but is just too long, although to be fair so was the book.The performances are pretty solid, particularly Hader, whilst Chastain rather disappoints as she fails to bring the Beverley from the first film to life.

The acting is good and cinematography is superb. Climax of the movie is strong but the way the movie has ended we can expect third part of the movie.There are some drawbacks also.

I love the characters, whether it be in this film or the preceding entry.Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader are great choices to play the older versions of Sophia Lillis and Finn Wolfhard, they are very convincing casts. James McAvoy is also a positive addition, while Bill Skarsgård remains enjoyable as It.The score is, again, strong.

67,kirbylee70-599-526179,MORE SCARES,7,27 January 2020,"The novels of Stephen King have been transferred to film perhaps more than any other author of all time. The fact that he writes nonstop might have something to do with that. But even now a number of his books that were turned into films are being remade before new ones are even filmed. A remake of THE STAND is in the works. And last year we were presented with the first of two parts of IT, a remake of the TV film. Now IT CHAPTER 2 is out on disc, completing the story that began in the first film.If you recall at the end of the first film the group of kids known as the Losers faced off against Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) the clown, defeating him at least for the moment. Pennywise is supposed to return every 27 years. At the end they all swore to return to combat Pennywise once again if he did come back. That time is now.The only member of the group to remain in Derry, Maine, was Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) working in the library. When a group of teens beat up a gay man and toss him in the river, his boyfriend watches as Pennywise eats him. Mike overhears what's taken place over the police scanner and knows what to do. He begins calling the rest of the gang.But for the rest of them life has moved on and the further from Derry they moved the more their memories of what took place have left them. Bill (James McAvoy) is married to an actress and now an author and screenwriter in the middle of a film being made out of one of his books. Richie (Bill Hader) is a professional stand-up comedian with anxiety issues. Ben (Jay Ryan) has lost weight, become a great looking guy and is a successful architect. Eddie (James Ransone) is an insurance salesman and married to a woman who is reminiscent of his mother. Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is in an abusive marriage and ready to leave for Derry. And Stanley (Andy Bean) remembers more than the rest, so much so that he kills himself rather than face Pennywise once more.The group gathers together and meets in a Chinese restaurant in Derry where Mike reminds them of their past and what they faced long ago. All of them are ready to leave and abandon their promise when Pennywise makes his presence known frightening all of them. Then Beverly reveals that when she was exposed to It's deadlights, she saw that if they didn't fulfill their promise she has seen their brutal deaths, beginning with Stanley's.The movie then moves back and forth from past to present as each one of the members must find an artifact that connects to themselves before they can face off against It. Mike has found a potential way to eliminate It, discovering where it came from and how it was defeated millions of years in the past. The artifacts each one finds shows them in their past and how they acquired the item and then how they find it once again in the present. This fills up quite a bit of the time of the film.Of course a final battle is on the way and before they get to it It will once more let them know he's out there and preparing for them himself. He wants revenge for what they did to him 27 years ago and he'll use anything in his power to have it. He'll play on their insecurities and their fears, he'll manipulate situations involving innocents and he will find a way to stop them in their plan. The only hope they have is if they can summon the courage that they had all those years ago and face him once again.Let me say from the start that the first problem this film has was the success of the first film. While that film was just over 2 hours the success gave the studio and director her enough confidence that they mad this one even longer, running just 11 minutes shy of 3 hours. It doesn't need to be that long. The proof of that is that the film feels 3 hours long. It's an overindulgence that doesn't destroy the story but does make it a movie you might not want to revisit any time soon.All of the actors involved are at their best here, making the characters not just believable but mirror images of the child actors that played the roles in the first film. That's not an easy task to achieve and make the character their own at the same time. And the kids from the first film return here (or were more likely than not shot at the same time as the first film) and remain perfect in their roles.There are a few good scares in this film like there were in the first but we're beginning to see a time in films when there is a strong dependence on CGI effects that result in their usage making the films not near as frightening. The last sequence of the film involves much of this and for me was one of the weakest moments when it should have been the highlight of the film.All in all the film isn't bad and if you've seen the first film you will definitely want to make sure and see this follow up. Perhaps the biggest fear I have is that even though this concludes the story as told in the novel the studio will look only at numbers and decided to make yet another sequel with less money involved and no creative folks returning. Should that happen it would be sad to see.",It Chapter Two

This is a long Emotional, Horror, Fantasy Epic that really, really pulls at your heart strings.
I found this film to be more about the loss of innocence as we grow up & move on with our lives & forget that fun & adventure we had growing up & how much those times mean to us. It part 2 was a love letter to Childhood & the Summer's of fun & the friends we had back then & all those beautiful moments that stick with us & what makes us well, us.
The Supernatural stuff is fun to me here, not scary just gory Horror Fun but it's everything else that touched me, the long lost friendships, the old feelings coming back & the memories, the imagery is beautiful, one scene in particular made me cry, when we see all the kids together with their bikes in a reflection of a shop window it was beautiful & sad at the same time & the voice over at the end from the letter written by Stan all beautifully touching & the truthful & sad words of ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" that part broke me.

69,kluseba,It wasn't necessary,6,30 October 2019,"It: Chapter Two tells the story of what happened to the members of The Losers' Club as they confront evil clown Pennywise to kill it for good twenty-seven years after the events of the first movie. In my humble opinion, this second movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. The first part had an intriguing atmosphere, stunning characters and diversified plot that ended on a bittersweet note. Some stories don't need a conclusion as some unanswered question might actually spark the audience's creative imagination. In order to cash in on the first film, the producers decided to opt for a sequel nonetheless.The main issue is that this sequel doesn't have the magic of the first movie. The coming-of-age vibe of the teenagers with their beliefs, bonds, fears, hopes and motivations was second to none. What we get here are seven rather depressing adults in their mid-life crises who haven't become the wonderful people they could have been.Another problem is that the movie constantly dwells on the past, has a ploddingly repetitive script and re-tells parts of the first film over and over again. There are numerous horror movies with considerable lengths that never get boring with classics like The Shining or recent masterpieces such as The Wailing. However, this film here overstays its welcome with lengthy storytelling, tiring flashbacks and endless dialogues. This movie should have been about one hour shorter than it actually is for a more dynamic, entertaining and relevant structure.Not everything is bad about this movie as you might have guessed by looking at my rather positive rating. The special effects are as great as they can get. The smalltown settings are perfectly chosen. The light techniques and camera work are precise, captivating and atmopsheric. The film includes a good balance of humorous and serious parts. The adult actresses and actors are doing a wonderful job and one has to point out a charming but melancholic Jessica Chastain in particular as well as James McAvoy who underlines his reputation as one of the most diversified, talented and unique contemporary actors as usual.The movie's saving grace however are the gripping final thirty minutes. The duel between The Loser's Club and Pennywise is fascinating to watch and feels like a reward after a stuttering start. The action scenes are intense, the characters develop depth and the special effects are spectacular. Make sure to enjoy such cinematography on the big screen while you still can.In the end, It: Chapter Two is quite a mixed bag. The film is technically well done but simply overstays its welcome. Personally, I didn't need a sequel at all but can objectively admit that this film has slightly more strengths than flaws.",It Chapter Two

It is actually a very entertaining, funny comedy and some scares were very good, on the other hand it's almost 3h long. The last hour really felt it was extremely stretched out. Some of the charcaters I liked, some I did not. As for first two hours I'd say this is a decent horror comedy, but last hour went downhill. The final boss fight was so long that they gave characters a break, yea they were safe for a few minutes and could talk freely, the Pennywise was supposedly to big to get in even through he could have easily shrink. Also the epilogue for this movie tried to give us a deeper meaning to whole thing, but why? It is a horror movie, not a drama, why is it being moralised at the end?

Focusing on the easier aspects of most modern horror films (the ubiquitous jump scare), this film works in fits & starts, strong when its uses its shock tactics & spot on casting to its good graces but then wasting them away by its rinse & repeat story construction which balloons the running time to nearly three hours. Some side characters are also given short shrift, namely a bully from their past & some of the spouses in the present, which are mentioned for the sake of the novel (& utilized better in the 1990 TV miniseries adaptation) but never truly integrated into the through line cohesively. A rumored longer cut may solve these issues ultimately when viewed w/chapter 1 but it's a shame the studio which released over nearly 20 hours of Tolkien material (The Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit trilogies) went the chintzy route for this masterstroke of modern horror fiction.",It Chapter Two

Where the first film firmly had its feet on the ground and did an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere and sense of nostalgia of the book, the second chapter fumbles, awkwardly .Its chief shortcomings is it incessant need to use flash backs to make its point. As if its only by referring back to the first chapter that it can make sense of what follows. It lacks cohesion too and a well defined sense of direction, moving around listlessly and disjointedly.Suffice to say, after a wonderful first chapter film this follow up is a real disappointment.5/10 from me.",It Chapter Two

Or has it?Chapter Two suffers from a bit of an identity problem. It's one part Poltergeist, legitimately tense and mind bending horror, and one part... Ghostbusters. Maybe it was just the theater I was in, but there were a surprising number of laughs in this movie. It also can't decide if it should focus on the adults or on the flashbacks with the kids.The flashbacks also directly lead into the films other main issue. The pacing is all off. The beginning and end or spot on but the middle definitely drags and I started to feel the 169 minute runtime of the movie.It's not all bad though. The performances are spot on, everyone fits their roles with no real outliers. That said, there are a couple that go above and beyond. James McAvoy and Bill Skarsgard are exceptional but everyone ends up being upstaged by Bill Hader who absolutely runs away with this one.Performances aside, the visuals are stunning. Penny wise is all about weird and twisted displays, so the visual effects have to be exceptional or the whole thing would fall apart and fortunately they deliver in every scene.In the end, it's a good, fun movie. It's far from flawless but it's got plenty of honest fun and strong emotions with legitimate tension to satisfy.

78,aidanratesmovies,An Unforgettable Horror Epic (as promised),10,7 September 2019,"IT Chapter Two is a outstanding epic of horror and is truly a one of a kind sequel. My expectations for the film were high, considering I loved the first one and am a huge fan of the original novel, and i'm glad to say they were met. The story was handled almost perfectly in this adaptation, and brought a smile to my face nearly the whole runtime- which is surprisingly almost 3 hours long. Many may be affected by the runtime but I found it only appropriate considering the depths of story they delve into with each individual character, and I was pleased to see most of the routes they took to get there. The beginning of the film where they summarize what the adults have been up to, I will admit, is a bit choppy, but rightfully so, as it is probably the least important part of the film. Most likely the beginning was as edited as they could make it, as the filmmakers were probably trying to shorten the runtime as best they can, especially considering the film is so long already in the first place. Still, despite a long runtime, I would have much rather had a better conceived beginning to a film like this, rather than a forgettable one to a remarkable film. Besides that gripe of the film, the only other problem I had was some mediocre acting, also more towards the beginning of the film, but with only smaller characters. As for the things I liked about it, I found the film easily well crafted. The balance between the adult characters and the bits we see from the kids were handled oh so well, and all performances were needless to say brilliant. The casting for the grown up Losers is brilliant as well, with Bill Hader, James McAvoy, Isaiah Mustafa, and needless to say Bill Skarsgard returning as Pennywise the clown being the standouts for me. The film also has mostly clever pacing, and it's surprisingly funny, interesting, and downright creepy. It is easily a film that will not easily be forgotten, with excellent direction and executed atmosphere, fantastic visuals, and some obvious but well appreciated notalgia. It will be hard to pass another series of Stephen King books, or even a single book, as his best adaption after these two.

79,truemythmedia,Meh,5,11 September 2019,"When ""It"" (or maybe now it's ""It Chapter One""(?)) came out two years ago I found I really enjoyed it. I thought the first ""It"" struck a perfect balance between creepy and fun, I thought the character chemistry between the kids was absolutely wonderful, and I thought the overall production was much higher in quality than many of the Stephen King adaptations I've seen in the past. The first film in this series gave me a lot of hope for the second, and for probably the first hour of this movie I really enjoyed myself, but then, unfortunately, this movie started to really fall apart after the first act. I actually think watching this film has made me appreciate the first film more. This isn't the worst ending we could've received- it's fine- it looks good and it's got a few truly creepy moments, but I found myself wanting a lot more from it. I'll probably still end up watching this film once more at some point in my life- I'd like to watch Parts One and Two back to back to see if I've missed anything.

Andy Muschietti's direction is great and the music by Benjamin Wallfisch is fantastic. However, what brings it down and makes it slightly disappointing is that it isn't that scary.

81,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Follow Up to End the Full Story,9,9 September 2019,"This was a film that I had been highly anticipating ever since I saw the first one. I kind of that thought that this one would make or break the overall story so I caught this the first night that was I was available to. I can already see that this one is polarizing, which I expected with all of the hype surrounding it. The synopsis is twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back.We start this off at the local fair in Derry, Maine. There's a guy playing one of the carnival games and gives the reward to a little girl. We then see that he's gay and kisses his boyfriend. One of them grew up here and wants out where the other one wants to go wherever the other does. They are then attacked by a group of locals who are homophobic. They beat one of them nearly to death and throw him over the bridge. His boyfriend goes looking and sees Pennywise. It then shifts to Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of the Loser's Club to stay. He makes the call to each member of the Losers Club and to tell them its time to come home.I won't break down all the aspects of everyone's lives, but Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a famous writer and married to an actress. Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) is married to abusive man and they have a clothing line. Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) is a successfully comedian, Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) is an architect, Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) is a risk analyst and Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is an accountant. They all deal with the news in their own ways, but it rocks them to their core and they start to remember.They all return to Derry aside from Stanley, who does something that is shocking, but fitting for the character. They catch up with each other, but the mood turns somber when they ask why Mike called them all here. This freaks everyone out and they want all to leave. Mike pleads to Bill to try to change his mind. They have to stop Pennywise and what it does every 27 years. If they're going to defeat it though, they need to reach down and remember the memories they suppressed. Pennywise has a bit of help when we see that Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) survived.Now I'm going to lead off my recap stating that I enjoyed this film. Much like with the original mini-series, I don't like it as well as the second half of that one. I think the aspects with the children are scarier so when they focus on them as adults, it doesn't get to me as much. I still thought this was good though, so I wanted to get that out of the way before getting into my deeper thoughts on the film.The first thing I really wanted to get into first is that the acting is great here. Chastain is a solid Beverly, but the one thing that didn't get though is the hurt enough from the character. She does bring quite a bit of strength which I really liked. McAvoy is great in pretty much everything I've seen him in. The only issue there is that he might be too good looking as an adult Bill. Hader was absolutely amazing here. There is a sense of hurt here that I really like that he brings with a secret he's been harboring. When it clicked for me it makes so much sense for this why Richie makes the jokes that he does. Mustafa makes for a good Mike who is dealing with the effects of staying in Derry. I like that he's the least successful because of it. Ryan is good as well as Bean. I do have to say that Ransone was hilarious and I thought he was perfect as the adult Eddie. Something I was disappointed about was a lack of Skarsgård. We get a decent amount Pennywise, but I wanted a bit more of him messing with them in this form. The children are all back and I thought they were all solid for rounding out the film along with the rest of the cast as well.The story here though was good for me. I like bringing in the aspect of the novel that they can't remember what happened to them before leaving Derry as that is solid mythology. They also brought up how Pennywise got to where he is and that he's really always kind of been there. Something that does throw me off that it seems like they're trying to say that he was a real man, so I don't know if that's just something he is doing to mess with them or not. There's also a bit of social commentary that was also in the book. The two gay men that are attacked is something that is socially relevant. It's said that in the novel it was set in the 80's, but still works today.I've heard issues with the pacing of the film. The movie runs about 3 hours, but to be honest, I didn't notice it. It really kept my interest and moved through everything without getting boring despite the length. It is interesting that with the original mini-series, the first half showed the adults having flashbacks and this one does that instead of the first film. I actually didn't mind it, because it made sense with what they need to do in order to defeat Pennywise. I wasn't the biggest fan how they the film plays out in the end, but I don't think it ruins the film. I personally just wanted it to be a bit bleaker. There was a bit too much comedy for my liking though. It made me laugh, but I also think that it relieves some of the tension for me if I'm honest.Another issue with the previous movie was the effects of the film. I really didn't have an problems and I didn't here either. There are some interesting, creepy things that were done, but to be honest, I think this one is downplayed a bit more than I wanted. I don't know if it's that they're adults, so it is harder to scare them and that they're having issues remembering. I do like the final form of Pennywise better than what they did in the original while somewhat keeping with it. The deadlights are an interesting aspect.

82,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Second Half to the King Classic,9,11 September 2019,"This was a film that I had been highly anticipating ever since I saw the first one. I kind of that thought that this one would make or break the overall story so I caught this the first night that was I was available to. Then actually caught it a few days later just to make sure what I thought about it. I can already seen that this one is polarizing, which I expected with all of the hype surrounding it. The synopsis is twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back.We start this off at the local fair in Derry, Maine. There's a guy playing one of the carnival games and gives the reward to a little girl. We then see that he's gay and kisses his boyfriend. One of them grew up here and wants out where the other one wants to go wherever the other does. They are then attacked by a group of locals who are homophobic. They beat one of them nearly to death and throw him over the bridge. His boyfriend goes looking and sees Pennywise. It then shifts to Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of the Loser's Club to stay. He makes the call to each member of the Losers Club and to tell them its time to come home.I won't break down all the aspects of everyone's lives, but Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a famous writer and married to an actress. Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) is married to abusive man and they have a clothing line. Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) is a successfully comedian, Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) is an architect, Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) is a risk analyst and Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is an accountant. They all deal with the news in their own ways, but it rocks them to their core and they start to remember.They all return to Derry aside from Stanley, who does something that is shocking, but fitting for the character. They catch up with each other, but the mood turns somber when they ask why Mike called them all here. This freaks everyone out and they want all to leave. Mike pleads to Bill to try to change his mind. They have to stop Pennywise and what it does every 27 years. If they're going to defeat it though, they need to reach down and remember the memories they suppressed. Pennywise has a bit of help when we see that Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) survived.Now I'm going to lead off my recap stating that I enjoyed this film. Much like with the original mini-series, I don't like it as well as the second half of that one. I think the aspects with the children are scarier so when they focus on them as adults, it doesn't get to me as much. I still thought this was good though, so I wanted to get that out of the way before getting into my deeper thoughts on the film.The first thing I really wanted to get into first is that the acting is great here. Chastain is a solid Beverly, but the one thing that didn't get though is the hurt enough from the character. She does bring quite a bit of strength which I really liked. McAvoy is great in pretty much everything I've seen him in. Hader was absolutely amazing here. There is a sense of hurt here that I really like that he brings with a secret he's been harboring. When it clicked for me it makes so much sense for this why Richie makes the jokes that he does. Mustafa makes for a good Mike who is dealing with the effects of staying in Derry. I like that he's the least successful because of it. Ryan is good as well as Bean. I do have to say that Ransone was hilarious and I thought he was perfect as the adult Eddie. Something I was disappointed about was a lack of Skarsgård. We get a decent amount Pennywise, but I wanted a bit more of him messing with them in this form. The children are all back and I thought they were all solid for rounding out the film along with the rest of the cast as well.The story here though was good for me. I like bringing in the aspect of the novel that they can't remember what happened to them before leaving Derry as that is solid mythology. They also brought up how Pennywise got to where he is and that he's really always kind of been there or at least the entity behind the character has been. There's also a bit of social commentary that was also in the book. The two gay men that are attacked is something that is socially relevant. It's said that in the novel it was set in the 80's, but still works today.I've heard issues with the pacing of the film. The movie runs close to 3 hours, but to be honest, I didn't notice it. It really kept my interest and moved through everything without getting boring despite the length. It is interesting that with the original mini-series, the first half showed the adults having flashbacks and this one does that instead of the first film. I actually didn't mind it, because it made sense with what they need to do in order to defeat Pennywise. I wasn't the biggest fan how they the film plays out in the end, but I don't think it ruins the film. I personally just wanted it to be a bit bleaker. There was a bit too much comedy for my liking though. It made me laugh, but I also think that it relieves some of the tension for me if I'm honest.Another issue with the previous movie was the effects of the film. I really didn't have any problems and I didn't here either. There are some interesting, creepy things that were done, but to be honest, I think this one is downplayed a bit more than I wanted. I don't know if it's that they're adults, so it is harder to scare them and that they're having issues remembering. I do like the final form of Pennywise better than what they did in the original while somewhat keeping with it. The deadlights are an interesting aspect. The film looks good and I think where they end up was a bit unbelievable, but I'll let that slide.Now with that said, I personally think this film lived up to the hype. I tried to avoid the trailers as much as I could so that helps me as well. I thought the story was solid and flipping how it is edited from the original is fine. There's a bit of social commentary here which I can also get behind. I thought the acting was good across the board and despite its running time, it never got boring to me.

83,jadepietro,It's Just Bound to Go Pop,7,7 September 2019,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well crafted supernatural thriller that pales to its original source, but still is a fine sequel to its predecessor.JIM'S REVIEW: Does It: Chapter Two have the ""It Factor"", that indescribable ""je ne sais quoi"" allure that its predecessor was able to capture so vividly with moviegoers two years ago? Yes and no.This supernatural horror sequel is again resurrected by director Andy Muschietti and many of his same crew of artisans in hopes to recreate that same bad magic. For the majority of the film, It succeeds in capturing the scary action and establishing a link with the now grown-up cast of characters so convincingly that the audience immediately relates to them and their deadly peril. While It: Chapter Two, more than not, generate the fear factor, this chapter slowly build its scenes of suspense and spends far too much screen time on exposition and subplots that do little to advance the storytelling. The film seems bloated with uneven CGI effects this time around and its formulaic set pieces almost outstays its welcome due to the movie's avid fixation with the gore factor. Less would have been more.The second chapter of the Loser's Club opens twenty seven years later with a particularly grisly and gratitious hate crime that signals the return of the infamous Pennywise the Dancing Clown. This prologue lingers in one's mind with a bad aftertaste of remorse even though it serves as the catalyst for the new cast of actors to reassemble back at Derry, Maine to fight evil forces. But unlike the first film, this and other moments have a mean-spirited glee that the first film avoided. The extreme violence of this killing hangs over the movie like a shroud of discontentment before the new cast of actors is reassembled and moviegoers can settle in for the fright-fest. Fortunately, the cast and Stephen Kings's essential story overcome this initial dread.Mr. Muschietti skillfully directs his film and turns up the horrifying action. He stages his set pieces with flair and expertly casts his movie with older actors that inhabit their parts with masterful interpretations of their former younger selves. Each actor has an episode that shows off their character's phobia as they battle with their own demons. This more mature ensemble includes: James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, Isaiah Mustafa, Andy Bean, James Ransome and Bill Hader. All are fine, with Mr. Hader and Ms. Chastain excelling in their roles.But without Bill Skarsgård as their evil nemesis, the film simply would not be as effective. HIs vocal delivery, physical movements, and iconic make-up as Pennywise ratchets up the tension and delivers the scares. Providing ample support (in flashbacks) are the original young actors from the first film and their presence is crucial to the film's success.Gary Dauberman's screenplay is very faithful to Stephen King's novel to a fault. (However, some judicious editing of numerous sub-plots could have improved and streamlined the movie much further.) The adaptation creates recognizable set-ups that have a sense of familiarity (the overuse of well-worn horror film staples that are all too obvious like a spooky fun-house with its hall of mirrors, a creepy mansion, the dark wet sewers, etc.). But partaking of these troves is half of the fun and Mr. Dauberman's penchant to fully develop his characters and their unique quirks heightens the frightening action on display. Too bad, he didn't eliminate the unnecessary multiple storylines that complicate matters or connect some secondary characters more astutely.Yet when plot and characters are rendered with a focus on childhood traumas and the dramatic life-or-death scenario is in place as they are in this imaginative installment, the effect is all the more impressive and relevant, even if the material itself has now become a standard horror package of stock characters caught in stereotypical surroundings. (Special mention to cinematographer Checco Varese and editor Jason Ballentine for their contributions for creating the unease. Benjamin Wallfisch's music score builds the foreboding atmosphere very well.)It: Chapter Two brings a memorable end to Stephen King's tome. While this final chapter is not as scary as its first part, Mr. Muschietti and his able cast provide an apt conclusion to this classic opus of terror.",It Chapter Two
84,rgkarim,Floating Through Nearly 3 Hours with Decent Story and Fantastic Acting,8,6 September 2019,"Two years ago, the relaunch of yet another series started, taking modern day technology and using it to put a new face on it. Stephen King's legendary book titled IT came back in a new light that felt like a Stranger Things Episode with a little more demented/horror element added to it.

The AssistantSUMMARY:
The genius of the film is that although a sequel it's also a stand-alone film that manages to take the tale in a new light. Chapter 2, at least this version, manages to make a multilayered story that holds part horror and part soul searching as our characters developed. In a decently compact way, It 2 accomplishes the task of bridging the 27-year gap and keeping to the horror element all why pushing some heavy political issues and moral tasking topics in a classy way. Not just a drama, the horror element still stands true in this film and Pennywise's new tactics are a step up in the form of nightmare motivating images that will stay in minds for a long time. Not the most realistic at times, IT's new forms for the most part have enough skin tingling factor to them to make some squirm in their seats, especially given how they made Pennywise a much bigger threat than I anticipated. A small subtle component that I quite enjoy are the small references to the book or popular phrases about the book. It's nice balanced humor and a clever ploy to sort of justify the decisions made in this film in regards to changing the story, which gets a nod of respect from this reviewer. Hands down though, the best part is acting, which I can go on for hours about. All the adult forms mirror the kids in many qualms, take the baseline characteristics and maximize them, and play off of each other so well that I can't help but praise the casting direction. As for the clown himself, Bill Skarsgård again redeems his role as Pennywise and takes the nightmare amalgam worthy as a legendary villain. He manages to add new levels of creepiness without trying too hard, achieving that skin crawling factor to new levels.In regards of areas that are still working on improving for me, well the film did not quite scare me like I was hoping. Again, I'm used to much of the scare tactics, but It Chapter 2's use of computer effects and other designs did not quite scare me as much as disturb me at times (that scene at the Chinese restaurant). In addition the stepped-up game of Pennywise sometimes crossed levels that I wasn't a fan of, primarily in some of the more torturous aspects that this film took. Those that have a low tolerance for dragged out beatings or torture may want to avert their eyes at these points. In regards to the plot much of the overall arc is wonderful, but the presentation at times comes off a little more convoluted than I had hoped. During the middle of the film the constant intertwining of past and present did not quite make sense to me, until the end when the explanation came. Not that it was not entertaining at times, I felt this approach sort of added fluff to the movie, almost as this was a director's cut. This brings me to the length of the film, while certainly not the slowest movie (Midsommar anyone), the nearly three hour run time did not quite feel necessary given that the first part was nearly an hour shorter. Again it is entertaining for the most part, but it's a commitment I don't think was quite needed. A small nuance again for most, the cursing sometimes goes down the avenues of being lazy writing, primarily in the overuse of the F bomb when there were better lines that the first film capitalized on. My biggest beef is the assistant to the mad clown, to which I don't want to ruin. A concept that starts to hold potential, the assistant is a wasted character in my eyes that serves for only a little bit of plot development and a few comedy moments. So much could have been done with this character, but I think the squad found this character the one to cut out most of in favor of the other focus points of the film.The VERDICT:
Wrapping this up, two years gave the movie enough time to make a horror movie that is familiar, yet has enough flair to be its own. Sticking to horror roots, the movie focuses on the story and does a nice job integrating most characters into the film. It may not be scary to me, but Pennywise is still creepy and has upped his danger level with new forms and references that should have fans smiling. Yet it's the acting that holds the key to success and brings the movie to levels that are super entertaining and deep compared to most horror genre casts. Still, the movie is a little long winded, with a convoluted presentation at times that adds a little length, and a character that felt like a waste. Otherwise, a semi-cheesy ending and some darker tactics are the only things that really didn't impress me. The summary though is that this film is definitely a worthy edition to the horror genre, and I believe it's worth checking out in theaters. My scores are:Horror: 8.0
Movie Overall: 8.0",It Chapter Two

Add to that heavy rotation on HBO and great home media sales and this saga has become Stephen King's Star Wars/Marvel/James Bond. In It 2, the Loser's club is all grown up and seeking revenge for the evil Clown, who will come in all shapes and sizes, culminating in an all out finale that shows the heroes winning over evil and saving the day.

Starring James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, James Ransone, Jay Ryan, Isaiah Mustafa, Sophia Lillis, Jaeden Martell, Jack Dylan Grazer, Finn Wolfhard, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Bill Skarsgård, Chosen Jacobs, Teach Grant, Andy Bean. (R)Nearly three decades after the events of the first film, the now-grown members of ""the Losers"" return to Derry for a reunion of grim purpose--seems that nasty, ol' Pennywise (Skarsgård) wasn't defeated last time, and with new young blood spilling, the time is nigh to put the fiend down once and for all. Sprawling but structurally-unsound and meandering horror story is full of hoary convolutions (including ""rules"" delivered with such solemnity they can't possibly be taken seriously) and repeats scare sequences with too little variety; as in the first film, when the ""jumps"" arrive, they're followed by explosive laughter instead of screams (despite Skarsgård's best efforts, his ""clown prince of evil"" is still far sillier than it is terrifying). Only Hader really stands out among the main cast, and he provides the intentional jests to go along with the inadvertent variety; the film's potential status as an accidental comedic masterstroke, however, is spoiled by far too many profitless detours and flashback reiterations that drag this thing out close to three hours. The protracted climactic showdown provides yet another piece of evidence in the argument that gargantuan digital effects do not mix well with fright flicks. Stephen King and Peter Bogdonavich both show up in cameos.41/100",It Chapter Two
88,Abdulxoxo,It's as good as a sequel can be,7,9 January 2021,"I think this film is creepier than the last one, credit to Muschietti in the way he creates some terrific set pieces, many of which were individually excellent. The way the film is shot, mixed with some great visual effects, makes for a thrill ride of a movie at times. I thought the casting choices for this film, in the way they match up to the kids from chapter one, was fantastic. The performances of the ensemble cast are terrific all around. Every one of these actors are given at least one moment to shine. In my opinion McAvoy and Hader shine brightest of all. Bill Skarsgard is also brilliant he is even better this time. For one thing we see a lot more of him. Not only is he amazing as he go around killing in amazingly bloody fashion; but we also get to learn more of his past. We peek into where he might have come from; and discover that there are others who are aware of him, who tried to banish him in the past.
As much as I did enjoy this film, there can be no denying that it's way too long. For a horror film 169m is at least half an hour more than what it should have been. The reason for such a length is because of the way the film was directed. The film does its best to introduce each of the characters, giving them all a decent amount of screen time. In a way this is good because it means we get plenty of information for why they do or feel certain things as the movie develops. Unfortunately, with so many characters in the group and it's been 27 years since we last saw them, they have grown up and become different people, they all have their own lives with different jobs, families and issues, this means that it'll takes an age to introduce them all. This problem arises again half way through the film when the gang gets separated. Each of them have a segment where they have to face their inner demons. Now, some of these are fun to watch; and a large reason why I think I may prefer this film to chapter one. However, because there are so many characters it does take a long time to get through them all.
All in all, A well made movie with good performances and astonishing visuals but it's a bit tiring to sit through due to its lengthy runtime.",It Chapter Two
89,arungeorge13,"A painfully long, sporadically okayish Chapter Two! [+52%]",5,14 September 2019,"Short Review: With a brutal opening scene that sets the tone for ghastly events to follow, It: Chapter Two delivers more of Pennywise minus the conventional scares. To summarize, the Losers Club reunites to deal with the Pennywise problem 27 years later. What made the first part of It so frequently entertaining was the chemistry shared between the wily, high-energy kids that the Losers Club comprised.While their older counterparts boast more screen-famous names such as James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, and more, their camaraderie lacks the spontaneous spunk of their younger versions. Bill Skarsgård makes a triumphant return as Pennywise the clown and leaves the most opaque mark in the two-part series. What stretches It Chapter Two is writer Gary Dauberman's and director Andy Muschietti's attempt to stay faithful to Stephen King's novel to a great extent. As such, it renders each (surviving) member of the Losers Club with an 'individual episode of horror', most of which work only in parts.
While the budget is a lot more lavish this time around (and that's reflected in the sets, costumes, and visual effects), director Muschietti replaces the more authentic, unexpected scares of the first with frequent, super-loud, in-your-face scares that you can see coming a mile away. This makes It Chapter Two more of a horror-actioner and less of an atmospheric horror-drama.
Also, the climax didn't do me any good. Compared to the elaborate episodes that each member of the Losers Club experiences, it fell extremely short of what one would imagine needs to be done to overthrow a morbid menace such as Pennywise.It would have also made more sense to cut down on these fast-paced jumpscares to give viewers some extra context on The Ritual of Chüd and its true effects. With a run-time of close to 3 hours, you're bound to feel some butt-numbing effects instead. After a first chapter that turned out to be a pleasant surprise, I thought It Chapter Two (with raised stakes) barely managed to deliver. Yet, it just might be the true-blue summer blockbuster of 2019.",It Chapter Two

91,rivertam26,Disappointing but somewhat entertaining,6,16 February 2020,"Initially I hated this movie. I have to admit my expectations were a bit high especially since the first chapter is truly one of the best horror films ever made. This time around we see the Losers club 28 years later after the evil returns. Together they must overcome their fears and find the courage to face it once and for all. The truth is the adult storyline is way less interesting than the kids but the way in which this film handles is overtly goofy and mistaken for most of it's run time. First up the casting is good but the roles are underwritten. Only Bill Hader and sexy James Ransome manage to make any kind of impact. The film also spends too much time in forced flashbacks that are neither engaging or effective. Plus the awful digital de aging is definitely a problem. Because of all that we never really get to know the grown up versions which consist of an underused Jessica Chastain. An underwhelming but handsome James McAvoy, Old Spices Isiah Mustafa (a.k.a. the hunky centaur) and an overly Jay Ryan as grown up Ben. Even though the original TV miniseries struggled especially in the second half it was more cohesive and effective. This sequel actually lessens the impact of its predecessor and actually takes away some of the quality. That being said watching it again and knowing what to expect I enjoyed it a little more and actually liked some of the scenes that are more atmospheric and not bogged down by bad cgi. In the end it's overly mediocre but does manage to be mildly entertaining. But with rumors of a third chapter on the way, I beg of them. Please stop.",It Chapter Two
92,Troy_Campbell,"Visually pleasing and super stylish, but also bloated and narratively dull.",6,8 September 2019,"Horror is not a genre I typically enjoy. I love a good horror film as much as the next person, but I find them to be very few and far between; the overall standard within the genre pretty low thanks to countless lazy efforts looking for cheap thrills and easy scares. The 2017 cinematic remake of the first half of the 1990 TV miniseries on the other hand, was a stylish, confident and tension building creep-fest, director Andy Muschietti crafting a string of striking and eerie set-pieces that found the perfect balance between frights and levity. Part two largely swaps the kids from the first instalment for their adult versions, bringing them back to the disturbing town of Derry 27 years after they thought the defeated the menacing Pennywise the Clown. Although the flair is still there, Muschietti can't create anything as memorable as last time out; the spine-tingling sequences this time more predictable and, thanks to an unnecessary extra 30 minutes of runtime, spread way to thin. Pennywise is a fascinating creature of nightmares - Bill Skarsgård's rubbery face, sad-creepy inflection, faded orange quiff and an almost imperceptible drool a superb combination to ensure his place in the pantheon of iconic horror monsters (right alongside Tim Curry's bubblier and bigger-eyed 1990 version). Muschietti secured an impressive cast too: James McAvoy as the leader of the pack, Jessica Chastain as the emotionally damaged heroine and Bill Hader and James Ransone as a quibbling pair of best buds who are always good for a laugh. Yet there's a spark missing from the adult group compared to their teenager selves; that recognisable chemistry of adolescents with their lives ahead of them a big part of why the first outing was so entertaining, whereas the beaten-down 40-something versions are less fun to hang out with. A sequel that gets bogged down in narrative filler and hokey backstory, It Chapter 2 still delivers just enough visually exciting sequences and nerve-jangling frights to cap off this two-parter nicely.",It Chapter Two
93,Jeremy_Urquhart,"A solid horror film, but also a mild disappointment after the first chapter.",7,6 September 2019,"I suppose it would be giving It Chapter Two too much credit to say that the magic sort of fading in this instalment reflects how adult life is less emotional/meaningful/magical than childhood.Because yes, the endearing and thoroughly likeable kids from the first movie have grown up, and they're still likeable, but for whatever reason it just isn't quite the same. Pennywise doesn't really up his standards, and he more or less goes through the same motions he did in the first one, and now that he's targeting adults, he's just not as menacing as he was when he was terrorising the same people as kids.Granted, I didn't find the first one hugely scary, and found it more satisfying as a Stand By Me-style coming of age film, but it was a bit more creepy the first time around because it was fresher and more surprising.
And with the cast being adults now (apart from some flashbacks), the nostalgia and whimsy and much of the emotion from the first has vanished (again- potentially a metaphor for the fact that growing up kinda sucks).So after all those complaints... why still give it a positive score?
Well, the acting was all around quite good, the scary sequences were still fun (though really not frightening), it was really funny in parts, there were a couple of neat cameos, and despite being almost three hours, it moved along pretty nicely, and apart from some points in a somewhat repetitive second act, didn't really feel its length.If you liked the first you'll like this one too, just probably not quite as much.",It Chapter Two

The CGI is impressive and the acting is good, but there's not much else I can say I appreciated about 'Chapter Two'.The big problem I have with this film, and to a lesser extend its predecessor, is its running length. There's just no need for it to be anywhere near 3 hours long and there were ample opportunities for scenes to be cut or trimmed. There isn't enough depth in the plot and it really does drag.The storyline is okay but rather predictable and quite clearly lacking ideas. It resorts to jump scares too often, most of which you can also see coming. Overall, while not a bad horror film, I won't be spending another 3 hours watching again.",It Chapter Two

All team (all are grown ) is gathered on a call of a member (as he has contact numbers of all's even 27 years and no one has important work seems they are waiting for just call. Woman member hit her husband to run away instead of covencing him.). After meet they decided to arrange a riots to finish devil but actually this part taking place in last 20 minutes and meanwhile in 2 complete hours you have to watch meaningless flashback with some poor jumpscares. Total waste of time with no story. I fear if we could see chapter three too in '21. Avoid this stupid chapter else will be lost time and money.,It Chapter Two

99,thekarmicnomad,Is it over yet?,5,19 November 2019,"I didn't enjoy this chapter half as much as the opening chapter.The characters from the first movie make good on their promise to return and kill off the clown if it ever comes back.
Everyone's child hood memories have become suspiciously hazy.
Then Pennywise starts messing with everyone.A pattern of events is now formed.
1 - We center on a character.
2 - They get a flash back from their childhood
3 - Pennywise shows up in the form of some improbable monster.
4 - The character screams.
5 - Pennywise goes away.
I didn't keep track of how many times this sequence is repeated but I would guess somewhere around a thousand.It looks like everyone is being setup for some sort of redemption but the ending just isn't that clever.This film felt like it went on for ever.
Despite spending two hours with the characters I could not care if they lived or died.
Pennywise is no longer scary as he just pops up then disappears like some kind of deranged whack-a-mole.Good production and acting but much too long and doesn't really go anywhere.",It Chapter Two

101,educallejero,"Well done, visually pleasing mediocrity",5,10 September 2019,"2 movies and more than 5 hours in, I still don't know Pennywise powers (what can and can't he do), the extent of them (limits), what he wants, what he needs, etc. That's a big problem, because while the actors were mostly incredible (with the exception of Jessica Chastain that was fine, but doesn't really look like the same Beverly Sophia Lillis was playing), and the story that was told between the scary sequences was sweet and kind of great, the truth is these ""IT"" remakes focus so much on the scary sequences that there is just not time to develop every character's arc. Because there is not time, the movie moves at an insane pace with a very repetitive mold. Literally every single character starts the ""development"" in the same way and we see them deal with it one after the other. All this with flashbacks of every character that didn't add anything new to what the first movie showed.Like I say, after boring and repetitive stretches, we end up in the third act where insanity follows (that's a book problem, but the movie didn't solve it) and things just happens and the movie ends. The arcs are all resolved, but again, in such mechanical way that every emotion is dried up by the time it appears on screen. They forced the kids on this movie because we loved them, but they could've used all those minutes to explain better Pennywise (if that's even possible) and develop a more coherent story and a better flow through the plot.",It Chapter Two
102,aciessi,Let's Float Again.,8,8 September 2019,"Trauma. It sticks with you for all of your life. What are the things you remember? Do you remember more good things than bad? When bad things happen, do they haunt you forever? These are the questions that It: Chapter Two confronts. Pennywise isn't just some scary clown. As Stephen King's horror epic suggests, he's a metaphor for childhood trauma and how to overcome it. In reality, many people are incapable of overcoming trauma. But for fiction's sake, it makes for a better and more rewarding story to imagine our protagonists (The Losers) coming together to defeat it. If you can't escape the clown.. kick it's ass.It: Chapter Two is not packing the same punch with audiences as the first one did. For starters, it's nearly three hours long. With a runtime like that, you'd better hope that you've made one of the greatest horror films of all time. But as I sat and watched, those hours raced by. Forgive me, but I had a ball. It's a night of dumb horror fun if nothing else. But the amount of character development is not too shabby either. Bill Hader kills it as adult Richie. Hilarious, and at times, heartfelt. Everyone else brings their all from McAvoy to Chastain. The scares are plentiful. Most of them land perfectly. Although, oddly enough, many are played for laughs. I found myself cackling at some of Pennywise's antics, whereas last time, he just creeped me out. That's a jarring difference for sure, but it almost harkens back to Tim Curry's classic performance, and that's something I can appreciate. If narratively speaking, this film follows the same beats as the first film, remember, that's because its the same book divided in two. It isn't supposed to break new ground. Are certain things about this film sloppy? Sure. Could it have used a trim? Maybe? But what we get in mistakes, we are overcompensated in thrills.So in terms of the snark this film is facing, I just don't understand it. Count me out as a naysayer. My bottom line is fun. Scare me, thrill me, make me laugh and keep me invested the entire time. It: Chapter Two does that with little clown horns on it's feet. It kept me liking it for 169 minutes. How many films can do that?",It Chapter Two
103,khanbaliq2,"Small gripes aside, there's enough to love about It: Chapter Two to satisfy anyone's inner cynic.",6,6 December 2019,"N an earlier post, I wrote about how only two films that were released in theaters during the summer pleased me. They're Toy Story 4 and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Well, Avengers: Endgame played in theaters during the summer too, but I don't consider it to be a very good film. There were also several other summer movies that I kind of like. So, when it comes to new Hollywood films, it wasn't a good summer or a bad summer. It was an average summer. I mean, one can't expect an excellent new film to be released every week. Who would have the time to go to a theater every week? This isn't realistic. Well, anyway, after the summer movie season came to an end, Hollywood quickly released several enjoyable films that make the summer movie season pale in comparison to this autumn movie season. I haven't seen every film that has been released in the autumn yet, but I can say that Terminator: Dark Fate, Zombieland: Double Tap, Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil, and Abominable are worth seeing. Most are so good that they can be seen more than once. I'd also like to see 21 Bridges, Charlie's Angels, Frozen 2, and Jojo Rabbit. Joker is a film that I think isn't worth seeing more than once. It's not a bad film. For a modern film, it's good, but the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired. I mean, it's no Apocalypse Now (1979). That's for sure. There are a few moments of brilliance in Joker, but, for the most part, it's a rather dull film, and I'm not judging it based on its message or content. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is good, but not extraordinary. The cinematography doesn't look very good. Most of the scenes in the film aren't interesting. And the direction, though certainly better than average for modern times, isn't very good either. What did surprise me is how much I enjoyed seeing It Chapter Two and Doctor Sleep. I don't think that these films are very good, but they're better than I expected them to be. In It Chapter Two, the director, Andy Muschietti, showed more of his artistic side, as he did in his fine horror film Mama (2013). It Chapter Two is more atmospheric, better shot, and features better acting than It (2017). And it doesn't rely as much on silly jump scares. All of this added together made it a more enjoyable film for an adult like me. But the film still suffers from the fact that, like It, it was made to appeal to as large an audience of modern moviegoers as possible. Doctor Sleep is another well shot and atmospheric film that was directed by Mike Flanagan, who directed the fine horror film Oculus (2013). As a film, Doctor Sleep is kind of enjoyable. The novel by Stephen King is, in my opinion, bloated and rather dull. Still, the film isn't much better because there's nothing about it that stands out. The acting is fine, but not great. The story is fine, but not very interesting. The cinematography is good, but not in any way truly appealing. The music isn't memorable. Some of the scenes are good, but most of the scenes are just passable. By the way, one of the horror films that I really enjoyed seeing lately is Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh (1995). It's better than I expected it to be. The first film, Candyman (1992), is, in my opinion, fantastic when it comes to its artistry. It's easily one of the best horror films of the 1990s. When I was thinking about it, I thought that it must be the best of the 1990s, but then I remembered that Scream (1996) was released in the 1990s too. Scream is overall a slightly better film than Candyman. With Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh, the filmmakers at least attempted to make a good film, and in some ways they succeeded. It's obviously inferior to Candyman, but the acting, the cinematography, and the direction still make it worth seeing. And, finally, I'm almost done with my Marvel Cinematic Universe marathon, which I began in May of this year, when I watched Iron Man (2008) again. From then on, I've been watching every MCU film in order, and I'm still not quite finished. Of course, it hasn't been an obsession with me because I haven't been watching the films one after the other all in one sitting. I've seen many other films in this time period too. In this way, I've now seen every MCU film at least twice, and I don't consider this to be a bad thing because MCU films are good. There still hasn't been a single bad MCU film. Quite impressive. The years 2018 and 2019 are particularly memorable in the history of the MCU because Marvel released four fantastic films one after the other. They're Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man And The Wasp, and Captain Marvel. When I watched these films again on home video I noticed how well made they are. The acting is good. The stories are interesting. The music is fitting. The entertainment factor is high. The special effects are excellent. Need I say more? I can say that by the time Phase Three began in the MCU, Marvel truly found its groove.",It Chapter Two
104,RforFilm,"It Chapter 2 makes for a good second half, even if its too long",7,6 September 2019,"You know why something like the Boogey-Man and Dracula are scary for children and not so much for children? It's about perspective. When your younger, because you don't have that understanding of the world, something like monsters seems plausible and hiding in the dark. The older we get, the more we realize that there's nothing dangerous in the dark except for our imagination. By the time we hit our twenties, it seems that the monsters have disappeared in favor of real life fears like criminals, work, and even of ourselves. The Boogey-Man isn't going to have the same effect on a thirty-year old.In a way, the monster of It, Pennywise the Clown, is a representation of the childhood Boogey-Man; it makes itself into whatever children find scary, it hides in the dark and it only follows children (but it is willing to eat adults). Plus, taking the form of a clown is the best way for it to lure children into it's trap. I think this is why a lot of adults do have genuine fears of clowns. As a follow-up to the It movie of 2017, It: Chapter 2 brings the Losers club back to Derry to face Pennywise again.Instead of the late 1980s, the story moves forward to the present day where a gay man missing (no thanks to Pennywise) and the only Losers Club member Mike (played by Isaiah Mustafa) who remained in Derry, discovers that they didn't kill the clown. So he makes the call to the rest of the losers to come back and finish the job. This consists of writer Bill (Played by James McAvoy), fashion designer Beverly (played by Jessica Chastain), now skinny architect Ben (played by Jay Ryan), risk analyst Eddie (played by James Ransone) and standup comedian Richie (played by Bill Hader. The only holdout is Stanley (played by Andy Bean) who commits suicide after getting the phone call.Everyone meets up in a restaurant where Mike reveals that as the town Liberian, he's done the research to figure out how to kill Pennywise. Part of it involves them collecting items from their past, thus splitting them up to explore Derry once more. As they each go to their old stomping grounds, each has an encounter with Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgård). It's here their confronted with new fears, along with the possibility that Pennywise just may be too powerful.The original It was a fantastic horror movie that I still highly recommend. Does It: Chapter 2 serve as a good companion piece? It does, though it's not as good as the original. A lot of the first movie was the fact that the main characters will children (all of them acted very well) and that we feared for them a lot more. It's not that I don't fear for them as adults, it's just not as interesting. I'll say it still works as all the actors playing the adult counterparts are really good. Of course the knockout is still Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise who remains just as scary.As far as the story goes, it's also good. I've read the book It, and I was okay with it being split into two movies. It does allow the characters to explore their old hometown without it seeming like a rehash. They make it clear from the beginning that the losers forgot about Pennywise and their childhoods (likely a supernatural cause by the clown). It leads into a good encounter with the clown in his true form...that I wished would have been designed better. Without spoiling the look, though it's different, it's heavily reminiscent of the final creature from the miniseries. I think they could have gone further.If the film has any major faults, it's with the running time. At nearly three hours, it definitely feels a lot longer then it needs to be. A lot of scenes will drag on really for no reason then to extend it. Along with that, the pacing can feel off (the first film had this problem too) when trying to combine the comedy and the humor. It's not bad, but it can also feel repetitive in spots where they encounter monsters they've seen before.I'll give this seven Georgie boats out of ten. Despite its long running time, I was still satisfied with the end result and how this connects with the first movie. I'll be curious if they make a super edit of both movies together. It goes without saying that you need to watch the original before watching this. Otherwise, it's safe to float to the theaters.",It Chapter Two
105,Anurag-Shetty,Perfect conclusion.,10,7 September 2019,"It Chapter Two(based on the second half of Stephen King's novel) continues with the story of the Losers Club, 27 years after the events of It(2017). After facing off against the horrifying clown, Pennywise(Bill Skarsgard), Beverly(Jessica Chastain), Bill(James McAvoy), Richie(Bill Hader), Ben(Jay Ryan) & the rest of the Losers Club, have all grown up & left Derry. Then a shattering phone call, brings them all back to Derry.It Chapter Two is an excellent film. Director Andy Muschietti has retained all the ingredients that made It(2017), an absolute delight to watch. The horror set pieces have been perfectly blended with hilarious one-liners. There are one or two perfectly executed jump scares. The climactic set piece is awe-inspiring. However, if I had to choose, I'd say I liked It(2017) a tad bit better than this movie. The highlight of this franchise is that you care about every single main character. The younger cast's adult replacements are just as flawless & are a perfect match to their younger counterparts. Jessica Chastain is spectacular as Beverly Marsh. James McAvoy is outstanding as Bill Denbrough. Bill Hader is mind-blowing as Richie Tozier. Isiah Mustafa is great as Mike Hanlon. Jay Ryan is brilliant as Ben Hanscom. James Ransone is awe-inspiring as Eddie Kaspbrak. Andy Bean is good as Stanley Uris. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader, Mustafa, Ryan, Ransone & Bean share this natural camaraderie, that was also shared by the actors who played the younger versions of their characters in It(2017). Bill Skarsgard is the star of the show as Pennywise. Skarsgard once again gives his all, in his unforgettable performance as Pennywise. Jaeden Martell, Wyatt Oleff, Jack Dylan Grazer, Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, Chosen Jacobs & Jeremy Ray Taylor are amazing as the young versions of Bill Denbrough, Stanley Uris, Eddie Kaspbrak, Richie Tozier, Beverly Marsh, Mike Hanlon & Ben Hanscom, respectively. Teach Grant & Nicholas Hamilton are awesome as Henry Bowers & Young Henry Bowers, respectively. It Chapter Two is a must watch for fans of It(2017) & fans of Stephen King's source material.

106,bankofmarquis,Hader steals the film,8,7 September 2019,"The ""secret sauce"" of the first chapter of IT (based on the horror novel by Stephen King) was NOT the gore or scares that were thrown at the audience, it was the characters and the performances that made that first film work. The young members of the ""Loser's Club"" - and especially the young actors populating these characters - created people that you wanted to root and cheer for throughout their ordeal with Pennywise the Clown and the bullies of Derry.So...it should have been a ""no-brainer"" for Director Andy Muschietti and the filmmakers to repeat that pattern - it worked very, very well. But, somewhere along the way they forgot what made the first film good and Muschietti and new screenwriter Gary Dauberman decided to focus on the horror, gore and frights and let their talented group of adult actors inhabit the characters with little (maybe no) help from the screenplay.And...the result is a ""fine"" film that wraps up the first film just ""fine"", but ultimately falls short of that first film and definitely falls short of what ""could have been"".IT: CHAPTER TWO picks up 27 years later when Pennywise the Dancing Clown comes back (per his cycle) to terrorize the children of Derry once again. The Loser's Club from the first film band back together (per their pact at the end of the first film) to battle - and finally destroy - this dark threat.The filmmakers pull a strong group of actors together to play the adult versions of the Loser's Club - headlined by Jessica Chastain (ZERO DARK THIRTY) as the adult Beverly Marsh and James McAvoy (Professor X in the recent run of X-MEN films) as the adult Bill Denborough. I find McAvoy to be (for the most part) a solid, if unspectacular, actor and he is true to from here. Solid, but unspectacular in a role that was written that way. Chastain, perhaps, is the biggest disappointment for me in this film as the young Beverly Marsh (as portrayed by Sophia Lillis) was the highlight of the first film but here this character is...bland and somewhat boring. I don't fault Chastain (an actress that I usually enjoy very, very much), I blame the screenplay which saddles these two characters with an underwritten ""love triangle"" with the adult Ben Hascombe (Jay Ryan - somewhat of a newcomer, who has smoldering good looks, but not much else going for him). It was rumored that Chris Pratt was circling this character (I would imagine he walked away when he saw the screenplay). That's too bad, for he might have brought some life to all 3 of these characters.Faring better is the usually reliable Isiah Mustafa (TV's SHADOWHUNTERS) as the adult Mike Hanlon, the only one of the Loser's Club who stayed in Derry to keep a vigilant watch against Pennywise' return. He has a haunted air about him - certainly in keeping with the the past that only he remembers. And Andy Bean (SWAMP THING) has a nice couple of moments as the adult Stanley Uris.The only truly interesting dynamic of the returning Loser's Club is the characters and love/hate relationship between the older Eddie Kaspbrak, the hypochondriac (played by James Ransome, TV's THE WIRE) and smart-mouth Richie Tolzier (inhabited by SNL vet Bill Hader). While Ransome's Eddie is quite a bit more interesting than he was as a youth (and that's no slight on Jack Dylan Grazer who played the younger Eddie, I just found Ransome's portrayal more nuanced and somewhat more interesting). But it is Hader who steals this film. His Richie is constantly using humor to cover his emotions building on the interesting characterization that Finn Wolfhard brought to the younger version and giving us more. Hader is a master comedian, so handles the comedy parts as deftly as you would think he would, but it is when the other emotions - fear, rage, love - come barreling out of him that Hader elevates this character (and the movie) to a higher level. I would be thrilled if Hader was nominated for an Oscar for this role - he is that good.Also coming back are all of the ""kids"" from the first film to flesh out some scenes - and set up some other scenes/moments by the adults - they are a welcome addition and shine a spotlight at how weak - and underwritten - most of the adult characters are in this film.Bill Skarsgard is seen quite a bit more as Pennywise - and that makes him less menacing and threatening (but still scary) and there are 2 fun cameos along the way by 2 prominent individuals, so that was fun.There is a running gag throughout the film about author Bill Denborough (the surrogate for Stephen King) not being able to write a decent ending - a critique that King receives constantly - and they changed the ending of this film from the book. I am a big fan of the book, but would agree that the ending of the book was not that good, so was open to this trying a different way to end things...and...this new ending lands about as well as the original ending (oh well...).But that's just a quibble, for by that time you've ridden with these characters for over 5 hours and while the first chapter is stronger than the first, the journey is good (enough) for an enjoyable (enough) time at the Cineplex.Come for the Loser's Club and the scares - stay for Hader's Oscar worthy performance.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",It Chapter Two
107,Ruskington,Literal nonsense,4,16 August 2020,"While the first movie was heavily flawed, it was still a fairly entertaining piece of cinema with plenty of positive aspects. The sequel however, is just complete and utter nonsense, littered with logistical errors and heavily reliant on jump-scares and cheap CGI tricks.Once again, the story is fractured, inconsistent and difficult to follow. Combined with a ridiculous runtime, the film becomes tiresome and ultimately quite boring. The final act is hideously bloated, similar in scope and style to the early Harry Potter movie finales (not a good thing).One thing I will say is that the casting is exceptional. I have never seen a film get the match between child and adult versions of characters so spot-on. This is particularly impressive with the Ben Hanscom character who looks completely believable as he transitions from podgy child to dashing lean adult. Jessica Chastain is another standout performer who does extremely well with a very challenging role.I generally hate Hollywood adaptations of classic novels but I had really high hopes for the It movies. Yet, despite having many things going for them, the films are just too messy and incoherent. Had this been put in the hands of Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott we might have had an all-time classic. Sadly, it will have to go down as a rather spectacular fail and a huge waste of a brilliant cast.",It Chapter Two
108,fernandoschiavi,"Andy Muschietti delivers a film worthy of the original material and manages to advance the first part of the story, adding new layers to the horror created by Stephen King",7,6 November 2021,"Returning to the direction of the second part of It (2017), Andy Muschietti presents us with a bloody and impactful conclusion, without leaving the comic and memorable air of the loosers, now adults. While the first part of the Andy Muschietti-led adaptation had explored, albeit more discreetly, controversial topics in his construction of the Derry space, in It: Chapter 2 filmmaker and screenwriter Gary Dauberman (Annabelle 3) dive headlong into the problematic aspects from the city to emphasize, to good effect, the dubious relationship the now-adult Losers have with their homeland. If the predecessor emphasized the beauty of the inseparable group relationship, here it is the individual and collective traumas that stand out on the most positive aspects, preventing them from recovering the courageous team spirit as they live their lives in a constant state of flight.However, like the hazy memories of its protagonists, It: Chapter 2 deals with its own difficulty regaining previous experience, even though it arrives just two years after its debut. Since much of Chapter Two, and by that I mean more than half of its duration, is devoted to each of the Losers reminiscing about past experiences, the flashback inserts become constant to the point of redundancy, either recapitulating events that occurred in Chapter 1 or excerpts that were left out and inevitably had to be included here. Thus, it shows itself to be indecisive between being a Part 2 and a conventional sequence aware of the time interval that separates it.There is a great side to this indecision: the return of the talented young cast, undoubtedly the strongest point of the feature released in 2017. The presence of the young people also highlights the unique care in the selection of the adult cast, with meticulous attention to the features shared between each actor with his past/future counterpart. It is also worth saying that the new scenes of the young Losers, whether individual or those gathered in their secret club in the forest, are again conducted with affection and sweetness that, by - not always - efficient editing and sophisticated staging tricks, transfer their emotional charge to the more austere passages in the present and still make the interactions of the old Losers more stripped down.In this second part, the adult cast would have to pass on all the emotion and charisma that their young versions efficiently fulfilled. And that's what happens. The story starts (continues) with a brutal new death in the city and Mike, (Isaiah Mustafa) who still resides there, suspects that evil may be back, when he begins to recruit loosers Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Stan (Andy Bean), Ritchie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan) and Eddie (James Ransone), as agreed, back to Maine. On the other hand, we have a character that has been ignored since 2017: the city that, in fact, is the strongest social critic in Stephen King's book.This connection between past and present is shown on screen in several situations. The film transits in moments when adults see themselves alone and, powerless, see themselves as children again. Changes happen with an intelligent use of photography, investing in plongées and contra-plongées to change perspective and present adults from an angle that suggests impotence in the face of the evil that pursues them, soon it becomes natural to see them as children. Gary Dauberman's screenplay then works with small subtleties to show the audience that each of the Suckers carried a mark with them, as seen in Bev or Eddie, who married alternate versions of their own parents. And with this it is possible to see that the characters gain layers, which do not sound forced, but reinforce traits already known by the public. Richie, for example, has become a comedian (and the choice of a voice actor for the character's role proved crucial), but he continues to use humor as a way to deal with his fears.All this (re)construction of characters is fundamental for the script to be able to develop the type of horror proposed here. It is not expected to cause fear through the obvious, but through internal traumas, which were introduced in the first film (and constructed during childhood). So, as in a therapy session, winning Pennywise depends only on friends being able to confront their inner fears. And again, this is done through friendship. This connection makes the project more cohesive, making it easy to see a single film, even if it is divided into two parts. Muschietti still manages to deepen this idea by placing the characters in situations of isolated danger, and needing to accept the help of others to be able to put an end to a greater evil. At its core, the monster the story tries to sell isn't a clown, and it does so with subtleties that few movies of the genre can manage.The script tries to adapt as many passages as possible from the book (although many were left out), and most of them just don't work well on the big screen. The plot has several loose ends that are not explained, leaving important snippets of Pennywise mythology open. If chapter 1 had a round script, showing the fears of a group of children as they are attacked by an evil entity, the sequence is lost amidst several parallel stories that make the film tiresome at different times. The almost three hours of projection bring a slow pace, for hours sleepy, despite the impeccable photography and the stylish direction of Muschietti.As this draft suggests, It: Chapter 2 is, indeed, a bit indulgent, but in this period of more pasteurized and repetitive blockbusters, it's refreshing to see such a strange and daring project gain this kind of freedom to develop on its own. Own time - although it has suffered cuts from the original four-hour version. Here's the case: it's too much film for one film, so the possibility is open to having both many lows and a variety of high points, like a chest of macabre pranks. You can feel the weight of editing, especially when the script decides to bring Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) back. Just as there was a reasonable choice to abandon other subplots with minor characters from the book, his presence here is prolonged and unnecessary. His actions do not interfere with the story's development and it is possible to see how the script tries to get rid of him quickly in order to advance on more relevant things.The first act is agile, full of humor and some good scares, and follows the same pace as Chapter 1. When the protagonists gather in a wonderful scene in the Chinese restaurant, the director manages to brilliantly transpose what happens in the book to the screens, in one of the best and best-developed scenes in the film. However, the plot is lost in its second act. When the protagonists are separated and go on missions alone, the excess of flashbacks and editing makes the middle of the film sluggish and tiring. Luckily, the director manages to pick up the pace of the plot in his third act, an explosion of events and action in the scary clash between Losers Club and Pennywise, managing to create a decent ending to the story (since the ending in the book was a great trip...).The immense volume of events arises at a constant pace, and should mask the passage of time for most spectators. It is not the type of feature film that should be accused of being uninteresting, since, in addition to mastering the rhythm, Muschietti has shown himself to be more than a mere director of the horror genre, but a professional capable of moving between different tones and aesthetics. Here, the balance between horror and humor even appears more unbalanced, with moments that border on the type of self-referential parody currently in vogue and dilute the immersion, but the drama takes on greater nuances as more and more ""grown-up conversations"" occur"" in this mature stage of the plot.And despite suffering from a structure too segmented for individual hallucinations, as was the case with its predecessor, It: Chapter 2 ultimately holds a big advantage over the first part: an emotional and ambitious climax in which Pennywise's influence is evoked about the collective of its characters, resulting in a veritable salad of effects and ideas that should erase from the public's memory - if they have checked it out - the bad version of the confrontation performed in the nineteen miniseries. With such a sequence, Muschietti graduates from a small great director of the genre to one with ample capacity to sustain bigger and bolder projects.The conclusion in ""It: Chapter Two"" is worthy of the original work and forms a worthy complement to the first part. The result is a daring film, precisely because it invests more in the complex concept created for the book. As a horror work, it seeks to detach itself from the clichés of the genre, taking its own and intelligent approach. There is still room for metalinguistic jokes, especially with Stephen King, who has always been accused of writing bad endings for his books (the author himself appears at some point to reinforce self-reference).Focusing on the importance of friendship to defeat our inner monsters, Andy Muschietti delivers a film worthy of the grandeur of the original material and manages to advance the first part of the story, adding new layers to the horror created by Stephen King. Some caveats about the CGI exaggeration remain, but that don't take the shine off the excellent makeup and photography work, mainly. This sequel has all the successful elements of its previous one, however, how much you will like this movie remains on the premise of how much you are a fan of the book or how many horror movies it has digested. It's not a masterpiece of fear, but it's a film highly recommended for fans of the genre.",It Chapter Two
109,agmoldham,Not as good as Chapter 1,4,24 September 2019,"Wrote the headline saying it wasn't as good as chapter 1 and went scurrying off to check how I scored the 2 movies. Don't need to change the headline as scored them 6 and 4. The major difference between the movies is that I cared much more for the characters in the 2017 movie. Consequently it was much more scary to watch than the 2019 movie where I cared little for whether the characters survived or not.The movie is set 27 years after the original and don't think I'm giving anything away by saying Pennywise is back. The movie switches between the two timeline and it is impressive how little the original (young) characters have changed. Finn Wolfhard seems to age in each episode of Stranger things and yet he appears unaltered from the original IT here. Presumably they shot the movies back to back.It's a bit long at 3 hours and it does tend to go for the shocks rather than suspense. If you are really into the genre then it's worth catching, but it isn't an exceptional movie.",It Chapter Two
110,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Reviews negatives are over-exaggerated,9,10 September 2019,"I came close to dismissing this movie and missing out on its theater experience because of over-exaggeration of its' negatives. It isn't a perfect movie, some criticisms are valid. One of the valid criticisms is there is an overabundance of CGI scenes that doesn't add to the story such as a scene at a Chinese buffet. I am usually critical of over-the-top CGI in movies and I do agree that Hollywood relies too much in it. But the CGI doesn't ruin this movie.The runtime doesn't bother me either. It was certain scenes that progressed slowly in the middle of the film so I think those scenes could have been infused with more story telling.What I did like about the movie were the new flashbacks that blended the younger cast members and their older selves on screen. It added more story material to chapter 1 that we did not know from the original movie and it made for a good transition from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2. As others have mentioned, the casting is superb. They did a phenomenal job casting the actors.If you are a fan of King's IT, don't let the negative reviews dissuade you from the theater experience for this film. You might end up regretting not haven't gone when you see it on video next year. Judge for yourself and watch it on the big screen. To many sheeple hop on the bandwagon because they think it's cool.Again, it's not an excellent film, but it's far from the mediocrity of mainstream slasher and possession films, or even other Stephen King adaptations with the exception of Kubrick's' Shining which in my opinion still remains as the best adaptation of Stephen King's books. I think its an 8.5/10. Besides, Marvel is the epitome of overabundance in CGI because its cheaper than hiring great screenwriters. This isn't a Marvel film, it's a Stephen King movie and it is certainly worth a movie ticket. I got more than my money's worth today.",It Chapter Two
111,markthomassintek,Cash Grab,5,16 September 2019,"REVIEW - IT - CHAPTER 2As you may recall recently there has been quite a few Steven King films remade, The Dark Tower, Pet Cemetery and of course IT, now we have a sequel to IT.Films as with stories are usually split into 3 parts or acts, the first act setting up the story and characters, the second the story and the third the fight or outcome.IT has 3 very different acts which became very apparent as the film went on, the first act or setting up the story was actually very good and in places was scary, the second act revolved the team of loosers finding their thing (fleshing out the film) and the third act was the confrontation with the clown itself, honestly the 2nd act could have been got rid of completely as it serves no purpose at all, so in essence a dissjointed film in my opinion.So honestly not impressed and by the end I had one thought running through my head, cash grab.Rating 5 out of 10",It Chapter Two
112,abisio,Same as the first part but not the same,6,6 September 2019,"I saw the original made for TV (1990) movie which was considered at that time one of the best horror movies ever made. Considering the incredible success of the 2016 remake; it is obvious the material was really good and terrifying. Putting kids in danger always is.
I never read the IT book; but I understand that chapter two is basically within the same book.
Chapter 2; gather after 27 years the original ""Loosers Club"" when the only member staying in town realizes Pennywise is still alive.It is not the same threatening kids than adults; so Muscetti uses lots of flashbacks with the original kids; but as we already know who survives there is no much to be scare there. So to compensate that, the movie takes the characters apart;. creates a few horror scenes for each character and then join them together in the final act in the big confrontation.I cannot deny that I had several jumps on my seat; after the first two hours the movie becomes repetitive as the horror scenes and there is still another 50 minutes to go.In terms of acting; Bill Skarsgard perfectly fill up Tim Curry shoes and sometimes is ever more terrifying.As the adults; Bill Hader and James Ransone are the ones who really shine mostly because they are the comic relief. Chastain is completely lost here; her character is less written than the younger one. Mc Avoid is better but his characters is also underwritten. The rest is just standard fare.In brief; if you see the first one you probably will want to see the second; but it is not really as good or terrifying",It Chapter Two
113,bob-the-movie-man,"Jerky and spasmodic.... no, I'm not talking about Pennywise.",5,5 October 2019,"Unlike most of the world's population, it seems, I found the original ""It"" from 2017 decidedly so-so. I gave it just 2/5. Would the next chapter be any better?27 years have passed since the terrors of the first film, and life in Derry, Maine has returned to normal. Indeed, all the kids who have left Derry and got on with their lives have mystically forgotten all that happened to them. The only one to remember is Mike (Isaiah Mustafa, channeling young Denzel) - the only one to stay in town. When Pennywise returns, like a bad-penny(wise) with heart-munching zeal, Mike calls all of his former friends to ask them to follow through on their blood-pact and return to fight their foe. All but one are set to return.Mike believes a native Indian ritual may finally defeat the shape-shifting clown, but for it to work each member of the team needs to find a personal 'artifact' around the town. And that brings each of them into personal danger.The film has some superb moments. A little girl, sat on the bleachers and bored with a school baseball match, is dazzled by a firefly and follows it underneath the seats. It is suddenly captured by white-gloved hands. Pennywise the clown emerges from the darkness, scaring the girl but with honeyed words persuades her to stay. And then....It's a brilliant bit of film-making, and really should have been the start of the film to replace a rather unpleasant homophobic sequence.There are a half-dozen other stand-out horror moments to enjoy, but they are scattered across the running time and never gelled into a satisfactory whole for me.There is also a nice running joke about the ending of a film (within the film) not being half as good as the book; a clear reference to the poor ending of the original film that could never match up to the sexually troubling, and rather un-filmable, ending of the book!The film really loses its way in the middle reel, when everybody wanders off alone in search for their ""artifacts"". Some of these sections are fun and deliver. Some are a bit lacklustre. But the big issue is that the approach, together with the regular flashbacks to the youngsters, makes the whole middle of the film extremely episodic. The heart of the movie is the interaction between the team... and this section saps all the momentum out of the film.It sure is an excellent cast, with James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain both acting their blood-stained socks off.Sophia Lillis is again extremely watchable as the young Beverly, neatly matching - both physically and emotionally - to Chastain's older character. (Note: there is a moment of marital violence in the film that might upset some more than the pretend horror on show).My favourite turn in the film was Bill Hader as the stand-up comedian Richie Tozier. Always ready with a quip, but underneath it all a selfish and troubled soul.Look out as well for a nice cameo by Stephen King himself.One of the things that really annoys me in movies, apart of course from mindless voiceovers, is a finale that goes on and on and on. This is a case in point. After a final battle (which is entertaining if a bit twee and illogical) there are multiple ""final scenes"" that go on and on and on and then rather end as a whimper rather than a shout.Directed by the original ""It"" director Andy Muschietti, I enjoyed this sequel more than the original. The cast is excellent and the ""episodes"" although inherently disjointed are good enough to sufficiently entertain throughout. It's not a great horror film in my book - I actually enjoyed ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" far more - but worth a watch.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the internet or Facebook.

114,lopezpatricia-06139,BREATHTAKINGLY AWFULL AND TOTALLY ANNOYING,1,24 March 2020,For a start it was way too long. But it opens up with a really dark homophobic murder. I did think that during the film these animals will get their comeuppance but they didn't. Then all the ghost train puppets started flying out and they were bad. Some of the cgi was top notch but only on occasion. If I had just ridden a ghost train at the sea side then I would have been more afraid. The only thing that scared me about this film was that gay people are still being killed in America,It Chapter Two
115,ofpsmith,It's complicated.,5,7 September 2019,"I liked the Losers as kids better than them as adults when I read the book, so I figured that I would already like the first film better than this one. It also might be important to point out that I was not aware of how long the movie was before I walked in. But even still, this wasn't as good as I expected it would be. It had legitimate scares and the acting is pretty good for the most part, especially Bill Hader as Richie Tozier. But the film went on for too long, it relied too heavily on cliches, it took itself too seriously when it was discussing the lore, it makes half an effort to follow certain things from the book (as in it will show something from the book but not follow through with it entirely), and generally I viewed it as unfocused. Were there still things to enjoy? Yes. Just not enough to fully recommend it.",It Chapter Two
116,kjproulx,"A Solid Follow-Up, Even if it Falls a Little Short",7,15 September 2019,"Back in 2017, the majority of audiences praised the fact that such a great Stephen King adaptation had been made in It. The television mini-series from 1990 was a very corny version of the story and it went without saying that it deserved a better treatment. Now, the second instalment of that great first film has hit theatres, and like the mini-series, the second portion of the story just isn't as interesting as the first. It: Chapter 2 does warrant a viewing though, especially if you liked the first movie because although it's not exactly great like its predecessor, there's a lot to like here.Picking up 27 years after the events of the first movie, Pennywise (the clown) has returned to terrorize the town of Derry once again. Reuniting as they promised each other they would, this cast of characters come together to face him one last time. Through various side plots that each character find themselves on, this film may feel slightly long for some viewers at a beefy 169 minutes, but I found that the events unfolding and the performances surrounding them was enough to keep me interested.Even if you find this film boring at times, it goes without saying that this is once again a stellar cast. Just as they brilliantly cast the kids in the first film, everyone here is on the top of their game. From Bill Hader stealing the show on multiple occasions to the star power of Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy leaping off the screen, there is an endless slew of great character moments. Where this film slightly fell apart for me was in the fact that this movie relies heavily on the past.Almost seeming to be afraid of letting the past go, this movie flashes back and forth from past and present, showing moments from their childhoods that coincides with current situations. It worked simply due to the fact that the cast of both films is great, but it really did feel like it unnecessarily made the movie longer than it needed to be. With that said, I feel that will be the complaint for most people, but I actually didn't feel the length of this movie. That might have been because I was just in the mood to watch it, but I digress.In the end, It: Chapter 2 has a great dramatic backbone to it and these performers are giving their all, but the sense of terror and tension is lost a little here in favour of the former. Still, I'm a sucker for a good drama and this film definitely delivers that tenfold. Both of these films feel like they have a sense of finality at the end of them, which is why they both work on their own. The fact that this movie constantly switches between past and present actually makes it easier to watch for those who missed the first movie, which is something I always love. While it's not going to be remembered as a great film on its own, I believe these two movies will work as a great double feature. It's absolutely worth seeing.",It Chapter Two
117,Carycomic,A three-hour sequel that proves longer running time plus a bigger budget does not always equal better.,2,8 September 2019,"Where to begin?Perhaps with the needless prologue where a bunch of teenage Down Eastern rednecks beat up a gay couple in their thirties. Was that even in the original book? I don't think so. And if it was? I still regard it as unnecessary!Then, there was the constant F-bombing. Is Hollywood employing more script-writers with Taurette's Syndrome? Or were the writers of this particular screenplay just trying to hide the fact that half this movie was so boring, a lot of movie-goers where I went to see this (myself included) were literally starting to fall asleep!All I know for sure is, if I ran a restaurant where six customers were swearing that frequently and loudly, I would have told them to either shut up and get out, or I'd call the cops. Long before they started killing hallucinatory hobgoblins with expensive restaurant furniture!The most irrefutable proof that this sucked, however, is the fact that, when the end credits started rolling, absolutely nobody--repeat: NOBODY--clapped for the relatively happy ending.In short?

118,DarthVoorhees,Great moments aside 'It Chapter Two' underwhelms as it attempts to be a sprawling horror epic,6,14 September 2019,"I couldn't help feeling underwhelmed upon exiting the theatre. I've thought about it a lot and really there just isn't a whole lot of substance to 'It Chapter 2', it just doesn't have much of a thematic soul to it and you know you are adapting King wrong when that is a complaint levied against your movie.First off, I loved It (2017) or Chapter One. The success of that movie lies on the shoulders of it's cast of child actors who all had chemistry, motivation and distinct personalities. 'It Chapter Two's adult losers are extremely well cast. The heavy hitters Hader, Chastain, and McAvoy are all inspired choices and their talent and star power lend a lot of presence to the film. Honestly though I was more impressed with the B list members of the Loser's Club. Isaiah Mustafa is outstanding as Mike Hanlon, the only character whose depiction 'It Chapter 2' improves from the King novel. James Ransone is the spitting image of Jack Dylan Glazer who played Eddie in the first film. He has that right mix of comedy and being the fearful member of the group without going too far. Andy Bean has a small scene as the tragic adult version of Stanley Uris but it may be the best scene in the entire movie. Stanley's fate always seemed cruel and for shock value in both the King novel and the 1990 miniseries but Bean brings out the sadness and bleakness of it. The juxtaposition of the adult Stanley and the young Wyatt Oleff flashing back and forth while being underscored with the beautiful music by Benjamin Wallfisch is genuinely heartbreaking. It's kind of a shame the moment is revisited in an awkward ending.Sounds like a rave so far huh? Well the individual performances are great. The adult losers have no chemistry whatsoever. The scenes where they are together just never click. I mean sure you can get caught up in the action during the scenes of peril but when they are reminiscing and laughing it just falls flat. Notice that I didn't mention the adult Ben played by Jay Ryan when I was handing out praise. He is a pretty big weak link in the chain. I don't know if the character is written poorly or Ryan is just going for easy choices but the entirety of Ben in this film is his not so subtle crush on Beverly. This is supposed to be a big emotional pay off and Ryan just over does it.A lot is being made about the run time. Honestly for a movie that long I felt that it was kind of half baked. No time is spent exploring the town and it's culture and how Pennywise hovers over anything. You need that and the first film did it so well. The clown himself disappears for some very long stretches. The film is padded with flashbacks to the kids. I don't mind this but they don't really interconnect with the adult narrative. The kid flashbacks just sort of pad the story from the first film. I'm sure if you've read up on the movie you know about the CGI removal of puberty from the 2017 cast... it's distracting and highly noticeable.The musical score is great, the cast shines on an individual level, and try as I might I can't bring myself to condemn a three hour horror epic. This is probably the most intense horror film in size and scope you are ever going to see. Personally I'd like to see more horror films with this broad a canvas and so I want 'It Chapter Two' to succeed despite my problems with it. It (2017) was great and I walked out dying to see the adult saga and so maybe I'm having the 'Game of Thrones' finale syndrome where the movie I had in my head was better.It's serviceable.",It Chapter Two

The first hour introduces the adult characters, they assemble in Derry and face their fears in order to defeat the evil. Frequent flash-backs provide the backstory.I'm not a fan of horror but I liked it more than I thought I would and more than the first movie mainly due to the humour.

120,Darkside-Reviewer,Tim Curry in a clown costume is more terrifying than any CGI monster,5,6 October 2019,"I personally didn't enjoy IT 2017 so I didn't have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won't be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it's climax the makers of this ""Horror Movie"" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before ""Terrifying""The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it's not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven't already seen it Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can't be re-created no matter how much CGI you use.",It Chapter Two

123,msbreviews,Rating: C,5,12 September 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)So, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year's best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director's chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema...Well, I got to be honest: I'm disappointed. It's not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn't even come close to its predecessor's heels. I disagree with some headlines I've read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There's barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn't as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.Some say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film's runtime, especially if it's over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There's more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that's funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain's (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn't help the pacing.The first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they're doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it's pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie's subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn't have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.Beverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little ""kid"" who's scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn't do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017's movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.Finally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it's a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn't have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it's pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great...James McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsgård had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn't have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsgård since there's so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.Andy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman's screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions.In the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn't as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there's excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it's ... okay.",It Chapter Two

So as usual I had too much excitement for the sequel 2 years after. Alas! That eagerness resulted in a poor Sigh. This chapter two isn't bad but not great either. As most of us are coming from the first movie; expecting the same experience once again! That's why majority of us couldn't really liked the film. No matter how hard I tried, believe me; I wanted it to be good. But unfortunately, honestly saying it's not even close to what 'IT' was!The Storyline here is convoluted, messy. The writing here arouses much more questions than answers! Characters lacked depth unlike the first one, where the character build ups were brilliantly done! As a result of poor characterization; I couldn't really feel much connection to them. The relatability factor was on the lower side. The performances are fine, Greatly assembled set of actors who are both talented and experienced; gave all they could. But The emotional connection I felt with the child actors on the previous film was surely missed in here. The horror scenes are too many, at one time it becomes repetitive in nature. The extra long duration don't help either. Some scenes seemed unnecessarily stretched! Although the scenes themselves are made well enough regarding the technicalities and CGI work but the surprise element was long gone after the first few. Having said that, the confusive blend of Sci Fi And Horror, that I couldn't really fathom. It looks like the makers decided to put some tributes to Some Famous Sci Fi films like Alien, ET etc.In the end it's a decent okayish movie, that doesn't really justify as a sequel, but could have done better, had it been a standalone one.",It Chapter Two

129,RussHog,IT...sucks.,2,7 September 2019,"I didn't like the first one but it at least had a cohesive story. This was truly bad. There are moments the child actors show back up and the film returns to good cinema - but the adult cast has no chemistry and their storylines are all rushed. The shots are sloppy, the CGI is bad, and not enough of Pennywise. Many of the scares rehash scenes from the previous film. The lore King's book is essentially dragged into the sewer to die. So many things wrong with this lazy awful movie. SMH.",It Chapter Two
130,MrDHWong,A solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work,9,5 September 2019,"IT Chapter Two is the sequel to the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel of the same name. Starring Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Isaiah Mustafa, and Bill Skarsgård, it is a solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work.Twenty-seven years after the events of Chapter One, the Loser's Club have all grown up and left the town of Derry, Maine, with the sole exception of Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), who chose to remain as the town librarian. One night, Mike realises to his horror that IT has returned and has resumed feeding on scared children. Before IT can claim more victims, Mike calls up his childhood friends one by one to reunite them and fulfill the vow they took when they were younger to destroy IT permanently.Much like its predecessor, IT Chapter Two relies on scaring the audience through building up a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and inner torment within the main characters, rather than with typical jumpscares. In spite of that, this film was considerably more drama heavy with less horror elements, likely due to the previous film featuring children a great deal more and the protagonists now being mature adults. The grown-up Loser's Club cast in this film each do a fantastic job mirroring their child counterparts. All of them bring their own uniqueness to their characters, with Bill Hader standing out the most as the grown up Richie, who injects some much needed comic relief into some of the film's more dramatic moments. However, once again, it is Bill Skarsgård as IT, in particularly his clown form Pennywise, who is truly terrifying as a supernatural force to be reckoned with. Despite the 170 minute runtime, the film is never boring and is brilliantly paced and edited thanks to the creative direction of Andy Muschietti. This really does feels like the conclusion to what could be considered the ultimate Stephen King adaptation, complete with all of the usual tropes and even some surprising references to his other work. With that said, IT Chapter Two is certainly worth watching, provided Chapter One has been viewed first of course.I rate it 8.5/10",It Chapter Two
131,eva3si0n,A typical bad sequel,5,18 September 2021,"The cinema adaptation of It 2017 looked fresh in the long-established genre of horror. And then It Chapter Two comes out. A typical sequel, but all the main characters are adults now. And the cast was not bad, of course James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain stand out against their background. But the plot of the second part is delusional, almost unrelated structurally. No movie, it's just gluing a lot of scenes. Actors are clearly trying, but with such a scenario nothing good will work anyway. Surprisingly, the first part of 2017 without a star cast looks much better.",It Chapter Two
132,Alexander_Blanchett,Very good sequel,8,6 September 2019,"Not as good as the original but still a very good conclusion of the Stephan King story.
The ""Loser Club"" now all grown up returns to Derry to face once again the deadly clown.
What worked so well in the first one was the bonding of the teens, the coming of age factor and the throw back to the late 80s. Here there is not much left of that, you are rather faced with a lot of troubled adults without much of a perspective. There is still fine character development but in this sequel the gore factor was surely more in the focus.
Acting wise it was good and the adult versions of the kids were wisely chosen. Jessica Chastain was quite good, though I hoped her role would have been a bit more interesting. James McAvoy had the most complex character and worked him very well. Bill Hader was also good and worth to mention. Bill Skarsgard was once again frighteningly convincing as Pennywise. It was nice to have some flashback sequences with the kids to reveal some secrets that we did not have in the first part of the film.
There was some really great editing involved and generally an excellent atmosphere provided. The ending was great and touching in a way.
Generally both films are among the best King adaptations out there.",It Chapter Two

135,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,24 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...After the pleasant surprise of ""It - Chapter One"", I had high hopes going into this movie, the 2nd Chapter. And though it didn't quite measure up to the first one, it was pretty dang close. All-in-all, both movies together were very well made and executed. ""It"" delivers what's promised. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised at all the low ratings. What else did they expect?In this installment, it is 27 years later, and Pennywise has resurfaced. Having taken an oath that if he ever came back, the 7 friends would come back to Derry and put him away - forever. All 7 have gone on to very different lives with their own set of new problems and challenges. And except for Mike, everyone has nearly forgotten the events of their childhood. Mike remembers because he stayed in Derry while the others have moved on. Once again, this time as adults, they have to face their own demons while finding a way to kill Pennywise. Oh yes, Henry Bowers has also come back and more dangerous than ever.As was the case in the first film, the make-up and special effects were simply awesome. Skarsgard delivers again as Pennywise, and all the adult actors played their roles well. I think what makes the first film work better were the kids. In some respects, they were braver than the adult versions of themselves. Having said that though, this picks right up where the first one left off and finishes the story to satisfaction.I loved both movies. I highly recommend them both. If you can, and want the full experience, watch them back-to-back like I did. It is time well spent and something I will be sure to do again. Awesome adaptation of the Stephen King classic (who also makes a nice little cameo in this film). 8 stars out of 10.",It Chapter Two

I don't think it would be bearable without them.The ""truck-stop lumberjack"" part made this gain one star by itself. That was way cool! Whoever thought of that had a great idea.",It Chapter Two
137,ronakkotian,Went on for too long...,5,14 September 2019,"This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. The whole premise of It fascinated me and I thought Chapter One was a good adaptation of Stephen King's source material. What worried me was how the adult portion would be handled since the 1990s mini-series had a very disappointing take on the adult segment. Whilst this is an improvement on the mini-series version, it doesn't reach the level of its predecessor.It: Chapter Two follows the reunion of the Losers Club, 27 years later, as they try to defeat Pennywise once and for all.My feelings towards this movie are quite mixed. There are portions which I enjoyed and parts which I disliked. What I thought was perfect about this movie was its casting choices. Seriously, the adult cast fit right into every one of their characters. You actually feel like the kids grew up to be like the adults. The best amongst them was Bill Hader who effortlessly acts like Finn Wolfhard's Richie Tozier. I felt the chemistry between them in the same way as the kids. This is one of the film's biggest strengths.A big issue I had with this film was its runtime. Whilst the first chapter had a continuous pace, you could feel the 2 hours 40 minutes here. Some scenes dragged on for way too long and some didn't feel necessary. If 20-30 minutes were trimmed off the length, then the pacing wouldn't suffer as much.A few flashbacks to the kid versions of themselves felt distracting. I couldn't help but notice how some of the kids, especially Finn Wolfhard, were digitally de-aged to fit the time period and because all of them grew up since the last film. Some of their dialogue had a sense of ADR done to them as well which put me off during my viewing.An important element that a movie like It should have is scary scenes. There were a few good scares in the first one but Chapter Two fails to recreate that same impact. Apart from one scare which genuinely shook me, nothing else affected me. A complaint I had with the first film applies here as well. There were too many jumpscares. I wish some of the effects were practical as I think that would've been more effective when it comes to the scares.However, what I loved about this film was Bill Skarsgard. His performance as Pennywise is so creepy and entertaining. It's not just the make-up that creeps you out but his way of speaking alongside his expressions make the character of Pennywise all the more scary.It: Chapter Two is by no means a bad film. Despite its flaws, there's a lot of appreciate. The camaraderie between the Losers felt really believable and the humour was actually funny. Muschietti's direction is once again great and the cinematography is good as well. I feel that they tried to fit in too much which affected the end result.",It Chapter Two
138,Azanspy,An okay sequel.,6,15 September 2019,"It Chapter One was fun to watch. It had many good moments and it was kids vs a killer clown, which is more interesting than grown ups vs a killer clown. It Chapter Two is long but does not bore us. There are no scary moments other than one or two jump scares. In fact, there is more humour than scare in this scary movie. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, James Ransone did good job but it was Bill Hader and Skarsgard who stole the show. The making of the film is also good with some very good shots. Overall, this movie is watchable for the ones who liked the first part even though I'm sure they won't like this as much as the first part.",It Chapter Two
139,dilipbts,It chapter two,7,10 June 2020,"I personally didn't enjoy IT 2017 so I didn't have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won't be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it's climax the makers of this ""Horror Movie"" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before ""Terrifying""The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it's not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven't already seen it Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can't be re-created no matter how much CGI you use.",It Chapter Two
140,statuskuo,Proved My Suspicion,1,8 March 2020,"Admit to yourselves, those who championed the first re-boot of this that you haven't seen it since. That being said, this is absolute proof your gauge was painfully off the first time. These kids have personalities built into a box and not one person that I cared about more than the 90's ""IT"" And it wasn't because of Tim Curry. He's great and will never be outdone (sorry kid who played him in this one, you aren't charming enough to be creepy as Curry was). The 90's was pure adult cinema. This is...some video game retro trash.
This movie (if you can call it that) drops us RIGHT at the end of the first chapter. Where they supposedly defeated the being that kills children yet goes into hibernation when the Losers Club thwart Pennywise's spree. 27 years later, their 40's version get called back into action. Here we learn they are all successful, yet do not remember their childhood past in Derry. All the better, since the traumatic events of the first one sent their memory into hiding as well. When called together by Mike Hanlon, they vow to end the terror once and for all.
I truncated the synopsis because...well, the more I think about this one, the more I really hate the people involved.
First, they steal the back and forth between past and present from the 90's version. Yet, somehow, that version was much more effective. This one has that gimmick where they run past their former self. Basically a memory that crisscrosses and such. This novelty wears down fast. And we get bits and pieces of their life as adults.
The 90's version really nailed the sense of their older selves. Again, they did the perfect casting by putting in...known television actors. This was a stroke of genius because the director most likely knew we bring our own baggage with them. Annette O'Toole, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Dennis Christopher, Harry Anderson, Richard Thomas, and Richard Masur. Absolutely brilliant because off the bat you really cared for them (with their history as good people in sitcoms and night dramas and cult films). Similar with their child counterparts.
In 2017 and 2019 ""It"" I really have no idea who any of these people are. James McAvoy is PAINFULLY mis-casted as Bill Denborough. As is Jessica Chastain as the grown up Beverly Marsh (though curiously, the teenage Bev in the original was bad casting). I never got the sense any of these adults lived a complete life. The abusive father tied to the abusive husband idea is tiresome. In the 90's version it hits you a little harder, since O'Toole played her more as a woman who was abused versus Chastain's baffling take as a woman who is affectionate to her abusive husband.
Any way, it gets REALLY tiresome when Pennywise becomes the spider and the resolution seems tacked on and...well, let's be clear, even Stephen King had no idea what ""IT"" was. So we get this overly computer generated VERY unscary thing.
There's too much to pick apart. It's just an awful money grab flick that totally lost that charm of fear. This became a dumb actioner, a woke it's okay to be gay thing, and well, it's a modern take. And when the dust settles I was surprised at a nearly 3 hour run time, it still felt like nothing happened.
I feel, these days, when they hand out assignments to make a movie, the statement is ""don't screw it up"" Life experience truly creates this, and somehow I feel the writer and director both need to live more life to know what makes nostalgia important. It isn't just rattling off pop culture references.",It Chapter Two

142,saadanathan,Not as good as the first one but does the job 6/10,6,21 June 2020,"On one hand I'm happy they didn't make a trilogy out of this story. On the other hand I'm not sure if a sequel was needed. I liked the first movie as it was but based on how the first ""It"" ended, with pennywise not being defeated entirely. I understand why they made a sequel to end the story completely. I enjoyed the first movie because it was fun to see kids fighting a monster and facing their fears. Now 27 years later it feels like every other horror movie with adults in it. So I'm not surprised of how it ended. Thus I don't like it. I think the flashbacks towards the past were among the funnier and scarier. I preferred seeing the characters as kids like they were in the first movie. Also the way the characters eventually defeat Pennywise is kind of dumb and lazy. I could see where the writers were lazy with the script and it's near the end. Calling Pennywise a ""clown"" and mocking him was really a lame idea. I don't know what else I would have done but the ending to me felt like one of Bill's disappointing book endings.

It's still a good film with a good story and a good cast of characters who show development and the monsters do look truly grotesque, both in appearance and the way they move, but it's never scary.

146,danielmanson,Disappointed on the whole.,6,10 September 2019,"To save hassle I'll jump right in:
Negatives: it's too long, I felt there was certain scenes which served no relevance and were there purely the lengthen the film. Could easily shave 30 mins off it.
The plot was flimsy, we got no explanation into Pennywise, why he did what he did and so on. Certain scenes also happened then were never linked back to. Bill and Bev kiss midway (no spoiler) and it's never once mentioned or anything. What was the point in that whole scene. This happened multiple times.
The likability and relatability of these characters wasn't the same as the first film with the kids. Ultimately wasn't that arsed if any of them died. And if it wasn't for Eddie and Richie this would have been very very stale.Positives: Eddie and Richie. Brilliant acting from both, especially Bill Hader. I quite enjoyed the small injection of comedy into this film, worked quite well.
The jump scares aren't too constant, something some horror films love to do.
Several emotions are done well. Funny, Scary, Intense, sadness and so on.Ultimately, the plot let's it down. I could get on board with the length of the film it it all served some sort of relevance, but it didn't. I noticed a few in the cinema got a bit bored midway.
The first film is much better, but it's not all bad don't get me wrong. If you've seen the first you may as well watch this. Just don't have huge expectations.

149,PyroSikTh,Had Its Work Cut Out,7,8 September 2020,"IT 2 follows the kids of the first film all grown up, and drawn back to the town of Derry twenty-seven years after they thought they defeated Pennywise. In the book the two timelines are more succinctly interwoven, but with almost the entire flashback of the kids' first encounter made into its own little movie, IT 2 had a little more work cut out for it. While the first film was a fairly simple, nostalgic tale of a group of kids uncovering the demon that lives beneath their town, IT 2 attempts a more mature approach, dipping its toes into the themes of nostalgia, and looking at how our memories of our childhood becomes warped - or absent entirely - as we grow older. It also digs a little deeper into the lore of Pennywise, and how he came to be. As kids, they find the demon and defeat it the best way they know how, but as adults they take the time to do research and come to the battle prepared with totems and a ritual to perform.At first I hated the casting of the grown-up characters, and found the film confusing in who was who, but as the movie went on I really started to see the genius of casting. James Ransome in particular is just a grown-up Jack Dylan Grazer, with the acting style, the facial expressions, and even appearance absolutely down. Bill Hader slipped into the role of Richie like a grown-up Finn Wolfhard perfectly as well. James McAvoy as Bill and Jay Ryan as Ben were really hard sells for me though, and the only real similarity between Jessica Chastain and Sophia Lillis is that they're female redheads. When you're the only girl in the story, you don't have to care about casting quite so much. But as I said, as the movie went on I could really get behind the casting decisions. I started to see Jeremy Ray Taylor's eyes in Jay Ryan, and McAvoy's stutter took us straight back to young Bill. Unfortunately Mike was as unmemorable as a grown-up as he was as a kid, so no judgements there either way.I haven't read the book, but I understand it goes to some pretty surreal places. With the hints of the Ritual of Chud in the trailers, I was excited to see some of this metaphysical weirdness put to screen, but it unfortunately never came to pass. Pennywise's backstory is barely touched upon beyond an animated hallucination, and a brief appearance to Beverly, and his true form to human eyes was barely book-faithful at all. With the Dead Lights already being a tangible entity in the movies, the alien-spider creature he appears as in the book makes less sense, so instead we just get Pennywise the clown with a spider body. It looks as goofy and unscary as it sounds (although my wife, who has a phobia of both clowns and spiders, is sure to disagree). The other big change from the book was the very end where the characters leave Derry, but still remember, undermining the entire theme of the story, about how we remember our childhood, if at all. And the way they turned Stan's suicide into a heroic self-sacrifice not only made zero sense whatsoever, but I couldn't help feel somewhat glorified the act. The idea that he just couldn't stomach the idea of going back to fight Pennywise was so much more harrowing.Then there's the treatment of Henry Bower, the bully turned murderous psychopath. His fate was left fairly ambiguous at the end of the first film, but he's back in this one, breaking out of a mental ward and heading back to Derry for...reasons. He attacks the grown-up losers for...reasons. And then dies for real and has absolutely no bearing on anything. In the book he's the epitome of Pennywise's corruption of the town, and takes a character out of the final battle, but here he's just a minor nuisance that could've been cut out entirely. For a movie that's already super long and could've done with a bit of trimming, leaving in such an ultimately superfluous sub-plot felt excessive and unnecessary.
As for scares, the wimps of this house thought there was still plenty here to be had, from Pennywise luring a little girl under the bleachers by empathising with her, to the corpse of Hockstetter crawling out from under Henry's bed, to Mrs. Kersch lunging out from her dark kitchen, to the Paul Bunyan statue and Pennywise taunting Richie, to those creepy baby hands attempting to drag Bill into the sewers, or Stan's head growing spider legs and crawling around like The Thing, to the warped baby creatures in the fortune cookies, to Richie's big speech getting abruptly cut short by the Dead Lights. There were plenty of scares here, and enough to stay seared in my brain for the next few days. That said I don't feel it ever lived up to the nightmare fuel of certain sequences in the first movie, and a couple of them were completely undercut by weird tonal choices, such as Eddie getting vomited on while Angel of the Morning plays over the top for a couple of seconds.In all I did enjoy IT: Chapter Two, even though I do feel it missed the mark on a couple of occasions and made a few weird choices (or choices that weren't weird enough in some cases). I'd love to see a full, integrated version of both movies together, spliced together with some of the filmed additional scenes that didn't make the cut, including Pennywise demanding tribute in the past. The first film is definitely the superior one, but that's because it had less to handle and was a more straightforward movie. Chapter Two deals with deep lore, throws in additional flashbacks, has a couple of superfluous sub-plots that draw the short end of the stick, and at just shy of three hours in length it still feels like there's more to it. I give IT: Chapter Two a solid 7/10.",It Chapter Two
150,baileycrawly,An Improvement On the First One,8,15 March 2020,"Going into It Chapter Two, I was fully expecting this movie to be awful.The adult portion of the story has notoriously been poorly portrayed. The adult half is easily the less compelling part of the book and the part of the miniseries where the story quickly begins to lose favor with the audiences.
Once again, this film does a good job of making an abridged version of a novel that wasn't all that great to begin with.The positives are much the same as the original one. I loved the efforts to go back to story elements of the first one to add things in that were left out of the original. It creates a nice little nod to the original and offers enough additional content to maintain interest and enrich the story. The way in which the side of the story in this film is portrayed was done successfully and interestingly, and the surplus runtime was sufficient enough to tell the story without making it feel cramped, rushed or diluted.Pennywise falls victim once again to the awful special effects that have a major diminishing effect on the final product. Bill is a fantastic actor who doesn't need digital enhancements. This film, however, is a little less of a disservice to him, offering him a bit more of an opportunity to act without hiding behind a computer generated artificial image.This is a movie not without its flaws, but it's by far more enjoyable than the first chapter with enough of substance to make it worthwhile to watch again. Still, the two movies together are more than sufficient. A supercut would be interesting but, beyond that, I'm hoping that this story stays where it is. Just like I said in the review for the first chapter, this is a story that works best when it's limited to the imaginations of the readers instead of diluted for film. Although I will always maintain IT to be among the weakest of King's novels, it would be foolish to not acknowledge the beloved status it holds among Constant Readers. The films will only have a diminishing effect on the books.
This was a solid entry in the King universe, but let's let it end with that.",It Chapter Two
151,sweidman-28016,A Step Down From the First But Enjoyable to Watch,7,16 September 2019,"IT Chapter 2 Review:Defeated by members of the Losers' Club, Pennywise returns 27 years later to terrorize of Derry once again. Now adults, the childhood friends have long since gone their separate ways. But when people start disappearing, Mike Hanlon calls the others home for one final stand. Damaged by scars from the past, the united Losers must conquer their deepest fears to destroy the shape-shifting Pennywise. I thought the first installment of this movie series was pretty good. It captured a good tone, had a compelling story, and interesting character dynamics. I don't know many people who were fans of the first that wasn't excited for the sequel. Chapter 2 was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Unlike most people, I had a hard time figuring out my thoughts on the movie. The first time I didn't really like it all that much. I thought it was mediocre. Then I saw it again a week later and I think I liked it. Then the next day I debated again and made pros and cons. In the end I think this is an enjoyable movie. The kids story is more interesting but I think this story is interesting as well. However the almost 3 hour runtime is about an hour way too long. So much unnecessary scenes were added. One aspect being flashbacks with the kids. They were mostly unnecessary. When the adults explore Derry alone, they encounter different places where they have a specific memory. I think that was a good idea because those were kind of more key elements. The big problem with the flashbacks was the CGI and voice editing. Since the kids have grown up a little more, their faces look a little different and some of their voices have changed. The CGI was just horrible to look at. Their faces were just filled with what I can only describe as over emotion. Sophia Lillis had the least amount of work done so she was pretty good. Their voices were even more high pitch than in the first and sometimes the audio was just sped up and overwhelming to hear. There was basically no emotion in the voices. Not their fault but more the editors. The acting was fine. Bill Hader had to be my favorite. He provided many funny jokes and actually put emotion towards his character. There's a character arc for him that's supposed to be a big deal but it wasn't too much of a big deal, at least how it came off. When it's first introduced the way it's presented felt off to me. Anyway I liked him the most. Personally I wanted Amy Adams to play adult Beverly but I thought Jessica Chastain did a pretty good job. And if Adams did play her she may have not gotten the opportunity to play her role in Sharp Objects with the best acting from her I've ever seen. Chastain had probably the most interesting character and she just made the most sense throughout the movie logically. Bill Skarsgård was good as Pennywise, I don't think as good as the first, but again is a great antagonist. I thought he showed up a little too much in this since the first actually didn't have him appear much, but that's just me. The rest of the actors were just fine. Nothing too great. Onto my biggest issues for the movie. Along with the first, this had an over reliance on CGI throughout. This more than the first. Everything was CGI'd and it just looked so fake where it was funny to look at. The end was just horrible with that. At least with the first they tried using makeup for some things. This was just all CGI. Speaking of it looking funny, I honestly think this is a horror-comedy. Every five minutes there was at least something funny said that made everyone laugh, this happens mostly with Bill Hader and James Ransone. Maybe if they took about half the jokes away I wouldn't think that but honestly this is a pretty funny movie at times. Nothing felt scary to me. There were only three jump scares that got me the second time I watched it. There's a little too many jump scares but I think it somewhat makes up for the horror aspect, though I personally don't like those. There are two things that I wish they would've changed to the plot. One involves Henry Bowers. He returns but honestly his character had no purpose. It did bring tension at times. Also I just didn't like the end. I think it was dumb and just funny to me. Based on how it ends, I'm wondering if the first movie could've just ended the whole thing if they continued using their method just a little longer. In the movie Bill is a writer and they keep bringing up one of his stories with a terrible ending. I personally believe that's kind of foreshadowing the end of the movie. Because I don't like leaving things on a bunch of cons here are some aspects I enjoyed. Benjamin Wallfisch's score is pretty good for a horror movie. I liked the first score and I think this one is just as good. The very very end of the movie I think was a really good way to end it. It's about the characters and it's just a good way to end it all. Also when all of the Losers' Club was together either having fun or just not panicking a whole lot about their situations, those were the strongest scenes. IT Chapter 2 isn't a bad movie in my opinion. It's just a step down from the first. Many people are divided and I understand why. Even though I find flaws throughout I do find myself enjoying the movie.My Grade: B-",It Chapter Two

This one doesn't live up to that one, but is still a pretty good follow up. The adult actors are pretty good comparisons to the kids, and I especially liked Bill Hader. There is a great cameo by Stephen King, poking fun at himself. I wish there were more scares. The best scenes in this and the first, are always when the kids are separated with Pennywise. Overall, the kid scenes are always more fun, as are the 80's.",It Chapter Two

The scare sequences are expertly and perfectly done albeit relying on CGI too heavily. The tone is more comedic than the previous chapter so overall I'd say that it wasn't quite as good. Be prepared for a long film though, it's almost as long as both parts of the 1990 original. The story can't sustain the length as it does stick to repeating the formula of showing each of the group their worst nightmare then they talk about stopping Pennywise and then back to their worst nightmare, again and again. Thankfully their worst nightmares are scary and perfectly executed. Not sure I get what Pennywise was doing and the final resolution was a bit weak and simplistic. Overall very enjoyable, excellent production.",It Chapter Two
156,donaldricco,Beep beep,7,14 December 2019,"Overall, I thought this was a good movie. I liked both casts, and I really liked how they went back and forth between the two. I felt like there were a lot of strong acting points, and strong scenes in general.
Where it didn't work for me was with the CGI ""monsters"". Many of them looked silly and slightly-humorous, as opposed to scary. And for me, that took a lot of the tenseness out of those scenes. The clown all on its own is scary enough, the other stuff paled in comparison.
Again, I did enjoy this film, but I think that scary guys in costumes beat special effects creations almost every time. Still, I'm gonna stay the hell outta Derry, for sure!",It Chapter Two

162,TwistedContent,Both Awesome and Underwhelming At The Same Time,8,10 September 2019,"This was without a doubt one of the years most anticipated horror movies for most people, including myself, a life-long lover of Stephen King and definitely a fan of the 2017's ""It"". While I did enjoy this, I'm not gonna lie, ""It: Chapter 2"" wasn't the movie I wanted it to be.I want to emphasize the hits of this movie before the misses, because they're quite strong. The first, a very sure hit, is the acting, pretty much all of the performances are mildly perfect - it was amazing to watch such a stellar cast working together (and also alone & apart, for at least half of the screen time...). Hader, McAvoy, Ransone, and, of course, Skarsgard are the absolute highlights. While the acting is top-notch, the character treatment is questionable. Specifically the treatment of Pennywise - there was less of him here than in the 1st part, and it also felt like he's much more ...unimportant. I think there was unused potential to give Bill more screen time to shine. Give him more substance. The next hit of ""It: Chapter 2"" is cinematography and FX. Sure, a lot of people (way too many actually) complain about the extensive use of cgi, but, in my humble opinion, it's the highest tier stuff, masterfully made and blended in with some practical FX and a truly crafty, imaginative cinematography. Another popular complaint is the pacing, here I beg to differ. It was not the pacing that bugged me, I felt like it went by at an even speed and there are quite a lot of shorter movies that have felt longer than this. What bugged me is what I consider this movies biggest miss - the script, the story. For me it seemed like the filmmakers aspired to put more in this than would actually work. ""It: Chapter 2"" made me confident in that the best way to adapt this novel is tv-series - 20 episodes, easily. The result of this script was a disjointed, choppy movie with a lot of scenes that felt unfinished and scenes that felt unnecessary or just plain confused. The most underwhelming moment (arguably) is the ending, or the climax. I don't usually give any spoilers, so I can only say that it was actually kinda lame. It's ironic that Stephen King often gets criticised for his endings & so does Bill's character (who's a writer) - Indeed the endings of both ""It"" and ""It: Chapter 2"" could be their weakest spots. Oh, and a nice bonus was a lengthy (for cameo standards) Stephen Kings cameo, the first cameo in a movie based on his writings since 1996's ""Thinner"".Thankfully, I liked the movie a lot more than I didn't, if that makes sense. The ingredients were there, the promise, the potential, the hype, but something didn't quite click and the result was an awesome romp of ups and downs, but awesome is what matters. I'd like to think that there was a true effort and love put into making this. My rating: 8/10.",It Chapter Two

At two hours fifty minutes, it could easily lose an hour's running time with little difficulty - a generic 'getting the gang back together' riff being one of the chief offenders. It drags so much, that by the time the final hour or so rolls around, I was just tired. It's a pretty diverting final hour, but it too is needlessly extended. With the talent around this movie, there's an interesting and potentially frightening take on childhood trauma and memory buried somewhere; but that movie is buried beneath the acres pointlessness.",It Chapter Two

167,Mike_Devine,Glad 'It' ended,4,26 July 2020,"2017's revival of Stephen King's classic 'It' had an undeniable impact on the horror genre, giving it a much-needed jolt at the end of a decade that was starting to run out of steam after a strong start. Last year's follow-up, 'It Chapter Two,' unfortunately could not carry the torch in a way it should have.The film brings together the Losers 27 years after the group put a stop to Pennywise in the small town of Derry, and clearly a lot has changed. With an unexpectedly strong cast featuring the likes of an Academy Award-nominated actress (Jessica Chastain), a proven funnyman (Bill Hader) and young Professor X himself (James McAvoy), among others, 'Chapter Two' has a lot going for it.Despite these familiar faces - and some newer ones that do a good job - 'Chapter Two' suffers from sequelitis in a big way. The nearly three-hour runtime is completely unnecessary and is an example of how a film can buckle under its own sense of grandeur. Many of the film's ""scary"" moments feel sillier than anything, as they come off as cheesy (how many buckets of fake blood must have gone into creating this?). And the uneven comedic references do not jive well with the overarching sinister vibe that we're supposed to get from it.Sure, there is a good amount of character development, and the bonds between the Losers are more important than any of Pennywise's antics they experience. But nothing feels authentic here - unfortunate given this script was based on the writings of King himself.The fact that 'It Chapter Two' marks the end of the saga is actually the best result for all involved.",It Chapter Two

I mean it should be impossible to screw such a concept!? Its a clown that can turn into your worst nightmares. I hope this is the Nail in the coffin for the director and that he gets fired.

Hader is superb in his role offering viewers enough of a comedic performance as much as a dramatic one. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are great, and Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is just as terrifying the second time around. ""It Chapter Two"" does feel long at some points, running close to three hours, the film needed to have its pacing arranged. Other than that, I enjoyed this sequel almost as much as Chapter One.

171,baunacholi-86159,Exceptional,9,30 September 2019,"I just watched IT1 (and reviewed with a 8/10) a couple of days ago to have the direct comparison now with chapter two. What I loved in particular on the 2nd part was the very dark atmosphere and some rather uncomfortable moments. Whereas IT1 felt partly as a movie made for teenagers IT2 was in every sense more grown up.
The opening sequence felt very raw and made the audience immediately clear what to expect in the upcoming 2,5 hrs (which btw was an appropriate time to tell the story in detail). Overall the flow and tension was nicely built with some amazing scenes (I will blow it away...1...2... you know which scene im referring back to!) also the labyrinth scene stood out so well as it was not only frightening but also showed the emotional aspect of the cast.
An aspects I didn't like at all (similar to the 1st part) have been the unnecessary use of jokes in the worst situations.
This said, pennywise, king, the cast delivered and created a strong movie experience with all the components a classic horror tale needs.",It Chapter Two
172,backup-50362,"Not perfect but still great in many ways, except writing",7,18 February 2020,"Right off the bat I'll say that some of the comic relief was off-place and terrible. Very few jokes landed. Most of the movie was dead air, reminiscing and ""preparing"" but really - nothing happened. This movie should've been an hour shorter. The script featured a whole lot of mess that we could've gone without. And the ending was cheesy and preachy. Also, was it really appropriate to have a guy dramatically cry for his just-died friend yet another guy and a girl decide to make out 2 seconds later just because 3 hours wasn't enough for you to space things out a bit? That was a baffling choice. If my friend just died dramatically and another friend was crumbling in tears the last thing on my mind would be making out in front of him with some chick who can't decide who she likes.BUT - all that doesn't mean the music, the occasionally hilarious yet still good CGI, the acting, the emotional moments weren't great, because they were. I appreciated all of this a lot. Bill Hader made me shed a tear! He was that good. Bill Something - the man who plays the clown - obviously way too young for this role when he's playing against people in their 40s and 50s. Even with an old man wig he was still too youthful. Not to say he didn't do a fantastic Pennywise again - he did. Just... his youthful face was less of an issue when he was scaring younger kids. Now he's scaring people over twice his age and even with the makeup you can tell he's much younger.It's so flawed yet so strong in many ways. Confused in it's writing - much like this review. But they both made their points. Definitely still a really fantastic movie, even with it's problems it's far beyond what else is there to watch.",It Chapter Two
173,eagandersongil,"No charisma, no soul and very nauseating.",5,23 September 2019,"""IT 2"" It's a troublesome film, young director Andy Muschietti tries to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, but ends up making a redundant, indirect, weak and boring movie, a work that tries to be too grand and gets lost in its own ostracism.
For starters, in terms of routers <(no spoilers)> the movie is different from the book and is not much longer than the range of its characters, it is almost 3 hours of film that is not developed in depth with any characters, and keep searching a comic flush that doesn't work with adult characters, or the movie further fails to develop Pennywise's story and gives yet another chance for a drama by creating couples, unnecessary scenes, silly cores and when to use after the clown and his History, a solution is silly and childish is qualified as overturned, and if you no longer have problems, we have a third act that is super gestured, leaving the long nauseating.Technically, the movie is good, but it has problems, or the CGI of movies, although average, works very well, but with the passing of the film and overuse of effects, gets louder and less scary, the same happens. As with the direction, the excesses of jumping are very scary, but they have a great mix and sound editing, good costumes and makeup, as well as a simple but good ambiance and art direction.The cast spends a lot of time excited as it happens in the first movie, the following remain for Bill Skarsgard and the smallest for James McAvoy and Bill Hader, although all play their part, some with less charisma like Jay Ryam, but they work.""It 1"" It was no masterpiece, but its surprise factor surprised everyone, mixing terror and humor, with charismatic characters and a plot involved, a direction that knew how to play with special effects and always use how to renew an act, in "" IT 2 ""We wait a little longer, but we have more of the same, and worse, we see that the most of the same doesn't work with a different cast and there is an update and an adaptation of the way of driving, besides a bad script, a continuation of Stphen King's classic - which has had his book changed a lot - is weak, lifeless, and tiring.",It Chapter Two
174,jamiedarlow-37510,'Time to sink!',7,22 June 2020,"Gloriously entertaining and deliciously macabre, the much anticipated follow up to the incredible reboot a couple of years ago has plenty of fun scenes, although it could do with a tighter edit. 27 years after the terrifying events in Derry, Pennywise has returned and the group of friends that went their seperate ways must reunite to face and defeat him. It's a truly great feeling when you're watching one of these sequences in which Pennywise manifests into a creepy old lady moving peculiarly in the background or bizarre creations lurking out of fortune cookies; the feeling that a dedicated film crew spent time making these grotesque beauties for horror fans to revel in is deeply enjoyable! Bill Skarsgard is naturally fantastic in his now iconic role as Pennywise the Clown; the tense encounter between him and a young girl towards the beginning is a nerve shreddingly and greatly comic example. All the cast are great and the visuals are really extraordinary in Pennywise's altering of the groups perceptions. There's no doubt that, clocking it at almost three hours, it is absolutely overlong and there are flashback sections which do not particularly add to the narrative, making it less rewatchable.

175,Cinema_Fan,"Wanna play a game of Tag, You're It?",7,15 September 2019,"Gary Dauberman, as Screenwriter, has done a tremendous job of reworking and revitalising Mr. King's novella of a very naughty clown that comes out to play once in every twenty-seven years. This, being the second instalment of a double-bill, with the first chapter being released in 2017, but, both here is an amalgamation of the exceedingly atmospheric television movie (1990) of the same name.It Chapter Two starts off twenty-seven years hence when our miniature heroes are fully grown-up and each having spread their collective wings and fled the roost that is small-town Derry, Maine, USA. Except one. The one, that is, recalling, reclaiming the flock to honour the oath that was once committed to each other twenty-seven years previously.It Chapter Two has the best of both worlds, a schism if you will, in this, we see, more than simply a telling of the horror genre. We see horror in many aspects here, as expected, but what is interesting is that we see, also, melodrama, nostalgia, responsibility, reflection, guilt and deeper, more concerning adult themes of forbidden love, bigotry, sexual phobia, sexual repression and suicide and all within a strong context of friendship, honour, loyalty that builds into a framework of parallel worlds of the horrifying Pennywise and the bonds that were the young children of twenty-seven years back to concatenating old memories and events from the middle-aged adults.What, too, exemplifies the charged atmosphere is the wonderful work from Checco Varese (cinematography) and all involved with Direction from Andy Muschietti to the many that gives here a more than spellbinding array of visual delight and astonishment. This is simply a gripping visual display of imagination and fortitude bringing together good & evil within one single conceptual chef-d'oeuvre.With the illustrious Mr. Hader, the charismatic Mr. McAvoy to the distinguished Ms. Chastain at the forefront there is a significantly strong cast that bounces off each other projecting charisma that gives the film a wider sense of personality that examines the element of both youthful and older cast together. While we see the charm of Mr. Skarsgård and his goading of the main players, it is all here, and their respective parts that are more than the foundations holding this piece together.It Chapter Two is no circus.

176,Med-Jasta,Same problems as the first...,5,23 May 2021,"In the first movie the threat was extinguished very early on. Because when It attacked the kids for the 4th time and nothing happened I realized that he couldn't touch them. And those first few times were cool and scary looking. But I figured it out and the fear went away. And for some reason these movies treat every scare like it's the first scare.They continue this style into this movie. And as grown-ups they know how Pennywise works but they get scared every single time? And the flashbacks didn't need to be so long. These were all treated as a scary scene but they were flashbacks! We knew what was going to happen!These are very well made movies and the kids were great and everything. But it was way too long and there were too many characters. Now I know what you're going to say, ""Well that's how it is in the book."" Well I got news for you. This isn't a book. It's a movie. And it was way too long and there were too many characters.I think the problem with making two movies is that they wanted to draw more from the book. And I think we all know that when it comes to Stephen King this isn't always a good thing. He's a great writer. He's got good stories. But this doesn't always carry over to movies. He can go off on 100 page side stories. Or have you follow a bunny around. He feels no sense of time. And as this movie pointed out: his endings suck. I should know. I read The Dark Tower series.I've always looked at his books as unfinished. They are raw idea that needs to be chiseled into something else. The best movies know how to do this effectively. But King has no filter. And that's why you shouldn't adapt it so accurately.And in all honesty, the original movie was way better. The story was condensed to just the plot and was actually scary. And it was made for TV in the 80s. I rewatched it after seeing these since I hadn't seen it in forever. And I was surprised at how effective it was. And the thing that got me the most: Pennywise. Tim Curry was super scary. The new version looks scary but he doesn't act it. Curry didn't look scar but acted it.I don't normally write reviews based off of what other people said but in this case I am. Because their views reflected mine but seemed to have a inaccurate take on their reasons. Because every problem they talked about was there in the first one. I don't know if it took them this long to realize it. Or if people were just caught up in the hype of the first. But it didn't seem fair to blame this movie exclusively. Like this movie really dropped the ball or something.So many people blame the CG for not being scary? It's what I said before. The thrill/threat wears off because of the over use of it. It's not because it's computer generated. It's because the director thinks you'll be scared by the same method and tricks every single time.It was very nice to see one of the kids wearing a Thundercats shirt. I feel like Thundercats has been grossly under represented in this 80s nostalgia boom.",It Chapter Two
177,DeBBss,It's Alright,6,26 May 2020,"Living up to It (2017) is a difficult task to do, but I really can't fault the creators for It Chapter Two not being as good as the first. It Chapter Two tries too hard to be as good as the first that it copies everything about the first. The camera tricks and chase scenes are literally a copy and paste. They should have done some new things to make It Chapter Two feel more like a sequel and not a remake. The best sequels of all time added something new, like Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.The plot brings back all of the characters, except for Stanley. The plot contains a lot of subplots; a little too much in fact. I'm surprised that they were able to make It Chapter Two 2h 50min, which sounds long, but there was a lot to unravel in this new plot. What It Chapter Two suffers from is the choppy pacing. Luckily, the pacing wasn't too choppy enough to make the film lose it's intensity.What I disliked the most was the characters. None of the new versions of the Loser's Club were likable, except for Mike. It Chapter Two focuses a lot on the characters' quests rather than the actual characters. They gave a bunch of exposition about the Losers after beating Pennywise when they were younger, but little exposition about their new current lives. Because of the lack of exposition given to the current losers, they weren't even comparable to their younger versions from the original. Also, the acting was way worse for some reason. These new actors are adult professionals, but they gave worse performances than their younger counterparts. I hated Bill Hader's performance of Richie, he made Richie seem like a jerk who cracks stupid jokes all the time. Finn Wolfhard did a way better job with the character, he made Richie goofy and likable.The good part was the use of CGI. The CGI created a lot of cool imagery that seemed like illusions. Because of the CGI, it really made It Chapter Two feel like an It movie. There was a little too much CGI being used to create the monsters, but I guess it's just personal preference whether you like it or not. But for some reason, the scenes that were supposed to be intense, didn't really feel that intense.I really liked It (2017), but It Chapter Two really failed on almost every level. None of the characters were likable; almost unlikable. There was too much subplots, even though it was necessary for the story. Because of all of the subplots, there was little exposition given to the new versions of the characters. It Chapter Two also suffers from a subpar screenplay and terrible acting.

179,DuskShadow,NOt as good as the first of the NEw Revisions,6,22 February 2020,"The remake of IT was looked forward to for a good two years at least. ANd upon seeing it, I was most glad. IT was scary, fun, and dark and adventurous. It also cam out at a time when the 1980s vibes had sickeningly reemerged for the 2010 decade like a bad joke. BUt it was a solid 8 outta 10.
The originals were not scary, at least not to me. ANd I saw them on TV and vhs when I was not even 8 years old. Some people are just tougher I suppose. BUt I always loved the work of TIm Curry, and he should have at least had a cameo in one of the remake films.
This being a review of the remade sequel, I should be saying if it was great or terrible, but it was just okay to fairly goo. I give this film a 6 out of 10 because it brought back too much former imagery and scenes from the first remake film. IT also was waaaaay too light with the forced jokes by Bill Hader, and often ruined the mood more than the original IT back in the day did.
NOt fully answering questions about the whole darn thing was another let down, and even with almost 3 hours and pushed as close to the end with a short 5 minutes of credits, the film just lacked alot.
BUt kids these days are easily scarred or intimidated, maybe many people regardless of age are. At the least IT Chapter Two provides a good amount of distraction. At most, it finally completes one of Stephen King's master works of literary and imaginative horror. Cause a lot of his other stuff nowadays aint doing so well.

180,x_manicure_x,Special effects rollercoaster,2,14 August 2021,"I was reading how the bigger budget and the success of the first movie had a positive impact on the production of Chapter Two, but I guess they were simply making fun of us. What were they thinking?Stellar casting and fancy references aside, this film lacks too much substance even for a horror popcorn blockbuster. It's essentially a tired rollercoaster ride where parades of visually embarrassing CGI jumpscares alternate themselves with cringe-worthy comedy situations and forcefully quirky lines. There were a couple of scenes that worked, but not enough to keep the whole movie ""afloat"".Despite the close to three-hour runtime, the movie gets no chance to elaborate on anything or tell a single story. They waste more than half of the time on solo scenes where the characters search for their memories and have a quick flashback followed by a mandatory jumpscare. The memories they retrieve were mostly things we extensively saw in the previous movie, if not something random with close to zero impact on the story. If the intention were to help us to remember all characters and prior events, a short montage would have been more than enough.The rest is just one extra visit to It's lair for one more battle that pretty much mirrors the one from the first movie with older actors (but same flicks). The Losers have zero emotional development, Henry Bowers' contribution is just a useless embellishment. The story behind It's true essence is confusing and contradicting. It's supposed to be a superior being able to do amazing things, take any form, control populations, but prefers to play dumb in a clown costume. As the characters got 27 years older, it could have been a chance to deal with more profound and complex fears, but the general tone is so clumsy and juvenile that it looks like a kids adventure Netflix show a la ""Stranger Things"".",It Chapter Two
181,OMTR,It Two Chapters (2017-2019): Best Stephen King's adapted movie with The Shining,8,21 September 2019,"A superb film, emotionally rich, intellectually deep, which is the best adaptation of a Stephen King's novel along with The Shining.",It Chapter Two
182,aarongnr,The entire idea of the screenplay is very weak,6,11 September 2019,"I don't know if the book has the same type of story but I'll just ignore that and only talk about the movie.The premise of this film was awesome: A group of ex-friends come together 27 years after they first met ""Pennywise"" to finally kill that clown.But: What happens is this: A group of ex-friends come together to then split up and go on a solo mission to remember what happened in the first film because they've magically lost their memory of it. Oh, and then they kill that clown.The entire movie was a wasted opportunity. Instead of giving us a new story, they give us a few jump-scares combined with revelling in memories. And the big problem is: There are WAY too many characters to do that. The film gives us atleast 5 minute segments of ""I-need-to-find-this-metaphorical-artifact-and-regain-my-future"" for each and every character (except Mike), which are all basically the same. The character remembers something, then a jumpscare, more remembering and another jumpscare. But as a viewer, after the first one, you know that absolutely nothing is gonna happen, because to them.And then there is this whole ""We-need-to-do-this-magical-ritual-to-capture-Pennywise-in-this-box"" thing. When I saw this I thought: ""Oh know, that's so stupid and doesn't go along witg the tone of the movies at all."" And then near the end we find out, that its been a lie, and I was relieved... only to realize that this stupid ritual thing nearly ruined half the movie for me because they kept talking about it and I kept thinking that its absolutely stupid.
There's one thing I didn't really get: Was the ritual thing real magic, but it just didn't work? (Cause Billie had the visions and all)... whatever, who cares? After all, it had nothing to do with how they eventually defeat him.Whiiiich brings me to the greatest negatives of all: The ending/the defeat of the clown.
They defeat him by calling him weak and scared and small and a clown? Really? That's some outburst of creativity right there. It's one of the most stupid, half predictable (because we saw glimpses of this in the first movie), and anticlimactic ways to end a movie like this. Horrible.It's funny how they keep making jokes about how Billy's books endings are so bad, when the really bad ending is the one of the movie itsself.Now, there are positive things to say about this movie:the production value is greatthe movie is (for the most part) quite engertainingthe dialogue is really funny at times (which is good, cause it has to compensate for the fact that the movie isn't scary AT ALL)the acting is quite fabulousvfx, music and cinematography are top notchThat's it, had to say this :D If you came this far, thanks for reading.PS: the movie was worth the 4euroes I paid for the ticket!",It Chapter Two

director: Andy muschietti
starring: James Macavoy,Jessica Chastain,Bill Skarsgård,Bill Hader,Isaiah Mustafa,Jay Ryan,James Ransone,Andy Bean,Teach Grant etcoverall rating 62/100for 27 years the losers club have found new lives outside of Derry. But when Pennywise returns the gang must stay true to there blood oath to each other and try to defeat pennywise once and for all. It chapter 2 was unfortunately a big disappointment for me it had its good moments for sure but i was left feeling underwhelmed lets talk about this.But first lets start off with some positives. The film had a much more tense tone,was more scary and had better executed jumpscares. This film did a better job at keeping you at the edge of your seat and executing many more jumpscares. This was due to pennywise and more monsters being involved so therefore there was more time to fit jumpscares and more scenes to drag out so you cant expect when the scare is going to happen. And in general i think the film was much more scary then the first. They went pure horror for this film and this part worked there was a lot more scary situations and creatures and pennywise was 100% more ruthless and scary then the first IT.Adding on from the previous point about pennywise ( Bill Skarsgard) the film was a lot more gory. I loved this as it left more of a impact with a lot more scenes. To see the more ruthless and aggressive side to pennywise was done well here as it made him more feared as a character as he was fairly tame in the first film compared to this so i am glad they went all out for this. As it genuinely shocked me with the amount of people he killed.However i know have to say that the film had very slow pacing in places. Unlike previous 3 hour films like avengers endgame which had enough plot to justify its run time IT chapter 2 did not. The film felt like 3 hours and really dragged in places. There was at least 30-45 minutes that could of been cut from the film to make it more of a well put together film. I just feel like they deliberately dragged scenes out that didn't need to in order to make the film as long as possible.Next i think the film had much darker themes and had good LGBT representation. Now the film tackled homophobia in the most brutal but most appropriate way. Seeing how horribly they were treated is the harsh reality of what still happens in todays society which is really sad so i am glad they raised awareness of this. And also having children being eaten was a lot more shocking to see due to there innocence and film tackled sexuality and abuse very well as well.Next i have to say that some of the use of flashbacks were badly done. I think the use of flashbacks was overused slightly leading to the pacing and narrative being slightly clunky. And the de aging on some of the kids looked terrible. Obviously its been 2 years since the first film and the actors probably look a lot different, But you could really tell especially with younger Ritchie that there face had been heavily edited and for me it was very distracting.Next i thought the film had really creative set pieces and mise en scene but also good character arcs for the older versions of the losers club. Due to the films budget being double what the first one was they really went more creative with there set pieces and designs and got really creative with baloons and incorporated clowns into things you wouldn't think they would so props for creativity for sure. And also i loved how they took the time to explain the characters older counterparts and where they ended up and giving them good character arcs. The film went into good enough detail about what all of the losers have been doing the 27 years apart and all of there characters got good amount of screentime to explain there story through some good uses of flashbacks.Next the film had a good amount of emotional weight and the acting from Bill Skarsgård was just fantastic. The film tackled mental health really well and to see stanley take his own life was admittedly difficult to watch. And to see Beverly in the same kind of abusive household was also upsetting to see. But the best part of the film would definitely be when Eddie sacrificed himself for Richie. There had been a teased romance between them both for a large majority of the film especially from Richies side. So to see Eddie sacrifice himself when he had previously been to scared to save anyone was a truly powerful and emotional part of the film. And next Bill skarsgård as expected was absolutely fantastic throughout the whole film. The fact that someone can pull off and execute such a disturbing and unsettling performance like he does is truly remarkable and he really should be rewarded with this kind of demanding role.However i have to say the film was very confusing when it came to explain pennywises origin and backstory and also Henry Bowers was a terrible character. The film never went into enough detail about how pennywise came to be which was a massive shame so when it came to the actual ritual to try and defeat pennywise first of all i didn't know what was going on and second it didn't even work so it was a completely pointless build up to the final act. Next Henry Bowers was a terrible character. He went to prison and clearly went insane but when he escaped he just tried to kill all the losers for no apparant reason apart from a past grudge i think they just wasted his character.Now for my final two positives first the film was absolutely hilarious. All the actors had great comedic chemistry with each other but i would have to say that Bill hader was absolutely hilarious. His one liners were hilarious the jokes he pulled on the other characters were brilliant, and he always found a way to find a situation funny. And next the overall cast for the older characters was literally perfect. Every single actor had the same characteristics and mannerisms as the younger versions they all even looked like them. And the best part was they all had the same chemistry as the kids had so this definitely kept the film going for sure.However now for my final two negatives. I thought the film got very repetitive. They used mostly the same fears for all of the adult versions and the film just repeated itself the characters all went to a place from when they were kids had a flashback and then found there token this happened so many times it just all was the same. The film was just to similar to the first one which was a big shame as they had the potential to do something different as we saw with the fairground which was great. And finally the ending was terrible. Everything just got to ridiculous at the end. Pennywise turned into a giant spider which was a stupid idea and the way they killed him was just underwhelming and made him seem easily beatable. This was a really big shame as it left me feeling worse about the film as a whole.Overall It chapter 2 is just about held together by its cast,acting,humour and set locations. But largely is a big disappointment and is far worse then the 1st film. They went for style over substance which further proves bigger is sometimes not better.",It Chapter Two
184,gavinp9,"Better than the 1990 version, not quite as good as the 2017 one",6,5 September 2019,"'It: Chapter Two' is the sequel to 'It' from only two years ago, but this is now the prophesized ""27 years later"", with Pennywise (Skarsgard) back to wreak havoc on Derry. The seven teens from 'It' come home as adults to fulfill their oath of stopping Pennywise. This time, they're: Bev (Chastain), Bill (McAvoy), Richie (Hader), Ben (Ryan), Mike (Mustafa), Eddie (Ransone) & Stanley (Bean). Don't worry - there's plenty of flashbacks so you can recall who's who.Thankfully, there's some humour, thanks to Hader and Ransone, but the others seem to kind of coast through - no one's bad in this, but no one stands out either. Unfortunately, for a film based around his psycho-killer-clown, Pennywise has very little screen time until the final 30min and you kind of forget what his motivation is. Being released so close to the first one, not sure we need so many prompts/reminders. That's the main problem with the film - it's almost an hour too long at 2 hours 50 minutes.The second act where they have to each get a totem could've been done in a 10min montage, not a 45min drawn-out mini-mission for each character. There's a few good CGI bits, some jumps, some gross moments, but nothing truly terrifying. Still, wouldn't want to be watching this is I was under 12. Considering how tongue-in-cheek the film is with it's references to Stephen King and crappy endings, I'm not sure if the ridiculous ending is supposed to be meta, or is just poor.",It Chapter Two
185,thebricks,Could not believe how obnoxiously racist the script was,1,11 September 2019,"I wanted to walk out but I took my mother who loved the first one and my dad tagged along. I could not believe how racist this movie was! In the first film, most of the kids were pretty much solidly middle or lower class. They were grounded. In this movie, all of the white members of the Losers do not just have good jobs, they are wealthy!!! Like, they are all white collar professionals who are likely millionaires, if not billionaires like Ben! Mike, the African-American, is the only one that is unemployed, driving a clunker from the eighties and possibly squatting in a building. What is up with that???!!! I've never seen a more ridiculous display of a microaggression by the writers in a movie in my life. In 2019, no less! I do believe the maliciousness was intentional, especially the contrast between all the vehicles the characters drive at different points in the story. How can you feel any sympathy for the characters when the writer constantly puts their white supremacist beliefs on display, using Mike as their punching bag? I mean, it's not even like some of them have normal, everyday jobs and like a couple are really successful. Mike is the odd one out. His present occupation is never discussed, he was like an outcast at the Chinese restaurant. The contrast between them is stark, glaring and not even acknowledged or explained somehow. The way such a likable character from the first movie was treated is so malicious, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, almost like they are treating the character like a voodoo doll. Something about Mike's depiction just rubbed me the wrong way; so much so that I knew it wasn't just a part of the story, it was an angry, racist writer taking out their issues against minorities. Speaking of contrasts, at the end, Mike is shown driving away from Derry to Florida in his eighties beater, shortly contrasted with a scene of Beverly and Ben living the life on a gigantic, expensive yacht. None of Mike's so-called friends would even chip in to help the guy buy a $5,000 Toyota for his drive and new life in Florida.Whoever wrote this movie really wanted us to know they didn't like Mike for some reason. The message has been received loud and clear dude!As for the actual movie, it was garbage. There was too much Pennywise and I felt at times that I was watching a videogame. Some people claim that there was a need for Part Two. It is what I thought it was all along, an unnecessary sequel. The first movie was fine on its own. This was trash in every way. I really wish someone would call it out but no one is brave enough to, apparently. Lke someone mentioned, it's absolutely redundant, the same film with adults and a less coherent plot. I will not recommend. Worst movie I've seen in a long, long time.",It Chapter Two

Only Mike continues to live in Derry and remembers everything. 27 years thence, Mike calls up the other six to return to Derry as they promised in their childhood, as Pennywise has now made his appearance again and struck devastation.He is terrifying to start with and every encounter of his appearance is startling. Bill Skarsgard continues his impressive and flawless delivery of the role of the tormentor posing greater danger and infusing uninhibited fear among his challengers this time. It's a fight to the finish as the protagonists deal with their individual fears, recounting the childhood events and promise to stick together to banish Pennywise for good.This is the final installment of Stephen King's novel, thus holding out an unprecedented frenzy and expectation. Chapter 2 unfortunately turns into a repetitive storytelling by replaying scenes from the first part and showcasing Pennywise's encounters with each of his challengers in a quirky way. Its elicits some shrieks and squeals for sure, but enhances its dalliance with an unnecessary overdose of blood and gore. The climax is too long to endure actually, undermining the thrill and fear elements. With a running time of 170 minutes, IT Chapter 2 does get a bit monotonous, stretching our patience. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are impressive, but no match to play foil to Skarsgard's Pennywise menace.

191,mgd_m,No,2,10 September 2019,"The direction is heavily off target, and mostly the script also is. There's too much exposition, the plot is constanly forced, many scenes are rushed so that they never build a true atmosphere.There's an awfully amateurish use of music, with scary sounds inserted in every wanna-be thrilling moment, but in this way you're warned every time and you don't get scared. Also, many scenes have an ""adventure"" soundtrack that really doesn't fit anything. I don't know about this Muschietti, but he seems very millennial.The story is a collage of scenes with no climax. Also, there's no real plot: as I suspected, the present day story told independently from the childhood setting is not enough for a movie.Pennywise is non-scary, as he was in the first chapter. He's just obnoxious, but not scary or evil.
The squirming monsters are silly as usual.McAvoy and Chastain are totally wasted.The ending is unsatisfying.This movie is a huge disaster, and it's 60 minutes longer than it should.Ps: ""Be who you want to be"" while Ritchie carves his name along Eddie's name... fed up with this repulsive, omnipresent, passive propaganda.",It Chapter Two
192,jakethesnake-42007,A struggle,4,20 October 2021,It was a struggle to like this film and get through it. The story is the flaw it drags on and the way it's done is confusing at times too. The acting is good but it just isn't that good.,It Chapter Two
193,deepfrieddodo,Sinks Below Chapter One,6,2 November 2021,"A pretty good continuation, but IT Chapter Two definitely does not float to the same heights as it's predecessor. This is by no means the fault of the cast; casting seems fairly perfect as the actors reflect their younger versions well, and the acting cannot be faulted. Featuring frequently, it is still the 'child' actors who are the more impressive though, the transition is fairly seamless.The big issue, though, is that the sequel is not scary. It can make you jump at times, tension is certainly built often, but things get very predictable and (ironically) no fear is created. A large part of this may be due to the utter reliance upon special effects, which aren't bad, but don't appear to fit within the atmosphere. Moreover, scenes in the previous film which inspired fear did so because the situation was genuinely scary, for this one everything was just gross. It was almost as if the audience weren't meant to be scared, just disgusted.The plot, which follows the book relatively closely, is okay but again not as strong as it's predecessor. Things take a daft turn at times, and at others can shoehorn in some Hollywood cliches. There is certainly an added humour with Hader on board, and the chemistry between the Losers works well, but maybe that's not much of a plus in a horror film.It's a good enough film, other than the special effects it's visually impressive, but overall a bit disappointing after the heights of IT Chapter One.",It Chapter Two
194,CountJonnie,How did Pennywise become a minor character???,5,27 December 2019,"There you go. So much expectations, because chapter one somehow made Pennywise a more interesting character, and the movie more scary than the original. But chapter two didn't live up to it.Chapter two picks up where the ""adult"" part begins, in a race to the final battle with Pennywise. But chapter two made the fatal mistake of having zero character development, and becoming nothing more than a series of failed attempts to scare the viewer.The acting was less, the story was gone, the CGI was poor and Pennywise himself was completely uninteresting. People refuse to learn that chemistry is more important than flat scare effects. The child actors captured that chemistry. The adults didn't. The only other thing to do, was to focus more on Pennywise, which the book did. But that didn't happen here either. What's left is a hollow movie, that started promising, end ended like most sequels..... flat and boring.",It Chapter Two
195,WalkdenEntertainment,The Battle We Have Been Waiting For!,7,6 March 2020,"Set 27 years after their first encounter against the evil clown known as ""Pennywise"" the Losers Club are now adults and come together after they receive some devastating news. The characters also deal with their own horror and dark pasts once again.As a sequel, IT Chapter Two has a significant runtime (almost 3 hours). This runtime is primary used for two things: horror scare attempts and to showcase a further developed plot.The horror aspect of IT Chapter Two tries to go up a notch compared to the previous instalment. From the start of the film, horror fans will have plenty to enjoy, but personally I found this film weaker in the scare and horror department. It also feels that Pennywise is used less to scare the audiences and at multiple times the film relies on CGI characters and monsters to frighten. These just don't frighten nor scare like the previous film which focuses more on Pennywise.As far as the performance go, the standouts from the grown up Losers Club were easily James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain & Bill Hader, who not only delivered a stunning performance, but were rather convincing at portraying the adult versions of their characters from the previous film. The casting choices were great and easily the highest point of the film and what shines the most. Bill Skarsgard was once again brilliant as the evil clown, Pennywise, with zero complaints.As for plot, for me this film is not as solid as the previous film, in particularly the film's 2nd and 3rd act which does ultimately drag on from time to time. It also feels that the film struggles with its ending but ultimately it's the film's plot that hurts the film in my opinion with added side mission and flashbacks for all the key characters. Without giving you spoilers, this is all I'm going to say.Overall, IT Chapter Two remains an entertaining horror film but it is a weaker sequel in regards to the film's story, plot and final act. Despite the lengthy runtime, there's still plenty for fans to enjoy. Leading performances are also positive. It's still a worthy sequel even if it is slightly weaker than the 1st instalment. 6.8/10 - Walkden Entertainment",It Chapter Two

This series has put the level of Horror at the sky thanks to it's big budget otherwise many horror movies just depends on there tune and makeup but this series showed us the real fear that is above ghosts.But the truth that no one can ignore is The first chapter was the most scary movie of all time and I don't think any film would be able to dethrone it because of It's ending where every character found their strength in their own imagination.",It Chapter Two

have grown up and have all gone their own way. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) is the only member of the Losers Club who still lives in the town of Derry. When he learns that children are missing again, he decides to investigate. He learns that the evil clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) is back in Derry. He informs the rest of the club and asks them to come back to Derry.
If the Loser Club again
meets, Mike must convince the club to destroy Pennywise once and for all. Because many of the club Pennywise and his dark actions from their past would rather forget, they think they better leave Derry. Mike and the members who want to take on Pennywise must now convince the rest of them to fight their childhood traumas and thus protect Derry's children from Pennywise.The film adaptation of the first part was a film that lasted about two hours and fifteen minutes. The playing time of this second part is almost three hours and you can unfortunately feel this time as a viewer. This is due to the lengthy pace of the film, which makes the film appear rather boring and unclear instead of scary or exciting. The lack of clarity is due to missed explanations about certain things. These things are better explained in the book and the mini series. If you are not familiar with one of these versions, you will be left with unanswered questions. For people who are more familiar with horror films, the scary moments in the film can also seem a little predictable.
In the first part, director Andy Muschietti also tried to respond more to the fears of children, but in the second part he tries to respond more to the fears of adults. Both films, for example, play into how fear can change in life as you get older.In this film, they also used more effects to bring out the scary creatures in the film. They have made more use of this compared to the first film. Unfortunately, it can often be seen that these creatures have been placed in the film with CGI, which means that they do not always come across as realistic and therefore do not always work well to scare you as a viewer. Bill Skarsgård is also less common in this film than Pennywise. In the first film and also in the mini series, Pennywise was more the form that the It took form. Because this was then an actor in a costume, it seemed credible and scary for viewers.
They also asked the young cast of the first part to make new scenes for this second part. The actors have become older since 2017 and are physically changing. With effects, they have been able to rejuvenate the young cast so that they look the same as they did in 2017. You can see this in light scenes, which due to these effects some of the cast have a distinct glow around them, which can sometimes come over as being separate or distracted.The best thing about this film is the casting, because the older and younger versions of the same characters from both films look the same with their looks and personality. Just like the young cast, the old cast has a good chemistry with each other as a group of friends. Every actor comes across well in this second part. Just like Finn Wolfhard, Bill Hader comes out best in the film with his comic moments and remarks.",It Chapter Two

Hader's was cursory but his fight was in the present day. The other two already had theirs and the fight was in flashbacks that had nothing to do with obtaining anything.Seemed to veer away from the rules they set up in favor of more visuals and the fight at the end had elements that looked pulled out of the filmmakers' asses when they were stuck.They knew that denying the threats were real would destroy the threats, but decided to repeatedly ignore them.Making fun of King's history of poor endings in his books was funny. The reference to John Carpenter's The Thing was good. And I assume the pomeranian behind the door was an ode to The Holy Grail's rabbit scene.The town was very sedate vs. the bloodshed going on. A town that small would be in panic mode and would be flooded with news outlets.For its length, they could have worked a bit more on the cursory character arcs for all six. I know it's time consuming, but it sure was long to begin with. Could have swapped that with other things.What happened to the ghoul driving the Trans Am? If Henry took a knife to the heart and lived, why didn't he survive an axe to the head? Pennywise was an alien with supernatural powers? He fed on fear? But the little girl under the bleachers was not in fear. Pennywise was vulnerable to intense bullying?It was entertaining and, although long, didn't really drag.",It Chapter Two

206,doorsscorpywag,The 1990 TV Mini-Series was far better and scarier.,3,21 November 2019,"This film is not a horror film. It's 'Stand By Me' with extra swearing.Far too much swearing especially from the kids in both 1 & 2. Did the writer think this was somehow cool? I have sworn most of my life and swore as a pre-teen but not every other word.The film makers made a point as to how much blood the film had in it as if that made it terrifying.but neither 1 or 2 was that scary and this one barely raised a scare once. And far better films have made use of tidal waves of blood.
A horror film should frighten the viewer. The clue is in the name. 1 was just about OK but 2 was not remotely scary at all.The acting was pretty poor and there was no decent development of the characters in the whole 5 hours of It. They started off pretty cardboard and ended completely cardboard. Bill Skarsgård failed miserably as Pennywise.The whole thing could have been wrapped up in two 90 minute chapters. Instead we had the interminable 'quest' section which was a waste of time and brought nothing to the plot eventually being discarded and pointless.The final battle was a bit boring and none of characters evoked any kind of empathy.
The final couple of minutes was absolute rubbish and an insult to the book and 1990 mini series. The whole motivation of the Stan character throughout the entire first part was dumped for some cheesy feel good tripe.The book was pretty decent and one of Kings better efforts and the 90 TV series did well without littering the scenery with endless swearing.Overall 1 & 2 were a very disappointing 5 hours worth of very poor storytelling.",It Chapter Two
207,zac-04879,"Unexpectedly Lacks Terror, But is a Fun Sequel",7,10 August 2021,"It comes as an enormous surprise that Chapter Two is nowhere near as terrifying as 2017's It, but also adds some hysterical comedy and mixes it with the engaging characters, loads of blood and satisfying conclusion. Understandably though, this sequel will approach to several fans as a seriously disappointing and foolish let-down.It Chapter Two was actually a pretty entertaining movie, but what's fairly reasonable about the amount of disappointment is the sense of horror, humour and length. This sequel obviously doesn't live up to the original. Despite the charming sense of humour, the terror-level's going straight down. There's jump-scares and bloody clown kills, but other than mild tension, that's all the scariness throughout the film. The first film managed to be terrifying and contained a tiny sense of humour, but the humour here completely overtakes the horror. The pace is really decent, but the nearly-3-hours runtime is ridiculously unnecessary. It should've been fast, and the climax didn't need to be so prolonged!Thankfully, the cast and characters are able to save the only-mild horror themes. Again, the pacing is great and the story will likely entertain you. In the end, It Chapter Two could've been quicker and scarier, but still impressed us with the comedy and characters.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",It Chapter Two

210,Aly200,"A decent conclusion, but lacking the magic of the first half",7,20 September 2019,"After two years of waiting we finally got the concluding chapter of Andy Muschietti's remake of the Stephen King novel 'IT'. While mostly executed well like its first half, the magic wasn't quite captured for the ending of our beloved Loser's Club and their defeat of the titular entity. I shall try to avoid major spoilers for those who wish to read the novel or watch the movie.Brief summary of the plot (easy to get from the trailers): 27 years after defeating the entity known as IT, the adult Losers must return to Derry when IT comes back seeking new victims and revenge on the adults Losers.For our adult cast, Muschietti assembled a top-notch cast including James McAvoy as Bill Denborough, Jessica Chastain as Beverly Marsh, Bill Hader as Richie Tozer, Jay Ryan as Ben Hanscom, Isaiah Mustafa as Mike Hanlon, and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak. Bill Hader is easily the standout as Richie, the foul-mouthed comedian of the batch which is perfect for the Saturday Night Live alumni. Hader is able to balance the dark humor with his dramatic chops that he acquired from ""The Skeleton Twins"" and his Emmy winning role on HBO's ""Barry"" and his facial gymnastics are silly, but purposeful. His comedic chemistry with James Ransone is touching and funny at the same time especially when the climax arrives and you feel for Richie.Returning as our scary clown is the ever creepy Bill Skarsgard in a much more toned-down (for the most part) Pennywise. While more cartoonishly creepy like his predecessor, Tim Curry, in the first chapter (which annoyed me a bit), Skarsgard is able to be in his element in the second part. The actor goes much more manipulative in this movie to get his victims (particularly in one sequence under some bleachers) which is a welcome change to spouting some of Tim Curry's original dialogue. The only downside is the climax for the Swedish actor, but it's more the fault of the visual effects team and writing. However it doesn't quite diminish the step-up for the performance.While the first chapter employed practical effects with some CGI, the team unfortunately went overboard with the CGI here. Thankfully Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise and the excellent Javier Botet get the majority of the practical work (considering Botet is the alternate Doug Jones for creepy monsters like Mama). I was laughing at the CGI particularly for one of Pennywise's young victims as the CGI jaw is so in your face and blatant which isn't the only ridiculous moment as you will see in the climactic showdown.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman returns to pen the script after his first directorial debut earlier in the summer with the third ""Annabelle"" movie. However you can tell that his writing isn't as strong as the first film specifically with the so-so chemistry between the adult Losers. As pointed out earlier, the strongest bond of the group is Richie and Eddie while the triangle between Beverly, Bill and Ben is ignored a little more than the novel and rushed through. Having a longer runtime (almost 3 hours long) also packed in too much material that could've been trimmed out of the script (not really blaming Dauberman for that as that is more on Muschietti and the editor). Don't let this detract you though and try to enjoy the remaining time with our characters.Do give this film a chance particularly if you enjoyed the first movie and the novel, but lower your expectations to a reasonable level. It's always a challenge to follow a successful first half, but it's not a terrible film just not great.",It Chapter Two
211,martinrobertson300482,Disappointing,4,25 September 2019,"The First ""It"" was how you remake a movie. It redid what worked in the 90's version and reinvented what didn't. Chapter 2 was always going to be harder to pull off and it simply doesn't succeed.After a promising start the movie simply plays it safe by doing alot of the same stuff over again. Apart from a couple of moments the film just isn't that scary, there are way to many call backs, and so much filler you wonder how the 3 hour running time here was ever justified. There is a good attempt at adding humour but that's also waring thin in the last hour, and I'd completely lost interest by the nonsensical finale.Really disappointing.

214,bastos,Worthy conclusion,7,25 July 2020,"I am a huge fan of Chapter One, ranking it amongst the best horror movies of the decade, but I was a bit cautious about Chapter Two as its source material is not as good. The adult portion is not as interesting as the children portion, not in the book, not in the mini series and unfortunately not in this movie, and I was amazed when I learnt the running time, how could they make it work for so long. Fortunately the running time is not a problem, as the movie flows quite nicely, it's just the storyline is not as interesting, and the book was not structured like this for a reason, they're not supposed to be apart. But I have many good things to say about this chapter, for example, the casting is really good, Pennywise is still a wonderful villain, the production design is wonderful and in all I think this is still an enjoyable movie. Some of the weaknesses of the first one are a bit amplified here also, like the overuse of both jump scares and cgi is a bit distracting. But to all the people praising the mini series and saying it's a lot better than these movies I think it's nostalgia speaking. As much as I like Tim Curry (huge fan), these productions are a galaxy away in terms of quality.",It Chapter Two
215,TheVictoriousV,Skarsgård steals an often underwhelming show,6,11 September 2019,"My biggest problem with It: Chapter Two is that it isn't ""Chapter Two"". Rather than following up on the original film, only now with the heroes as adults instead of children, it instead emulates the original miniseries by cutting back and forth between the adult plotline and scenes with the kids, that could have been deleted from this film, lest the previous one seem like unnecessary viewing and this one too long. It is effectively a whole new adaptation of the Stephen King book (without the underage orgy, luckily).We join the Loser's Club from the first It as they've moved on with their lives and, by some dark magic, forgotten about their encounter with ""It"" in Derry, Maine the summer of '89. It is only when the group is reassembled by Mike (Isiah Mustafa as an adult; Chosen Jacobs as a boy), the only member who stayed in Derry and thus somehow kept his memories, that the others also begin to recall. The supernatural in-Universe explanation is a front for clear themes of nostalgia, ""moving on"" and returning home, and they would be clear enough without lines about childhood memories.James McAvoy plays now Jaeden Martell's character, Sophia Lillis grew up into Jessica Chastain, the foul-mouthed Finn Wolfhard became an edgy stand-up played by Bill Hader, Jeremy Taylor's ""fat kid"" evolved into a ripped Jay Ryan, and Jack Dylan Grazer became James Ransone. There is one more character who doesn't quite make it in, but I won't give away too much.Even without my bias as a fellow Swede, Bill Skarsgård is spectacular as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, It's primary form, and the character does all the unnerving stuff you expect. He stalks, he lurks, he transforms based on his victim's innermost fears and anxieties, he mauls, and he terrifies. He also attacks a homosexual character, which was reportedly the final straw for the Internet journalists, totally not proving that these people are officially the dumbest f-cks.Also involved are Javier Botet as the Leper, either one of It's forms or an image he creates within a given victim's mind. Teach Grant portrays an aged and insane version of the bully from the previous It, and Xavier Dolan has a decidedly unexpected cameo. Stephen King as a store clerk is a little less shocking.Speaking of King, I don't know how well this movie fares in terms of faithfulness. It recaptures some of the iconic Stephen King silliness - willingly or not - but it is in many ways more moving and scary than, say, the original miniseries or any given adaptation that Steve wholeheartedly approves of. I'm told there's also supposed to be a giant space turtle, even though I could have sworn readers of King take him very seriously.The movie is indeed rather silly when it doesn't mean to be, and often falls flat when it does. Nonetheless, it delivers in terms of excitement, performances (mainly Skarsgård), and a sense of nostalgia that even those not born in the '80s can relate to. It also has jump scares and a clown so the average horror viewer will get what they're looking for, no questions asked.All the same, a more apt ""Chapter Two"" would have been a film that focuses on the first movie's heroes all grown up. I thought the whole point of following the children on their own in 2017 film, instead of playing both plotlines back-to-back like the original It, was to give the adults their own movie. Whether you want to make one King adaptation with flashbacks throughout, or a double feature with one film per time period, either option is fine. But I'd advise you pick one and stick to it.",It Chapter Two

That is because I believe a truly great story needs time to develop characters and commit the viewer to the experience. It Chapter Two is a prime example of a film that boasts a long run-time without using it properly, and it becomes a real drag. Many times the stunning visuals and costume design in combination with a gut-wrenching performance by Bill Skarsgard would have me at the edge of my seat, only to slowly sit me back as all momentum slowly burned out. It also dawned on me that the horror if IT is best viewed through the lens of a child protagonist. Some moments with a full adult squad just felt disingenuous.",It Chapter Two

I was entertained enough that, when I realised, it was already at the finalé! At least that's how I felt (and pretty much everyone in theaters).It was surely not a scary movie. I saw many people complaining about this. I think it was ok; I'm not fond of jumpscares, but there were many, many scary sequences (and all of them lead to a jumpscare, so that's a 50-50 score).

222,mattiasflgrtll6,This is what people find scary?,2,9 October 2019,"27 years after the members of The Losers' Club defeated It, visions of the clown start popping up again. Mike Hanlon calls everyone up for a meeting to come up with a plan to defeat It once and for all.Like the first movie, it starts off promising enough with the opening scene. Eddie and Adrian just want to have a nice day at the theme park, but are confronted by a couple of bullies who try to intimidate them. They get annoyed, but walk away from them. After they get cornered again however, Adrian starts mouthing off, going so far as to insult one of their haircuts. As you might expect, this doesn't end well. What makes this scene so much more impactful than any other in the whole movie is that it's the only one which feels real. The violence inflicted upon them just for their sexuality is very disturbing, and the tragedy is heightened when Adrian gets thrown off a bridge. It then finds him as well and eats him brutally, but the scariest part is the homophobic violence shown just before. Though it's still notable for being the *only* scene where any restraint is shown with the clown at all.As you can tell, I'm already getting into my negatives. This movie was horrendous. As someone who wasn't even a fan of the first one, I would much rather watch that one again since it seemed to care about its characters at least. Which is something It: Chapter Two doesn't.
If you're looking for good character development and interactions, look elsewhere. Instead it seems more interested in wasting its time on extremely obnoxious and laughably unscary jumpscares. I was laughing out of embarrassment every time the movie tried to be scary. Who did they think they were fooling? Fortune cookies cracking open Gremlins-style, one of them having an insect with a baby's head? A Paul Bunyon statue showing off its big scary teeth? A naked old lady with hanging tits? A hobo making out with your mother? These attempts at trying to spook you were so phony I couldn't tell if they were trying to be funny or not. There's one part which clearly was supposed to be intense, but for some weird god-damn reason they added comedic music to it. It completely ruins any sense of danger they tried to establish, and comes off as a cringeworthy way to make the audience laugh, since at the test screening everybody already laughed anyway.The CGI effects work is as fake-looking as it gets. Honestly, I'm surprised a lot of it even got past the pre-production stage.The dialogue is horrible. Instead of incorporating humor into the script naturally when it *fits*, every serious moment is ruined by a stupid one-liner. Richie especially deflated the tension all the time by either pointing out they are in trouble (as if we're too dumb to get it) or saying something goofy at the most inappropriate time. If they were going for a horror comedy it's too tonally inconsistent, not to mention most of the jokes are so lame anyway they're not funny. And when they try to be heartwarming it's so overdone and cliché that you keep rolling your eyes at the self help-esque quotes they keep spitting at you. I swear, there are maybe FIVE MONOLOGUES throughout, and they all sound exactly the same.Even Beverly's dad, one of the few creepy things about the first, comes off as a joke in the few scenes he appears in. The way he sprays his daughter furiously with perfume is so absurd I couldn't take it seriously, not to mention the moment where Beverly's inside a bathroom filled with blood and he keeps chanting ""COME TO DADDY"". Just like everything else it's too over-the-top.And for a clown as powerful as It, the way he gets defeated is absolutely pathetic. Forget fighting him to death, trick him in any way, or even the ritual Mike keeps going on about (which conveniently he ""forgets"" way too late it doesn't work). No, let's just call him a few hurtful words and he'll shrink to the size of a baby. I sh'it you not. The most evil and otherwordly clown alive is weakened by being called a regular circus clown. The scriptwriter really must have backed himself into a corner with this one.The acting is mixed. Bill Hader is good (even though I find his character a bit annoying). Jessica Chastain gave a very earnest performance, and was probably the best out of the main cast. Isaiah Mustafa and James Ransone were all right. James McAvoy was a little off however, which was disappointing. His stuttering doesn't feel like it comes out naturally. Jaeden Martell as the kid version of Bill did it much more convincingly.
Bill Skarsgård, and this might come as an unpopular opinion, was pretty hard to watch. To be fair the material he gets is ridiculous, but his line delivery was so exaggerated and goofy I wondered if he was trying to keep himself from cracking up or something.Most of all however, I was bored to tears. With all the constant repetition of jumpscares and scenes dragging on and on, I kept asking my friend ""How much do we have left?"" since I could barely wait to leave the theater. No way in hell the merciless 2 hour and 48 minute run time is justified.The biggest higlights are the cameos by Stephen King and Peter Bogdanovich. Skip this sorry excuse of a ""horror"" movie.",It Chapter Two
223,GomezAddams666,A very satisfying conclusion,9,7 September 2019,"Let me start of by saying this movie did not disappoint, at all. I was honestly impressed because not does it feel like a natural conclusion to the first chapter, but it is also a great film in its own.I will not talk about the story in order not to spoil it, but I will say it is very well written, some changes have been made from the original novel to make it much more cinematic, but they work, they do so astoundingly as it is a really great movie, its writing is pretty solid.The performances are amazing for the most part, James McAVoy, Jessica Chastain, and Bill Hader are amazing as the grown-up versions of Bill, Beverly and Richie, but I will say that acting-wise it felt as if the rest of the Losers were not as good as their younger counterparts, history does repeat itself it seems.I have to dedicate an entire section to the astounding performance of Bill Skarsgård, he is nothing short of amazing and my only grief is that he does not have as much screen time as I would have liked, but his performance is terrifying, give this man an Oscar.All in all, I found this sequel to be awesome, I will give it 9 out of 10.This spectacle led by the ever capable Andy Muschietti is a satisfying conclusion to the story, and when you watch it, and you should watch it, you'll all float too.",It Chapter Two
224,tfminfl,I am the eater of worlds...,10,12 September 2019,"355. It Chapter Two. I loved Chapter One, I loved Chapter Two. Picks up 27 years after the events of the original, you know, when the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, had a child orgy and made a promise to come back if Pennywise returned. That's not what happened? And right on schedule Robert Gray appears back on the scene to eat some children. Mike Hanlon, the only member of the Losers Club to stay in Derry and witnesses what's going on, starts making some calls to the other members of the group and asks them all to come home, the issue with that is, people who leave Derry tend to forget Derry, so it takes some begging, and they all all make it home, well, almost. And as they each explore the town, Pennywise comes out to play to welcome them home, cause he's missed them, they're like the ones that got away. Leading up to a showdown to bring an end to Pennywise, once and for all. Pretty sweet creepy effects once again, good casting of the adult losers club!! End Pennywise once and for all.. LOL... Yes the million years old Pennywise was defeated by the Losers Club, which they did 27 years prior as well. How did the defeat him once and for all, by performing a ritual passed down to Mike by a group of Native Americans, who performed the ritual and then were promptly eaten by Pennywise. My guess is, Pennywise likes these games. At the end of the day, Pennywise finished his cycle of eating Derry's precious little bundles of joy, got a kick out of The Loser's Club actually coming back to get their asses kicked once again, losing a few losers along the way, put on a little show for them, and went to sleep, and will come back to suck the marrow from their grandchildren's bones in 27 years. :) All Hail The Crimson King!!

225,CabbageCustard,A movie that doesn't know what it wants to be.,5,23 December 2019,"This movie can't make its mind up.The preceding IT movie of this current crop was one I truly enjoyed. That's because, whatever its virtues or failures as a horror movie, it was a movie that had a heart. It was essentially a movie about friendship and growing up and, to use a well-worn cliché, coming of age. It was essentially another 'Stand by Me' but with lots of CGI. This movie has none of that heart, but it tries to. It tries to evoke sentimentality and nostalgia for the first movie and the band of kids at its heart - the Losers. But it also wants to be a horror movie. It never succeeds in marrying these two themes and subsequently fails at achieving either one individually. There is too much CGI to be truly scary. It just does not seem real. And the CGI is at the expense of building atmosphere and tension. The movie also tries to be somewhat of a psychological thriller, as each of protagonists face their past fears and failures. Finally, the movie goes out of its way to include as many throwbacks to the characters introduced in the first movie as it can, even when they really have nothing to do with the current plot. Trying to be so many things at once means this movie is almost three hours long. You notice the running time too. I was looking at my watch well before it got to he end.To be honest, I didn't hate It Chapter 2, but I didn't like it either. At the end all I thought was 'meh'. Maybe you will like it better.Just in passing, I can't end without commenting on one of the opening scenes of the movie and I apologise for any spoilers. In the very first scene of the movie we are taken to the Derry carnival where a couple of young men are enjoying the sideshows. One of these men, it is revealed, is a former Derry resident and the other is his boyfriend. These two attract the ire of some local louts who proceed to do a bit of very brutal gay bashing. All through this scene I was wondering if one of these men was one of our protagonists from the previous movie and how this act of violence fitted in with the rest of the plot. Turns out this incident had nothing to do with the rest of the plot and the characters involved - the two young men and the louts - played no further part in the remainder of the movie. So my question is, why have this scene at all?? In hindsight, its existence for no reason seems sort of homophobic and more than a tad offensive. You may disagree, but that's the way it seemed to me.",It Chapter Two
226,mr_bickle_the_pickle,I loved the Bill Hader/James McAvoy moments...,7,9 September 2019,"I liked the second half of this film a lot more than the first. Not that its totally garbage, there are still good scenes and moments...but the characters have forgotten whats happened and have to spend time re-learning things we already know, and because of that it felt a bit long. And the only really character who is really built upon is Richie. And Bill Hader really shines and mostly steals the show. The whole cast is good and James McAvoy has a particulary heartbreaking scene where he's begging Pennywise to take him instead, but I think you feel more for Richie in this movie. And so I really liked those aspects of the film.Another negative, is that I didnt find it that particulary scary. The CGI was a bit overused and looked pretty fake at times. Again Bill, is really great in this role and I wished they just relied more on him and his talent because he can be genuinely creepy.But I still didnt hate the film. I didnt find the first one that scary either but really enjoyed the kids and how it felt like a coming of age story, and again...I liked the cast and I loved the concepts of them standing up to their fears and letting go.

The best part of IT is the clown, and there was too little of him imo.But as long as you go in knowing this is a 3 hour movie, has too much CGI and too litle Pennywise, then you will probably think its a ok/good movie as well.I do hope the movie does well though because I would love to see a third installment, but next time, have more Pennywise!!",It Chapter Two
228,anthonyjlangford,Unreal and Overcooked,4,28 October 2019,"The problems with It II are well observed by other reviewers. It's length and wasted cast are far from the only problems however. It appears that the director has come to believe in his own mythology since the success of the first film, which was a very good, if not great horror movie.This time round, he's tried to throw in everything into the pot to perhaps set up a career path into a more dramatic film future. Hard to say, but he falls way short of doing what he's supposed to, which is to create a gripping horror film.Within the first 30 minutes, there are three separate incidents of white males perpetrating violence against innocent parties, that feels like it belongs in 1977, not 2017 when this story apparently occurs. More anti-straight white male bias dressed up as edgy cinema. Is this a film on gay hate crimes, police brutality and domestic violence? These things are not as common today as they were in the past, despite what the over-saturated, click-bait media may have you believe.In any regard, he's thrown all three down our throats within half an hour and they really have nothing to do with the central plot of Pennywise and the kids at all. The Beverly situation in particular, was false to the point of being laughable. One scenario was more than enough. Instead of gritty realism, its cliched farce. Just get on with the story.The adult characters, who haven't seen each other in decades are riding each other, quite harshly in a couple of situations, yet there is no normal adult reaction. Same when Richie (Bill Hader) has an interaction with a child in a restaurant. It's totally false. The parents do nothing. It's just poorly written. It feels like a completely different team involved here than the first film. I like the actors. I just don't believe most of what's coming out of their mouths.It's not worth going on, tearing the film to pieces. It's simply overcooked, (like its CGI) with everything thrown into the mix, and more than should be there, like it's farcical lead ups, except what it should have, which is decent characterization and plotting. The actors did deserve better. It's a massive disappointment. Watch the 1990 version instead, or read the book. It's one of King's best.",It Chapter Two
229,dussaultjulien,Unequivocally the worst movie I've ever seen.,1,17 December 2019,"This movie is horrible and possibly one of the worst movies ever made. If you thought part 1 was bad, get ready. This is a billion times worse.Bill Skarsgard trys, but untimely fails yet again as Pennywise the Clown, and the story, which was unbelievable in both the book and the TV Mini series (but at least watchable), is even more unbelievable in this one.Native American's ""sealed"" Pennywise years ago, and now the grown uo Losers Club, which they all truly are with the lackluster and horrible performances given and acted in this role, have to perform a ""ritual"" with some crappy leather container to ""finally defeat and seal"" Pennywise the Clown, but instead it turns into flashbacks for almost 2 hours.The first hour and 45 minutes are watchable, if you call over the top, horrible CGI watchable, then sure, but it does get better. We get a cameo by Mr. Moneybags A.K.A. I don't give a crap anymore give me your money, Mr. Steven King who has the gall to show up in this stinker. His cameo is short, but is the only real good part of the entire 2 horus and 45 minutes of this film. That's around the hour and 25 minute mark, get ready for the rest.The rest of the film is all flashbacks until the last 20 or so minutes. When I paused an hour and 45 minutes left and saw that I still had an hour left, I started skipping scenes and found that I didn't miss much. The ending shows the Losers facing down Pennywise, not in a spider form, but some crappy worm thing, a fight ensues, everybody sings kamiya and Pennywise deflates and is sealed away. The remaning losers jump into the lake where they jumped as kids and the fat kid gets the girl and stutter cries and that's it man",It Chapter Two
230,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,More of a comedy then a horror,7,4 September 2019,The movie is long and i felt it kept slowing down. Id say people will really miss all the kid actors even though there are alot of flashbacks and kids cast keep reappearing. There was alot of comedy less of a horror so people who are expecting a horror will be badly disappointed. Id just like to warn everyone there is alot of flashing images in the last 30 minutes or so which is very much irritating and annoying. The entire ending battle was really bad but before the credits its a very sweet ending. The cast members did very well to fit inth there characters from the kids cast.Overall really enjoyed most of the movie other then the last 40 minutes the comedy scenes are very funny and laughable but again people wanted a horror not a comedy.

231,TuesdayThe17th,Second half to a visually epic and poignant horror remake,8,10 December 2019,"""IT2"" is a quite good second half to an overall monumental two part film. When I was young I watched the original IT miniseries and it deeply moved me. It wasn't so much that it was scary, but rather that the story of friendship was so rich and that's what was at the core of the film. The final scene of them on their bikes used to make me shed a tear or two. ""IT Chapter 2"" closely imitates the depth of friendship and too has a very moving final couple scenes. This movie is not a horror/thriller but instead a horror/drama. Perhaps even swap the two around. This is definitely a high quality horror film. I watched it in 4K and I have to say the effects are better than most if not all other horror films. The first one also had this offering. Even though ""IT2"" isn't really scary, it IS shocking and there are plenty of nightmarish monsters. One scene in particular where Beverly goes to her old house to find her ""artifact"" is in my opinion the scariest sequence in the movie and it was done very well. You can really see Muschietti's trademark horror elements and directing style here as it faintly echoes aspects of his first feature film, ""Mama"". The acting was up and down. For example, Bill Hader did a great job acting while James McAvoy did not... I personally feel McAvoy was the wrong choice for the role. Also, I feel Jake Gyllenhaal would have been much better as adult Eddie than James Ransone. Aside from a couple minor editing flaws and moments of bad acting, the two new IT films as a whole is a really good movie and is a horror landmark.",It Chapter Two

Sounds like an oxymoron, yes: A delightful horror film? But honestly, I really had fun with this one. I think Chapter 2 has a lot more levity than the first film, both thematically and comically, thanks to its downright creepy and hilarious imagery and Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård's righteous performances. Yes, it's a long sit, but it went by fast because it was so off-the-walls. I can sympathize with Stephen King fans and horror die-hards for wanting something legitimately scary, and I agree that it could've used more authentic terror, but...the villain is a CLOWN. Yes, I wanted to be scared, but I also wanted to be amused, and holy smokes, it's enough of a wild ride for me to recommend on a whole other level.

Also the humour doesn't always hit it's mark and the ahem...cameo of a certain auteur...was really unecessary...and self-serving.The movie doesn't establish the adult characters and their lives and how they got to where they are. The cast is uneven as well and so are the performances. The children were much more enjoyable and entertaining to watch than their adult counterparts.And now it's clear, even more so, Amy Adams should have been cast as the grownup version of Beverly Marsh (she and Sophia Lilis has already worked together on ""Sharp Objects"" on HBO).But there is still enough to like, if not enjoy, in this movie not to make it a complete failure or outright flop.5 out of 10",It Chapter Two

238,RhapsodyReviews,Great Sequel.,8,26 September 2019,"Review:
'It: Chapter Two' is an American supernatural-horror film directed by Andy Muschietti. It is a sequel to the 2017 film 'It', both based on the 1986 novel by Stephen King. Going into this movie I was the most excited I have been to see a film in a long time. But I can honestly say I was nervous too. I wasn't nervous that the movie was going to suck, I knew Andy Muschietti could pull off a great film with the material he had available to him. I love the first 'IT' and his earlier work with 'Mama' was fantastic. He knows what needs to be done when constructing a good horror movie. I was nervous for two reasons. One being the fact that I enjoyed the first movie so much that I didn't want this movie to fall short like a lot of other sequels do. The other reason is the ending, because I was never a fan of the ending of 'IT', whether that be in the novel or the 1990 adaptation. I will discuss my feelings about the ending of this one later in this review.
Set in 2016, 27 years after the first film, the story follows the remaining members of the Losers Club reuniting in order to defeat the eponymous being who has returned to terrorize the town of Derry, Maine.
I'm going to talk a bit about the casting decision in this movie before I get to actual acting! This is some of the best casting choices I have ever seen in film. Not one actor felt out of place, everybody looked, acted and overall embodied the kids that they were supposed to be playing. We all knew that Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy were going to crush this movie, they're amazing in everything. Everybody else did a wonderful job, and not once in this movie was I taken out of a scene because something lacked or felt off with the acting. But, I need to discuss how brilliant this one person was in this move because he was the standout for me by miles and that person is Bill Hader. I did not expect to come out of this movie saying Bill Hader was the standout, but my god he was good. He plays the adult version of Ritchie and it's brilliant. He is so funny is this movie (of course), but he was so quickly able to play different emotions when he needed to whether it be anger, sadness, happiness or whatever, his character felt it all and he played it so well!
It's hard writing a review for this movie (especially spoiler free), because I loved it so much that I just want to talk about it for hours. Sure, it has some problems, but I personally feel that a lot of the problems in this movie are forgivable. It has some pacing issues at times but being nearly 3 hours long one could expect that. It had so much story to tell you can't expect it to be balls to wall every minute. You know if it was and they shortened the movie people would than complain that it's nothing like the book. The movie is not as scary as it's predecessor, but I think that was purposeful being that the first one was kids being terrorised by this evil clown. In this one it's more of a revenge tale on Pennywise. Going back to Bill Hader being super funny, another actor who was amazingly funny was James Ransone - who plays the adult version of Eddie Kaspbrak. These two played off of each other a lot throughout the movie and I can honestly say I have not laughed so much, or so hard in another movie this year. They didn't over do the comedy though, at times where you think maybe this shouldn't have a joke in it you remember this is Ritchie, I wouldn't believe the scene if there wasn't a crack about something.
A movie's ending is everything. A bad ending can ruin a good movie, a good ending can save a bad movie. With the ending to this movie I left feeling okay. I didn't love it, but it was a lot better than what it could have been. I'm not going to talk about it other than that because I will get into spoiler territory. If you're a fan of the book it could honestly go either way with liking it or not.
Overall, as a super fan of Andy Muschietti and Stephen King I would gladly rate this movie 5 stars, but I do understand some flaws with it. If you liked the first one you will have a great time here, maybe even a slightly better time dare I say. I loved it and can not wait to see it again.

Scary clown, big sharp teeth, balloons. It just seemed like 3 hrs was too much. The ending wasn't that great either as you kind of wonder why the guys did not think of it sooner, especially after the first movie and their first battle with Pennywise.

241,Slarkshark,Our Favourite Shape-Shifter at It Again,8,6 October 2020,"Chapter One in my opinion was a very good horror movie. So it was going to be hard for Chapter Two to match its predecessor. 'Two' does a good job, but it just isn't quite there, but is at least decent and is still superior than most horror flicks out there.As a horror film 'It: Chapter Two' is quite long, though I believe it needed to be. One was pretty well a straight up horror movie, albeit a very good one, while this one contained a lot more drama. Which is fair, since the characters are having to deal with the fallout from the first one, while also confront the present. 'Two' also fleshed out Pennywise a lot more as an entity and his background. I have not read the book, however after doing some research I feel as though they did Pennywise justice when it comes to his background, story, and overall portrayal.The first one was definitely more scary. This one leaned more toward jump scares and didn't build up the genuine dread as successfully as the first. I agree the CGI for the lepers and zombies really did not add to much and was more of a distraction.I've also seen the two part miniseries a couple times, and we all of course love Tim Curry's performance, though that seems to be pretty much the only memorable thing. I remember the first half being better than the second. And I have to say as a whole these two parts are superior to the miniseries. The ending is much more satisfying in the 2019 version.I had no issue with the casting at all. Bill Hader was amazing and provided the needed comedic element. The other two superstar names of Chastain and McAvoy were great, as were all the others I am unfamiliar with. I kept thinking 'Ben' Jay Ryan looked like a younger Josh Brolin.Respectable sequel.",It Chapter Two
242,fredschaefer-406-623204,I liked it despite some obvious problems.,7,8 September 2019,"One of the most anticipated movies of the year has been director Andy Muschietti's IT CHAPTER TWO, the second part of the his adaptation of Stephen King's much beloved and mammoth 1986 novel, which had been adapted before in a much beloved TV miniseries in 1990. The first film, released two years ago, was both a box office and critical success, more than that, this new big screen version of King's story resonated with audiences, drawn to the story of a group of misfit teen agers, who dub themselves The Losers, and who must confront an ancient evil entity haunting their small Maine town of Derry in the summer of 1989; this entity, who presents himself to the world as a malevolent clown named Pennywise, lives on fear, especially the fear of children. It's a great coming of age story, with some of King's most vividly realized characters, not mention one of his most terrifying villains.This second film, which centers around Bill, Beverly, Richie, Mike, Ben, Eddie, and Stan - The Losers - 27 years later and now adults, who must now return to Derry and take on a resurrected Pennywise. And it has problems, not the least of which is the nearly three hour running time, but more to the point, a story line that is overstuffed with a lot of business. These were same problems with King's thousand plus page novel, which I have always thought would have worked better as two books. The movie does get off to a strong start, where we are introduced to the adult counterparts to the kids we met in the first movie, all of whom are scared in some way by the trauma they endured in Derry - Beverly is married to an abusive man, Eddie is still a germaphobe, Bill is a once successful writer now blocked - who come home and catch up over a meal in a Chinese restaurant, where things take a turn. In the second half, the group (sans suicide Stan) ventures out on their own, attempting to reconnect with their childhoods, and to find a personal totem that time that will help them defeat Pennywise once and for all. Here we are treated to essentially the same scene over and over, where Bill, Beverly, and the rest, visit an abandoned movie theater, and old apartment, a drugstore, the park, have a flashback, and are confronted by Pennywise. And boy is this section heavy on jump scares, so much so, that after awhile you can see them coming. To me, jump scares are the equivalent of a sugar high. It's also very heavy on the CGI, some of which is better than others - I was impressed with the long tongued leper who torments Eddie, the monstrous Paul Bunyan statue that comes to life and chases Richie, and the old lady thing Beverly encounters. But I didn't find any of it particularly scary though. In the third act, our heroes descend deeper into the sewers under Derry for a final confrontation with Pennywise, and this plays out much more like a giant monster film than anything else. It's a satisfying ending, even with all the obvious CGI, but I understand if anyone finds this wearying. There is still the Ritual of Chud (not the mutant cannibals from that other 80's horror movie), but much is left out from King's book, which for many, went cosmically off the rails in the finale, which included the giant turtle Mataurin, who spat out the universe. It's a classic example of something that might have worked on the page, but would have looked ludicrous on the screen. Many think King attempted a concept in that finale that he failed to pull off, though many fans love it. Also missing are subplots involving Beverly's awful husband and Bill's movie star wife. A central problem with this second film, which was true for the book as well, is that the adult Losers' story lacks the sense of wonder, discovery, and triumph that was palpable in their teenage versions.Still, despite all of its faults, I could not dislike this movie. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Andy Bean, and James Ransome are first rate as the grown up Bill, Beverly, Richie, Mike, Eddie and Ben; all of them give winning performances, totally selling me that they are the older versions of the young actors who played them in the first film, which could have been a problem when those young actors show up in flashbacks (though some have been noticeably digitally de-aged, because kids change a lot in two years). Bill Skarsgard owns Pennywise every bit as much as Tim Curry did in the miniseries. There are a number of scenes that really work, starting with Pennywise luring a little girl under the bleachers at a ball game that is scary and terrible in the way great horror movies should be; the hate crime murder of a young homosexual that shows that things in the Derry of 2016 are just as awful as ever; Ben and Beverly reaching for each other in the final showdown when Pennywise is about to drown them in their own fears. Stephen King himself turns up in a funny cameo, where he chides the adult Bill Denbrough for the bad endings of Bill's books, a knowing wink to King's own fans that have made the same complaint for years. Director Peter Bogdanovich turns up as well to make the some complaint. And though I've disdained CGI plenty, there is one creature that is a nod to one of the most infamous effects from John Carpenter's THE THING that I loved. I also like the tweak Muschietti did with Stan's suicide, something absent from the book.And if any producers are looking for other Stephen King works to bring to the big screen, I'd like to put in my two cents for an adaptation of FROM A BUICK 8, and if anyone really wants to take a risk, take on RAGE from the Bachman books. The latter would be quite controversial, but never timelier in this political climate.",It Chapter Two

I watched it with some of my family knowing this horrible past is behind me.... wish the film was better.I loved the first one. This one just felt underwhelming. Starts off with Pennywise killing a gay guy and then we have to watch all the members of the Loser's Club getting an invite back to Derry. All Pennywise does is scare him. I think the only real threat is the bully escaping a mental asylum (who has a zombie driver, for some reason). Also the film tends to borrow from other films like The Thing.The movie is really long and you will feel it. The ending, like the original, sucks I'm convinced nobody knows how to end this thing. I also felt that they really didn't have to go through all that trouble to bring the kids back. It almost makes the first film a little pointless.

245,hunter-friesen,"""It Chapter Two"": Too Long for Too Little",6,15 September 2019,"In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line to the Ford Motor Company. He made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator. Now just a hundred years later, director Andy Musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to It Chapter Two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before.This sequel to the highest-grossing horror movie of all time (unadjusted) takes place 27 years later in the same town of Derry, Maine. The rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success. Unfortunately, the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of Pennywise, who seeks more victims for his twisted games. Being the only ones that have stopped the evil force, the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess.Director Andy Muschietti returns behind the camera after the record-breaking success he earned from 2017's ""It"". For the second time around, Muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before, both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length.When it comes to giving audiences what they came to see, Muschietti delivers on adding even more blood, gore, and creepiness. Pennywise's indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality.The biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention. That same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen. The more they happen, the more predictable and boring they are to watch.A runtime is never indicative of quality by itself, every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship. And at 170 minutes, ""It Chapter Two"" falls way short of earning its record-breaking runtime. Instead of the horror being a slow burn, it's more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting Stephen King, a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him.Dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within King's novel, but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out. The story wants you to take it pretty seriously, but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task.Muschietti didn't do much to justify the excessive length, but Dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing. The film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace. Then, against all logic, Dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes, severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake.The highest regards should go to casting director Rich Delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts. Unfortunately, good looks are the only quality some actors possess here.James McAvoy does fine as Bill. The most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his Scottish accent with a less than convincing New England one.Having a rocky 2019, to say the least, Jessica Chastain follows up the bomb that was ""Dark Phoenix"" with another subpar performance. She doesn't shine as brightly as Sophia Lillis' younger Beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time.The standout performances come from the two Bills in the cast, Hader and Skarsgård. Hader plays adult Richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy.Skarsgård as Pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately doesn't get seen for long stretches. Between him and Heath Ledger's Joker, future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach.With over five hours of material between two films, the ""It"" series has come to a less than satisfying close with ""It Chapter Two"". There are some things to admire Muschietti and co. for doing or trying to do. But for every great Bill Skarsgård moment (which is all of them), there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking. Overall, between its highs and lows, ""It Chapter Two"" makes for a semi-enjoyable time. Just make sure to bring a seat cushion.",It Chapter Two
246,arabnikita,"3 hours of pointless drama and cheap scares in a so called ""horror""",5,7 September 2019,"Sequels to good movies can be challenging to make because of audience's expectations and it becomes the director's job to craft a new movie that upholds the standards if it's predecessor while delivering new content in an enjoyable manner. It Chapter 2 received a bigger budget, a solid cast and for some bizzare reason a whopping 3 hour runtime that proved to be its biggest fault.The problem with It 2 is that it tries to be a psychological dramatic comedy with pop scares and ends up failing miserably at all of them, except maybe the comedy. It is the exact same movie as part one with new scares and jokes minus the chracter chemistry and the overall pleasant vibe of Part 1. A lot of time is wasted on pointless drama, reminiscing about the past and soul searching to a point that by the time the interesting part starts, I have already lost all interest in the plot.Despite following a source material, the entire film feels forced and pointlessly long. The film does have good acting and some hillarious laugh out loud moments but it all gets lost in the excessive talking, thinking and building up for cheap scares.

252,snowfre,"A disappointing ending for the ""It"" saga",6,12 March 2020,"""It"" (in retrospect I guess we can call it ""Chapter One"") was a well-balanced Stephen King adaption filled with adventure spirit, humor, good scares, and coming-of-age emotions. When we move on to ""Chapter Two"", Beverly, Bill, Richie, Mike, Ben, Stanley, and Eddie are adults and several circumstances force them to return to their childhood hometown of Derry, Maine when Pennywise has returned. ""It Chapter Two"" is overall entertaining and most of the adult cast (Chastain, McAvoy, and Hader being the main stars) are fittingly chosen to portray the Loser Club in present day. However, the film has lost its very nicely executed balance from the first film. Many scenes, not to say the ending, turns very anticlimactic as they - especially Hader as adult Richie - throws out oneliners and funny comments, which takes of the edge of every situation they're in. Once again, Bill Skarsgård is perfect for the role of the child eating clown and there are some good jump scares, not as effective and common as in the first film however. With the final chapter, ""It"", one of the better King-adaptions recently, fails to go out with a bang. The adventurous, curious, and warm (it was there even though it was a horror movie) atmosphere is forgotten and the ""It Chapter Two"" leaves you indifferent for the two-part saga. For its entertainment value, that's the sole reason, I score this film 6 instead of 5.",It Chapter Two

My one friend I went with didn't even like scary movies and she loved it. We all did. I probably jumped out of my skin at least 10 times. Some spots I knew it was going to happen and others I was very surprised. The movie had everything that a horror movie could possibly have to make it entertaining and a bit scary. The fact that they can add comedy into it without being cheesy was great. I don't see that too often. Sometimes comedy works with horror and sometimes it doesn't. For the most part, people seemed to love the movie based off of the reviews I've read, not just on here but on social media as well. However, I still decided to see it despite the few negative reviews. Sometimes you can't please people. Also, people compare this to the 1st one an awful lot and some think the 1st one is better. I couldn't disagree more. I like part 2 the best. To be honest, I've never seen the original 80s version of these films so I cannot compare the two, nor do I want to. If you are a fan of horror and part one, then don't listen to the bad reviewers and go see it. I promise you won't be disappointed",It Chapter Two

So this is the end of It, and it doesn't live to the expectations.Allow me to explain myself.The first movie was the perfect dark comedy and you might believe that may be it wasn't risky enough because the cast was full of kids and they were all destined to survive for the sequel. So they make a good choice focusing more on the comedy on the first movie and then the sequel will be more dark and scary.You were incorrect. This movie isn't scary again. It's a horror dark dramedy and is monotonous as you don't have any idea.The first act of the movie is all of the characters being invited to come back to the town where everything happens on the first movie, so you have to observe their reactions to the invitation. I wouldn't consider this as a spoiler because it's something that everybody recognizes is going to happen. Over here are the spoilers of the formatTHE SPOILER BEGINS - The second act is they collecting the things they need to defeat Pennywise but everybody has to go alone in their quest. The format is: First they go to one place, then they will have a memory of when they were kids that explains why that object is so meaningful for them. When they get the object, they probably will see pennywise and all their fears seem to be coming true. - THE END OF THE SPOILER.The second act is so repetitive and slow that causes you feel like this movie could last just two hours without the filler.

Look, we're all always somewhat dissatisfied with book adaptations doesn't matter what actors are used. Movies based on books are hard to do which is why I will admit part 1 was brilliant, certainly, but part 2 didn't live up to the hype. Part 1 was well shown and effective and I was shocked at how well that film looked. So much so, my partner jumped out her seat in the cinema and everyone else jumped with her.Part II could have improved in places with the unnecessary humour disengaging the audience. Yet considering part 2 had to be a little bit audience friendly, undoubtedly part II was underrated.Part 1 was a fantastic remake; if that didn't make you cringe/jump nothing will. On the downside Part II is without doubt a tad frustrating. This sequel looked brilliant in the adverts but fell a bit flat. Same actors so no excuse really but well Hollywood does tend to run out of ideas these days a lot quicker.The recreation of IT part 1 will always be something I remember.

260,eelen-seth,A frightening yet touching story of forgotten friendship and lost opportunities.,8,8 September 2019,"The sequel to the 2017 box office success 'It' starts exactly where it left off. Almost no explanatory flashbacks to the situations the Losers Club got themselves into, fighting the terrifying Pennywise. Only difference in 'It Chapter Two' - they're all grown up and ready to end It, once and for all.27 years ago, a fear-indulging creature tried to feast on every teenager alive in small town Derry. A group of friends, defeated the being (disguised as a clown) and moved on with their lives. Or so we think.. After a brutal killing one evening, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) decides to call every single one of his old friends, begging them to come back to their hometown. Barely remembering the events of almost three decades ago, they catch up over dinner and drinks and memories start to flow back. Sooner than they'd expect, It strikes again and the returning members of the Losers Club feel betrayed by Mike, luring them in knowing well enough they'd have to fight their common enemy once again. Mike did a whole lot of research to figure out It's origin and also knows how to defeat this being. But our group of friends has to stick together to successfully finish this fight against evil.Andy Muschietti is back to direct the second chapter to the well known Stephen King novel. It seems like he grew up, just like the Losers Club did. The jokes matured, as did certain subjects within the story (domestic abuse, sexual orientation..). Another impressive note is Benjamin Wallfisch's score. Simply eerie and unsettling. While I thought his score for 'It' was a bit bland and boring to listen to without the visuals, he decides to go bigger and bolder in this film and it really pays off.The movie has a lot of inventive sequences, which sometimes will blow your mind in how well constructed they are. A few of them are re-used from the previous chapter, but in a different and more terrifying way. The production design is next level perfect. While I thought 'It' relied heavier on jump scares, Chapter Two uses them less. There are still quite a few of them that actually work, but they don't seem as forced as the ones that came before. Whenever a new CGI-monster comes along, you simply ask yourself who designed these creatures. Some are straight up nightmare fuel.For fans of the younger cast, don't worry, they are still present through the use of flashbacks. But the focus is all on the adult versions this time. The true standout is by far Bill Hader, who plays grown up Richie - an alcoholic stand up comedian with a secret he can't seem to express to the outside world. His acting and comedic timing breaks some of the horror-tension, but never in a way it becomes annoying. He's genuinely enjoyable to watch and has an emotional arc to feel for. Other surprisingly great performances come from James Ransone (grown up Eddie) and Jessica Chastain (adult Beverly). James McAvoy (adult Bill) isn't bad, but it seems like he's playing one of his personalities from Split/Glass, with his accent being a bit too thick and an over-the-top lisp. While Mustafa, Jay Ryan (Ben) and Andy Bean (Stanley) just didn't get enough screen time to be rememberable. Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise, and while I thought he was brilliant in 'It', I kept wondering how much CGI they used to put him in this film. It became quite distracting, especially in the second half.It Chapter Two is the better half of the story, which explores the very interesting origin of this evolving menacing force and shows the devastating consequences of its wrongdoings towards a group of children. It not only shows that it's okay to be a loser or someone that doesn't entirely fit in to today's society, it makes us think of what we are capable of by just believing in ourselves.

I wasn't convinced because they were indeed adults.I was amazed at how unintelligible the characters are. You are adults... you are facing some sort of demon and you get to plan your actions. Wouldn't you think that arming yourself with gear and weapons would be wise? Gee... Also who the heck would be afraid of that clown as an adult? Maybe a few scaredy cats might be but I want to believe that most adults would treat the clown like a threat that needs to be fought. The entire premise of course would fall apart if the characters were not scared which is the flaw from the start. This plot really only works with children or creatures much more frightening than clowny.So anyway, it was a slog to develop the story and a chore to watch if unfold. The story should have been rewritten with some sort of twist or at least more comedy. Overall, not a good film.",It Chapter Two

He was completely invested in his character. I enjoyed his performance much better in this movie than the original. It might be because he got more lines in this movie. He completely knocks it out of the park in this horror movie.The whole cast of the Losers Club were terrific and acted perfectly. The levity that Bill Hader's character gave was on point and brilliant. It definitely made some situations feel less uncomfortable and scary for me.I loved how this movie made me afraid, but in a completely different way.

While not as scary or tight as it's predecessor, what the sequel does give us is great direction from Andy Muschietti and some well rounded actors up for the challenge, Bill Skarsgard continues to shine in his horrifying role, while Bill Hader and James Ransone stand out from the crowd with some hilarious, yet beautiful performances. MacAvoy, Chastain, Mustafa, and Ryan all do well in their respective roles, it however feels like the writing gave them very little to do, which is a shame because these are great performances.

271,schroederagustavo,They tried to make It Epic...,4,16 September 2019,"So before anything, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed the first movie, I gave it an 8/10 and I stand by that grade. There are a lot of things that I don't like about the first movie, but overall I think the good outweighs the bad. What I particularly did not enjoy about the first film as much was all the spooky clown stuff and the jump scares and what I really loved was the coming-of-age stuff and the characters and how well they blended together.Unfortunately, in It: Chapter 2 it's a lot less character stuff and way more spooky clown stuff that seems to be there to appeal to teenagers. I don't want to take anything away from Bill Skaarsgard, because I think he's great as Pennywise, it's not his performance, but the execution of most of the scares that I think is really poorly done and not at all creative. Every single scare in this movie follows the exact same structure, they are all predictable, you know exactly when it's gonna happen and how it's gonna happen. It's not scary, it's annoying.Although I did not enjoy this movie, there were aspects of it that showed promise. Of course, the cast is great, a lot of awesome talent here and the performances are good, especially Bill Hader, who is really great and hilarious, as far as I'm concerned, he's the best part of the movie, by far. Even though the cast is great, I don't think they mesh together as well as the kids do in the first movie. There is this one I would say great scene in this film in a Chinese restaurant where all of these characters are meeting for the first time, they're joking around, talking, it's really cool character interactions. And even the crazy stuff that happens during the later part of that scene is really well executed. The problem begins with two things, I believe. 1. This movie is filled with flashbacks to when they were kids, who are very noticeably digitally altered and I'm pretty sure they did something to their voices too. It's very distracting and took me out of the experience. 2. When they go and find their tokens, essentially the exact same scene happens over and over again but with different characters, none of the scares work, they are predictable and stupid. However, the scene with Jessica Chastain and the old lady has some promising moments to it, namely the stuff that happens in the background, which is really cool, but it's a tiny moment in the film. Then there's the scene with Eddy and the leper in the basement, which then suddenly plays the song ""Angel of the Morning"" for some reason and it's very awkward, it only plays for like 3 seconds, with no fade in or out, it's bizarre, to say the least.The ending of the film is essentially identical to the first movie, only BIGGER with a bunch of unnecessary CGI and it's just a mess of a movie, I don't even know what else to say. It feels incredibly long for what it needs to be, the scares don't work and even with this much talent all over the place, It: Chapter 2 hardly justifies its own existence. You could say that the story progresses because they kill It in the end, but in that case why not just do this final death in the first movie. I think that would have been much better and even if this movie has small moments, overall it is messy, loud and obnoxious.",It Chapter Two
272,theredsky,It: Chapter 2 Review,6,8 September 2019,"It: Chapter 2 is one of if not the most entertaining film I have seen this year. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this film and that's both good and bad. Compared to the 2017 film, Chapter 2 is not great on a technical level but it's far superior on an entertainment level. Here are the negatives. The film does overstay its welcome. The runtime is 2 hours and 45 minutes long and you definitely start to feel that.There are certain elements that could have been removed from the film and it would have been better. The ending of the film is not that good either. It does a rapid tone shift after the climax which just feels off putting to what we just encountered. The visual effects are pretty bad. There are many different forms of It shown through the film and they all look pretty fake. It gets distracting when the form of It in the climax looks fake which causes that scene to lose any tension that was built up. My final issue is that the film once again decides to rely much more heavily on jump scares than actual concepts. The 2017 film had scary moments that were built up and didn't come off as jumpscares but every attempt at being scary in this film was a jumpscare. Here are the positives. I feel that this film is an example of perfect casting. Each adult actor mirrors their child counterpart almost perfectly. Their acting is really good also. Bill Skarsgard, James McAvoy, and especially Bill Hader are standouts from the film. Bill Hader steals every scene he is in. He's incredibly funny and is the best part of this film. The film is incredibly funny. There are many jokes or sequences in the film that are just drop dead hilarious. I feel that some of the funny scenes were intentional while others were not but I will give director Andy Muschietti props for making this film semi self aware. There a bunch of really cool and unique transition shots and the cinematography was pretty good. Overall, It: Chapter 2 may not be as scary as the 2017 film but it's vastly more entertaining thanks to a likeable cast and hilarious sequences. I give It: Chapter 2 a 7/10.",It Chapter Two

Even the second half of the 1990 miniseries (which has been much maligned) is, for the most part, more believable and watchable.Again, the acting was good, but the film itself is very much an incoherent mess, with once again, using special effects to fill up and carry the story. I didn't for a second buy that these were old friends reconnecting and joining forces again to stop and kill the evil monster who tormented them as children. As before, the changing of the timeline from the novel and the miniseries did this movie no favors.It's unfortunate that so many of these re-workings or new adaptations feel the need to discard character development and the psychological aspect for overblown special effects, gore, nudity and graphic violence. As I stated in my review of Chapter 1, Pennywise is just too obvious to be able to lure in his victims, when he's got ""demonic clown from hell"" practically plastered on his forehead. The sense of tension and dread is completely missing in this film, and pretty much in the previous one. Say what you will about the miniseries, but despite its limitations, it created a level of psychological suspense for the most part. This movie does not.I'm sure some will prefer these recent adaptations of Stephen King's novel (including the author himself) but these movies just didn't do it for me.

276,TheMovieDoctorful,The Magic is Gone,3,9 September 2019,"I want to make one thing perfectly clear before I get into why this film doesn't work at all. I loved It: Chapter One. You're gonna see a lot of pieces on Letterboxd over the course of this month go on about how the first film was never that good and that's just not something I'm going to buy into. As far as I'm concerned, the first film was a masterpiece and, in my opinion, the best film of 2017. I was so excited for the 2nd installment (I'm of the opinion that the 2nd half of the book is actually better than the first), that I opted to see it in IMAX instead of a regular theater (My first IMAX viewing since I was 5 years old) So when I tell you this is a really bad film, understand that I left that IMAX feeling like someone had died. I was the last person who wanted to be the bearer of bad news.Not everything fails. This is, after all, a follow-up fona great film in my opinion. Almost all of the acting is quite excellent. Jessica Chastain as Beverly absolutely steals the show. You can tell she really studied the Hell out of this role as she captures a lot of the subtle facial acting choices of Lillis in this first movie. She's strong, she's fierce, she's funny, she's sympathetic. I have friends who are only interested in seeing this film for her performance and they likely won't be disappointing. Isaiah Mustafa is also fantastic as Mike Hanlon. Chapter Two gives Mike a lot more to do and definitely makes him into a more well developed and rounded character than the first film and Mustafah really helps to mold him into a rather mysterious, wise presence. James Ransone is practically a clone of an older Jack Dylan Grazer, in both appearance and vocal delivery. In fact, only one actor in the film seems to deliver a bad performance in my eyes, who we'll get to later.The aesthetic is impressive as well. From the stunning and shocking practical effects used for the film's wide variety of monsters to the pleasing cinematography (IT Chapter Two's clever use of Dutch angles in particular really stuck with me) Muschieti (clearly a talented filmmaker, despite this film's failure) has a wonderful visual eye that's fully on display here.Remember earlier when I said that only one actor gives a bad performance in this film? Unfortunately, that actor is the lead. James McAvoy, despite being a great actor, seems to completely phone it in as Bill Denbrough. His performance seems disinterested and devoid of passion. It's like he out so much into his earlier performance this year in Glass that he had nothing to give to his performance as Bill. It doesn't help that Chapter Two's characterization of Bill comes off as creepy and possessive (""Why can't you be the woman I want you to be?"" he tells his own wife.)It Chapter Two is possibly the worst edited film I've seen in theaters. That includes both Justice League and The Snowman. I'm not exaggerating an ounce when I say that nearly a third of the movie is just deleted scenes from the first film used as flashbacks. Almost every single one of these scenes don't exist in this cut of the movie for the purposes of character development or exploration of theme, but for more random spooky clown scenes. Not only are they unnecessary, not only are they lazy ways to make a rather small and unsubstantial film feel artificially epic, they're incredibly distracting and actually end of removing a lot of development from the adult cast. Ben's scene with Beverly in particular really rubbed me the wrong way. It's funny how Beverly's most in-character scene in Chapter Two is when she's actually Pennywise in disguise.So much of the film seems aimless. It will set up certain aspects like a child in danger who reminds Bill of his late brother or an ancient Native American ritual of faith and friendship used to banish Pennywise and then go absolutely nowhere with them. Said child dies anticlimactically and the ritual that the film spent so much of its plodding, meaningless runtime ends up failing.Ideas that the previous film set up are equally wasted. I was very curious to see where Beverly and Ben's romance would go in Chapter Two, one of my favorite love stories in literature. Sadly, it ends up having the passion of 2 sock puppets rubbing against each other. The attraction begins and ends at ""Beverly loves poetry, Ben wrote a great poem, now they're gonna kiss."" Maybe the film could have given their romance more depth and believability had it spent less time on unnecessary and pointless scare scenes, but that's neither here nor there.Not only is It: Chapter Two a bad movie, it's a morally offensive one. The brutality and pointless nature of the film's beginning homophobic hate crime is horrible to witness. Fans of the book will argue it's merely being accurate to the source material, but with all of the pathos and humanity It Chapter Two removed from King's masterpiece, what made this one scene an absolute must to include? Don't even get me started on the film treating Eddie's suicide as a good thing because he was ""the weakest of the group"" and couldn't weigh down the Losers Club (I'm not even making that up, that's the exact terminology the film uses)I never thought that a film could be released this year as disappointing and potential shattering than Pet Sematary, but It: Chapter Two takes the cake.

The first film was better, and the ending to this one was completely unsatisfying. Were they suggesting that Richie was in love with Eddie his whole life? Don't hint at it, especially after that hate crime at the beginning of the film. Second, the movie totally steals from both THE THING (spidery head) and Ridley Scott's LEGEND (Meg Mucklebones? Really??) to create ""monsters"" that were more laughable than anything else. Third, the whole attempt at mysticism via Native American ritual was just token and flimsy. Were the writers trying to make a statement? If so, they failed horribly. Finally, it was WAY too long, and sadly, most of the best scenes were the flashback scenes with the kids. Was Steve Carell unavailable for adult Eddie? Seemed like they were trying to replicate him. Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, and Bill Hader were solid, but the rest of the cast ... bleh.

279,joshbarton15,It ends.,8,8 September 2019,"The Losers Club have been waiting twenty-seven years but it's only been two years for us to find out what It has in store for them on his return to Derry. It Chapter Two is the concluding chapter to this particular adaption of Stephen King's novel, following It in 2017, and it certainly maintains the epic scale of the first film, which is a rarity in the horror genre.Twenty-seven years after defeating Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), the Losers Club reunite in their hometown of Derry to relive the nightmare of their childhoods and put an end to it once and for all.It took a while for It Chapter Two to get going for me however, when it does, it is a vastly entertaining horror romp that may not be the scariest film ever made but, just like the first film, can be downright unsettling at times. It's the reuniting of the Losers Club that drags out the opening of the film however, it's a necessary evil that leads to quite a wild reunion scene inside a Chinese restaurant, certainly unsettling rather than scary.Once they're all together the film moves along at a pace that makes the 169 minute runtime absolutely fly by, jump scares and creepiness galore as the Losers try to work out how to defeat the evil that has been lurking over Derry for many years. There were some really effective scenes but I found the overuse of jump scares a little irritating, especially as they were so predictable, while the quiet build-up and eeriness of other scenes were much more appealing to me.Coming to the performances, It Chapter Two features a grown up Losers Club while also using the fantastic younger actors from the first film in flashback sequences. The coming-of-age aspect from the first film and the actors performing in it make it a better film for me but the adult cast assembled for Chapter Two do a fine job in closing out the epic story. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are two actors you know can deliver knock-out performances but it's Bill Hader here that really surprised me, his turn as Richie Tozier being the most interesting of the Losers and showcasing some great acting along the way. Of course, you can't get through these adaptations of It without mentioning Bill Skarsgård's brilliant performance as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, not as prominent here as he was in the first film but just as effective when on camera.It Chapter Two is a film I can see growing on me with repeat viewings, a little like the first did, as there's so much to take in from it. I'm a big fan of the disturbing nature the film offers rather than the jump scares, and the cast really make this quite the film. The scale of it all across two films gives it that event cinema feel, which is something I'd like to see more in the horror genre.",It Chapter Two

This is some dirt that someone has scraped off the pavement (Gary Dauberman is the guilty party here) and served to a gullible public.
I tried to like this film (after trying to watch it twice) but each time I just switched off and thought, Nah, this is just rubbish.

My favorite was the cast, Pennywise, and a special guest star appearance Stephen King himself.Pennywise creates chaos as he eats and murders adults and children. I do however find the narrative story feeling messy and all over the place. Their is too much they are trying to focus on. You feel like you don't care about some of the characters. The ritual was a huge waste of time. Pennywise final form feels like a joke. The battle was sort of weak and messy. The losers gang felt like they are the new Marvel Avengers.The movie is great to watch once. After awhile you might forget about it as the years go by. It Chapter one was a better movie.

287,basilisksamuk,Half a good film and proof that fx have gotten worse,6,24 October 2021,"A good cast and a script that was a sensible interpretation of the original book made for an entertaining couple of hours. Then it went wrong in the last hour.Unfortunately there seems to be a belief that the last act of every blockbuster film has to have half an hour of murky CGI where people and entities fight each other and you can't tell who is who and who is winning or losing. This has now spread from superhero movies to many other movies including this one. You can safely stop watching this movie after the protagonists enter the haunted house and fast forward to the denouement because you won't have missed anything.A measure of how poor modern fx have become is to compare this to John Carpenter's The Thing. Anyone who has seen both It Chapter 2 and The Thing will know the scene I'm talking about which was presumably included in It as a homage. Go back to The Thing and you will see that the scene was part of a sequence that lasted a few minutes whereas in It, it becomes lost in a sea of CGI and fx that add nothing to the film and go on for ever. It is notable that the fx in The Thing are far superior to those in It and a comparison of the crew on It and The Thing proves that today it takes many more people to produce worse fx than a film made forty years ago.I liked It Chapter 2 quite a lot until that final hour and the director even managed to coax James McAvoy to do some acting. 8 out of 10 for the first two thirds fell to 2 out of 10 for the last third.",It Chapter Two
288,rcolgan,You'll Float Two,6,8 September 2019,"Stephen King films can be difficult to get right. There are some aspects of his writing which are quite hard to put to film, especially when it's a 1,200 page novel that contains a lot of lore that's impossible to condense it to even two movies. But he also has some of the greatest horror movie scenarios ranging from the goofiness of killer cars, the terror of being trapped with your most psychotic fan and of course a killer clown from space taking the form of everyone's worst nightmares.Whilst chapter 1 of It wasn't able to include some of the more bizarre elements of the novel such as the ancient space turtle who created the universe, it instead focused on the battle for survival between a bunch of outcast kids known as the losers and an alien who wants nothing other than terrifying and eating them. Now chapter 2 takes place 27 years after the events of the first movie and the losers have all grown up and almost all have forgotten the horrors of their childhood. But when Pennywise reawakens, they are all called upon to make good of their promise to defeat the evil creature if It ever came back.Though the film seems less interested in focusing on any plot and instead plays out more like a horror anthology film. Similar to the last film, the losers are separated through most of the films run time with Pennywise cornering them all by turning in to their own personal nightmares. This ranges from anything between being trapped in a hall of mirrors to encountering an old granny, at times delivering on a level of brutality that most films usually shy away from.But in spite of the films increased budget, the scares aren't as effective this time around. There's nothing as visceral as the bloody bathroom or as frantic as Pennywise's monstrous form reaching out from a projector. Parly this is because of the absence of cinematographer Chung-hon Chung's who played a massive role in developing the nightmarish visuals of the first film. Also at 2 hours 45 minutes, there is a fair amount of repetition of the standard Pennywise formula. There's only so many times it's entertaining to see the same formula of one of the losers ending up alone, Pennywise jump scare and the loser running away unharmed before things start to get boring.As for the characters themselves, all the new cast are all individually very entertaining. James McAvoy delivers with both emotional intensity. Jessica Chastain carries all of her characters trauma from the first film. And Bill Hader is an absolute treasure who's able to make anything hilarious. However as a group they don't share the same chemistry as their childhood counterparts, mostly because similar to the original TV miniseries the dynamic of young childhood friends is just more fun to watch.And at the core of the movie once again is Bill Skarsgård's unhinged Pennywise. He's one of the few recent great movie monsters with an unsettling presence whenever he's onscreen, always moving in an unnatural twitchy way.It's just a shame that Skarsgård is often only limited to being part of brief jumpscares and isn't given enough time, with the film favouring some more generic CGI monsters instead of just giving Skarsgård more time to deliver on some psychological terror. Overall watching It kind of feels like walking through a haunted house at a carnival. You'll get a few good jump scares and you'll have some good laughs, but not offering anything which is likely to resonate in any meaningful way.",It Chapter Two

The running joke in the movie about endings was, no doubt, aimed at him.It's scares really weren't as good as the first movie, either. Like I said, it was still good but if you're expecting a big crescendo this movie falls short.

Not to say this was, by all means, a bad sequel this was way above average, I do feel the first film was better on the scary jump points that gave you chills.Not that this sequel has them, there are a few moments throughout this film that give you those moments of did that just happen and another moment when pennywise is just being seriously creepy to the point it almost like a child with sinister intentions that give you the chills, the film doesn't try to overplay it.I swear this is the creep part of the film, the casting! When you are watching the character all grown up it really freaky how well cast this film is because each act in this film acted and play the older version of the kids. It like they were cast as themselves in the first film just younger and now playing the older version in the sequel, never before have I seen this in any film, so this is well done by the Cast and director.The film itself just give some what of a background to it but doesn't really go into too much detail of why this demon ended up on the earth, though Stephen kings book actually does go into more detail which has a connection to another Stephen King book the dark tower.But as ive said It chapter two is way above average and actually a pretty good sequel, probley by now people are wondering how does the ending happen, that I can't give away because of spoilers, all I can say is it better than what teh TV series of it did, though I do feel it could have been done slighty a bit better on IT true form reveal, but I understand what they were going for with the way it ended.With talk of a possible third film, to be honest, the only direction I can see them taking is a prequel way before the loser club stumbles on the demonic clown, possible around the era of the circus or further back. It chapter two is worth watching but seriously dont take a red balloon from a strange clown you might just end up floating, as they all float down here.Dislikes: There are a few slighty pacing issues where scene jump slighty drags the film down, the scary part of the film was a little dull in this sequel which is because we're used to watching Pennywise from the first film.The big reveal of It true form was good, it was miles better than the original Tim curry It tv series, but I do feel as if it could have been designed a little more frightening, but I understand what they were going for it would have been the same if they had the look a different way.",It Chapter Two
295,IAmTheShyGuy,"""A fitting dark horror sequel with a heavy dose of powerful visuals!""",7,8 September 2019,"The year 2017's horror flick ""It"", which was a box office hit, had rewritten and upstaged the genre of horror films. For me, the film also managed to create an emotional bond with it mainly due to the smart & innocent child protagonists and the interesting way in which they defeat Pennywise, the evil clown.The story of the film begins with Pennywise striking back into the town of Derry, 27 years after the events of the first film. The group of kids, now adults who live in different cities regroup and get set to kill the clown. Will they be able to successfully kill him? The answer is shown rather impressively in the movie.This film has a more psychological touch to it with several sinister and spine-chilling scenes when compared to the more lucid screenplay in the earlier film. During the course of the film, at times we are shown the flashbacks of the protagonists wherein they encounter some of their disturbing childhood memories escaping from Pennywise.The screenplay is quite engaging but the movie feels a bit longer at the ending. During some instances you might feel bored, more when each of the protagonists try their own approach to kill the clown. The film also has some comedy dialogues which somewhat brings down the horror factor.The director has ensured quite well in ensuring that each of the adult cast members have similarity to their younger counterparts. Especially the casting of James Ransone as Eddie is spot on! The dark cinematography and visual effects are really powerful and effective in bringing out some stimulating moments. The background music is exceptional and gives you absolute chills & thrills!Overall, this film is a fitting sequel to the 2017 blockbuster and is a must watch if you are a connoisseur of psychological horror flicks!",It Chapter Two
296,liderc,So bad it's funny...,1,29 February 2020,"Already after the first scene, the only truly apalling scene in the movie, I wanted to switch It off. And I should have. The pointless but sadistically detailed depiction of a hate crime, which also looks and feels like directly lifted from the 80s or 90s (the root of the conflict, the hairstyles, the clothing, the queeny, weak gay men vs the tough, braindead hetero men stereotypes), doesn't make any sense at all. It might actually be the rebirth of It, as it feeds on the evil in the small backwater town, but the uninformed viewer never gets much of a chance to understand that. But as the script generally is full of holes, meaningless hints or pointless ""horror"", this is simply what you get. The only thing really made clear is that men are only allowed two things: die or mope around as depressed losers, dreaming of romantic relationships which will never happen.The rest of the movie is mostly unintentional comedy. It now looks and feels like a clownish freak or  who loves whacky costumes and fake gore. Large insects with clown faces or small town weirdos acting as his standins are not that scary either, they are either funny or pathetic (or somewhere inbetween). The scene where the female protagonist is locked in a restroom stall with her menstrual blood sloshing around everywhere and some silly creeps shouting obscenities through the door really had me chuckling, as it felt just stupid. The two stupid, self-hating gay guys, who in the end nearly died adoring a puppy (""So cute!"") before one of them actually dies with probably the most hilarious last words on his lips ever uttered ranged somewhere between homophobic comedy and sarcastic black humor. Actually, most of the overblown ""horror"" in the movie felt like a black comedy making fun of schlocky CGI horror fests.But, after the unintenionally hilarious final death blow to It (remember: simply call evil beings from outer space who were even too much to handle for tough Native American sorcery ""clowns"" and they are gone for good - life can be so easy sometimes!) we get some very superficial hints that the adults are happy now (except the gay guy, of course), and that's it. The story, I mean. Why it took the lousy team of filmmakers so long to tell this trashy 80s comic book plot is another mystery never explained.If you liked the first movie, or if you liked the original novel, or even if you simply value your time and sanity, stay far away from this dull mess.But remember,. before you die, tell everybody who's hot that they are hot or carve their initials into wood while weeping - if you are gay. If you are straight, just enjoy the good things in life like saying ""I love you"" on the telephone (for no apparant reason) or sunbathing with your equally hot partner on your yacht. And if a monster shows up, just say ""Clown"". Perfect, another lesson learned!",It Chapter Two
297,tresm87,"What should've been an excellent follow up to a tremendous first installment, devolves into a dragging mess of tones and miserable cgi with few redeeming factors.",6,23 November 2019,"6.4/10 I absolutely adored the first film adaptation in 2017 and I'll be honest in saying the original tv movie adaptation was average at best imo. I was extremely excited for this chapter 2 film since the first came out with high hopes especially when the cast was revealed for the adult losers club. Now that I finally saw this new addition, i have to say I thought this was pretty ridiculous and an utter let down. While it has its decent moments revolving around some charming characters of the adult losers club, and a few interesting Pennywise scares, i found this to be bizarrely scattered, and at times dull. Story wise it's straightforward and very cliche with unbelievably stupid jump scares sprinkled into every 10 min with seriously some of the most laughable cgi you can imagine. Some of the concepts they thought up had to be attempts at comedy. There were some comedic elements in the first film but not during the scares as much. The tone is constantly clashing between extravagant scares and dumb jokes to where it is not coherent as a film. The cast saves this film and gives you a reason to care especially Bill Hader and James McAvoy. I felt Bill Skarsgard was underutilized massively in this and replaced with these mostly terrible cgi jumpscares. While the conclusion does have the same emotional connection as the first and the same high stakes, i couldn't help but feel like it was a missed opportunity overall. Maybe if we finally get that supercut there will be added scenes to rectify some of chapter 2's disappointment. Until then I'll stick with the first film.",It Chapter Two

The film gives us a lot of chills and heart beating moments but it does also have unnecessary arcs, like we definitely didn't want Bowers to return. The 169 minute running time could have definitely been trimmed or used better.Bill Hader steals the show in this one and his arc is the best written one too.

304,cappiethadog,Limbo it,7,20 September 2019,"Pennywise the Clown calls himself ""The Eater of Worlds"". The same can be said about writer/director whose ""The Big Chill"" is a near-remake of ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"", the debut feature film by John Sayles, made four years earlier. The filmmaker, to this day, sticks by his claim that he had no prior knowledge of Sayles' micro-budgeted indie, despite both films having carbon copy premises. Seven thirty-something adults who formed a clique during their hippie years at college, reunite at a summer house and gripe about the agony of being yuppie sellouts. The only difference is that in ""The Big Chill"", the ex-countercultural warriors return under somber circumstances, a memorial service for their friend Alex Marshall(Kevin Costner), the diehard who accepted too late that the dream was over. Since Costner didn't survive the final cut, the body in the coffin can be anyone or anything you want it to be; the body, for cineastes, is a filmic body, ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"", a celluloidal twin that few people knew about. After Harold Cooper(Kevin Kline) delivers the eulogy, Karen Bowen(JoBeth Williams) takes her place at the organ and plays Alex's favorite song, The Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"". For the dead, it's happiness. For the writer/director John Sayles, it's credit. At the gravesite, Nick(William Hurt) has to wrangle Meg(Mary Kay Place), who walks in the opposite direction of the ceremonial plot, but she gets there, and says goodbye to the deceased before they lower the coffin. On an extra-diegetical level, it looks as if Alex's friends are hiding the body; a secret pact made by these Secaucus Seven dopplegangers. The camera pulls back from the burial site. ""The Big Chill"" is fleeing from the scene of the crime. It's a pet cemetery of sorts. ""IT: Volume Two"" brings ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" back to life. Call it creative license; call it whatever you like, but something went down in 1983 and ""The Big Chill"" is the only suspect.Echoes of ""The Big Chill abound in ""IT"", Stephen King's magnum opus, released three years after ******'s requiem for the baby boomer generation. There are fortune cookies in ""The Big Chill"". The fortune cookies inform ""IT: Chapter Two"". Over brunch, Karen regales her college pals with her recent Hawaiian adventure. At a local Chinese restaurant, girlfriends in tow, she encountered this very disturbing fortune: ""You'll never amount to anything."" Sarah Cooper(Glenn Close), Harold's wife, responds: ""I don't believe it."" The operative word is ""it"". The menace followed Karen back to South Carolina. ""The Big Chill"" works as a human horror film; it's the idealism of their activist-oriented youth coming back to haunt them. Michael(Jeff Goldblum) reads his fortune: ""Friendship is the bread of life, but money is the honey."" Again, it's Sarah who replies. ""Even fortune cookies are getting cynical,"" she says. Cynical like them, their older selves; capitalists all, with mortgages, fancy cars, and stock options. The fortune cookie is the elephant in the room. Alex's foolish idealism is what killed him. Neither Michael, who wrote an article in their college newspaper about the physics whiz turning down the Rutledge fellowship, nor Sarah, who knew him in the biblical sense, comment on Alex's epiphany, a belated dawning attributable to his suicide, that the fortune cookie message accurately prophesized. The fortune cookies in Andy Muschietti's ""IT: Chapter Two"" are blunter. The Derry kids, all grown up, catch up on old times at Jade of the Orient, a Chinese restaurant, after Mike Hanlon(Isiah Mustafa) calls them back home when the cyclical nature of their haunted town's child murders rejuvenates itself, right on schedule. Instead of a fortune, The Loser Club members receive single words that they recombine in vain to form a coherent sentence. The missing link, a proper noun, that Beverly Marsh(Jessica Chastain) grips between her fingers, is added to the group fray over meaning. Beverly organizes the jumble of words: ""Guess Stanley could not cut it."" Pennywise(Bill Skarsgard) ensures that the elephant in the room is accounted for. Stanley Uris(Andy Bean), just like Alex, slit his wrists in a bathtub. The fortune cookies act as a conduit between both films. One cookie contains a bat wing. Are there bats in ""The Big Chill""? Yes. The group hears Chloe scream and rush up the stairs to her room. One cookie contains an eyeball attached to octopi-like tentacles. Does the human organ and mollusk in concert also make an appearance in ""The Big Chill""? Yes. Nick watches, on television, a black and white movie in which men ward off a giant octopus from boarding their destroyer with blowtorches. The scene comes from Robert Gordon's ""IT Came from Beneath the Sea"". Muschietti riffs, with or without the source material as a guide. Every generation, Pennywise returns to Derry. In the 1983 film, Harold, the shoe company impresario, and Sam Weber(Tom Berenger), a Tom Selleck-like television actor, make the bed, and as they straighten out the sheets, we learn that Sarah's husband plans to open up his ""twenty-seventh or twenty-eighth"" store. Twenty-seven is the magic number; twenty-seven years is how long it takes for the clown to awaken from his hibernation.As the popular wisdom went, ""IT"" was unadaptable for the big screen, due to the graphic violence that Pennywise committed against minors. With the rare exception, such as John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13(1976), in which a little girl gets shot in the chest near an ice cream truck, the onscreen annihilation of a child was rare. The body count in the Stephen King novel proved to be a major stumbling block. Original programming on HBO and other cable outlets, not to mention, online streaming services, were options unavailable to the group who bought from King the film rights, so ""IT"" was brought to network television and condensed into an abridged two-part miniseries, directed by Tommy Lee Wallace. The iconic scene, in which a yellow slickered boy negotiates and loses not just the paper boat, but his life, looks downright Disneyesque when measured against the no-holds barred standards of violence in contemporary moviemaking. It's a bloodless scene. Pennywise(Tim Curry) grabs Georgie's arm and bares his sharp teeth, and then a dissolve to an eagle-eye shot of the boy's flower-laden casket. The blood is dislocated to a black and white picture of Georgie in Bill's photo album, drenched with oozing red body fluid. Georgie's blood, in ""IT"", remains pooled on a rain-soaked street. This time, when Pennywise grabs the boy, there is no dissolve. The audience is confronted with, albeit fantasy, the intimacy of a frenzied child in jeopardy, rendered in a graphic honesty that was once deemed unthinkable. The clown has Georgie's arm firmly clamped in its jaws. There is a cut. We're spared the cleaving of his arm. But the surgery is implied, when we see the boy crawling away from the storm drain with a missing limb, before being dragged back by an alien-like elongated arm. Pennywise, in ""IT: Chapter Two"", bites the face of a sad friendless little girl under the bleachers, and then, at a carnival, he breaks through a fun house mirror and eviscerates a boy in front of Bill Denbrough(James McAvoy), who is shielded from the carnage by arterial spray that coats the glass in red entire. Is this necessary? Isn't suggestive violence enough? Ugliness is in the eye of the beholder.Pennywise is anything and anyone; he can shapeshift into both monsters and people. Georgie Denbrough(Jackson Robert Scott) is the clown's favorite bit of mimicry, because it tortures Bill, who is coerced into a guilt-ridden admission of health on that fateful rainy day. As Beverly Marsh(Sophia Lillis), in a flashback, Pennywise adopts the girl's feminine wiles and fools Ben Hanscom(Jeremy Ray Taylor) into leaning in for a kiss. The clown can also transcend time and space; it has the ability to subsume the two-dimensional body of Bill's mother in a film slide, and when the projector's rapid-fire motion turn the slides into a home movie, the clown goes 3D and vacates the filmic world. It goes after Beverly. It can be anywhere and do anything, such as take celluloidal form. Beverly lives close to a glen. The clown, hypothetically, could be Glenn Close, whose Sarah Cooper can be, at times, mercurical. This is when. The old woman(Joan Gregson) who lives in the Marsh's old apartment, stops moving, freezes, as if her batteries suddenly ran out, while having a cup of tea with Beverly, before resuming her rote niceties. In ""The Big Chill"", Sarah stands motionless in front of an open refrigerator; she chooses nothing, as if she forgot what it takes to be human. During Alex's wake, at the buffet table, she tells Michael: ""We give first preference to people who kill themselves in one of our bathrooms."" That's a mean thing to say; that's Pennywise.In the made-for-television version of ""IT"", Ben(John Ritter) says: ""Limbo, how low can you go?"" as he ducks under an aluminum rolling door. ""Limbo"" was a 1999 film directed by John Sayles. Georgie could have caught up with his boat if he did the limbo instead of hitting his forehead on a road closure sign.""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" fought its way out of the pinebox and dirt.And returned as a construction batter.",It Chapter Two
305,anupapu8,ll time favorite Horror Movie.,9,6 September 2019,"IT CHAPTER : 2 - Damn this movie was so satisfying and fulfilling. i loved it. It gave me a completion which satisfied my inner heart. A satisfaction almost on the level of completion what Harry Potter 8 and Dark Knight Rises gave me (well yes slightly less than those two movies , but you can understand what i am trying to say). Its has now became my most favorite Horror Movie of all time.Chapter 1 was a really awesome movie by itself. And to top that was almost an impossible hurdle. And from most of the reactions and reviews it seems like the audience is not exactly satisfied with the film. I don't understand what they were expecting. For me the last movie in any series must give you the feeling that this was the way it must have ended. Just like Dark Knight Rises was not needed to be like Dark Knight. It had to be something altogether different because it was the concluding movie and it did that particular thing brilliantly. That same thing is now done by IT CHAPTER : 2 , at least for me.OK first and foremost i am gonna address the things which has been criticized most about the movie by the reviewers.1] Was it a movie too long than it actually should have been ? No. Not at all . I was never bored. Yes there were 1 or 2 scenes which could have been edited. But that would have shortened the movie by may be only 5 mins. Which would have been totally meaningless. In-fact i was so much involved in the atmosphere of the movie that i could have happily seen 15 more mins of this movie.2] Was the D-Aging of Child Artists for flashback scenes too distracting ? Hell No. I wouldn't even has recognized those effects if i haven't read about the same thing in the reviews before watching the film.3] Was the ending too bad? No No No. I don,t understand why the ending of this movie (which is also the ending of the book) has been disliked by so many people. Its good. Simple yet effective.4] Lastly did the flashback scenes were unnecessary for the film? Are you kidding me. Those were some of the greatest scenes of the movie. So great that if those scenes would have been in the first movie instead of this one than the first one could been a better movie by itself. But that would have made this one lesser good.So that's about wrap up all the complaints. Now about what i liked? The VISUAL EFFECTS mixed with PRACTICAL EFFECTS and PRODUCTION DESIGN was the top thing about this movie. Oscar nomination worthy. The 70m$ spent on the movie (doubling the budget of the first one) was clearly visible on the screen. And the money has been spent in a very innovative way. This one is also definitely the most Beautiful (in a horrific , scary and dark way) looking movie of all time.Then obviously comes the Cast. Bill Skarsgård has made Pennywise so much his own as much as Heath ledger had made Joker of his own. There is nothing much to say about him. He was just out of this world in a very crazy way. But the standout performance of this film was Bill Hader. His comic timing, was 200% spot-on. There were so many awkward situation where the writer has given him the jokes that any other actor could have done wrong. But not him. I also loved the fact that neither the director nor James McAvoy & Jessica Chastain tried to use their Stardom too much. They both just mixed-up with the bigger assemble cast and never tried to chew the scenes anymore than needed. Not a single actor has done a job which is below good.The background score was a little underdone than the first part. i would have liked more creepiness. But it was not bad at all. Same goes for the cinematography which goes perfectly with the movie but didn't stand out as the first movie did.The last showdown ? O my my. It was so good. So great. Pretty long (in a very satisfying kind of way where you don't want something to end very quickly). i cant praise enough that particular act. It was heart crunching, in a literal way.And than there was the extended ending. So emotional. Such a tribute to true friendship and nature of scarifies. Very very very fulfilling.O yes, almost forgot (because i never watch Horror movies as just Horror movies), this one definitely had larger number (and better too) of horror scenes than the first one. I judged that by the number of screams i was hearing from the audience.So just watch it8.8/10by ANuP APu KuMaR",It Chapter Two
306,BlueSkies765,Better when rewatched,10,11 April 2020,"A second time viewing Chapter 2. What can I say? I love it. It along with Halloween are my favorite horror franchises. They were the first horror movies I've seen as a kid in the 90s. Initially I felt like Chapter 2 was the weakest in the franchise but it has grown on me. I think you can like all the parts for different reasons.Initially I didn't like the long runtime. 3 hours for movies was popular in 2019. I sometimes feel a movie takes itself too seriously and it makes me not really want to watch it. However as a fan of IT it's actually a treat. You get more time to enjoy the movie. Also it's different watching it at home than in the theater when it first came out. You can split this up in two viewings. This is actually enjoyable as it feels like you're watching 2 movies for the price of 1.I also initially wasn't really impressed with the story. A criticism of the 1990 It was that the first part with the kids was better than with the adults, because their bond felt more natural. Because I wasn't really in the mood for this movie also because because back then I felt the 1990 version is superior, I wasn't really locked into the story. The chemistry is actually terrific in this version. The Losers Club have that special bond that made It 1990 a classic. A group of abandoned people must fight darkness and only have a small group of true friends to help them. That has always been the heart of It. Even though it's 27 years later the Losers Club are still as close as ever. This is the result of good acting and good writing. With almost 3 hours worth of movie a lot of time is spend giving the characters depth.
What I also liked is the humor. This is criticized but I liked it. A bit of comic relief made the friendship feel more genuine but also because it's a movie after all so a bit of comedy never hurts it.Lastly Pennywise was terrifying in this one. Always the menacing presence that somehow always seem to be present. I liked how there's different scenes with Pennywise than the 1990 version. There were some parts that are familiar but overall it was a fresh story.A very entertaining and solid sequel and I'm sure more fans will appreciate it more as time goes by.",It Chapter Two
307,Dannyboi94,"A great movie, that could have been even better...",8,7 September 2019,"IT Chapter 1 was, in my opinion, a fantastic movie, not because of the scares (despite not having many), but because of the characters. The kids in that movie were just flawless, they worked so well off each other. I didn't think the grown-up versions wouldn't even come close to the chemistry that their younger counterparts had, and I wasn't wrong. Despite having a brilliant cast as the older versions, they just didn't have that same spark. Now this can be because they haven't seen each other in 27 years, most of them are estranged, and are living very different lives. Of course they wouldn't be the same as they were as children, but I felt this dragged it down a little. But despite this, every actor played their role perfectly, with the highlights being Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak. These two were flawless as the older versions of their characters. The other actors, were also very good, but you would expect the likes of James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain to give great performances. And like the previous movie, Bill Skarsgård nails it as Pennywise. You can tell he inherited his family's trend of playing psychotic characters, because he is so good here, he is almost too good. The character of Henry Bowers was pointless, and added nothing to the film, he could have just been cut out completely.The movie has tons of pros and cons, with ""some"" of the direction, cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting being the main highlights of the film. It is a stunning looking movie, from the lighting to the camera angles. But there are also tons of bad things about the movie, that stopped it from becoming better.One thing is that, it over uses CGI. While in some scenes, they clearly used practical effects, and make-up, because some of the creature designs are remarkable, its just a shame that some of the scenes that could have been terrifying, were filled with unnecessary CGI, especially at the end. Another problem I had with the movie, is its pacing. The movie seems to cut and dash between scenes, despite the movie being ridiculously long, like seriously, this movie is almost as long as Avengers: Endgame, that isn't normal for a horror film. The film drags in places, yet, I cant think of what scenes they could have cut out, because the scenes shown, were needed, but at the same time, while I was watching, I felt like they had cut tons of the film out. Some scenes were too quick, and felt rushed.But my biggest complaint was that it tried to put TOO much comedy in there. The first chapter was funny at times, but the comedy was well done, here there are some terrifying and thrilling scenes, and they are bogged down with quick one-liners. It ruined those scenes. Why the director did this is a mystery.IT Chapter 2 is a good film, it has some great moments, but also some bad ones. The scenes with the younger versions were the best scenes, and some of the creepy eerie moments, where Pennywise was tormenting children, were all perfect. But the film suffers from the typical shove CGI here, shove CGI there, and it really brings it down, as well as the pacing. But despite that, I still enjoyed it.7.6/10",It Chapter Two

Now was this better than Chapter 1, In my honest opinion....... yeah.I think it was better, to me I like the connections the adults have with each other and it really got to give credit to the cast. Bill Hader of course was funny and awesome in the role, no matter what he gave a good performance. And of course Bill Skarsgard was phenomenal in this film because, no matter what he does he always steals the show. The way they beat Pennywise though I can agree it was kind of lazy.

313,C-Younkin,Better than expected,8,6 September 2019,"Hiya GeorgieIt Chapter 2 is the thrilling conclusion to Stephen King's classic clown novel which finds the losers club needing to go back to Derry after 27 years cause they did not kill Pennywise like they thought they did.And first off let's just say that Pennywise has been a terrific villain through all this. Yes, clowns remind us all of serial killers anyway, there's not much Krusty can do about that, but if you also get one who knows your fears there really is no stoppage to the torments one could inflict.Bill Skarsgard has really dug in here, he's having fun, and i'm loving how over the top he allows the voice and mannerisms to get.The losers club comes back, this time as adults, in fine form.Sure guys like James McAvoy, who carries Bill's guilt over the loss of his brother Georgie perfectly, and Bill Hader, whose the wise-ass Richie of the group, stand out but everyone here is allowed their moment.And there are a lot of moments here. This is a lot of movie. Sometimes it's going for horror, sometimes it's comic, sometimes it's a coming of age drama, and in the case of the friend-zoned Ben and the only girl of the group, Beverly, there's a rootable romance here too.One of the criticisms that has been labeled against this is that it's not a scare on top of scare style movie but I think that's cause this movie is smarter and way more ambitious than that.This is a follow-up to the highest grossing horror flick of all time-why not going huge with it?The losers club themselves are still a great bunch of guys and lady and it'a a huge laugh seeing them pick up right where they left off- ribbing each other, bringing up old memories, regretting the fact that as life often goes, we do lose contact with even close friends.You also never see anyone of them with a cup of coffee- they're so high strung just by living in Derry that even tossing a red bull in the middle of them might result in explosion.Director Andy Muschietti throws in even more creatures this time around- heads walking on spiders legs, decomposing bodies, statues, things just come alive with big booming voices.Muscietti worked pretty well with these overgrown, gangly looking monsters in his first horror flick, Mama, but he has vastly improved the facial distortions, the creatures entrances, nearly every jump scare is part of a grander scene that just looks like nightmare fuel.Like that scene with the old lady from the trailer is 10 times more creepy in this movie and is just a masterclass of suspense.Yes at nearly 3 hours all of this can feel relentless but he moves these horrifying creatures around like a chessmaster and my heart pumped and my jaw dropped and that's no small feat.I was also someaht worried about the ending here- mostly cause part 2 of the miniseries ends with kind of dud oh, they look like they're fighting something from Honey I Shrunk the Kids.But Muscietti proves to completely understand psychological torment by movie's end and continuing to incorporate that in the final showdown is a smart move.Story-wise this also does a hell of a lot- adding in a Native American subplot, telekinesis, tokens, and some really brutal acts of homophobia and spousal abuse that ties in later with a message about bullying.I'm out of breath just trying to explain all this movie tries to do, so while it's not always scary and is definitely long winded,It wants to be a lot of things, most surprising of all is it makes you want to call up a close friend you haven't spoken to in a while..if you have one. That shows this isn't just about the scares but about the characters too. On both counts I was more than satisfied.If you liked this check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more",It Chapter Two

315,Willie-12,Second Time The First Part Was Better Than The Second Part,5,25 November 2019,"They say that most people learn from their mistakes. Maybe that's true, I don't know. However, what is less true I believe, is someone learning from someone else's mistakes. No one wants to think that they're susceptible to the same potential problems as someone else. And I think that's one of the issues when it comes to It Chapter Two. Andy Muschietti (director) and Gary Dauberman (writer) had the example of It (1990), the television miniseries that was very popular, to learn from. The main problem the miniseries had was that when the makers decided to split the film into two distinct parts (instead of interweaving the kids' story with the adults' story like the book), the first part was largely considered better than the the second part. In other words, the kids' part of the story (as well as the child actors' performances) were better and more interesting than the part of the story with the adults. Well guess what? Muschietti and Dauberman, knowing this, decided to go the same route, and split the part of the story with the children up from the part of the story with the adults. And the results were pretty much the same. Most people consider It (2017) to be much better than It Chapter Two (2019). Including me. IC2 is a number of things. Unfortunately none of them are positive. It is too long. It is too convoluted. And, quite simply, it is no where near as good as the first chapter. I had a feeling that this was going to be the case. Even when one of the story lines for a certain adult gets shortened before the rest of the adults get together, it's not enough to lighten the load with too many characters. And the problem is, the makers of the film obviously felt as if each character had to have equal screen time with equal scary events happening to each one. And going through those stories one by one, in that manner, takes away any kind of surprise that may have otherwise existed. And when there aren't any real surprises in a movie that's supposed to be scary...well let's just say that tends to neutralize the frightening parts of the film. In other words, it's poison. How disappointing. Perhaps, if anyone ever decides to adapt this story again into a film (honestly I, and a host of others really hope that never happens) they will try and tell the two parts of the story the same way Stephen King tells the story in the novel...simultaneously.",It Chapter Two
316,CriticalOfEverything,Disappointing.,5,12 September 2019,"I don't know why, but there's just something about It Chapter Two that feels off. The casting is great, there are some decent scares and few good scenes, but it just feels incredibly average and a far cry from the original. It's bigger in scale yet feels smaller, it just doesn't have the same impact that the first did. It continues what the first did in blending horror, humour and heart together, but I guess it just doesn't do it as well? I don't know. Like this is honestly the one movie where I am genuinely confused as to why I feel this way. If you enjoyed it then that's fine, but personally I just didn't like it that much for some reason.",It Chapter Two

The film could easily last 2 hours 20/30.-The way IT died.

When the members of the loser grew up and left the town, their memory of what had happened became more and more dim and even began to forget. It's just like in reality, we use avoidance to face the fear and responsibility we don't want to take on, and we use forgetfulness to hide the past we don't want to look back on, but in this way, we also lose the happiness we feel.
As the movie shows, when they come back to the town, their fear and pain in the town all come back, but more importantly, their happy time in the town, their unforgettable friendship, all come back.
Life is bound to go through all kinds of experiences and sufferings that you don't want to face, but if you don't want to admit that this is part of your life shadow, then how can life be complete?

321,ha77y73ad97,Lost a little heart by the end,7,13 September 2019,"This is certainly a second chapter to a wider story and not just a sequal for the sake of grabbing money by the studio. As most people who know the story of the infamous Stephen King novel it chapter 2 was planned from the start and the movie certainly proves that!The casting of all the losers club were prefect, to match adults to kids is rarely scene normally its the other way around, from James McAvoy to Bill Hader to Jay Ryan as Ben (honestly one of the stand out choices) the club bands together to fight off Pennywise once more. The first time the adult club meet really brings back the reason why the first film was such a success. The chemistry of the whole cast mirrors the first prefectly from the reactions to jokes and heartfelt conversations sitting around a table bringing the characters to the forefront. And special mention to clown of course as Bill Skarsgard kills it as the creepy and torturing demon that lives beneath Derry. Again living up to the first chapter and the original in another prefect casting from the start.For me the first 2 acts the the better of the film again centring around the characters and what Derry/ Pennywise means to them. They all differ in their reaction to receiving the call from Mike that after 27 years the clown has returned. Bill Hader steals this part with the nervous reaction of throwing up just before hes comedy road show. James McAvoy has come a long way from his turn in Narnia from other masterpieces along the way but to turn a stutter on and off through fear after the call came though shows a total understanding of the character. Again when they first meet back in Derry is again prefect direction and casting. The second act solely consists of facing their fears from the first chapter, Bill buying hes old bike (with a great cameo from Stephen King) to find the boat of Georgies, Beverley finding the postcard in her childhood flat (with possibly the best scene in the film with a creepy woman who now lives in the flat with the trademark style zombie/ demons that King loves to add to these stories), Eddie finally facing his germs in the basement of the pharmacy, Bill retrieving his year book page with another grewsome incounter with Pennywise, Mike already having his 'token' and Richie facing the fear of the clown during rhe first encounter whilst they were split up.Then this is where the movie falls down in my opinion they went for the big cgi budget final confrontation which totally detracks from the character building for 1 and 2/3s of this movie series. This just leaves a lot to be thought about during this scene and with the death of Eddie was timed well but still with the fighting a 30 feet Pennywise detracks from the gravitas of this.The final scene is a great piece of art as the adults stare at there reflection and transition to their younger selves with Eddie and Stanley by their sides. With a movie that consisted of more good than bad it was a satisfying ending to a 2 part movie but with a fair amount things that could be improved. This the possibility of a supercut with extra footage on the hirizon i wouldnt mind seeing that!",It Chapter Two
322,DeadMansTrousers,Mediocrity at it's finest,6,7 September 2019,"The casting of this was great and I was hoping for a good send off for this story. Sadly Ch 2 is mediocre, sluggish, and too long. As a King fan I am familiar with this story so I know how the book ended and I didn't expect the movie to be exactly like the book but some of the changes they made were so different from what King wrote that it just doesn't sit well.*SPOILERS AHEAD*The losers kill pennywise by forcing the creature into a baby's form and then tearing it's heart out and smashing it as a group. The reason I have an issue with this being the ending is we see the characters we are supposed to love and relate to who have been bullied their entire lives become what they hate the most, bullies. They have to defeat the dark by becoming dark themselves. I personally didn't like this and I don't understand the point of turning the losers into bullies to kill pennywise. I'm not sure why they chose to turn the losers into what they stood against so they could defeat pennywise but I thought it was a bad ending. I would've rather seen the ending how it was in the book.All of that aside parts 1&2 combined equal almost 5 & a half hours, there is too much unnecessary material here for the average viewers and they should've just had one long movie.

324,Benslie,A good followup to the first one,8,7 September 2019,"First of all, the adult cast was outstanding playing the older versions of the kids. Yes, some of them may not look like them physically but they still knocked their parts out of the water. For me there wasn't a weak actor in this film but the two that stood out the most out to me was Bill Hader, who plays adult Richie, and James Ransone, who plays adult Eddie, because these two characters already were standouts in the first movie and they helped cement that status with what they did with their characters in this film. Bill Skarsgard once again was great as Pennywise and still doesn't help with mine or anybody's fear of clowns. Now, this film is two-hours and forty-nine-minutes long with credits and two-hours and forty-five-minutes without credits and I'm going, to be honest with you at certain points you start to feel that time. There were some scenes that went on far too long that I think they could have cut down and also certain scenes that could have just been left out entirely. Apparently, this film was originally four-hours long and you can kind of see where they had to cut certain things out. But I will say that there are points in this film where you feel like a fly on the wall in this film and the time just flies by. I think that in this film they used more CGI compared to the first one and honestly it doesn't look that great. This isn't a spoiler cause the kid actors have said this in interviews but they had to de-age the kids in this film so they matched what they looked like during the first film and you don't really notice it. Although I will say that in one scene a character doesn't sound the same and it's pretty obvious. But for the rest of the CGI, it just wasn't the greatest. In the end, this film is a good follow-up to the first film with stellar performances and a great story.",It Chapter Two
325,Amthermandes,Pennywise isn't freakin' kidding.,9,6 September 2019,"It: Chapter 2 was almost everything I wanted it to be. Almost.The sequel feels like a direct continuation of the first part, only slightly amped up with more scares and intensity. There were some let-downs however, so I'll start with those:-Yes, it's long, but it didn't really feel like it until they started wrapping things up at the end.
-There was also too much use of CGI, albeit there being some really awesome, scenes with it (like, for example, a brilliant reference to a certain John Carpenter classic... ""Trick r' Treat"" anyone?).
-More scares indeed, but some felt either too forced or predictable.
-There was a bit too much profanity, which isn't something I'd normally criticize, but much of it felt too unnecessary.
-As far as I could tell, there weren't any, or as many, ""subtle scares"" as the first one.Aside from these nit-picks, the movie does not disappoint. It dives more into the emotional attachment the characters have to each other, and to It. Unlike the classic 90's version, it also explains more of It's origins. Not only does it follow the first part well, it also uses plot elements and themes in the book, and twists it into something new. So it's so much like the book, yet, it's not, and in a satisfying manner. And while a few scares may be a tad flat, it's still quite intense. And yet, like the first part as well, manages to maintain a balance of horror and comedy. It's more brutal than the first, and just about as fun. It was relieving to find the way they ended it all in the movie was handled VERY well, considering how strange and cerebral it was in the book (don't look into the light!!!).And if you heard, or read, any rumors about it possibly being the ""bloodiest film of all time,"" don't get your hopes up. It does have its moments, but it's nowhere near ""Evil Dead"" or ""Dead Alive."" Or even ""A Nightmare on Elm Street.""""It"" started well, and ended well. Fans of the first should walk away happy as a clown....after an appetizing dish of child.",It Chapter Two
326,joshuabush-34620,Great sequel and adaption!,9,7 October 2020,"I was floored with what they did for the sequel. I think they nailed it, but I do think they could've toned down the humor and the CGI was bad. Other than that, awesome movie and adaption of the second half of the novel.",It Chapter Two
327,GavWaskett,Why does Pennywise hate playing tag? Because he's always IT.,7,13 September 2020,"Now, I didn't even bother reviewing It, the first film, I think I stuck it at the end of four short reviews about Christmas films, I really didn't think much of it and couldn't understand why such a fuss was made of it. But I will always admit when I'm wrong and watching the second film has made me re-evaluate the whole pair of films. Taken together It and It Chapter Two make an excellent film, they are two parts of a story and need each film to compliment the other one. The first one didn't work for me on its own but put with this one, they made for five hours of enjoyable and well-acted horror.
This is set 27 years after the first film and Pennywise is back and up to his usual murderous mayhem. The first victim being some poor s@d who has already had a rubbish night and from then on, the cuter you are the more likely you are to get bitten/stabbed/faced ripped off!James McAvoy is superb as Bill, the Losers leader who is dragged back by Mike(Isaiah Mustafa) who is the only one not to have left the town of Derry to start anew, also along for the ride is Jessica Chastain's Beverly, whose life is never easy, Bill Hader as funny boy turned comedian Richie, James Ransome nervous Eddie, Jay Ryan's somewhat buffer Ben and Andy Bean's terrified Stanley.The whole ride is bloodthirsty and nerve wracking with Bill Skarsgard superbly evil Pennywise still tormenting and stalking the now adult Losers whilst getting his kicks with random Derryites. This film is about the quest to end Pennywise and to find themselves. It has some gutting moments, some jump out of your seat moments and some excellent interplay between the leads, especially between Mr Hader and Mr Ransome, who bring Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer's Richie and Eddie to emotional life in the adult world.The film switches between adult and child, between reality and fantasy, between horror and comedy whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat.It has made me change my mind about the first film, in fact I would heartedly recommend both It and It Chapter Two to anyone. Fantastically acted by both younger and older actors and actresses and I really wasn't happy about getting up to go to the loo in the middle of the night after this one. A second chapter worth of 15/20 for both films.",It Chapter Two
328,Tanay_LKO,"Fair Scare, short of a few 'pennies wiser'",7,29 September 2019,"This review is delayed, yet it seems befitting to talk about the sequel, cinematic adaptation of one of the most revered horror stories in modern English literature.Part two, or say the continuation of the prior story, is 'not' all about the terrifying clown. Set about 27 years after the horrifying clown-spirit Pennywise was sent to hiding by 7 lanky teenagers (a.k.a. ""Losers""), the haunting resurfaces to the town of Derry - recharged and more sinister. Bounded by their blood oath, those teenagers - now adults, reluctantly return to their hometown for the end game. Though, it shall take more than their presence for those losers to be united. As they became what they were running away from, together recollect an unsettling, fearful past to nab the 'fear' of the present.Scary, graphic and jump-scare thrills make most of ""IT: Chapter 2"". Much like its first-part, Director Andy Muschietti (""IT"", ""Mama"") and horror screenwriter Gary Dauberman carefully excerpt and modernize the even darker novel by Stephen King (who makes a rare cameo subtly criticizing his own story-endings). The allegory of facing fears as children to fight until death is remarkably executed. Given the master casting choices (with prowess and literal lookalikes to teenage actors) which include - Jessica Chastain (the girl-with-issues Beverly), James McAvoy (the stuttering Bill), Jay Ryan (the fat-boy Ben), Isaiah Mustafa (the black orphan Mike), Bill Hader and James Ransome (the latter two being brilliant as foul-mouthed Richie and hypochondriac Eddie) along with Bill ""The Pennywise"" Skarsgard, make worth spending nearly 3 hours in a theatre.However, good an effort, this film feels deliberate. The terror-tainted background score (Benjamin Wallfisch, ""Blade Runner 2049"") is well-crafted with conventional operatic overtures and unsettling string accompaniments, yet there's too much of it. Then, just like King puts it, the film falters in concluding its characterization properly, making it look like a rush job of ending on heartfelt introspection. Though, it doesn't nose dive from its own previous benchmark of horror and would get your heart-pounding and even, laughing-out-loud on more instants.So, there's no reason to leave this follow-up act out of your watch list for it doesn't (again, thankfully) do a ""Hangover 3"". Yet, for a few ""pennies wiser"", it would have been exceptional to match ""IT"" itself.",It Chapter Two
329,jackson_ro,It Chapter Two,6,14 February 2020,"Although in itself an entertaining horror flick, it doesnt get anywhere close to the height of the first movie. The sequel feels forced, as if film was constructed just to fulfill the promise of the characters from the first film. What made the first It so good was not just the plot, but the setting, the mood and the teenage characters, as if we were transported back to our younger days and were forced to face our darkest fears, but now that the characters grew older, it just stopped feeling special. The sequel's plot is also way too straightforward and fails to tell any backstories of Pennywise. The bulk of the film still relies heavily on the goodwill from the first film which is really a shame considering It was one of my favorite films of that year. Really enjoy the Stephen King Easter eggs scattered throughout the film, at least that made it a little more special.",It Chapter Two
330,darkwizard404,Letdown,5,7 September 2019,This one was a letdown compared to the first one. People loved the first one mainly for Pennywise and he was barely in this movie. The only time you'll have a good look at him is in the climax. The rest of the movie is pretty much flashbacks from the previous film.Most of the scares in the film were because of random creatures and not Pennywise. This is not what I expected. They should have given Pennywise more screen time. Acting wise they were all fine in their roles but sadly the pacing and the direction weren't up to the mark.Overall it's an average film which could have easily finished within two hours. It was unnecessarily dragged precisely the second half. It's a one-time watch.,It Chapter Two

333,mf2812,Was it worth it?,6,21 October 2019,"To the guys at the top, that's an easy answer. Yes.To the general public. Probably.To the Stephen King fan. No.Obviously covering an over 1000 page adaption is going to run into problems having just 6 hours to do so. But even at that, there was plenty of wasted time (especially in Episode 2) that could have been cut for more of the novels material. Just little things like explaining why it's an eye that comes out off Richies fortune cookie or a dead baby bird out Mikes. There's just so much that could have been changed and made no difference to the time. I mean, how much more would it have taken to show Beverley seeing that the doorbell said ""Marsh"" at first, then it change to ""Kersh"". The end ""fight scene"" was ALWAYS going to be a nightmare to put in front of an audience as it's easier in the book when you can let your imagination do the work and I think that's why there's the running joke all out through the movie about Bill's books having bad endings. The twist at the end was kinda cool and I actually hoped that they'd do it this way rather than the book as it's heartbreaking to see them forgetting who each other is all over again.All in all it is a fine movie but there's no scares whatsoever and it just seems like some different shape of the actual ""IT"" is tearing towards the camera shaking their heads in a weird way (think the alley scene in ""Jacob's Ladder"").Worth it for a one, maybe two time watch and overall for the series together:Chapter One - 8

334,WooderIce64,"Decent, Not as Good as the First",6,29 January 2020,"It's widely agreed upon that no matter what version, the first half of It is better than the second. It's been 27 years since the Loser's Club defeated Pennywise, and everyone's favorite demon clown has returned for more. The kids, now adults in their 40s, get back together to defeat the monster one more time. However, they've all lost their memory, except for Mike, and most of the movie is spent on them going through Derry trying to regain them by collecting items from their pasts. It's not bad content, per se, it just feels like filler and takes way too long. The movie's runtime is 2 hours, 44 minutes. That's excessive for a movie like this.However, it's balanced out by absolutely fantastic performances. Bill Skarsgard returns as Pennywise, and he's perfect. He doesn't talk as much this time around, but he nails all the gestures and mannerisms of being a creepy clown. He's just as good as last time. The other person who garnered a lot of attention is Bill Hader as Richie. Deservedly so, as he does exactly what he should, act like grown-up Richie. The rest of the adults, including Jessica Chastain as Beverly and James McAvoy as Bill, also do their part, and we do see the kids we knew all grown up. Since we get this microcosm of their lives, there's a lot of emotion put into it with how they cope with their memories and facing their fears through a completely different, more grown up lens.There's still more to dislike, unfortunately. The scares were way too predictable. After the first few, you can easily do a ""3, 2, 1, jumpscare"" countdown in your head. Plus, there are way too many jumpscares. Henry didn't need to be in this at all. I know he's important in the book, but hey, Lord of the Rings worked without Tom Bombadil, so this could work without Henry. All he does it eat up runtime. All in all, It: Chapter 2 doesn't come near the heights of the first movie, but it wasn't expected to. It's a decent film, but it's not going to be one of the most remembered horror movies of all time like the first one.By the way, there is reportedly interest in making a cut of It that intertwines scenes from both movies into one massive, 5-hour movie.

The scale of the film is bigger which I like and the way the movie shifts between flash backs of the younger kids and their older counterparts is a good way to pace the film. I hate this movies attempt at being scary, the first film really built its scares on tension and made the audience think ahead where as this one is just crappy jump scare after crappy jump scare, it's a cgi monster mess! Penny wise was terrifying in the first one and yet he's very under used in this one, he's barely even in it, it's always some other monster appearing right up until the end and don't even get me started on how they beat penny wise in the end because Jesus it's cringey and really not well done. I just think this movie was a massive disappointment and I just wish the director would have stuck to the formula from the first film as it would have ended up being 100% better.

It Chapter Two had a good amount of blood and gore which is what a movie such as It should have. I also do enjoy the aspect of how they added drama and romance as it made for an interesting sequel. The only 2 things that I thought was wrong about this movie was 1) We do not see Pennywise as much as we did in the first film as the film was mostly shown around the kids as adults. And 2nd, I think 2hr 49mins was an okay length for this movie but at some points in the movie, I did daze off because it was a little slow and you did not have any idea what was happening.

Despite these problems, I still like the movie. It's like watching a rated R version of The Goonies as adults, like I'm watching a 80's film. The characters were great, especially Richie.

Although all the scary scenes were pretty tame, violent but tame, I was surprised watching how many others jumped out of the corner of my eye.
The real treat of the film is Bill Skarsgard (I'm sure I butchered that spelling) as Pennywise but that also is my gripe, not enough of him. If ""It"" wasn't a single story Bill would be well on his way to be a new Freddy, Jason, Micheal Myers in a franchise.",It Chapter Two

Although the character is nonsensical, Skarsgard has fun with it and he is fun to watch. Other than Skarsgard, i can't think of any other reason why i would even bother to go see this movie. The story itself is rubbish and, at three hours long, is two and a half hours too long; the half hour worth watching are those scenes with Skarsgard's Pennywise. This is not to discredit the cast of veteran actors and their younger counterparts who all show their acting chops as well, but the material they had to work with was trying too hard to be compelling and engaging and ending up neither one nor the other.

346,Kirollos-Noah,"Entertaining, yet flawed",7,6 September 2019,"For 2 years, I dreamed of IT, I craved IT, I missed IT!IT Chapter Two is once again directed by Andy Muschietti, screenplay by Gary Dauberman and starring Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, James Ransone, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan and Bill Skarsgård.Twenty-seven years after the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, he has returned to terrorize the town of Derry once more. Now adults, the Losers have long since gone their separate ways. However, kids are disappearing again, so Mike, the only one of the group to remain in their hometown, calls the others home. Damaged by the experiences of their past, they must each conquer their deepest fears to destroy Pennywise once and for all.IT was a great horror movie, and it was faithful to the source material.. it was a great adaptation to part of the novel! So clearly IT Chapter Two was one of the most anticipated movies of 2019, I was so excited to see how Muschietti will make it, and after the cast was announced, I was even more excited! And there's a lot to admire in this movie, but still, the first one was better, and there're a lot of reasons why the first IT was better than the second chapter.. but let's start with the things I liked about this movie:The movie was so epic, especially the third act, which was insane, I LOVED IT, the way it was directed, the performances.. Pennywise! Everything was amazing about it!The performances were also great, the two Bills stool the whole movie, especially Skarsgard, once again he's my favorite part of the movie, even though he's not in the movie that much compared to its duration, which is a problem, but we'll get to that point later... Anyways, McAvoy did a great job too, also Chastain, but my second favorite is Ransone as Eddie, he did a great job to capture the humor very well, and he was amazing as scared Eddie too!If it comes to the scary scenes, the movie wasn't scarier than the first one, that's because back then, they were kids, they were in grave danger, but now they are adults, so you don't feel like they're in danger or anything till the third act, but it had some good scares to keep the audiences entertained enough.The movie also has a great message, the second chapter is even deeper than the first one, and funnier too!Let's move to the cons:Starting with the duration, the movie is almost 3 hours, the plot is good and everything, but if you think about it for a second, the movie could have been shortened a bit, yeah the performances were great, it was so good to see them that great that long, but still, some scenes weren't necessary, they just added time to the movie... The first 15 to 20 minutes felt rushed and you kinda feel like there are a lot coming at you, but then the movie moved slowly, but the cast managed to make the 3 hours worth watching and rewatching from time to time.And with that length, Pennywise wasn't there that much, that could be disappointing to some, and some could be good with it, I'm right in the middle.The movie is kinda filled with flashbacks, and the young actors are older now, so they don't look the same, so they had to CGI their faces and digitalis their voices to look the same, sometimes it was distracting, and the bigger problem here that they used so much of these flashbacks, sometimes for horror's sake and sometimes for the plot, and I understand that they had to do it, but they didn't do it good enough.So IT Chapter Two might disappoint some of the fans of the first one, but still it was so well made, and it's emotional too, and sometimes people can relate to it.. with a great message at the ending, all of these thing made IT Chapter Two deeper than the first one, and with that amazing cast, the humor did hit even harder than the first one, but still as a horror movie, the first one wins the round, and as the length, lots of scenes could have just been cut and shortened, because the plot felt a little bit stretched to fit the length, but it didn't always hit! Also Pennywise lost his mystique a little bit, and there's not that much of him too. But still IT Chapter Two is so watchable and entertaining, and I think lots of the fans are gonna love it, and find themselves so satisfied too.I'm gonna give IT Chapter Two a B!Thank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to my review of the first IT.

347,borismk-38942,Did the writers get a lobotomy between films?,2,7 September 2019,"This movie stands in stark contrast to its predecessor, nowehere has the idea that sequels can't live up to the original been more true than here.The movie has so many moments that are clearly supposed to be tense, yet come off funny because of poor presentation. If this had been intentional it would've made a good comedy. Which is a shame, because a good comedy would've actually been watchable.The characters are a combination of cheap stereotypes, half baked psychological ideas and downright weirdness. Every character that isn't a main character feels not even slightly fleshed out, more like a marrionette being lurched around by the writers for some uninspired plot device role.I can see why some people like this film, it brings up a lot of psychological issues that always get attention in today's world. In the real world people who bring up these issues gain popularity, regardless of whether they present their ideas intelligently or even understand anything about the actual issues they're discussing, and obviously the film industry has learned. It perpetuates bad stereotypes and *shouldn't* be popular by any means, but just like an on-the-rocks celebrity looking to for attention to stay relevant, it'll get what it wants",It Chapter Two
348,rowanmaillot,"""I could only make out one word.... DISAPPOINTED.""",7,27 July 2020,"You probably know that quote from Inception, yes, I did copy it and yes, this movie kinda sucks. Before I begin this review, I just want to say that It is my favourite book and the 2017 adaptation was one of my favourite horror movies, so of course I was extremely pumped to see the second one, I was pumped out of my movie and... eh, just eh.This movie has some great things, the cast is extremely good and they deliver excellent performances, but one thing I think this movie did badly is they put Pennywise in daylight and that was an obvious mistake, Pennywise is supposed to be a scary clown, one who lurks in the dark to feed upon children, but putting him in broad daylight really makes him lose his effect of scariness. The CGI used for the children for flashbacks really distracted me, the cliched flashback in horror movies is getting really stupid now.Bill Skarsgard is great, he's scary, the adult cast are fantastic, especially Jessica Chastain, James Macavoy and Bill Hader, Hader added a lot of laughs throughout the movie and I really felt the emotional weight when Eddie died and we found out that Richie may had been gay and felt a certain way for Ed, but the third act is really stupid. The way they yell curse words to make Pennywise shrivel up and become a tiny baby, it's just... I can't. It makes It look cute, like... ugh.Overall, It Chapter Two is an average/disappointing movie with great performances, but overall, the story is incompetent with the acting and it's just extremely saddening that we didn't get a better version.Grade: C+",It Chapter Two

350,seige-hound,"Nowhere near as good as the first, but still has a lot of good stuff",7,10 September 2019,"Probably the best and most horrific moment in this movie is the opening, where the gay couple gets brutally attacked, one of them being thrown over a bridge into the river only to be eaten by Pennywise. That scene is horrifying and great, and the closest we get in this film to the Georgie scene from the first film.After that great opener, the film doesn't seem to know what to do.I haven't read much of the book, but from what I've heard, the Adult scenes in the book are not the main focus of the story, and the child sequences are given a lot more development. Which makes sense, as the story is about overcoming childhood trauma and how trauma impacts you years after you grew up. However, when the films were originally pitched where the first film is about the kids, and the second film is about the adults coming back, I think the screenwriters weren't quite prepared for how much of an undertaking that would be.The movie rushes through the intro scenes where we see where the adult Loser's Club ends up, seemingly in a rush to get them all back to Derry and have more Pennywise shenanigans, but when they all get there, the film turns into a fetch quest, where each of them has to retrieve an object from their past to sacrifice in a 'Ritual of Chud' in order to defeat IT once and for all. This fetch quest takes up most of the almost 3 hour movie, before a 1/2 hour climax in the sewers.During each character's mini adventure, it cuts between a previously unseen scene from their childhood (ie, a newly filmed scene with the kid actors between their breakup and reunification to save Beverley) and a scene with the adult versions coming across a similar scare. These scenes range in quality, my personal favourite being Beverley's scene that was mostly shown in the teaser trailer a few months back. Save for the ending where the creepy grandma turns into a CGI monster that isn't scary at all. Bill's mini adventure is also decent, and the longest, as he meets a young boy who reminds him of Georgie, and attempts to save him from Pennywise. The other scenes are either okay or completely forgettable.Speaking of forgettable, the bully Henry Bowers, who kills his dad and attempts to kill the Losers in the first film, comes back after breaking out of a mental asylum. I thought he would be a bigger secondary antagonist then he ended up being, because after stabbing a couple of people in non-fatal areas, he ends up dying rather quickly after being introduced. A wasted opportunity for sure, not to mention why Pennywise needed his help in the first place? Who knows.Finally, the climax, where Pennywise reveals its true form. In the book, It's described as a giant spider, which the original 1990's miniseries attempted to do with mixed results. For some reason, though, the film instead made Pennywise's true form a Spider-centaur, where IT still looks like a clown on the top half, but has long spider legs on his body. I guess they wanted to keep Bill Skarsgard's great performance as IT and not overshadow him with a CGI spider, but again, it's a missed opportunity to just go crazy with a really fun design for ITs final form.Overall, this film has several missed opportunities, but there are definitely things that are worth praising. The casting of the adult versions of the kid characters was incredible. All of them look great and act the roles well. The acting overall was incredible, and if casting directors could get Academy Awards, they would get all of them for this film. There were still quite a good few horror moments, and a few good laughs.As good as the first? Not at all, but a good bit of fun in the cinema? absolutely.",It Chapter Two

I know some people thought the cgi puppetry was not scary but it reminded me of house , evil dead films , by been more funny than scary .",It Chapter Two
352,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Will we float down to the theater for IT: Chapter 2?,8,7 January 2020,"The Stream: The movie is definitely about 45 minutes too long.The Big Screen: The comedy and scares keep you going the whole time.The Final Bill: This movie is way too long but quite entertaining.-S2S: Movie ReviewWelcome back to Derry... I mean welcome back to Stream to Big Screen. This week we have before you a review of Stephen King's IT, Chapter 2. IT2 is the sequel/second part to It (2017). With a star-studded cast featuring James McAvoy as Bill, Bill Hader as Richie, Jessica Chastain as Bev, and Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise, the movie is not lacking for acting talent to finish up the revamped horror classic. Speaking of revamped, I do recommend watching the original It (1990) and/or reading the best-selling novel (1986). Those of you that take that challenge, please comment and let us know how this version of It compares to those versions. For those of you living under a rock, we've included below the trailer to freak you out in preparation for the movie.IT2 does some things very well. I really enjoyed how the story was told. I didn't read the novel, but I'm sure it gave the movie crew a ton of material to expand upon and visualize. And boy did they take every liberty with those. Nonetheless, I often found myself glued to the movie and not taking my eyes off of the screen. The writer and director worked well together to really dive deep into the emotions and fears of each character. On top of that, the writing did a great job of keeping the comedy and comedic relief through the movie, just like the original. IT2 stayed true to the original in those facets, which I appreciated, but it found a way to be it's own as well.Next, the cast did a really good job channeling their younger selves and matching their adult selves in the original. The main cast that I mentioned above, fit so well. I couldn't imagine the movie without them (If you've seen the movie, comment on a couple actors you think might have been good replacements).BUT THE GLARING ISSUE WITH THIS MOVIE IS THE LENGTH. I mean the original movie was told in a marathon,3 hours and 7 minutes, but included both child and adults halves. IT2 alone was 2 hours and 44 minutes of only the adult portion of the novel/movie. I understand the producers grabbing at money by splitting the movie but can we think about the consumers/viewers at all. Nearly 3 hours for half of a story is unreal. The director definitely could've shortened this movie by 30 to 44 minutes. There seemed to be endless amounts of flashback scenes or hallucinations from the past. While they were all good to watch, I would've preferred them to just shorten the movie instead.The only other issue for me dealt with the scares in the movie. There were a few really good jump scares in the movie. The problem for me is that I felt the movie didn't give us anything new to be afraid of or fear. On one hand, I could praise the consistency and continuity to Part 1. On the other hand, I would've preferred a surprise or more originality. On top of that, I can think of at least 2 scare scenes that elongated the movie unnecessarily. Those could've been taken out and no one would've missed them AT ALL.Lastly, it bothered me that the film didn't dive into Mike's mental state as a pre-teen like they did the others. They mention his issues in passing but it seemed like each character had a dedicated 10 minute deep dive but he was forgotten. It wasn't a huge issue for me as it didn't really occur in the original movie either but with all the liberties that were take, they could've done the same for his story.Long story short, of course this is a movie you should see in the theaters and judging by the first 3 weekend sales (171 million), you already did. The issue is that this movie is way too long for no reason and a lot of the scares lack umph because they are too similar to Part One. Nevertheless, the cast, suspense and the laughs make It: Chapter 2 the perfect matinee movie, if you have free time and a must see Halloween season stream.",It Chapter Two
353,garethwooduk,Not as good as first one!,6,14 September 2019,"Felt this dragged from the beginning and too much cutting from past to present, some decent scenes and shocks of gore but it didn't capture the fear and shock of first chapter.Would of prefer a better ending and more screen time from pennywise, but I felt the adult characters were good choices to play the older versions of the young kids in act 1.I feel the story lacked some how and would of preferred it some how left it a mystery of the entity...

355,helenbassett,IT: Chapter Two Film Review - Time To Come Home As Director Andy Muschietti Takes Us On A Really Long Stephen King Fun Fair Ride,8,17 September 2019,"Andy Muschietti again directs the Stephen King clown horror as we open with the Losers Club swearing their oaths to return to Derry if IT resurfaces. And when the all grown up Isaiah Mustafa's Mike hears on the police radio one night that there has been a killing, he visits the site of the murder and finds a message for them written in blood. COME HOME. And for an almost three hour long movie it rattled along, to the point when it ended I felt there was more to come.After the trauma of IT the members of The Losers Club have drifted apart and eventually lost touch. Living their adult lives with, in some cases, the same demons of the past. But now the horror they have since forgotten as adults has resurfaced 27 years later. And they need to return and renew the blood vows they took as teenagers. And reface the horror.Bill Skarsgard returns as Pennywise, taking a big bite out of Derry, and Isaiah Mustafa, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, (great in Trainwreck), Jay Ryan, James Ransone and Andy Bean play the grown-up Losers. Although not too shabbily as they all have made successes of their lives. Except Mike who remained in Maine remembering their past.And when Mike calls his old friends, none remember him or that past. Not even why they have a scar. When they do the intensity of the fear is rekindled. Dare they go back?Jessica Chastain's Beverley has the foresight to see their deaths, of all the Losers Club members she was the only one exposed to Pennywise's deadlights. But she runs to Derry when she gets the phone call. Escaping her life. James McAvoy as a horror writer badly in need of an ending, is Bill, whose brother Georgie was Pennywise's victim in the original IT. And who Beverley believes to be her old secret admirer. Bill Hader is Richie. Stand-up comedy hiding a secret that Derry seems particularly bad at dealing with. Jay Ryan's Ben is the former fat kid, now a buff wealthy architect hiding away in his stunning masterpiece, and keeping his human contact to zero. James Ransome's risk averse Eddie is married to a plus-size lady, and she makes him just as neurotic as his Mom did. Lastly Andy Bean is Stanley who decides not to make the journey. To be honest I needed the recap as to who each character was, and the matching of the original kids to their adult actors was very inspired.Those that have come to Derry meet Mike at a Chinese restaurant, in a lovely scene the years slip away and they're back as old friends. But the fortune cookies do way more than give good luck. With comic book gore that as a 15 certificate I knew wasn't going to be scary, but the fun fair effects were frankly disappointing. But enough to frighten off our Club members.But Mike needs them to stay and perform a ritual on IT that he learned from a Native American tribe who had settled in the area years before. Explaining to James McAvoy who has assumed a childhood lisp brought on by his fears. Impressive and not unlike his Split characters. And they all need to be part of it. Even Stanley.IT feeds on their fear and they have plenty. And each has to bring an artefact from the past to the ritual. The young actors from IT reprise their roles as we explore the source of the adults fear. I think Beverley's worked best with the creepy old lady now living in her childhood home. I don't know if Eddie's was even real. But how could Jessica Chastain scream like a girl, after her life and what she has seen.Overall there weren't the jump scares that would make a horror scary. The horror was right at the beginning of the film, hidden in plain sight. And no town needs a Pennywise for that. But beware the bleachers and Fun House I would say, as danger lurks for any child who wanders off alone. And from my original review of IT in 2017, Derry loses a lot of children.Although the film horror was a disappointment and I have looked forward to it for so long, the actors were fantastic. Bill Hader's comedy was laugh out loud funny and the interaction between the two casts very cleverly directed by Andy Muschietti. All the wonderful young actors are named in my IT film review.And what of the ending in the rain sewers below the haunted house? Each of our Losers had their artefact from when their fear began, but they finally have to face the fear to find themselves. And in some cases each other. Again with the fun fair CGI effects, but it all seemed like there was a better story to tell. Like I said at the beginning something more to come. Pennywise was demonic wasn't he?, then make him demonic. As I haven't read the book I don't know how true the ending is, but I needed a big red balloon of a bang instead of a Harry Potter style rollerskating spider.As a drama it worked very well, as a horror not so much, but the comedy was inspired. Watching Bill Hader and James Ransome trying to decide which door is really the less scary for them to run through was hilarious. Fingers crossed there's a cute puppy behind one of them. A great double act.And Stephen King's input was noted, 'Here's Johnny' was unexpected but played in with the trailer for Doctor Sleep before the film. The follow up to The Shining.And as a horror fan I'm already looking forward to that one so don't let me down.",It Chapter Two
356,pazu7,I really liked it. I could have loved it.,7,6 September 2019,"(SPOILERS) It chapter 2 is a sort of glorious mess of best intentions. But I think its weaknesses can be attributed to one simple thing: the success of Chapter 1. The kids in the first film had a natural, unforced charmed. We all knew them, they reminded us of ourselves, our friends, the brats next door. But the adults in this film are not really given time to establish themselves in our hearts, we only see them as adult versions of the kids. It's not that way in the novel. The adult/children version are separate but equally defined. This second film also seems to constantly be trying to replicate the tone and innocent vulgarity of the first film. But it's not the first film , and shouldn't have tried to be. Chapter 1 tells a very simple story, kids form friendship and fight shape-shifting demon from another dimension. We meet the kids, see their first encounters with IT, explore the insecurities they have to overcome, then on to the show down. Even at its foundation, Chapter 2 is a much more complicated tale. Old friends, who have forgotten shape-shifting demon, get called back to fight it, must renew old bonds, be reminded of what IT is, revisit encounters in several flashbacks, be introduced to ancient ritual etc etc... All that to say it could never have been a continuation of Chapter 1. It was essentially a different film. But in trying to match the pacing and tone of the first they cheated the adult cast, and imo, the audience, of a more adult film. ... A dead giveaway to the insecurity of this film is the non-stop score. Whenever filmmakers are unsure of a scenes ability to carry impact, they blast the score. From the moment the adult Losers enter the Niebolt house, the music keeps trying to force the atmosphere. This actually deadens the dynamics of those sections and ruins the scares because the best scares are born in silence. There are so many scenes when they could have just let silence carry the tension and let the play say the thing. Also, and I know people will disagree, there was too much Pennywise in the conclusion. I get why they did that, with the clown spider thing, but as a fan of the novel, I was just hoping to see something more surreal and incomprehensible. Something horrible. Overall it was OK. I enjoyed IT chapter 2. But I could have loved it if it had not been constantly begging to be loved. Knowing this was cut down from 4 hours, provides me hope that the expanded version be able to take it's time and let the adults Losers establish themselves.",It Chapter Two
357,robinsonaustin-07490,Still Clinging Afloat,7,9 September 2019,"Saw IT: Chapter Two Thursday, and I it was a pretty fun film. For those that have read the novel or watched the first chapter would know that 27 years after the events of the first film, It resurfaces in Derry, Maine, to continue its spree of terrorizing the denizens and eating its children. Mike Hanlon, the token black member of the Losers Club, remained in Derry to document information on how he and his friends could possibly destroy It if he ever returned. And sure enough, he had, thus began the revival of the blood oath they made years ago.The acting is stellar for the most part. While many have already stated this, it is true; Bill Hader does an amazing job at portraying the grown up Richie Tozier. He carries most of the humor in the film, but when the time calls for emotion, he does fantastically. The other cast members also do a good job at portraying the grown up Losers and they do resemble them in some likeness, but I felt they weren't as impactful. Bill Skarsgard once again kills it as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, who here is actually a little more goofier, but nevertheless, the 27 years did nothing to file down his fangs. He's just as creepy as he was in the first film - maybe even more so.Unfortunately, my issues with the film mostly lie in the writing. The film for starters is 3 hours long. Normally I don't mind long films. I mean Avengers: Endgame was roughly around the same length of time but I felt that it flew by quickly without me having to excuse myself for a bathroom break. It: Chapter Two, however, didn't need to be that long. I am aware that the novel is a long read, 1,138 to be exact (and I read it for a few months to complete it), but the side quests that the Losers go through really weigh down the runtime and are nowhere as interesting as they may as well should've been. There were also new additions to the film that I felt could've provided something new for a story that had already been established, but those moments are ultimately for nothing. The biggest issue, however, is the adults. The adult portion of the story was never my favorite part of the original book, not in the miniseries, and it's still there in this take. I guess what makes it problematic is that...let's be real: children being put into dangerous situations with an evil, ancient monster is infinitely more terrifying than adults facing those childhood traumas. This is especially true if you have little ones who you do not want to be put in harm's way. That is what made the book Pet Sematary and its 1989 adaptation scary. The adult portion of the It story was always the weakest of the two.Overall, It: Chapter Two is a mixed bag. As a conclusion, it is definitive and mostly satisfying, but when you take what the first film had done, it comes off as more feeble.",It Chapter Two
358,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: It: Chapeter 2,6,30 September 2019,"I've been putting of writing this review for a little while now. That's because no film this year has left me more conflicted after leaving a screening as this one. To be transparent this was high on my most anticipated films of the year after the first film proved to be a surprisingly, emotionally resent and enjoyable horror film. Given the source material I was prepared for the second installment to be more muddled than the first but I was not prepared for just how meandering, uneven and freaking long it turned out to be.It is easiest to talk about this film in chucks, so to start with the introduction is sloppy and strangely rushed given the overall run-time. It is hear that it becomes clear that the new cast are what is going to carry this film with Bill Hader and James Ransone in particular filling the screen with their presence right out of the gate. This is a well cast film with all the actors working well together and managing to capture some of the personality of their younger counterparts.Once the losers club is reunited the problems start to show themselves. Most of this film consists of heavy dialogue scenes in darkly lit rooms with over the top and often corny lines being delivered in surprisingly engaging ways followed by big CGI horror set pieces that feel rejected from one of the Insidious sequels. These scenes will then be followed by one or two of the main cast walking in an unrealistically empty street for way to long, rinse and repeat for the better part of two hours before we get to the big climactic ending (which for obvious reasons I wont get into here).The film also features extensive flashback scenes with the cast of the first instalment. For the most part these get in the way of the main plot and could have done with being cut down a fair bit but it is still nice to see first hand the connection these characters had as kids (even if the de-aging and voice manipulation gets pretty distracting after a while).Don't get the wrong idea from this review however, this is one of the films it is easier to talk about the bad stuff than the good stuff but there is some really good stuff in here. As I mentioned before Bill Hader and James Ransone are both brillant and the rest of the cast also does a great job in their respective roles. I also think that Andy Muschietti is a great director, the movement of the camera and overall visual flare of the ""scary"" scenes makes me wish I could see him direct something with a much better script.Steven King's classic horror novel is a strange, meandering mess that will forever be divisive. There is something to said about how both mainstream adaptations have been exactly the same.",It Chapter Two
359,Schuriken,Homo Lone,3,10 September 2019,"No Stephen, we don't want your autograph either buddy. Not when the ending is a cartoon mess of CGI and a red balloon mate. Maybe in 27 years they will remake the remake of the remake's book to film adaptation in full CGI. Is this movie about kids exploring their homosexuality and a cartoon clown that goes BOO continuously for 2 movies in a row ? Really ?Jump scares, a clown that does nothing but scare kids, very cartoony and funny CGI monsters and have you ever watched the movie TERRIFIER ? Its a movie about a clown killing people. Check it out Stephen. Take your old musty closet full of old boring stories throw it out of the window and start over man. Or wait for the Saturday morning cartoon version of IT Chapter 3. Pennywise vs The teenage mutant ninja turtles.CGI scary faces. Really ? In the year 2019 people still pay to see that ? I felt absolutely nothing for the group of kids and later adults, looks like the actors were picked out of a hat no connection whatsoever between them no chemistry no nothing. Just a bunch of random people reading lines from a book to each other. Any more stiffer than that and their back ends would need CGI too.I thought Stephen King was super outdated. I thought Stephen King movies had great acting and terrible CGI. Not the other way around.Maybe sell the rights to Disney and have Luke Skywalker do a lightsaber battle with Pennywise and a bunch of Jedi turtles in the movie to sell toys at Walmart. Think about it brother. Don't just go BOO. Sell the crap out of it.Until the next remake of the second sequel's reboot remake.....BOO!...........BOO!!......................BOO!!!",It Chapter Two
360,Phil_M_A_Kerr,Hometown horrors,10,10 September 2019,"This film is like a dream (or nightmare). This is true of the few Stephen King books that I've read. It is fair to say that you can't divert far from your source material. Why would you want to?
It is an ensemble piece, for sure. Everyone brought their A-game.
The visual horror was rendered to perfection. There is plenty of it. Quite an achievement and well worth the ticket price. Be warned that it ain't subtle.
There is an unrelenting atmosphere of ... something quite unpleasant.
It may prove more frightening for those of us who grew up in towns than it will city slickers.

The whole tone was weird and different from the first one and it was less scary. Pennywise didn't come up as much so that wasn't good. Some things happened that didnt really make sense and was weird. There was a lot of new monsters and stuff that was in here. I just dont feel like hating on this movie, i feel like its not right to and i feel like it was good and im just not getting it, i feel like other people didn't really like it as well. The ending was weird too because it was a happy ending and nothing happened which means that i guess it is really over and the series is over for good which is sad but ""nothing lasts forever"".",It Chapter Two

Unfortunately the director is incapable of showing any sort of restraint and the rest of of it is a loud, drawn out mess, absolutely saturated with terrible CGI that ruins any sort of atmosphere by taking the viewer out of the movie.
It's a real shame because the cast is very good but even they can't save it from the effects laiden garbage.They took the 'not scary at all' door.",It Chapter Two

Yes it does have some horror scenes (which didn't really scare me).This story gets you so involved and entangled in its twists and the lives of the characters that you won't really care how scary the so-called horror scenes are.True fear is remembering bad incidents that left you feeling powerless when you were younger... Many such memories cast a long shadow on our adulthood.True fear is remembering that as a vulnerable teen, you were cast out, maybe because you were a racial minority, or had an ability challenge, or a religious minority, or abused by a loved one.True fear is remembering that you were treated differently simply because you were differebt.Ultimately, true fear is wondering if you should still be afraid...Destroy the clown.

367,acdc_mp3,The Mini-series is much more truer to the book.,5,12 January 2021,"IT Chapter One and IT Chapter Two were ok, but they didn't stay as true to the book as the mini-series did, which damaged the whole experience of the movies. The movies were much more violent and clotted with CGI. The parts that were supposed to be scary were actually so over the top, it was amusing. The kids and adults cast for the Loser's Club was very well done and the actors did a good job representing the characters from the book. Let me get to Pennywise: Nobody, and I mean NOBODY can hold a candle to Tim Curry's Pennywise performance. Similar to Jack Nicholson in the Shining, Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise, looked extremely menacing right from the get go, which indicates children in the 80's are much more simpleminded and cannot read into a situation that will take their lives unless they had the tiniest bit of common sense. Sadly in today's world of movie making, they use a heavy layer of CGI to cover faults of the character and story. The CGI hindered it as usual and really, there wasn't anything nearly at the level of creepiness and flat out scares that the mini-series had.I gave the movie 5 stars because any movie that makes me laugh unintentionally will get 5 stars from me right off the bat. Once again, if you have read the novel before seeing the movie, you will be greatly disappointed and frustrated at how much better it could have been told. This has always been a peeve of mine regarding most of Stephen King's novels turned into movies. I recommend watching it, though because of the simple entertainment it provides.",It Chapter Two

There are so many wonderful touches installed in this film, the humanity, the giddy humour and the persuasive melancholy of who we are and our place in the world. There isn't a false note. Of course all the horror and insane creepiness is all still intact, bigger and bolder than before, some of the set pieces are inspiring. Yet even so, all this seems to take a backseat to what else is being conveyed here at times, in which the assembled cast admirably manage to put across. It could almost be considered an entrant for the Cinema Of Personal Expression in a minor way and in modern terms.Yes the French kissing CGI ghoul was slightly stretching the boundaries but apart from that everything looked and felt right in so far as the cruel, fun-house effect that the film strove for. It didn't reach perfection but I believe it achieved everything one could have hoped for in terms of a companion piece to the 2017 film.

With the first one, you've got all of these kids, and, sorry for the psycho-babble, when people are younger than mid-teens, we want to protect them. After that, in movies, it doesn't work anymore.When kids were the victim, it hurt. The fears that the grown-ups faced were the same psychologically as when they were kids, but they have grown up minds. That's also what makes Stephen King so great: his stories are about characters and written with a lot of heart.I mean, if you don't care about any of them, why even be scared a little?I do think that it was written also in such a way that we have a tendency to fall in love with them.

After 27 years had passed, the evil entity that is a metaphor for humanities' fears and negative emotions/thoughts/feelings is back to haunt them again by utilizing chilling illusions backed by great VFX to remind them of their childhood pains and fears. Great storytelling, as each of the protagonists experience the return of the demon by their own unique way, where each is pushed emotionally to the brink of madness, but at the same time, helps them to find and gain strength to unite and move forward in order to kick the devil's clown ass back to oblivion, but this time, it'll be once and for all (without another 27, 54, 81, or 108 years of waiting to return). I love the added childhood flashbacks which, to me, give the first movie more color than it does to the last one while also giving us one important message: not all frightening childhood is bad in the long run as it can also bind people together with unbreakable bonds even after separated for nearly 3 decades, and a little loss of memory of a particular event and place. There is one more important message in the final moments of the film which I'm not gonna mention here, I urge you to go watch it by yourself because the ending is very beautiful, comparable to the last year's 'Blade Runner 2049'.

The first was okay after I watched it a few times, so I thought maybe this one wouldn't be so bad. Sadly it did not do much for me. It wasn't all bad with the few creepy/scary parts and some of the humor was actually pretty funny, but overall it was just too overdone for me. Just like the first, the CGI is just outrageous and way overdone. Nothing about it really fascinates me. And the storyline is a bit weak. I'm sure some like this, but this movie just wasn't anything special to me.",It Chapter Two

First of all, the actors are amazing, especially the Old Version character they impersonate their younger selves perfectly!
And Bill Hader is seriously the best in the movie!!!
Second of all, the production is a masterpiece & the music is great.
Bill Skarsgård again did a great job being Pennywise, i wish we saw him more though!
Some of the jumpscares were predictable but the others we not and they were amazing!
Andy Muschietti did a great job again!
It Chapter 2 is way better than the first in my opinion! (i loved the first so much)
There's a lot to talk about this movie, unlike other people those 3 hours were really fast!The Movie Was Quite enjoyable!

381,IndridC0ld,A movie that delivers far fewer scares than real life.,5,2 October 2019,"When I was a young adult in the eighties, Stephen King knew just how to make the everyday world seem very scary. Today, the real world is just a whole lot scarier than King's ""monsters."" Sadly enough, this renders King's movie, It, Chapter Two more of a black comedy than believable horror.How exactly does a clown with a silly laugh and pointy teeth compete against a kid who walks into an elementary school, and kills a couple of dozen kids? How do I get afraid of a father who abuses his daughter, when the cop on the beat in my neighborhood can kill an unarmed man running away, and escaped any consequences by saying ""I feared for my life""?The real world has simply become way more scary than the One-Time jump-scares of the seventies and eighties. The one King movie that still retains its horror is The Dead Zone. Today, a dangerous madman really does hold theKing's movie isn't particularly bad, it just comes across like a worn-out carnival fun house.",It Chapter Two

I was a little disappointed that this one didn't get as high an attendance as the first one. I heard some people say they liked this one better because it was more character driven. Others said they like the first one better. Them being kids at the time, made it scarier. There are several flashbacks of them as kids encountering Pennywise and his terrifying antics in this second one too. Speaking of which Bill Skaarsgard is so impressive. Tim Curry was great, but Skaarsgard is even better. I think all characters were well cast. It was truly terrifying in places and there were some jump scenes that actually made me jump.

So many poor movies based on King's books and this is yet another one.The novel has magic in it, in the sense of wonder and regret. So anyway I watched the last 10 minutes of the movie because the end of the book is almost heartbreaking: the friends all leave Derry to return to their lives and their memory of the town and their friends fades away again. The last line of the book is the most haunting:""Or so Bill Denbrough sometimes thinks on those early mornings after dreaming, when he almost remembers his childhood, and the friends with whom he shared it.""And the film?

384,dhainline1,Pennywise Better Watch Out! The Now Grown Losers Club Will Kick His Ass!,10,7 September 2019,"When we last left the Losers Club, the six boys and one girl made a blood vow to come back to Derry, Maine to finally destroy the evil, shape-shifting clown, Pennywise. It was late summer 1989 when the vow was made and the children except lone black character Michael Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs as young Mike, Isaiah Mustafa as grown Mike) have left Derry.
The club members are wildly successful except for poor Mike who has stayed in the cursed town and is waiting to see when and if the members will fulfill the oath they made as children. William aka Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell as young Bill, James McAvoy as grown Bill) is a very successful writer who is married to Audra (Jess Wexler). She is an actress who is staring in a movie based on one of Bill's books. Everyone agrees Bill is a good writer but they criticize his book endings. The lone girl, Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis as young Beverly, Jessica Chastain as grown Beverly) is a wonderful clothing designer married to Tom Rogan who abuses her horribly. Bill Hader is Richie Tozier the club comedian who doesn't write his own material. Finn Wolfhard plays young Richie. I think the adult actors really look like the children actors with James Ransone nailing Jack Dylan Grazer's Eddie Kaspbrak mannerisms to a T! Andy Bean has a short, memorable role of Stanley Uris and he channels Wyatt Oleff's mannerisms and hair quite well! I can also see Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben Hanscom growing up to be quite a hunk like Jay Ryan! Last of all, Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is back to his own tricks and this Pennywise is truly terrifying and in a rage!
The catalyst for Mike's contact of his old friends is the hate murder of a gay man named Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) in 2016 at the Derry Carnival. These hateful punks beat up Adrian and his boyfriend Don Haggerty. They throw Adrian in the canal and Pennywise, just waking up and starving after 27 years, takes a bite out of Adrian. As the movie goes on, the flesh of Adrian doesn't satisfy the clown for long. He feeds on a little girl named Victoria who has a birth mark on her face. Pennywise tricks her into thinking he can cure her mark but devours her instead. He also eats a young boy in the fun house in front of Bill.
The Losers all come together in their old town with the exception of Stan who cuts his wrist in the bathtub after Mike's phone call. Pennywise is determined to make the Losers relive their childhood traumas. He even breaks Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) out of Juniper Hills institution to exact revenge. Henry killed his father Butch Bowers as a boy and was committed. The scares come on after another! The spider Pennywise with Stan's boy face is way more scary than the fake looking creature from the almost 30 year old TV movie! Well, to give the TV movie credit, TV has a more limited budget than movies and the producers and directors did their best with what they had. I never really liked Stephen King acting in the movies based on his books, but I thought he was great as the antique store owner who sells Bill the bike Bill had as a boy. Bill missed his beloved Silver and needed it back.
The Losers stick together and finally defeat Pennywise. Eddie is killed by the spider and Richie is heartbroken because he had a crush on Eddie but never told anyone he was gay. This movie did follow the classic TVmovie in some scenes especially with the Chinese restaurant and the special fortune cookies. Pennywise says ""Kiss me, fat boy"" to young Ben like TV Pennywise (Tim Curry) said to TV Ben (the late John Ritter). A rain slicker clad Georgie also confronts young Bill and grown Bill and tells both that it's their fault he is dead.
All in all, I was satisfied with this movie and the cast! Both Bills (Hader & Skarsgard) were awesome! It's safe to say that Bill Skarsgard and Tim Curry before him have ruined clowns for everyone! I recommend this movie as a satisfying swan song to this movie!",It Chapter Two

388,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,What happened?,7,11 September 2019,"About a year and a half ago (I believe) we were served with a truly remarkable yet slightly flawed adaptation of IT, one of Stephen King's best novels. Splitting the narrative into two movies was a good idea, as a 1100+ pages novel would be quite troublesome to adapt into a single (watchable) movie. However, these two movies should function as a whole yet they do not. This movie, by definition, cannot be defined as a horror (because there is none) but more of an adventure/mystery movie with certain fright segments. But first thing's first:1) The acting. The casting was top notch! Chastain and Mcavoy were brilliant casting choices but Hader was the one who stole the show alongside Ranson. Ryan and Mustafa were not bad choices either. However, only Hader and Ranson gave their characters some flair or character. Hader stole almost every scene he was in and the chemistry he had with Ranson was extraordinary. Ryan was nowhere to be seen. He simply lost himself in the midst of the other characters and was left completely unexplained. Mustafa was, specifically due to bad writing, simply a character that was poorly written and deviated from the source material almost entirely, leaving the audience with a completely wrong impression about him. As for Mcavoy and Chastain, this is a prime example of - I simply do not care - way to portray a character. They were unimaginative and uninspiring, she was emotionally blank and distant, especially in scenes with Ryan (he only segment where she should not have been) and Mcavoy simply had a busy year and I guess this movie was the last in line. There is no other explanation for his lethargic portrayal of Bill. Regarding Skarsgård, he did, again, a great job, but suffered due to a tragic lack of screen time and overuse of CGI.2) The story. All they had to do was follow a simple and linear path King had in the book. Remove certain side stories and the main story-line is here. Why they decided to intertwine the adult stories with (again) their child counterparts is completely beyond me. Those segments destroyed a coherent and cohesive narrative, leaving the viewer with a sense that they are watching dozen small scare segments tied up into one. The smart idea would be that the grown-ups revisit all places the kids in the last movie got spooked and continue from there (why that was not the case is, again, beyond me). Not to mention that the part with the kids were not scary at all, and those segments were, at points, extremely CGI-ish so they take the viewer from the experience. Also, certain segments that should have provided decent scares were nullified by comedic elements (e.g. the ""Just call me Angel of the morning"" segment). Also, Pennywise was almost absent from the movie which is a shame as this part of the story should be considered his revenge, and it was everything but that.Another great misfire was the direction and editing of the second half of the movie. Once the Losers split up in the movie, the direction and storytelling is all over the place with no sense of where the director or screenwriters were going or what was the overall importance of certain scenes. Most segments from this part were not in the original novel and that is really noticeable (even for someone who has not read the book). Ironically, for an almost three hours long movie there are story parts that are left unexplained (e.g. why is Beverly's key her totem) and characters left undeveloped (e.g. Bowers). On the other hand there were scenes that should have been completely left out of the final cut (e.g. It's second kill in the movie). Taking all that into account, it is no wonder that the movie is almost three hours long but the disappointing thing is that it would have functioned much better as a two hour standalone sequel focusing solely on the adults and only here and there referencing the kids.3) The general lack of scares. This one I find most interesting. The movie is not really a horror flick (unlike the first one). However there might be a logical explanation to that. My girlfriend noted that as adults we do not scare that easily any more but are much more prone to anxiety and stress. She also stated that this movie should, taking that into consideration, be viewed through the eyes of adults, whereas the first one should be viewed through the eyes of a child. Henceforth, the first one is scary and frightful and the second one is not, but makes you feel tense and anxious at points. Considering that, maybe the lack of scares can be contributed to the prism of the eyes of the beholder - child/adult. Albeit, Pennywise did say - You've all grown up.Finally, the battle with Pennywise is overly prolonged, lacks a definitive climax and is unceremonious. The latter being the fault of (again) hacking the character into several groups and (again) putting them into yet another stream of small segment scare scenarios. The end of Pennywise is, unfortunately, just the same as the rest of the ending - bland.4) The direction. It could be a trait, but I still find it much more of a lack of experience. Movies should not feel as if they are interconnected small segments. The movie lacks a flow and is at points a bit lost in itself. This can, but doesn't have to be, the directors fault. However, as the first part has the same feel to it, I will be contributing it to a directorial trait that has to change in the upcoming future (especially taking into account that he is directing the upcoming FLASH movie).5) It's actually entertaining. Despite all the negative aspects of the movie: the duration, the messy editing, the generally uninspired cast, the badly timed jokes and humor etc. It Chapter Two is a highly entertaining movie. It has a high re-watch value, it is light, it is funny and easy to comprehend. I am not sure if that was the goal of the movie, but if it was, it surely succeeded in it in every aspect. If it wasn't, well, it just accidentally achieved a high entertainment value. And that is not something many movies can say about themselves these days.All in all, if you saw the first IT, see the second one. You will not regret it and you will have a good time. A shame that time was not a bit more scary.",It Chapter Two

390,rustonreviews,It doesn't float. It sinks.,5,19 September 2019,"I've never read Stephen King's It, nor have I seen the 1990 two part miniseries starring Tim Curry as Pennywise. I was, however, very impressed with Muschietti's 2017 remake, which was revealed to be the first chapter of a duology during its closing credits. It's no wonder Muschietti has opted to follow the same route as the miniseries; King's epic novel is practically impossible to adapt into one feature length effort, given how much story is packed into its whopping 1,138 pages. Taking place twenty-seven years after Chapter One, the Loser's Club are called back to Derry once it becomes apparent that Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) has awakened to feast on the next generation of Derry's children. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), who never left Derry, calls his old friends back so they can fulfil the promise they all made twenty-seven years ago: to kill Pennywise once and for all should he ever return.
High expectations were set following Chapter One. With Muschietti back on board as well as Dauberman and Skarsgård, all was looking promising for Chapter Two to be a worthy companion to its predecessor. One of the highest praises sung about this film is its casting, and rightfully so. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader are excellent choices to play the older incarnations of their respective characters. Everybody looks the part and it strikes as wholly believable that these are the same characters we followed back in Chapter One. Unexpectedly, Bill Hader (primarily a comedy actor) steals the show as the adult Ritchie. Bill Skarsgård also delivers another fantastic performance as Pennywise, although his role isn't as prominent this time around, which is a real shame. There has also been much discussion about the films lengthy runtime; clocking in at just ten minutes shy of three hours, this is a long horror film which, unfortunately, results in some serious pacing issues.Many of the film's problems are present during the painfully dull second act. It is here where Dauberman's script falls into repetitive territory, leading to unimaginative scares and boring, drawn out sequences that slam the film to a grinding halt. Most of the time, there's just too much going on with little by way of plot progression. In a novel, you of course have all the time in the world (as King clearly demonstrates), but in a film you don't get that luxury. Chapter One was paced very well, the plot moved swiftly, and it was an engaging experience overall. Chapter Two, on the other hand, doesn't share this quality.Troubling the film also is an overabundance of CGI. Excessive CGI in a horror film never upholds well, and given how many of the most remarkable practical effects ever put to screen can be found in the realms of classic horror, it astounds me as to why filmmakers still endorse it to the lengths they do. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark suffered from this exact same problem. Much of the CGI on show here looks pretty distracting at times, and I couldn't help but wonder what some sequences would have looked like if brought to life via practical effects. Facing the struggles of repetition, just about every sequence during the second act ends with a lazy jump scare or the emergence of an average CGI creation. It's hardly effective, and it gets boring staggeringly quick.
There are a handful of noteworthy sequences to be found here, though. One of the most effective of the bunch happens early on, including the Losers Club reuniting in a Chinese restaurant where an admittingly haunting scene plays out including fortune cookies and a tragic reveal. But what's largely frustrating about the scenes that actually work is how the insertion of comedy often downgrades these moments of genuine terror. Dauberman (for some unknown reason) injects quite a few punchlines and gags throughout the film, and just like the excessive CGI, this is annoyingly distracting and pointless.It Chapter Two is a crushingly disappointing sequel that doesn't live up to its superior predecessor. Excellent casting, good cinematography and a pretty enjoyable final confrontation between Pennywise and the Loser's Club aside, this is a film that could have greatly benefited from a few more cuts. Entire scenes and characters could be removed from the final cut, and the absence of these unnecessary additions wouldn't at all affect the overall narrative whatsoever. Chapter Two is a clumsy, bloated experience with moments of greatness, but unfortunately, this is a film that sinks rather than floats.",It Chapter Two
391,2001ASOfan,"A watchable mess, but just barely",4,11 September 2019,"Note that I wasn't a fan of the original theatrical ""It"" this is ""Chapter 2"" to, as the mix of shape-shifting Pennywise goofiness mixed with heavy drama just didn't set well with me, and I thought it ultimately failed both as a horror film and serious character study. Pennywise and his various forms just aren't that frightening to me, and some of the heavy drama is downright brutal compared to the shapeshifting silliness. It's jarring, and just doesn't work. This new chapter, without getting into spoilers, also manages to add a depressingly mixed, confused, and vague message to viewers about hate crimes that is truly queasymaking. Bill Hader is the standout for acting among the adults here, but the character he plays is also given a too-vague treatment. The subtlety means some (maybe even many) viewers will not even realize what his character's epiphany is as a person. I will say I wasn't bored watching it, even at almost 3 hours long, but I was put off by the lack of clarity and some of the more ridiculous, loud, silly monster moments. This film also veers wildly between extremes of heavy drama and some completely goofy monster and demon special effects and noise, just like the first, and, again, the combination just doesn't work.",It Chapter Two
392,theterminator-92378,A worthy follow up to the 2017 film while expanding the story of the losers club,9,7 September 2019,"What to say about IT Chapter 2 that have not been said this movie is just incredible Stephen King movies have been on the rise in recent years and this one and the 2017 original have been the best that have been adapted to screen and while chapter 2 may be the follow up it expands apon the original movie while also being able to tell the story of the adult losers and ends what is the best of the stephen king stories.
the story of the losers takes place 27 years after the original story where the losers are brought together to fight IT and the build up that sees how the losers have aged and while Stanley takes his own life in order for the losers to kill IT and i think that in a way this motivated the losers to do what they have been waiting 27 years for there fight against the thing that has been tormenting Derry for so many years. Another part that was very well used was the parts showing the young losers club and the parts imbetween moments from the original with digital de aging of the losers who have since grown up in real life and they have some great moments where they develop the story of the group and what they have been through and why they are such great friends and the scenes in the club house where they have parts that go from the young to the older losers and it's really my favorite parts of the transition between young and old.
The cast is incredible with Jessica Chastain {Beverly Marsh} James McAvoy { Bill Denbrough} Bill Hader {Richie Tozier} Isaiah Mustafa {Mike Hanlon} Jay Ryan {Ben Hanscom} James Ransone {Eddie Kaspbrak} Andy Bean {Stanley Uris} and Bill Skarsgård {Pennywise} with the returning young cast of Finn Wolfhard, Jack Dylan Grazer, Sophia Lillis, Chosen Jacobs, Wyatt Oleff, Jaeden Martell, Jeremy Ray Taylor and Nicholas Hamilton they reprise there roles from the 2017 IT and it is great to see the young cast back it breathes fresh life into the story and feels much like the book in the sense that it cuts betwen the POV of the young losers and then on to the older ones.

Side Note: I had never read the book but I can tell you the opening scene was based on a true incident that happened in Bangor Maine where Stephen King lives and where I grew up. I remember it quite well when it happened.The key flaw to this movie is it relies too heavily on the audience transferring their understanding of the bond built in the first movie to the people playing the adult version of the kids in this movie. In most sequels your okay that they spend less time bond building because those relationships were already established in the prior flick. But these are adult actors who look only mildly like their child counterparts, and you don't really feel the connection that the movie presumes you do. To even further illustrate my point, a lot of the background to the relationships in this story is told in flashbacks to the kids.So the actors are together for a scene in the first of the movie, and the only time they are all back together again is during the final battle. It just dulls your investment in the characters and thus the overall movie entirely.",It Chapter Two

Now they released the sequel, and I will say that if you didn't like the old take of this part of the story then you probably will be walking out of the cinema with a grin on your face, this movie is awesome! There are some effective scares here and there, in one scene I forced myself at the back of my seat so hard, it was like the scene aqtually was happening. All of the actors here does a great job, we really believe that they are the grown up-versions of the kids. I would say that the best actors were Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård.

The group defeats Pennywise by simply shouting random insults at him, which devolves into a chorus of ""dumb clown"" over and over again. This seems like lazy writing and a dishonor to Steven Kings creations. Given this unearned victory, the happy endings that the remaining members of the group have feels baseless and a bit cheap.

The movie starts with a hate crime if killing a gay guy and includes stealing sacred objects from natives and a running hidden joke about Stephen King's writing habits. I literally stopped the movie and slept twice while watching it because it doesn't flow all that well and doesn't resolve a lot of questions. They took almost 5 hours of screen time between parts 1 & 2 and they never fully explained what Pennywise is or how it came to be or why it eats people or the 27 year cycle. Some of the CGI wasn't scary to the contrary looked like something from a children's cartoon.,It Chapter Two

I don't think the runtime is too long, there is no space for boring scenes, it's always happening something interesting in the screen.The two weakest problems in my opinion were the CGI, I mean it's good but sometimes it's also too much (I don't know how to explain better, but they could use practical effects in some scenes, would make some elements more realistic), and I didn't like how the movie sometimes forgets some characters during a lot of time.

415,mc1382,Bonkers just....bonkers,5,8 September 2019,"Damn, I underestimated how much restraint Cary Fukunaga gave the first one. This film is bonkers and doesn't take a breather. This insanity works for the film's benefit and weakness. In saying this, the characterisation was interesting and I liked the contrast between childhood and adult fears. As you've probably heard the grown-up Loser club are great and their emotional progression throughout help to elevate the film as a whole. For as absurd and over the top as this film is there were instances where it worked in the film's favour and when it worked, the results were very satisfying. When it doesn't it feels like the weight of the film gets lost and all we're left with is a bunch of CGI effects and gross-out scares (some of which verge on comical).The first one understood that the kids fear was the horror and not the monster itself. This made it more psychologically interesting. This one has elements of that but it kinda focuses on the (jump) scares themselves rather than the implications. Sometimes at the expense of character development. I feel like without Fukunaga it loses some of that subtlety (even if his contribution to the first one was cut down due to him leaving the project). The pacing/length is good for the most part and I didn't feel the run time. The only instances of this were in the middle of the film which gets quite repetitive and the ending which gradually got draining. What helped elevate the ending was the emotional and cathartic resolution for the characters.Yes, this film is deeply flawed but there's enough good stuff that I ended up enjoying it. Considering how hard a book like IT is to adapt, I appreciate that they gave it a shot even if the final result leaves something to be desired.I can't decide between a 5 or 6 but I'mma just leave it at a 6 for now cause I'm in a happy mood.",It Chapter Two

It also made me glad that i as a watcher haven't thought about what happend when they where splitted up and thats so fun that the filmmaker thought about so many details to make it even more intressting.What It chapter 2 stick it out from the first one is that it takes up more important subject like the rage that Bill had over Georges death and the depression you feel with Beverly after what she had gone thrue and when stanley realize that suicide is the only way for him to make it stop.
I know many of you though it was to long and i personally feel like it's a good thing cause then the filmaker really got their time to fill in intressting parts and not make it like a deleted scene or just cut it afterworth. I also heard that people wasn't happy with the ending and i can see that but i also think it's hard to make a (not lame) villian death .Why i gave this movie 8 and not 10 whas that it was a little bit to messy sometimes and could have made it's backstory a little bit better!",It Chapter Two

IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.

426,lumieretrain,It Chapter Two by Andy Muschietti,8,11 September 2019,"The unexpected huge success of It Chapter One has surprised the audience, as it became a blockbuster with more than $700 million Box Office worldwide. The movie became one of the most important horror movies, as well as one of the most important movies which the filmmaker Andy Muschietti has ever directed. Thanks to It Chapter One, the actors who played the main characters, became important to get a career for their future. There were expectations to work on the second chapter of the movie, as the filmmakers went immediately back to work. Especially for how in the original novel It, the first part focuses on the Losers Club as children, by arriving at the second part which focuses on the main characters as adults. To see how the story would end, once the nightmare gets defeated. In 2019 came out It Chapter Two by Andy Muschietti with Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, Andy Bean and Bill Skarsgård. The movie's plot: 27 years after the event of the Chapter One, the Losers Club who have turned into adults must come back to Derry. As they all have promised to defeat It as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), who comes back to bring the nightmare again. The movie gets interesting by seeing how the main characters, would get back all of their memories after they have been away from the hometown. As they all have lost their childhood memories, which have been very important for all of them. The story balances the atmospheres between the horror and the drama, to be workable in the narration's rhythm from the beginning to the end. Especially on the moments where the main characters get back the memories, when they were all together as well as when they were separated in each roads. In the same way the story uses the dark fantasy elements, by making the movie spectacular and visceral to be unforgettable for the audience's eyes. The story uses jump scares in the most unexpected ways, by making some of the scariest scenes unforgettable. One of the most important elements of the movie like in the novel, is the dark side of the humans by showing how they can be cruel without necessary be controlled by It. By even describing how evil are the sociopath Henry Bowers and his gang, who would have no mercy with anybody especially with the Losers Club. Jessica Chastain was extraordinary as Beverly Marsh adult, who becomes a successful fashion designer and is married with the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrick). Once she gets the call from Mike Hanlon, she would slowly get back the memories about her complicated relationship with her abusive father Alvin Marsh (Stephen Bogaert). James McAvoy was excellent as Bill Denbrough adult, who becomes a successful horror novelist and writes a screenplay for a movie based on his book. He is married with Audra Phillips (Jess Weixler), a successful actress who plays a role for the movie based on Bill's book. Once Bill gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about the burden he has on his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott). Bill Hader did a well done job as Richie Tozier adult, who becomes a successful stand-up comedian. Once Richie gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about a secret he never said to anybody. Isaiah Mustafa was excellent as Mike Hanlon adult, who is the only one to have remained in Derry and he owns a library of the Town. Once Mike realizes It is back to bring the nightmare again, he immediately searches to call all the members of Losers Club. Mike would also show some discoveries he made, about the origins of It and how they can defeat Pennywise. Jay Ryan was excellent as Ben Hanscom adult, who becomes a fit and successful architect. Once Ben gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about the love he has on Beverly Marsh. James Ransone was extraordinary as Eddie Kaspbrak adult, who becomes a successful risk assessor and is married with Myra (Molly Atkinson) who resembles his over protective mother. Once Eddie gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about what happened to his mother's fate. Andy Bean did a well done performance as Stanley Uris adult, who becomes a firm accountant and is married with the teacher Patty Blum (Martha Girvin). Once Stanley gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would be the only one to not maintain the promise with an inevitable fate. There would be an explanation in the specific moment, the reason of his decision to not maintain the promise. Finally Bill Skarsgård was extraordinary as Pennywise, who this time would be much ferocious and vengeful. Especially by trying to kill with no mercy the Losers Club, as he would appear in the scariest forms in front of the main characters' eyes. The editing helps by maintaining the narration's rhythm workable with dramatic atmospheres, especially at the flashbacks where the main characters see themselves as children. As well as at the scariest scenes, where unexpected moments happen to be unforgettable. The camera catches important moments in every single angle shots, without letting the audience get distracted by anything. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch was elaborated, by describing the emotions of the main characters and the specific atmospheres with compatible musical notes. It Chapter Two is one of the best horror movies, with a surprising epic conclusion.",It Chapter Two

The movie is not a comedy movie so why is there so many comedy scenes . The final scenes is look like a kids movie : theykilled it why kids words like you are ugly or you are just a clown clown and the plot have big difference with Stephen King roman like why the story talks about the sexuality of Richie . The movie is good but the first was better or Stephen King masterpiece was 10 times better .the movie had not be nominated for nothing . I don't understand why the cast don't took the first it costume it was ten times more scariest and the actor bill skarsagard the guy who played it made an amazing job and others actors too.I come back too talk about the story, it was amazing and had logic with the 1st and havelittle reference with the 1st and if you don' tseen the 1st you will understandwith the flashback and others.

I have to given the high quality of the rest of the movie the makers could made a better ending..... and both the TV adaptation with Tim Curry and the big screen versions shyed away from the ending in the book which was disappointing but admittedly probably difficult to pull off.Anyway apart my gripe about the ending, my Wife and I thoroughly enjoyed IT Part 2.... this was not just a 2 dimensional horror movie, it had depth and the script in terms of the character interaction and casting was Top notch.IT part 2 really shows that horror movies can be more than just cheap jumps and shocks..... and I can finally forgive Stephen King for the terrible 90's TV adaptation of the Tommy Knockers!!",It Chapter Two

However, seeing as it's part 2 I have some caveats. 1) the runtime was way too long, I liked the fact it kept going from modern to present but it felt bloated in the middle. 2) the cgi is overdone and not effective. 3) there are some scares but I felt I was watching a thriller/drama instead of horror. 4) the ending was meh, again overblown ending esp the narration at the end, I felt like this movie was never going to end.
5) if pt2 was released as a separate movie with same title it would've easily worked, if you haven't seen part 1, no need as pt2 summarizes it perfectly, the problem is it's part 2 and I expected more.
6) it's worth a watch and I enjoyed It but part 1 was far superior.

436,Thekeybaldemasterrises,IT is a mess :(,6,6 September 2019,"Boy is IT Chapter 2 messy. I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't thrilled with this movie. It's far too long. It's almost 3 hours, and it feels longer. The pacing is brutal in the first half, and by the time you get to the third act, you just feel too exhausted to feel completely invested. Where the first movie worked for me as it's own self contained movie, Chapter 2 is definitely a companion piece that expects you to watch it immediately after the last movie. Which makes sense as they made it clear that Chapter 1 was just taking the kids portion of the book, and then Chapter 2 would be about them grown up. I will say this movie delivered on good casting of the adult counterparts, because everyone genuinely does a good job. Bill Hader is easily the best part of the film, he had some of the funniest gags I've seen this year. However that leads me to my next issue, it's way too comedic. For being a horror film, its not scary. The humor overtakes any tension it wants me to feel when it's dropped right in the middle of a scare. The first one did this too, but I didn't feel it was as obnoxious as this. Especially when most of your scares are pop outs and loud noises. There were scenes I just tuned out because the tone was so all over the place that, I just didn't know what to feel. A guy in our theatre fell asleep and was snoring so loud, we all just laughed because... yeah, it was kinda boring at times! All my problems pretty much trace back to the book and why it's damn near impossible to adapt and make great. It's a mess of a book. While Bill Skarsgard is chilling to watch as Pennywise, and the coming of age story works well in places, it just all doesn't flow well together here as it did last time. I will commend both movies for trying to mainstream the material, and for REALLY trying. Both films have engaging performances, and some really nice cinematography, but I just don't feel as eager to watch Ch 2 as much on repeat viewings. The ending was the equivalent of Lord of the Rings where it takes that much time and investment out of you, to the point where the ending overstays it's welcome. It Ch 2 isn't the worst movie I've seen this year, but it was disappointing. 5/10",It Chapter Two

I like my scares subtle but this just went a little too far especially in the third act.
Pennywise has his moments like the first film but it seemed they just tried to make too much of him and what was happening.
I can honestly say this film I didn't jump once although the film was aim to make for that.
I was saying it's not a bad film and the production was great, you'll probably get some loving this but unfortunately me I didn't.

438,babybuletgani,Opening back in 1989,6,8 November 2019,"Opening back in 1989, as the Losers' Club enter a blood pact to again fight the shape-shifting evil of 'It' should Derry's streets and storm drains ever run red again, the action then jumps forward 27 years to the brutal death of Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan). Beaten in a homophobic attack, Adrian is thrown off a bridge into the churning river, only for a clown to appear on the bank and offer an outstretched hand...
Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only Loser who has remained in Derry, puts out calls to Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Ben (Jay Ryan) and Stanley (Andy Bean). They are scattered, memories tattered, but Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård) is ready to greet them all. And he - it - remembers everything. Clocking in at nearly three hours (insert 'ballooning running time' gag here), It Chapter Two sees returning director Andy Muschietti craft a hugely ambitious horror blockbuster the like of which we've not seen since Kubrick's The Shining. Too long? Nah, its flaws lie elsewhere: the book's WTF ending works better on page than screen; Pennywise loses some of his scarefactor as his mythology is laid bare; the mid-section is episodic - a series of horror shorts laid end-to-end - as Pennywise terrorises each of the adult Losers in turn; and too many reality-bleeding-into-fantasy scenes featuring too much CGI make It Chapter Two resemble a latter-day Freddy Krueger movie. (A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 even plays at the pictures in one of the 1989 flashbacks.)
Still, huge kudos goes to Muschietti for once again capturing the essence of King's magnum opus. There are many glorious scenes here and a real frisson comes from seeing the adult Losers (all good, with Hader the standout) return to the Barrens, Keenes Pharmacy and, of course, the house of Neibolt Street. Themes of memory, identity and trauma run deep, and viewers can expect shivers aplenty; dread is just a part of it.

441,jcullen_s,Better then original TV movie,7,7 September 2019,I enjoyed the movie I thought it was scary at times well get to that later and an overall pretty good adaptationBut I feel very mixed with problems like I never was interested with the Ben Beverly and Bill triangle and that's another thing Ben was really different in this movie in the book and original movie I remember him as a drunk playboy millionaire something like Tony Stark he reminded me of but now he just looks like a bodybuilder or model or something like that and it bugs meI do really like the rest of the characters like Richie and Mike have been my favourite because Richie is amazingly played by Finn wolfhard(sorry if spelled wrong) and Bill Hader is just great and Mike I really loved because he's so emotionally broken from It for 27 years because he has never forgot about It people might disagree with me about Mikes character but I like himThe directing was another great part about this movie with all the transitions and things like that and this is way scarier then It 2017 because we got stuff like a wired bug with a baby face come out of a fortune cookie and that unforgettable Ms.Kersh scene witch is on par with the shinning but there were a bit to many jump scares if you ask meSomething I didn't like was the new Henery Bowers the kid I thought was good but the older him was just over the top and just boring to watch in my opinionI do like the Steven king cameo that was pretty intertaning and how they always say to bill his endings suck witch is a lot of things people say about King great book bad ending another problem I had is while it was funny it was a bit to much at times for example the Chinese place was good to be funny but not when Eddie gets thrown up on and they play it comicalOverall a good movie my thoughts might change but right now It chapter 2 is a 7 for me,It Chapter Two

I was so annoyed, though, I have to add my own displeasure: This movie had me staring at the clock constantly.

I realize they wanted to adapt the book correctly but the book was even too long for some people. I loved the scares. I will say I was pretty scared the whole time. It was like going through a marginally scary haunted house. Pennywise was perfect as always. He has more time on screen in this movie and gets to show more bite than he did in the first chapter.

I'll bet even those who are rating it high couldn't wait for it to end either. It reminded me of scoobydoo on one had, a group of goofy people seeking for clues about a ghost/clown and trying to unravel the mystery. On the other hand it had the zombies of the Evil dead, so a bit more x=rated than scooby

Do not expect a horror film because this is not. This is a well made monster film with horror elements.It Chapter Two looks really good. Cinematography is amazing. It exudes the feeling of a high budget film. There are quite a few scenes that are just amazing to see. The film starts well and maintained a decent pace for a while but eventually ran out of gas and started dragging.The pacing was the single most negative thing for me because it never allowed me to get hooked with the film. The long run time does not help the cause. There are many things that could have been cut out.The portions of the films that worked, worked too well. I am glad I got to see this film because there are few scenes that are just too good for any horror or monster film fans. The scenes in the restaurants in the beginning with the fortune cookies is super creepy. The scenes under the baseball stand is amazing as well. And the one with the old woman that was on the trailer is great as well. The whole 20min or so in the climax is also worth going through some of the boring scenes.I loved Pennywise in this one. Bill Skarsgård has done an amazing job. His voice is superb. Among other actors none really stands out. The younger versions of all the actors have done a better job in my opinion.Anyone who watched IT should give it a watch. Yes, not everything is quite there but the good outweighs the bad. I enjoyed it.",It Chapter Two

It has some very good moments of tension l, quite raw and gore scenes, but in general it is a soothing hitter. ""It"" is not a clown, it is an evil entity that takes many forms and here they do not show it as such, in the first one it was well introduced but here they were limited with the character, they are still determined to only show Pennywise and do not show their true potential. Although the performances and the actors are very good, the ""companionship"" is not felt, only when there are flashbacks and they show them guys is when you notice that ""brothers"" atmosphere. Many times it is not understood why an adult is going to be afraid of something that feeds on your dreams and you already know that if you are not afraid of it, nothing will happen to you (of the children if it is understood, obviously) .The problem is the script and deepened to that the long duration that does not know how to build and spin the plot well; It has some scenes of other people's shame and also forced comedy.

460,jadediamond,Disappointed,7,6 September 2019,"The only reason I'm giving this movie a C for effort is because I can tell the cast, the crew, the producers, director and everyone else attached to this movie put a lot of their hearts and souls into this movie. Yet, it didn't live up to the hype of the original. I began to lose interest in the opening scene where we see a gay, white couple at a fair and get not one gay kiss but two gays kisses and of course a group of homophobic white males beat them up. They also change the sexuality of one of the losers to homosexuality. Because heaven forbids if two guys have a close friendship where they occasionally make fun of one another, then it must mean they're gay. So IT has become a LBGT agenda movie. The movie had a good ending, but it wasn't any better thassn the original. While the scares of the original depended on Tim Curry and practical effect. This one depended on Bill Skarsgard and CGI. There were two scenes where I jumped. But for the rest, the monsters weren't scary, you can anticipate the scare, or the audience was tricked into thinking they were about to get a jump scare. The writers were creative and did their best to make this movie different from the original. They relied heavy on showing a lot of flashbacks with the younger cast to get those nostalgia moments and attempt to capture the magic of the first movie. But like the original, the adult cast were great, but they couldn't capture the childhood innocence of their younger counterparts even when they made juvenile jokes to one another as the adults. I did like that they gave Mike a little bit more to do. He got to narrate the scene after the opening scene, have a private talk with Bill, and help out with the final battle. I did love the storyline between Ben and Beth. It was different from the original, but it was a good mix of romance, horror, and angst. It wasn't a bad movie, but go in also knowing it's going to be an agenda movement. And this will be the new norm for all movies. Even if it has no place in the movie and feels added on, Hollywood is going to insert their agenda and if this is how every movie is going to be, then I'll be seeing fewer movies in in the future. Overall, it was an okay movie. It was more funny than scary. However, I won't be adding it to my It collection. I'm cool with the 1990s It and 2017 IT Chapter One.",It Chapter Two

I understand horror movies have been castrated by modern sensibilities but feel free to be ""Conjuring"" creative. ""It"" is more slapstick humor than comedy.

464,iamianiman,IT ends with a big balloon.,6,4 September 2019,"""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you. I've missed you!""Pros:The casting director very much shines in the spotlight here. If there is a category for Best Casting Director in the Academy Award, I am all in to bet that It: Chapter Two's will not just get nominated, but win very big. The casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger-selves from the predecessor.You will feel the emotional impact of The Losers' Club as a whole. The fear that feeds their souls, the memories that hunt them & the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within & about.The various & disparate forms of IT should give a blast of excitement to the audience. This is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other-worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek-a-boo! It is gross, weird and definitely strange.The heartwarming story of The Losers' Club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year. The connection they have is so strong and palpable,An excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another, giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure.Cons:Albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch, however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow. This is the main problem with the IT movies, it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare. Even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures' features.The real form of IT is upsetting and disappointing. I can strongly say that the majority will love IT's true form from the 1990 Television Mini-Series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier, deadlier & more realistic.It is super slow and draggy that it doesn't need to be at almost 3 hours mark. 2 hours should be the best run time for this movie like IT Chapter One. It has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour. Reunion, get together, a few jumpscare parts. That's all there is to it.The second act of the movie (halfway) feels as if you are watching 5 to 6 different short films instead. Because it has that slow-burning nature, the scenes feel disjointed from one another. It spends around 45 minutes to an hour to look at every members of The Losers' Club being haunted by Pennywise.Verdict: IT CHAPTER TWO is certainly fresh and enjoyable. Hopes up not, its extremely slow-going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode. IT CHAPTER TWO walks you into a journey of the insidious Derry town albeit its lack of formidable creatures.",It Chapter Two
465,huntersmithx,Flawed yet semi-satisfying,7,7 September 2019,"I was originally hesitant to see director Andy Muschietti's rendition of Stephen King's beloved book ""It"" back in 2017, but after hearing splendid reviews from fans and critics; I took a chance and came out pleasantly surprised. Since then, I agree with why that is now considered by many to be a modern Horror classic.Now our favorite Losers club are back to face Pennywise again in ""It: Chapter Two"". Adding up all of that and that this is my second most anticipated mainstream film of the year, does it live up to the hype? Well, somewhat. It's an imperfect but solid sequel.In spite of a three hour runtime it kept my attention for the entire ride. Like ""Chapter One""; it's wonderfully shot (with effective use of sepia tone colors) and the editing and scene transitions are eye popping. Many of the dialogue and scares are cleverly written (a scene at a restaurant is a highlight).In spite of an often unsettling plot, there is plenty of levity to be found here. It unfortunately suffers from inappropriate timing with many of the jokes, causing the film to play like a dark comedy. Half of the frightening and dramatic moments are finished by gags and one-liners. There is one scary sequence that really works until it's ruined by a joke straight out of a Deadpool film.The pacing is troubling at times; since some of the opening introductions are rushed, while certain flashbacks to the younger versions of the Losers Club could've been shorter. This makes the narrative not feel as fresh or as fulfilled compared to the first film.It's most accomplished at being an emotionally fulfilling journey for the Losers club. This is sharpened by the adult actors being dead ringers for the kids from the original; including the main highlight Bill Hader- an instant classic as Richie, as he combines the best of his talent from ""Saturday Night Live"" with intense urgency to best serve the idea of ""What would Richie from It be like if he grew up?""If you're looking for a good cinematic start for this Halloween season, and something to bring you back all the feels from Chapter One from September 2017; Chapter Two is a somewhat messy but nicely done job.

What I found missing was that some scenes were too long. It's a little bad for them to postpone what they have to do and engage in other events. Since the film was R-Rated, the blood was used very successfully. Bill Skarsgård's wonderful Pennywise performance adds a distinct taste to the film. The player elections were also very successful. I can say exactly the same. Dialogues are very well written by place. The first film is better, but it's nothing less than that. It was a nice sequel. In short, it was a film that could be enjoyed.

It did not need to be three hours, I literally checked my phone several times because I was so bored and I NEVER do that. Boring. Boring. Contrived dialogue. Boring.It felt like a disjointed connect the dots thing like ""lets see what happens to this person next, now this person, oh big surprise its something relating to their childhood phobia"" like some sort of kids book.Also, there were so many rip off references not to just to other Stephen King movies (not even counting his cameo as the shop owner) and ripping off a scene from The Visit from M Night Sham. It was not cute. And there were too many references to the book having a bad ending while still having a bad ending.Major plot holes, not going to give them away, you'll figure it out. It was like there were 5 different endings that were all equally cheesy with unbearable dialogue and outcomes.Cannot stress enough that nothing was scary. I temporarily suspended my prediction filter to try and be jump scared but it didn't work. I wanted to be jump scared, or scared, I really did. But the formula was too tropey.I literally did not get a single moment of amusement, enjoyment, or any sort of entertainment value from this garbage.

471,pkneer,Good and Bad and Could Have Been Great,6,7 September 2019,"First, I had such high hopes for this movie, so expectations were at the top. The Good - the acting was above average with Hader being the biggest surprise. The casting was absolutely perfect - each adult actor looked like the child actor and made that aspect more believable. Also the CGI was very good. The Not So Good was the feeling you watched a scene and wondered about its purpose. The takeaway was the movie could have been trimmed and cleaned up and cut down from its 3 HOUR length. The Bad - the length, as I found myself checking my watch, which is a killer for any film. And there were characters that basically served no purpose in the plot or it's direction. Why were Henry and his burned up buddy even in the film? Take his scenes out and you have a 2 hour movie that was a lot tighter.I had a bad feeling very early on when it became apparent that the film was relying more on jump scares rather than creepy and eeriness that the book, the TV miniseries, and part 1 created. Some of the jump scares were very well done, but that was not the type of film I was expecting or hoping for.If you did not have high expectations or expect a film similar to part 1, this is an excellent jump scare horror film - but personally it was not the kind of film I wanted to see.",It Chapter Two

Oh, scary scene, I should act scared. Oh, fighting scene, I should be brave. Oh, sad scene, I should cry.It's cheesy, it's long, the jumps scares don't work at all... and yet, I gave it a pretty high score.It's because I consider it an adventure movie that tries to amaze you with new CGI. Almost like a video game. I know I'm doing the movie a disservice but if I review it as a horror movie where character development is important, I'll probably give it a one.It feels pretty epic, even though I rolled my eyes a couple of times.So yeah, go watch it if you're bored.",It Chapter Two

If they cut 30-40 minutes from the almost 3 hour running time and tightened the narrative it would have been a 10. It's longer than The Godfather. There is a tad bit of meandering in the second act of the movie. That could have been easily cut. The final act seemed very rushed.

Pennywise is at his most effective when he's in the shadows, offering a scary contrast with his pale skin.Sadly, when he's out in the open he just looks silly. There were a few scenes that were actually kind of scary. But the rest just felt like missed opportunities.I didn't really care about the adult versions of the characters either. The first film did a better job at getting me invested in the characters. Their fear also felt much more palpable. This film was a strange mixture of f-bombs, badly-timed jokes, and random outbursts of screaming that hardly felt real.I will admit though, there were a few sequences near the end of the movie that were memorable when I wasn't distracted by the disorganized directing.Best scene = the bleacher scene though, bar none.",It Chapter Two

Returning to Derry, they are made to confront a vengeful evil while relieving past fears and traumas that did not go away in adulthood. As an ensemble, the cast have balanced roles without one dominating the presence, unlike the original where Bill's guilt is emphasized. However, because of different character arcs, the thematic message becomes muddied. The character arcs deal with the same fears, guilt and repressed feelings from the original, although additional perspectives were added.Mike is underused and should have been the emotional center, notwithstanding the need to definitely close a chapter in the ensemble's life centered around Derry and It, and by also being the character that remained in Derry. The reveal he withheld information from the group that the American natives died fighting It felt shoehorned and his reasoning contrived. Bill's guilt is explored deeper when it is revealed his reluctance to join his younger brother Georgie was intentional and not because of sickness. Richie is revealed to be a closet gay who developed feelings for Eddie since. Homosexuality is a theme hammered violently in the opening scene when a gay couple was brutally attacked after which followed It's first reappearance, although the film doesn't overtly project a pro-LGBT stance. Stan's suicide does not help the Losers Club and the letters sent by him explaining his reason is unnecessary. Beverly continues to experience sexual and family abuse through her husband, but this is glossed over and her prominence as the lone female is not as strong from the original. Ben remains insecure with his feelings with Beverly. Their resolution is lovely, as Beverly realizes Ben wrote the poem she kept safe.Overall the film is convoluted and has a repetitive story, although the latter can be forgiven because childhood trauma don't necessarily go away in adulthood. While the film has multitudes of messages, it gets bogged down because it does too many things at once. Despite its epic length, the conclusion is well earned because the characters have fully grown from their trauma. Although the pacing can be slow, especially during the first hour, the narrative hastens when the ensemble begins the quest to find totems of their pasts and It's appearance becomes more frequent.Speaking of It, Bill Skarsgard is absolutely fantastic and the film's true highlight. The scene were he gave It emotional range during the baseball game is phenomenal. Skarsgard is terrifying, although the CGI feels overdone during the final battle. Part of his awesome performance is embodying the non-human personality which director Andy Muschietti characterized It to differentiate him from Tim Curry. The rest of the cast is good and no one in particular is bad. Bill Hader steals the show by balancing comedy with inner sadness. A lacking element here present from the original is Derry's creepiness. Almost every citizen in Derry from the original had sinister, hidden motives or bad intentions making the Losers Club stood out. Compared to the original Chapter Two looks more beautiful direction wise. The cinematography and production designed are improved, despite portraying the same setting. Many of the visual and practical effects are great. The horror is strong and score is more engaging.It Chapter Two has many qualities riding for it but also weaknesses from the script, ultimately coming up short to the original.6.5/10",It Chapter Two

I love Bill Hader and he had the best lines.....
I did lower my score by two points.
First i just wish that Beverley and Ben had more dialogue between them like Annette O'Toole and John Ritter had....
Second gratuitous Killing of kids lower my score aside from that it was awesome.
Bill Skarsgard is great he's really freaky in the movie even so more than Tim Curry which i loved.....

480,legonerdy,Far From Mediocre,7,8 September 2019,"The movie wasn't incredible, but it wasn't bad. I genuinely enjoyed the movie and actually found myself laughing hysterically. Some people may view this as a weakness in the film, but I feel like it actually kills you into a sense of comfort and complacency that makes the scares land better. I didn't jump at all in the first movie, but I jumped two and a half times in this one. I generally don't go for jump scares, bu I feel like these actually had something to offer. They were more than SUDDEN LOUD NOISE MAKES YOU FEEL ABRUPT INCREASES IN ADRENALINE. I liked it.The only real critique I have is that Pennywise didn't feel like as much of a threat this time around. He messed with them a little, but he was largely absent. When he did show up, their mother of finally doing him in was... odd. I won't say it was ineffective, but it was an odd approach. I will grant that the first movie was supposed to be fear while the second was self-exploration and coming to grips with yourself, but I still feel that a movie titled ""It"", and that is supposed to be a monster movie, should have more monster.Also Henry. That was either a waste of a character or an unnecessary addition. Though, in fairness, he did cause one of the funniest scenes.",It Chapter Two

But how to say it, ""The Clown Returning to the Soul 2"" 145 minutes of the director of the film is obviously wanting to dig more into the inner fear of the character, and the main creation adds a lot of eggs to the first part of the clown. But in fact, too many jump scares make it difficult to be scared after the mid-term, and even feel boring. The main creative desire to express more but limited to the horror film restrictions made the customer's original fear of the theme somewhat deviated, feeling the lack of the first time to see the surprise. Ps: The monsters made by modern special effects, although not scary, can really be disgusting to the audience. The emotional line of the clown's returning soul is very different from the theme!

It seems that they decided to completely remove all the things that made chapter 1 decent and expand on all the things that didn't work with it. There is no subtlety in this film. It's all over-the-top, giant, loud, bad CGI monsters running at the characters while screaming. It's not scary.

I expected it to be even more groundbreaking than Chapter One, instead we got a sloppy script for the most of the film, and it's only the ending that stopped me from giving it 3 out of 10. Having said that, I don't mean the ending was phenomenal, no. It's simply way better than the first 2 acts which are pure snooze fest, the jokes were completely unnecessary and gratuitous here and made it look like an amateur writing, no offence. It wasn't scary even for a second, instead it was overly loud with of plenty poorly executed jump-scare efforts. It's like they shot the first 140 minutes in a rush, put it together, realized it doesn't look good and decided to work hard on the ending. I just can't believe it, guys.

Actors who play grown-ups give amazing performances, especially James McAvoy and Bill Hader. They managed to show and make us believe in their connection starting from teen years onward.

I'm not normally into horror films because of the generic jump scares and so on but IT is exception.So to bascially sum up chapter 2, well it plays a lot on the first film, i would say a good 1 hour & 30 mins are just flashbacks to the first film, yes they are revelent scenes to get their items that they need to sacrifice to do the ritual. BUT that does not make a good movie imo, because in between the almost 3 hour run time, you get Pennywise kinda scaring the cast here & there, the scary things that appear this time are more funny than scary according to everyone in the cinema I was in at the time.Then towards the end we are greeted with Pennywise's ""real"" form, some spider looking thing which wasn't really gripping imo, but the way they defeated Pennywise was interesting, ill leave that spoiler out :)Yes there is still a great sense of humour in the film which I think we all love, the banter is still there from all the cast. BUT I do prefer them as a young cast personally, I think it just worked better BUT I understand that the films followed the books so I can't really moan about that.All in all i understand some of my points might seem silly because they have to follow the books but hey, it's my view on this filmOverall though i would not watch this one again but have happily watched IT 1 numerous times now & still love it.Age: 25 - Cinema Saw: Cineworld Stevenage iMAX 2D - Cost: Unlimited Card",It Chapter Two

498,DanielRobertRoss,Does it float or sink?,6,5 September 2019,"Since the 70s, there's been great Stephen King adaptations (Shawshank, Green Mile, The Shining, Misery and Carrie), there's quite a few mediocre (Cujo, Children of the Corn, Pet Cemetery) and quite a few that are just rubbish (The risible Maximum Overdrive, Dreamcatcher, Dark Tower etc).
King's not to blame for the variable quality of course, not every director is Stanley Kubrick.So where does It: Part 2 rank?I enjoyed the first film for what it was, despite some silly moments and excessive jump scares. I appreciated director Andy Muschietti's style for the film and looked forward to seeing where the second film would go.
Unfortunately this anticipated follow up is quite frankly, more of the same.
Despite strong performances from all the cast (In particular Bill Hader) and some well executed set pieces, the genuinely creepy moments are dwarfed by CGI jump scares, but I have to admit, I jumped back in my chair several times. Cheap or not, those damn boo moments work.However I still miss the era of films like The Shining, where slow tension and atmospheric chills were more important than cheap boo scares.
Not a bad film by any stretch, it's leagues above the frankly crap TV miniseries (Apart from a bonkers Tim Curry as Pennywise, the 90s version is pretty forgettable).
A solid addition to the genre (With a fun cameo from a genre master), but it's not exactly going to dethrone the great Stephen King adaptations.
But goddammit, I jumped back in my seat three times. And my partner loved it.

I thought they did a great job with the casting, especially the adult version of Eddie. The actor completely nailed the performance. He even looks like the younger actor all grown up.
If you read the 1,100+ page novel, you know that the movie is very different from the book - as it should be, as the book was a huge letdown. At least for me. Thankfully there are no giant space turtles here.
I loved the humor in the story. Others have complained that there was too much, but I thought it worked.

504,wackywhovian11,Not True To The Book,6,23 September 2019,"Well I finally got to see IT chapter two after 3 weeks of finishing up that very very VERY long book Stephen King who I love but seriously why does he have to write such long ass books. But anyway I finished it last week so I saw the film on Friday (September 20th) and I'll start this review off with it's NOT like the book at all. Okay that's not true, some of it is of course BUT they changed ALOT of the book to fit the movie which I understand but after you spent weeks reading the book you want to see what you've read? Does that makes sense?
Anyway if you are knew to the world of IT and didn't see the first film shame on you because it's a great film. IT Chapter One is basically about these kids who classify themselves the Losers Club are haunted by the evil clown Pennywise who can change his appearance into anything that frighten you to feed off your fear. Okay so kids band together to take down Pennywise at the end of the first film by making a pact that if it's not dead they'll come back to finish the job.
Alright so you're caught up on the first film so now on with Chapter Two where it's 27 years later (which I guess IT has to wait to gain his strength to attack again after what happened in the first film?) I didn't understand that part in the book/movie so I'm just guessing that's why Pennywise had to wait so long to attack the adult kids from the first film. Anyway Mike calls everyone back for a reunion of sorts to try to band together again to fight Pennywise again and finally kill it for good. Their is a member of the group that isn't with them and I won't spoil it because it's a key factor to the story. Anyway the film takes a lot of liberates from the book to the film like I said which I understand because you can't fit a long ass book like that into a 2 hour and 50 minute film <== yep you read that right nearly a 3 hour film so be prepared for a long film. Bill is still dealing with the death of Georgie from the first film. Ben of course is still in love with Beverly and too scared to tell her even after all these years. Eddie is still OCD over every little thing from germs to sickness. Richie is a stand up comedian which is understandable because he was always the funny one. Bev is a fashion designer and Mike take care of the library in Derry, Maine. Okay good now we have our characters set up, let's get to why I didn't really like this film. Okay that's really not true I liked the flashback scenes of the kids from the first film and that was basically it. The adult version of the kids I didn't care for because to me they were a dry in their performance but the kids scenes were fresh because it took me back to when I watch the first IT film and loved it. I wish they had jus stuck with the kids more and not waited 27 years for them to be adults to kill Pennywise because it would have been more entertaining (for me). I won't spoil the film climax scene of the fight with Pennywise because if you've read the book it's WAY different (trust me) but I'll just say I didn't care for it. I felt Pennywise powers 27 years later were a bit lacking in his goal to get to the adults who hurt him which made no sense. If you've been lying in wait for 27 years ago don't you think that's a pretty good nap to regain your powers to take out a bunch of kids who are now adults?
The things I did enjoy about IT Chapter Two were like I said the kids from the first film scenes were great. The Paul Bunyan part with the adult Richie was awesome. The Fortune cookie scene was creative. The part with Bev and the old lady in her old apartment was not scary but funny as hell.
Would I suggest this film for y'all to see? Hmm well if you've seen the first film then I mean why wouldn't you see the second part that's just silly. That's like reading first part of a book and then saying nope I'm good I don't want to know the end. So yes I would suggest it but wait for Redbox or on demand which I wish I had done that OR watched Downton Abby BUT like I said I finished that really LONG book and I wanted to see the conclusion of the film. Would I buy this film on Blu-ray? Well of course, because I have the other film and the also the mini-series and I'm sure they'll be extra scenes that we didn't get to see in theaters that I'll be interested in viewing BUT I won't rush out and get it the day it comes out I'll wait until it's on sale.",It Chapter Two

So I was pleasantly surprised to love the first hour build up to chapter two.
Don't get me wrong as an horror genre fan this is not scary at all, but it certainly is a much more entertaining watch than the first helping.
It reminded me of a darker version of The goonies and that is by no means a bad thing. The humour was good as this was much needed at the long running time.
As in the original IT films I think at nearly three hours long it was far to long in length.

This started out with some beautiful dialogue and original/creepy and scary scenes but it kind of went south from there as the movie progressed. Cheap sound effects, predictable scenes and regular talking with a mix of things that didn't make sense took over the movie.

Long horror films can, and do work - The Shining being a great example, with plenty of time devoted to character and creating an unsettling atmosphere. Here though with so many characters, and so much backstory, everything gets abbreviated down into a short flashback, followed by a series of jumpscares. Now this might just work for a regular 90 minutes, but for something almost twice that length it just becomes tediously repetitive. Then with the film concentrating on the scares there is even less time for the very capable cast to do something with the flimsy material. In a good horror there should be a quite tension, broken only by the gasp or well placed chuckle, to break the tendiont. Today there was more an air of boredom.",It Chapter Two
510,mertafor,Was that a missing sequel of Harry Potter?,6,8 September 2019,"I guess the writers were making fun of themself through Bill's writing skills: ""your book is really good but ending is terrible"". This explains a lot about this movie.After I read several divided reviews here, I realized that terrible cgi and cheap scares are waiting me. I totally agree with those views. But honestly it didn't bother me much because I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of the movie. It was nothing to do with horror yet it was great entertainment. I didn't even care much about inconsistencies like some characters from previous movie came back from dead (IT is all about sort of hallucinations after all, but dead guy was driving a car!?). Going into these details might make this movie unwatchable because Pennywise only goes after children. So why our older losers club crew is still in danger?Anyway, then the last 1/3 came. Oh boy, what a mess. I totally forgot what I was watching before. Losers club against some cheap spell from out of this world. I felt like I was watching a harry potter sequel. Apparenly writers saw the potential of first movie and wanted build a deep philosophy around Pennywise for sequels. However it doesn't add up. Some moment you show old pictures of Pennywise from a century ago and a woman claims that she's his daughter. It definitely looks instresting and creepy, gives hope for a potential back story. Right after that they come up with a place, Pennywise's ""den"", which existed for millions of years according to Mike. And Pennywise's possible back story is being swapped with an ancient power idea.Story was basically all over the place. The main reason is movie has identity issues. Tries to be comedy, horror, adventure, fantasy and something epic. Being as a huge 80s horror / comedy fan, I must say this one is far away from the genre.In the end although several issues, it's a watchable movie and deserves a 6.5/10.

515,zanghi_james,Just My Honest Opinion after Streaming this Film for about fifteen minutes...,3,27 October 2020,"Watched up to where Richie is introduced. Not at all impressed. This is a pretty bad film.The opening scene with the 'I Heart Derry' balloons was close to what happened in the book, but not as good. Much like the opening scene with Georgie in the first part, it doesn't stick the landing.Casting is okay. James McAvoy is a good choice for Stuttering Bill and the guy they got for Eddie visually looked good, but Jessica Chastain was never who I saw as Beverly. Didn't get to really soak in the Bill Hader performance, which I've heard is one of his better ones.I really don't like how Andy Muschietti and Gary Dauberman completely butchered one of Stephen King's best novels. The Novel is far too complex to even be broken down into a two-parter movie and so much important stuff is written out for pacing and time as a result. I am reminded of a considerable passage from the King Steve himself, from his opening introduction of the Uncut version of another novel, 'The Stand'. He tells a shortened and streamlined version of Red Riding Hood that is essentially a one-paragraph summary of a much more detailed story then talks about the missing details make the story far better.That is the same thing with this film. The movie omits and changes so much that I can remember from King's massive novel. The character of Audra Weixler is reduced to a tertiary character, when she is vastly more important to the story. There is barely any reference, reportedly, to the Turtle and the Ritual of Chud is completely rewritten. Now, the Eddie/Richie bro-mance is actually something I'm on board with, but other than that, this movie is just so typical of either immense studio interference or a director who has little regard for the source material.The most maddening thing about this film is the omission of the book's original ending, which, had it been done right, would have been a magnificent ending on par with Shawshank Redemption. Guess I'll have to wait another few years for a better attempt at Stephen King's novel, because this attempt by Muschietti is terrible.In short, this feels more like a spin-off to the Conjuring than a straight-up Stephen King-fest. I really think both parts of It are poorly made. I just hope I don't have to wait another 27 years for a remake.",It Chapter Two
516,AnAverageNerd,So close yet so what,7,30 August 2020,"Lets start off by agreeing that we were all shocked at how good the first film was and therefore we all went in with some significant expectations. Once again, this film hits the mark on many of its attempts at comedy and i feel that this is almost as important to these films then the horror itself. The horror itself is done fairly well however due to its overly fantastical nature you begin to desensitise to everything. The thing that really lets this film down is the ending and our procrastinators defeating the dreaded clown. Watching these heroes fight through all number of situations just to shout a few insults to win at the end really left me cringing at how they managed to turn this film from a good sequel to just plain weird. Overall, you'll love the characters (especially Richie and Eddie), you'll love the villain, it hits the mark for a good 90 minutes and then they start to run out of fuel.",It Chapter Two
517,watcher101,A little disappointing,5,8 September 2019,"I'll admit that I set my expectations a little high after the first one, but even then, there were several things about this movie that were rather disappointing. The first one was great, a true horror movie. This one was more of a dark fantasy, kind of like the movie ""Pan's Labyrinth"". One of the biggest issues is that for some reason, it kept throwing in needless and pointless humor. Sometimes it was a character making a comedic remark, sometimes it was just a scene itself that came across as comedic. This unnecessary comedy really underplays a lot of stuff in the movie, making scary scenes less scary and making serious scenes less serious and impactful (such as the random 'Angel Of The Morning' moment). I really don't know why they did that. Sometimes those comedic scenes were unintentional, but many were.I was also disappointed with some of the characters. Eddie, Ritchie, and Ben came across as bitter and angry a lot of the time. Ben especially, and he had this possessive, jealous air about him towards Beverly. Speaking of which, I didn't buy the romance between them, at least not on Bev's end. Ben was in love with her since childhood, which was fine, but Bev was completely in love with Bill since childhood, and even when they were adults. But then she suddenly and immediately falls for Ben because... she found out he wrote her a poem one time. All of a sudden, the feelings she had for Bill (even having known that he hadn't written the poem) suddenly disappear, and she's suddenly completely into Ben, whom she never once saw as a romantic interest, as a kid or as an adult. At least in the book it kept her feelings towards him ambiguous, but this came almost completely out of the blue on her end.They also added a bunch of stuff, like the characters needing to find tokens, which wasn't in the book or mini-series. This addition not only went nowhere, and therefore was completely pointless, it took up so much time in a movie that was already nearly 3 hours. They also completely omitted certain character roles that could have and should have played much bigger parts. I understand that cuts were necessary since the movie was almost 3 hours, but then why add unnecessary plots elements to begin with, especially when they could have filled them in with the characters and events they cut? And then there's was the climax. While not bad, it felt rather over the top, you know, just a little too Hollywood, not quite right for this type of horror movie.I know this may sound like I'm bashing the movie, but that's not necessarily the case. It was a passable movie that I enjoyed, but I felt like it could have and should have been so much more than what they did with it.",It Chapter Two

521,verrucktcarlos,IT may need to be re edited.,7,15 September 2019,"I actually really enjoyed this film. Cinematography was great, effects were great, overall it is a really well done film. Even if you think the movie sucked I don't think you can give this a rating like ''1'' when technically it is so well made. Anyway. What I didn't like were the jumpscares, WAY TOO MANY, seriously way too many. Too many times where the music slowly builds up, then stops, complete silence and then BOOM, scary stuff with loud noise. I don't think a story like this needs these many jumpscares, I don't think it needs them at all, the premise itself is scary, it's kinda like the exorcist, 0 jumpscares in that film, and it is one of the most terrifying movies ever made, because the story is pure nightmare fuel. I think the original 1990 movie is scarier, it has a very eerie and unsettling atmosphere, unlike this one. The part with Beverly and the old woman is equally good in both movies until that huge monster shows up, with a jumpscare of course. That scene is a great example I think on why the original is scarier. Also the infamous ''Dont you want it'' scene, which I was hoping to see in the new one. That scene is extremely creepy and unsettling. Overall I think the movie is great, it could have been excellent if it was re edited, seriously get rid of the jumpscares, some of the jokes, some of the CGI and some of the same boring ''movie'' music, seriously the original one has such a disctintive soundtrack, this one is just so average.",It Chapter Two
522,tohkwongweng,Absolutely loved it!,7,7 September 2019,"As a huge Stephen King fan I have been eagerly awaiting Chapter 2 and this I'm really happy to say, it didn't disappoint. Definitely upped the scare factor and at several junctures in the movie I got goosebumps. And that's the measure of a great scary movie. How good was the Scary Grandma? What a work of genius! Possibly one of the best contemporary horror movies ever and as someone who almost exclusively watches only scary movies i've had a lot to compare against. There were some derivative scenes (think M Night Shyamalam-The Visit and John Carpenter-The Thing) but they were essential to the creepiness factor. In no way did it detract from the quality. The only reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it was a tad too long and that can be my only criticism. Put that aside and appreciate the movie.",It Chapter Two
523,WillsFilms,It: Chapter Two Floats My Boat,8,12 September 2019,"It: Chapter Two, despite not being as good as Chapter one, is an amazing conclusion to the story of It. The cast in this movie is phenomenal. Every actor gave an incredible performance as their respective loser. Bill Hader and James McAvoy stole the show in every scene they were in. The conclusions to the character arcs established in Chapter One all make perfect sense and wrap up the stories of these characters incredibly well. However, there was one character resolution that felt rushed, especially with how well it was built up in the book. Stephen King himself makes a cameo in the movie. It's a really clever scene that die hard Stephen King fans will find absolutely hilarious. Bill Skarsgard continues to shine as Pennywise The Dancing Clown. Pennywise, in this movie especially, is so despicably evil that you're really rooting for that clown to go down.If I had one problem with the movie, it's that the climax goes on forever. The final battle went on for about half an hour and, though I was still excited, it was far too long when that time could have been spent on more character centred scenes. The movie has an absurdly long runtime, which they should have used to their advantage instead of making the climax so long. The movie also has problems with its tone. After a scary scene, a character will make a joke. This is an issue as the movie often doesn't know wheather it wants to take itself seriously or not.In summary, It: Chapter Two is a great conclusion to the It duology with a final battle that goes on 15 minutes too long and some rushed scenes, but has great acting and mostly great writing, while maintaining the first movie's strong message about friendship. It's definitely the inferior of the two movies, but it's still a phenomenal watch that I highly recommend.",It Chapter Two

532,fatamorgana-40208,Another failed ending....,7,12 January 2020,"The ending to Stephen King's novel ""IT"" was awful and this movie made sure to follow the same path.
In this movie they poke fun at how bad the finale in King's novel actually was, not once but several times, in a not so subtle tongue in cheek manner, even by the King himself in a cameo role...so knowing this, the makers of this film then proceeded to make an ending that was actually worse than the novel's ending! Unbelievable!!!
The ending blatantly stole the climax to every lousy ""possession"" movie in existence..... non-believing skeptic goes their entire lives without believing in god and then in a matter of two seconds does an about face and believes in god and goodness and the evil is vanquished.
Same premise here but actually somehow worse....the whole gang is terrified of Pennywise but amazingly in a span of a few seconds their fear becomes strength and they come up with a last ditch effort to chant that he is small. He then magically shrinks down to the size of a small child and has no power left...

It was way worse.This one doesn't even start well for me. Zero suspense for Pennywise's return. No story for the adult loser club members re the realisation that IT has returned. No pace or suspense at all, this one goes at comic book pace, which is particular disengaging given that the film is an unjustifiable 3 hours long!It is literally 3 hours of OTT, CGI sequences, with wholly unscary IT ghosts and monsters, that just like the first film, stalk the loser club, and again, just like the first, Pennywise never kills them, even though he could easily.
Mr King, why is that? Why can Pennywise only kill the b characters? Why does he always wait for the loser club to find away to defeat him, when he like has million occasions to kill them?

537,zenjunkie,IT's not perfect - but IT's close!,8,21 January 2020,"Why so much dislike for this movie?
Have these people actually bothered reading the book?
Or have they just read a synopsis.
Everything of importance is there. With a little bit missed out, and a little bit added here and there. So what?
Of course the book is better.
Come on! - The book is always better!
But, as adaptations go, this movie does a good job.
So much complaint about the use of CGI. Why? For God's sake have you seen the CGI in movies recently - it's everywhere! And there's so much thats worse than this, (Marvel movies - yawn). I found it to be of high quality with just the right amount of Stephen King type surrealism in the visuals.
Don't forget that much of the horror is in the minds of the victims, using their childhood fears against them. Hence the sometimes comic visuals. Surrealism.
Conquer your fears - you conquer your IT.
Can you not get that?
Were you ever a child?
As for scares. The movie has plenty, but it seems to have become fashionable to NOT be scared these days. Its either lame bravado, or no imagination at all, or sad victims of a need for gross realism in horror movies.
And as for being too long - because so many people now have such a limited attention span, anything over 90 minutes is definitely gonna lose their interest. You sad poor people. Watch YouTube.
Or, wait for Netflix to put this film on with a speed-up option!
This movie is well told, exciting, mostly true to the book and well characterised by the actors. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. There's too many reviewers only writing for the sake of getting out a complaint these days.
And pay no attention to the 'woke' generation who think the end is lame.

538,burkholdermicah,Best Horror Movie Of The Year!,10,5 September 2019,"Andy Muschietti's 2017 film version of one half of Stephen King's sprawling 1,100-page novel It is amazing! That Movie succeeds at the most basic task of adapting a terrifying book: staging horror scenes that are genuinely creepy. Its sequel, It Chapter Two, seems as though it's taking a similar approach, opening with a sinister carnival populated by King's signature evil bullies-along, of course, with the clown that traumatized a generation, both in fiction and in real life. Then, suddenly, you're three-quarters of the way through this 170-minute film, and you realize that, although the horror imagery has only accelerated, your heartbeat has been slow and your fists unclenched for a while now. This Movie has it all and it definitely follows the second-half of the book really well; it has some funny jokes, a couple of really good performances, impressive creature and set design, and pleasing cinematography. It Chapter Two was exactly what I wanted and what I want to see in other Horror films.
The biggest question going in to Chapter Two was who would play the grown-up versions of the Losers Club, the preteen outcasts who booted Pennywise the Clown into the screaming cosmic void at the end of the first movie. Happily, this aspect of the film is excellent, with casting that's so spot on that Muschietti shows it off in a shot morphing together the faces of one young actor and his adult counterpart halfway through the film. Summoned by a phone call from Mike Hanlon, the one member of the clique who never moved away from their hometown, the adult Losers-Bill Denbrough, Beverly Marsh, Richie Tozier, Ben Hanscom, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris, each of whom has changed dramatically in some ways, and not at all in others-feel strangely compelled to return to Derry, Maine, although they can barely remember anything that happened while they lived there.Once reassembled, they slowly begin to remember the summer of 1989, and everything that they went through in the sewers underneath Derry. As Mike explains to them over a Chinese-food reunion dinner, their efforts that year weren't entirely successful, and the 27-year cycle that's seen centuries' worth of children murdered by the immortal Pennywise has started up again. Would they be willing, Mike asks them, to try to kill It again, this time for good?It Chapter Two is built around this return, in an episodic, repeating structure that splits up the Losers and sends each of them into their personal nightmares twice over-once to gather an artifact that will help them perform a Native American banishing ceremony known as the ""Ritual of Chüd,"" and once again when the ritual spins out of control. Some of these personal journeys are better developed than others; the most psychologically compelling belongs to the unsinkable Beverly Marsh. Bev's return to her childhood apartment, where she's confronted with memories of her abusive father in the guise of a demon disguised as a kindly old woman, is the most nightmarishly evocative sequence in the film, matched by an intense scene later on where Chastain tries to break out of a barricaded bathroom stall that's rapidly filling up with blood. Compared to these, most of the film's scare scenes, several of which are direct callbacks to more effective scenes in the previous It seems awesome.
But where Bev's storyline is the most compelling, Hader's performance as Richie ""Trashmouth"" Tozier-who, in a contemporary update, has grown up to become a stand-up comic rather than a radio DJ-is by far the most magnetic. Even more so than Finn Wolfhard did as a young Richie in Chapter One, Hader picks up the whole movie, puts it in his pocket, and walks away with it. Although it's not an overtly flashy performance, Hader's charisma in the role is difficult to understate, and the eye wanders naturally towards him every time he's on screen. Hader is also the only member of the cast for whom the film's quip-laden dialogue makes sense. (If you don't get the meta joke about Bill's inability to write a decent ending to one of his books the first time, the next half-dozen uses of the bit should suffice.) It's as if the script, once again from screenwriter Gary Dauberman, was given a punch-up by Trashmouth himself-which is great for Hader, but terrible for any sort of sustained suspense. The deployment of these comedic asides is often spectacularly ill-timed, particularly in a callback scene where Eddie confronts ""the leper"" that's been haunting him since childhood. The scene is grimy and unnerving-that is, until Muschietti drops in a brief blast of the cheesy AM Gold hit ""Angel Of The Morning"" right when the terror is peaking, popping the balloon of dread instantly.Speaking of, Richie also gets one of the better visions of Pennywise amongst the adult Losers, a vision of the evil clown floating down from an animated Paul Bunyan statue with a bouquet of red balloons that will be familiar to readers of King's novel. (What won't be familiar is an additional subplot that implies, without making explicit, new information about Richie's sexuality.) The film is so spread out, however, that Pennywise isn't as palpable of a presence here as in Chapter One, although Skarsgård commits just as completely to the role, his eyes wild and his chin dribbling with psychotic drool. In fact, the best Pennywise scene in It Chapter Two is one that was invented for the film, where the clown lures a lonely little girl under the bleachers at a high school football game, then chows down on her head with its layers of deep-sea creature jaws.King's novel is, admittedly, also spread out and repetitive in its structure, so in this regard It Chapter Two is technically more faithful to the original than its predecessor. But in terms of adaptation, Chapter Two cuts out much of the connecting tissue that makes King's Losers a single living, breathing organism, making them less bronchi in a lung and more isolated cells floating down the same bloodstream. To wit: Although he's been restored to his rightful place as the Losers Club's semi-official historian, Mike is nevertheless pushed to the margins of the story by the removal of a key historical interlude in King's novel. This reframing, from the intergenerational trauma of the fire at the Black Spot to Mike's personal guilt at being unable to save his drug-addicted parents, is part of a larger shift away from the theme of ancient evil shaping history and towards a theme of childhood trauma and how it carries into adulthood.
The pursuit of the Losers by their childhood bully Henry Bowers, here freshly escaped from the mental institution where he's been locked up for the past 27 years, is very well played out and the subplot that sees Beverly's abusive husband chasing her to Derry is excised completely. The result is the defanging of one of the most interesting elements of King's book: the massive, inescapable scope of Pennywise's evil, replaced by a more rote internal, individualistic struggle. Perhaps predictably, then, those hoping to see the cosmic strangeness of King's novel translated to the screen are going to be disappointed, as those elements are corralled into into a handful of truly amazing CGI sequences. And while we won't delve into the details of the ending here, suffice to say the apocalyptic scale of Derry's fate has been scaled back significantly, replaced with a sentimental farewell to the lifelong friends and their shared ordeal.This is all presented in a beautiful package: The film's color palette is rich, and Muschietti skillfully blends past and present with sweeping camera movements that take us from flashbacks and the present day without a single cut. The art direction and production design are both top notch and full of tactile detail, and the entomologically inspired creature design nods both to King's novel and such imaginative influences as Jan Svankmajer, the Brothers Quay, and Rob Bottin's special effects work on John Carpenter's The Thing.If you are looking for an amazing Horror Movie that stays true to the source material and gives something that both King Fans And Horror Fans will adore, you will not be disappointed.

I enjoyed the original from 1990 (and the cast) and I enjoyed the first chapter. Unfortunately, this movie felt like a really weird, really long dream. Casting did a great job of matching the adults to their younger selves, but a few of the actors were just not present enough for me. Jessica Chastain and the actor who played Ben to name a few. Bill Hader was actually great, but I kept thinking he looked like Dwight from the office and it was very distracting. lol Same with James McAvoy. I was a mess because I kept thinking Ewan McGregor and Jason Bateman!!! Why!!!!??? I rarely get actors confused like this. smh The actors that played the kids nailed it compared to the adult actors, but unfortunately in this installment we saw the adults more.Anyway, there were definitely some enjoyable moments from It, but it was very difficult to get the original version from 1990 and those actors out of my head. I wouldn't say that It is very scary and that was disappointing. It seemed more geared towards shock, comedy, surprise, and heart. If anything it was tense. The cameo from Stephen King was cool. What I enjoyed above all else was these amazingly solid friendships. I did enjoy the weirdness, but it was a bit too much. I enjoy a little comedy in my horror, but again it was overkill. Probably the best scene in the film was the fun house and under the bleachers. Oh yeah, where the hell was everyone at the Inn?!?! Were they too cheap to hire staff or other guests for the inn? Oh! Another weird thing! Just call me angel in the morning baby playing as poor Eddie gets severely vomited on by a rotting corpse. Seriously, what were the writers on?

A REVIEWEnsemble movies are always difficult to pull off. There are concerns with the character arcs, who gets importance and who gets not, and they get muddied by studio concerns about which actors get more screen time. An example of this would be the X-Men franchise, which, with the glorious exception of X-2 and to an extent, Days of the Future Past, never could achieve a satisfying compromise with storytelling needs and studio-mandated decisions.It: Chapter 1 was a perfect example of the heights it is possible to achieve when everything happens smoothly. Partly because they were working with a cast of teenagers who, with the exception of Finn Wolfhard, weren't global stars and partly because the script demands it, and also because the coming-of-age genre and horror genre allows for such compromises. The Chapter 2 was always going to have to underachieve, simply because of the scope of the material that was left to cover from Stephen King's mammoth book, but also because of the lofty standard set by the first movie.That being said, Chapter 2 doesn't disappoint too much. There are patented horror movie scares, although in lesser number than the first, which maybe affected the horror quality of the movie. Since It movies were designed as conventional horror movies, they needed to have more of them, unless they were leaning more into to the psychological aspects of horror, like the director Muschetti's previous work, Mama (2013), which borrowed techniques from Darren Aronofsky. The reliance of psychological and atmospheric tactics, when pulled off successfully, can bring great dividends, like Jennifer Kent's The Babadook (2014), which in my opinion is the best horror movie in the last few years. But this formula is difficult to pull off. Chapter 2 didn't pull it off, and the movie comes across as too much of a conventional horror film but without too many conventional jump scares.Bill Hader shines among the ensemble cast as the elder version of the hilarious Richie Tozier. They found the perfect casting for both young and old Richie. The cynically funny, motor mouthed kid which hints at a complex character underneath is perfectly portrayed as an adult by Bill Hader, who might have been mistaken to be born for this role. His funny bone is kept at a balance here, without going overboard like the Marvel movie-style but doing just enough to provide a slight breather while keeping the tension intact. James McAvoy, as the older Bill, does his studio-mandated leading man, which I was mildly disappointed by, since he is, and remains, an actor who still brings something different to a Hollywood blockbuster, however conventional the role might be written. Jessica Chastain conveys the emotional weight of all the abuse that Beverly Marsh suffered. Even with the limited time given to her story, the abusive relationships that she keeps continuing to live on, and the toll the Deadlights had taken on her, is given a glimpse of in the movie, and is extracted by Chastain to the optimum effect as the capable actor she is. James Ransone is yet another flawless casting, as he embodies Jack Dylan Grazer's weird tics, twitches and mannerisms so well that within a minute of his being onscreen, even before another character uses his name, I knew this was Eddie. Jay Ransom, who played the Beast in the atrocious Beauty and the Beast TV series, plays the older Ben. Now all successful and hunk-handsome, he still has the young Ben's infectious warmth and serene innocence. Mike Hanlon, the kid with the least screen time in the first movie, gets the most in the second, is portrayed by Old Spice hunk Isaiah Mustafa. He alone has stayed back in Derry among the Losers, and therefore retains all of his memories regarding the clown, and has researched all these years, never believing It to be truly gone, and ready for the moment It returns. The haunting fear and old battle scars still remain with him, and it is yet again the difficulty of the medium which doesn't allow for a more detailed examination of Mike's personality and growth, severely affected by PTSD and secrets only he will remember and keep. Bill Skarsgard does his thing with Pennywise, making me think whether he should've been cast as the DCEU Joker.Overall, the movie is well paced, and I didn't know how long the runtime was until I came out of the theatre.VERDICT: 6.5/10A one-time watch",It Chapter Two
548,vlevensonnd-87248,A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT,4,8 September 2019,"We were all geared up to see this movie, and we saw it this afternoon. We had seen the first part of the remake 2 years ago, and even though there were certain aspects that were far better than the original, the bulk of it was not as good. We still vowed that we were going to see part 2 when it came out. We both thought that the humor was way too forced, and the jokes we're really not funny. There's too much over acting with certain characters, and not enough emotion and/or fear expressed realistically with other characters. There were creatures that were added into the film was like watching a 60s or early 70s horror movie. It looks like something that Sam Raimi would do - if you see it, you'll know what I mean. The movie really dragged on a number of occasions that really didn't have much content, and that left us wondering why on Earth they were not edited or shortened, because the last thing you want to do is put your viewers to sleep. I could not believe it, but I nodded off 3 times!! In the first section of the movie the vulgarities we're so extensive and there was no point to it. It was vulgar for the sake of being vulgar. There is little innocence in these children which we both found disturbing in both part 1 and 2. I found the battle at the end to be better in this one then in the original, however, after the battle the movie dragged on again, and I was glad to get up and leave. It was a really good size audience but it was just some of the kids that laughed just a few times more than we did. Everyone was pretty silent in leaving the theater. It's such a pity when such an anticipated movie comes out and it turns out to be so disappointing. The actors were good but it was a waste of talent.",It Chapter Two

552,olovsimonsson,Too much of the wrong things...,2,6 December 2019,"What the first movie got right was a balanced focus on IT and the lives and friendship of the children in the losers club as well as their relationships to each other. No such thing exists in the second chapter. Instead it seems to think that the audience will feel for the adults just because we felt for the kids, and that we should be satisfied with the relationships we got to follow in the first movie. Such is not the case. I'm not given any reason to care about the adults, so I don't.So what's left? Chapter II starts out quite faithfully to the book, although very abbreviated, until they're all back in Derry. After that, almost nothing is left of King's book. With no relationships nurtured or rediscovered, it is just a painfully long series of jump scares and scenes that seem to compete for the title of most disturbing. However, due to bad animation and a lack of build-up, eventually the myriad of attempted scares cross the border into tedious silliness.Halfway in, I was begging for it to end, and in the end I was nearly crying because simply did not believe that it ever would...",It Chapter Two

The movies way of unfolding the story is good but takes too long to reach to the main theme. The story of this movie is short and a lot related to chapter 1 though at some points you will feel like watching a completely different movie with the same theme.

I didn't feel for any of the characters and there are so many jump scares it's just boring. The mixing with past and present is also bad, confusing and makes no sense.The acting are mixed, with James McAvoy being the worst of the bunch with terrible non-believable studer. Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan and James Ransone does solid performance (as well as ALL the child actors from the flashbacks) but this doesn't save the movie. Bill Hader is a funny guy and good actor but has no chance with the many terrible and out of place lines he's being dealt.The top side is that it's obviously high budget and well shot, but that's about it.

560,nycruise-1,A LOT of effort but the parts don't add up to a whole,5,16 April 2020,"I finally saw this movie after being sorry I missed it in the theaters last summer.Well, I have to say the wait was worth it! I only paid $5.99 to see it on Google Play rather than a full movie theater ticket of $12.00!The movie is full of special effects and gore - occasionally I got a good scare but more than anything else this film tired me out! After about an hour I was caught up more with all the composting of film, the trick shots, the editing, the set design, etc because all I could think of was ""How did they come with that idea and how many people and hours did that shot require???"" Shot after shot, sequence after sequence.The main problem - without giving anything away - is that this ""It"" alien can distort time and space by affecting people's minds. So all kinds of things happen but then - guess what - they really didn't happen. Or maybe a few really did? After awhile I just gave up and chalked it up to the alien, then ultimately just chalked it up to the director and writer.The secondary problem is that King's work usually entails personal dramas, histories and relationships between many of the characters. That may work well on the page but for a real killer-diller monster movie it just bogs everything down. In this film particularly - I guess because the producer and director wanted to be really faithful to the book - it's just one personal conflict after another. The ""It"" monster uses these personal facts to create horrors specific to the characters - but, again, in order for those moments of horror to happen, we have to sit through memories and recountings and confessions ad nauseum.Every monster movie has a final confrontation with the rampaging beast and this movie is no exception. Unfortunately, in this movie, given all I've said, it's just more of the same only on a bigger scale.",It Chapter Two

While other scenes where less faithful than the older made for TV movie, but in general this new remake is closer to the original story.As for the movie. It is decently acted and special effects are very good. The story is gripping. I only think that in some scenes (in particular the old lady scene) the movie tries to impress the viewer with special effects a little too much. Also, comparing to the first movie, and especially with the book... something seems to be missing to the characters.

573,omega_work,Inferior to first one,5,11 September 2019,"Here's the short... The film was definitely fun and entertaining. Although I didn't find it scary enough to be a horror movie nor funny enough to be a comedy, so it falls somewhere inbetween, making it a little bit of a confusing experience. But definitely fun.Where this movie shines is in the nostalgia. The first one did a great job of transporting us back to our own childhoods, and it was clear that we were seeing the world through the eyes of a child, with adults and bullies all being characatures. This one was almost a nostalgia overload as the kids came back to see their home town, yet I really liked those bits. I was a bit dissapointed that the theme of seeing the world through their eyes didn't continue, this time with kids being characatures.Perhaps my biggest problem with the film played itself out in the first couple of scenes...It opens with a gay couple who are attacked by a bunch of thugs simply for being gay... Something I would've bought maybe of we were still back in the 90's but this is taking place in present day. Not only was this a forced little piece of woke, it had absolutely no relevance to the plot, making the filmmakers look desperate to appear intersectional.The next issue was the following moments where we learn that Mike has been living above the library for years. Now in the original version this would make sense because Mike was the one obsessed with Derry, but for some reason in the first movie they made Ben the one that was into the history of the town, so they just abandoned that and instead decided to try to convince us that Ben was actually a prodigy architect, capable of building an underground structure most adults wouldn't be able to.These changes are odd because they don't lend themselves to the story in ways that could've been done otherwise.Steven king makes a cameo as a shop owner which had a lot more opportunities for jokes than they went for, which was a bit of a shame to be honest.The entire movie is sort of pointing towards the characters getting artifacts from their past to perform a ritual that is supposed to kill the monster. It kind of trudges through these sequences intercutting new scenes with the kids being terrorized by the clown. The scenes from the past are great when they shed light on their present, but boring when they try to include new suspense sequences because we already know they point to nothing.Another area that confused me was that in the first movie, the things that scared people were fake. But in this movie that seemed to change... To the extent that a zombie was chauffeuring the grown up Henry - so it makes for a confusion of the world we are in.The other thing that was somewhat frustrating was that Pennywise didn't have any clear goal. In the first one he woke from his slumber to feed on fear and kills kids along the way. Here it's like all he's doing is waiting around for the grown up version of these kids. The only other person he kills is the gay guy from the beginning a d a random kid which also seemed to be to get at Bill.It's a bit of a she because there was a lot of potential for this to be something special, but instead it took great casting and a great premise and didn't respect itself enough to give us a good ending - which is ironic seeing as one of the elements of the story is that Bill is a writer who is unable to write a good ending.Bottom line, it's fun but didn't live up to its own potential.",It Chapter Two

578,craigbenting,Definitely a Drama as Much as a Horror,8,31 October 2020,"This was a good sequel, even with all the flash backs, which gave more information on what happened in the timeframe of the first movie.If you don't have a sense of humor when watching horror movies, skip this movie (and I feel sad for you).In case you watched this movie and didn't get it for whatever reason, the end point of the movie, both movies really, is that we all have fears, often rooted in our childhood, that weaken us. ""It"" is the embodiment of those fears, and the weaker we allow them to make us, the stronger they get. This is the theme throughout both movies, which is what makes ""It"" so scary, even as adults.All we have to fear is fear itself. And, the most important thing in anyone's life if that they believe in themselves. Both sayings sound so cliched, but I guarantee you that every successful person 100% believes in those sayings. You can't be successful until you conquer your fears, and unfortunately most people never do.In real life, our fears are scarier than any horror movie. If they weren't, why would it be easier to face a horror movie than our own fears?And watch the ending. We can more easily conquer our fears while depending on our friends. The very end scene where they explained the suicide was unnecessary - he was obviously too weakened by his fears to conquer them, which everyone admitted earlier in the movie, and hence the point of the movie.It's honestly very rare to find a horror movie with such deep meaning as this, so it seems it's been very underrated. It seems a lot of people watched it just for a few shallow thrills and others who might have gotten the point of the movie were scared off by the horror.Oh well. The point wasn't the CGI, it wasn't the horror, and it wasn't the humor. Go back and watch it again if you missed the message. It really is touching if you're wise enough to see it.",It Chapter Two
579,MovieNinjaGuy,Utter nonsense,2,10 May 2021,"Started off ok but quickly loses its way once the characters are drawn back to Derry. Pennywise takes ridiculous forms to the point we see so much CGI it just becomes laughable and not scary.The characters also seem not to have learned anything from their childhood trauma and just walk into more traps and are even more stupid than their childhood versions in the first movie. Characters hear voices come from somewhere and the first thing they do is go there and fall for Pennywise's tricks. Not even an ounce of hesitation to think ""hey I've seen this trick before, I'm going to ignore it."" There is a mixture between what is happening ""now"" and more childhood trap scenes too, just to make it really, really long I guess.Adult Bev teleports around where necessary. The characters seem to be doing nothing in Derry in fact except for walking into traps. It is really dumb. No plan. Just walking around. There were actors, sets, and crew available here to probably tell an interesting story. But that is certainly not present here. The slight sprinkles of hints about Pennywise's origin are more interesting than the mayhem that is going on for most of the movie.Stephen King's cameo seems utterly pointless. A quick line addition when McAvoy leaves the shop with the bike such as ""damn writers, what are they good for anyway?!"" would have fixed that and made it fun. Then leave out the humour from all the scary bits.There is no subtlety here at all, overlong and too much for no reason. Everything is just thrown at you; humour / sadness / fear / anger all at the same time, you don't know what to think. Eventually I switched it off with about 40 mins to go probably. I had enough. Glad I didn't bother going to the cinema for this one when it was released. Utter tripe. No direction, just a bunch of scenes you'd expect in an It type horror movie with too much CGI all randomly thrown at you after each other. See the brilliant ""Us"" instead.

The long running time didn't bother me at all, and I actually think it worked better being almost three hours long. The whole movie felt more Stephen King-y to me than some of his other adaptations. From what I've read they stuck very close to his novel with this second part and I'm glad they did. If you're a fan of The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episodes, the movie kind of reminded me of that, except in a movie version with real people. Where as some people found the CGI to be cheesy and overdone at times, I felt it worked quite well and the effects were very neat and coolly put together. The adult versions of the kids are spot on and every actor is good in their role. Bill Hader is funny in it and actually so is James Ransone for that matter. There are plenty of jump scares to be had and I must say I enjoyed the second part better than the first. People will disagree with this but hey you still get a good dose of the kid actors in this one too. Also Bill Skarsgard brings back the creep factor again as Pennywise! 8.75/10",It Chapter Two
582,grantpaulsen,A Satisfying But Slightly Underwhelming Sequel,3,7 September 2019,"It Chapter Two is a satisfying but slightly underwhelming sequel. It concluded the story in a satisfying way and was faithful to the book. The performances were all fantastic across the board namely Bill Hader, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and Bill Skarsgard. Surprisingly this film was much more of a comedy than a horror film, and I loved that personally, and the humor was definitely intentional, I was not laughing at it as some have said they did. This is unironically the funniest film I've seen so far this year. The humor always worked for me and was always funny and clever. I liked the script and the writing a lot from a dialogue perspective, if not from a plotting perspective. And I did find some meaning behind this film not being scary, but at the same time that's a problem with the film. The opening scene deeply unsettled me, but I don't think the film ever got to that point again in terms of horror. Plus that scene didn't end up affecting the story at all. There's a character in this film who served no purpose and could've been cut out entirely. I realize this character was in the book but an adaptation needs to know what works for the film and what needs to be cut out, and this character definitely did because he/she didn't impact the narrative at all. There's a lot of retread and flashbacks in this film, and while some are meaningful, some are pointless. The execution of the second act was poorly written and meandering, one specific set piece in the second act could've been removed entirely, plus the narrative in the second act is a bit shallow. The scenes don't flow together very well and don't connect at all, and there could've been a better way to execute these individual set pieces. The editing, visual effects, and de-aging technology were all bad. Lastly, the film's length, it did not need to be 2 hours and 49 minutes long, they could've easily shaved off 20 - 30 minutes and the film would've been better.

But Bill Skasgard is the true star and does not disappoint one bit. Though he is not creepy, he is a fullblown murderous entity out to eat kids. There are many jump scares, and the loud sounds make the movie particularly jarring; making the horror more enjoyable. It has less character exploration than the first one, and less creepy, but it is an all out monster fest in the end. The movie seems to drag, and could have been a standalone movie without having to feature the previous casts. Though the decision to do so was to connect the story with the furst instalment. But it dragged the story and felt repetitive. The only backstory that was effective was James McAvoy's character, provided good character motivation.

The only genuinely creepy bit was when the distorted old lady first started running after Bev, but the second she stepped into the light I found myself laughing at the horrendous cgi, reminiscent of some of the aliens from the original Men In Black.And what was that ending all about?

There is a lot of hype for this movie and the trailers and everything made it seem such as the movie would be a lot better than it actually was, I assume that's the whole point of promotion, but considering that the first movie fully met my expectations I would have expected something a little better (I'll explain).
Pros
The acting is great and the casting is flawless. All the actors are a perfect match to their children predecessors and they approach their parts with respect towards the characters we all met and loved as kids. It has some very good moments with creepy jumpscares and wacky characters and achieves to balance between comedy and horror. As an ending to the whole it 'franchise' it's what you would expect without any unpleasant surprises and it's going to leave you satisfied and kind of nostalgic.
Cons
I personally didn't like the backstory that wad given to 'It' and they way they suggested would be right to defeat it, although I haven't read the book and I don't know if that kind of material was included in the original story. 3 hours was too long for this movie and it made me a little tired towards the end. I also didn't love the cgi, I have the feeling the the previous movie had used better effects.
Conclusion
'It Chapter Two' is a solid conlclusion to the story and it has the thrills to excite horror movie enthusiasts. The cast has chemistry which makes the movie even better and if you loved the first movie then it's worth your time but don't expect to get the same feeling with the original.

593,SGuiliano1064972,Don't let the Movie Critics prevent you from seeing this. A very frightening conclusion to the Stephen King Macabre Tale.,8,14 September 2019,"All that I can say is, judge the Film for yourself.
It seems that when people went to see this film so far They negatively bash it. But you must forget IT CHAPTER TWO is the continuing story of The Losers Club returning to Derry, Maine and they reunite and their purpose is to destroy IT ""Pennywise The Clown"" once and for all.
Also, I must remind you that this is a horror Film and it's loaded with scares and lots of Blood. To me, I don't mind the CGI in it but it's better than the 1990 miniseries. Director Andy Muschietti has delivered a horror Film that can affect you in one way or another. Yes, there are Flashbacks but it's essential to the Story of the Losers Club when they are mature adults.
Another reminder, This film takes place in 2016. A more Hip version. But as I was watching this movie, I must say I was really into it.
The casting was great. James Mc Avoy is always good in everything he does. Jessica Chastain does a good job as the adult Beverly. Regardless if Amy Adams didn't portrayed her it didn't matter to me. They're both great actresses. Bill Hader and James Ransone work very well together and you can see the chemistry between the two when you look at them as Richie and Eddie as adults well. You can see they had to study the actors humor and how they mingle together as kids. Isaiah Mustafa knocks it out of the park as Mike who stayed in Derry and waited for 27 years until Pennywise returned. Jay Ryan and Andy Bean were good also as Ben and Stan. And finally, Bill Skarsgard is more evil and vengeful as Pennywise.
Most people don't realize is that the Losers had to confront their fears returning to Derry, Maine because they can't let Pennywise to continue murdering innocent children. So they plan and sacrifice so that IT will never return.
From my point of view, The Losers were still Kids again, though they were adults but as each member help each other they overcome their fears.
My own moral is this. We were all Kids and we all have childhood fears and at some point in your life you have to confront them. I can say that as well because I was a child with fears. And I think that's the point of this second chapter to Stephen King's classic novel. So, I really enjoyed it and it lived up to it's hype. The CGI, again, didn't matter to me. To conclude this, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But I can't wait until it's released on Blu-Ray.

The movie is unnecessarily long. The acting is good. The main 6 leads played their part well, their behavior resembled their younger counterparts. The CGI is good but overused.

IT Chapter Two ticks all the boxes. Hats off, in particular, to James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, and of course Bill Skarsgard.
Much respect also to Benjamin Wallfisch, the composer of the orchestral score.

I found myself in the end questioning if the film series was created about a killer clown that haunts kids, or a group of friends who love each other. Don't get me wrong the unity of the group was important in the original film, but they seem to go over board with this part of the theme, especially when the group of adults finds themselves hugging each other in the water while crying together in the end.

600,rexmagicman,"Beautifully produced horror film.....creepy, not scary",9,9 August 2021,"So, I'm going to start off with the fact that I read the book ions ago when it was first published, and it scared me beyond belief. Then, the miniseries came out with Tim Curry (who can do no wrong), and I was an instant fan. Then, I saw these versions in the theatre, each on opening weekend --- and, thought ""meh, they're okay, still not like the miniseries"". Not sure why that was, as you can tell that they spent a lot of money, they look great......but something felt like it was missing to me (and my friends thought the same thing as well -- we're all in our late 50s).So, in the last 4 months, I've figured it out, as I purchased both the Blu-rays, and for the first viewing, watched them back-to-back, and Eureka!! They are meant to be watched together, as ""one"", in one sitting --- not two separate movies, years apart (or even days, weeks or months apart). Watching them back-to-back, the story flows so much better, the tension and creep factor is far higher, and it's truly an enjoyable and memorable experience. It's a five-hour excursion, but is well worth it, if you can do it......the time actually goes by quicker in my mind doing it this way......did it for a second time already, this weekend, and am so impressed. The entire cast is incredible, both the young and the older actors (they did such a great job of selecting the adults who would portray the younger kids, truly believable in every way), and Bill Skarsgard is beyond frightening as ""It"". The ending has a much stronger impact......I've shed tears both times now that I've watched them as one continuous film when the end approaches......so emotional. Everything about this works, it's very well filmed, again the acting is top-notch by all, the effects for the most part incredible, and the score beautiful/haunting. A sumptuous, wonderful epic ""horror experience"".......not scary, but definitely creepy......super-creepy, and ultra-creepy in parts. Watching them together brings the same amazing ""epic"" feel reading the book gave you -- watching them separately doesn't provide that same experience at all.I'll be giving the same review on Part 1 --- the only reason I'm giving each a 9 1/2 instead of a 10, is that some of the effects just don't work for me, mainly the dinner scene at the Chinese restaurant. Originally, separately I would have given the 1st part a 7, and the 2nd part a 6 1/2, but watching them together, as one film without a break --- I give them both a 9 1/2.

And of course there is always the problem of converting a (long) book into a movie; but this is a movie, and one is not required to read the book prior to seeing the movie. I just got lost in this movie. There were lots of roaming plots that did not seem to go anywhere and did not seem to tie together. The acting and casting was good. The humor was OK; perhaps a bit over-done for a horror movie, but OK. It is loaded with jump-scares and just things designed to look creepy or gross. The protagonists often engage with some creepy monster as if they are in a life-threatening situation, and then they just miraculously leave and everything is OK. E.g. when the female character (Beverly) encounters that old lady in her dad's apartment; the creature chases her around and then at the end Beverly just leaves the front door. So was this creature actually trying to hurt Beverly, or was this just some mind-game with no real threat to her? (And neither answer is satisfying.) And somewhat similarly toward the end a creepy old woman (perhaps the same woman?) comes up out of the water and attacks Beverly, but this creature is easily defeated; what's the point? Was this just a weak monster, or was this just a scare-tactic? The whole plot with Mike tricking them with that old indian thing was weird; did he think that would work, just because it would give them confidence? (Apparently so. And note that in order to do all of this he also drugged his friend with that root that caused hallucinations.) (And so all of this stuff about getting an old item to sacrifice was crap; e.g. the inhaler, shower cap. Wasn't this the sole reason the went to that old (dangerous) underground fort?) And then in the end, once that placebo-plan failed, they had no plan, until they decided to have Pennywise chase them into a small space to make him smaller to kill him. Then suddenly this plan morphed into sort of insulting the clown which made him smaller, and then they just ripped out his heart and mashed it up. So that's all it took to defeat him? And they come up with that plan in the caverns in 10 seconds and yet they could not think of that in the preceding days (weeks, years)?

Maybe I'm just desensitised from many standard Hollywood horror movies that I've watched, but even the jump-scares were predictable and I did not even bath an eye.

The filmmakers of It: Chapter Two use this to create a very moving story of friendship and the bonds we make as children. Unfortunately, in between scenes of genuine emotion and character interaction, there are horrible instances of CGI horror that inspire more laughs than screams. Decapitated heads turn into spiders (a la The Thing, but more laughable) and old women turn into giant Looney Toon characters with pendulous drooping breasts while we're supposed to pretend this is in any way frightening when, more often than not, it looks like something out of a lousy 90's computer game.Thankfully, It: Chapter Two is loaded with strong performances from an excellent cast who are given the nearly impossible task of selling a lot of the cheesy effects from their reactions alone. In that sense, the film is a rousing success as the actors manage to ground the insanity around them into something tangible and real. It's to their credit that the film wrings any iota of emotion out of the story. SNL's Bill Hader might be the MVP here as the wise-cracking Ritchie who's holding onto a big secret. He's appropriately amusing when needed and heartbreaking when you least expect it. Also excellent is James Ransone as the grown up Eddie who captures some of the nervous and manic qualities of his younger counterpart to an uncanny level.It: Chapter Two won't be the scariest film you've ever seen (or even the scariest film of the year for that matter), but the strong performances and solid emotional core will tug at your heartstrings a little more than you might initially expect.",It Chapter Two

623,drawnsupreme,IT was alright and worth a watch,7,7 September 2019,"The first film felt so new, fresh and original. Horror movies nowadays lack originality but IT: Chapter One was like a breath of fresh air for the genre back in 2017. After seeing IT: Chapter Two, I can say I enjoyed the sequel but there were a few little things that took away from it being on par, or better, than the first.First off, I thought the originality, the creepiness, and the suspense from the first movie are almost gone in this sequel - it recycles a lot of the same horror concepts of the first one, making the movie a lot less creepy and much more predictable. You'll see just about every jump scare coming from a mile away, and you'll most likely to predict how those scenes turn out.This movie also had a lot more comedy than I thought it would. Most of the time, the crowd at my theater were either laughing, giggling or yawning. The comedy worked very well in the first film because the kids were just being kids - silly, witty, but entertaining to watch, but as adults, the goofiness felt a bit excessive.Don't let that sway you away from seeing the movie though.IT: Chapter Two is still a good little movie that focuses more on closing out each character's story arc. Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise is still an excellent character whose presence and performance made me want to see more of. He probably could have used more screen time, come to think of it. The entire cast did a great job with what the script they were given - but there's no doubt that the script had room for a few tweaks here and there - along with plenty of room for improvements on the horror and suspense elements, especially considering that the movie had no problem pushing over two hours in length.IT's worth a watch, at least once.",It Chapter Two
624,Paradroid78,"Not scary, but overlong and overly reliant on CGI.",5,13 September 2019,"The movie starts out well, but quickly bogs down in disjointed scenes following the individual characters having an encounter with the monster and getting scared, in between unnecessary flashbacks to them getting scared by the monster in their childhoods.After around two hours of this, where you're left pondering the meaning of life and wondering if the plot will ever go anywhere, the story finally picks up for the CGI heavy third act monster hunt, that really wouldn't feel out of place in an episode of Doctor Who.If this movie were actually scary or unpredictable it would be one thing, but the plot beats are hugely predictable and because of the overuse of CGI nothing fells particularly scary. The film has a lot on jump scares, but they're telegraphed a mile away and you can literally count the seconds on your fingers when things go quiet before something scary happens. To compensate for the lack of real psychological horror, the film instead goes for shock value by amping up the gore.On the plus side, the actors do well with what they're given, you do invest in the characters, and the movie is technically well made. But at nearly 3 hours it's just too long, and a lot of unnecessary scenes could have been cut without detriment. If an hour were trimmed, nothing would have been lost and it would immediately be transformed into a tighter, better movie.At the end of the movie we're shown a street with a cinema advertising Nightmare on Elm Street 5, which shows that someone making this had a sense of humour because, while admittedly never as bad as the worst, this movie feels a lot like a modern incarnation of a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel.",It Chapter Two

The whole point of pennywise is he thrives on fear but we seen a couple of deaths were there is no fear there's no build up it's just straight kill? If that is the case why is he pandering on and on with the losers club? The biggest problem I had with it was the CGI it's everywhere, whatever happened to some make up or prosthetics I just find it so lazy in hollywood these days. It's not a bad film nor is it great it's a good sequel very rarely you find a sequel better than the first and I'm afraid this is another to add to the first of films that aren't as great as the first. I feel like Pennywise wasn't in IT a great deal his character is so iconic I feel he should've got more screen time as Bill Skarsgard done a cracking job of the character.",It Chapter Two
627,pitabox987,"I was hoping for an improvement after Part 1, I didn't get it...",1,30 December 2019,"The title of this review says enough.Part 2 was pretty hopeless as a continuation of the story from Part 1; the first part was marginally better than this one.A set of movies that rely almost entirely on jump scares and the worst story I've seen in a long time. - The book was enjoyable, but this is a disgrace to both the book and Stephen King himself, that he was involved in it's production doesn't say much either.As many reviews say, the film relies too heavily on CGI, particularly the zombies during the film, and the 'Pennywise spider' bit toward the end, that wasn't even scary at all; it got overly repetitive, I almost felt like turning the film off...I rated Part 1 two stars, but this film barely even deserves one star! (If if I could rate it a zero, I would, and it's been a while since I've seen a film worthy of that!)Watch if you must, but honestly it's a waste of time, not even a good Halloween style movie.",It Chapter Two
628,taranpannu01,IT: Chapter Two (2019),6,15 September 2019,"I've been deciding whether the film was a 7 or a 6 and for now it's a 6. The positives outweigh the negatives, the sort of criticism that came from when the film was first released perhaps has influenced my judgement when I saw the film and I agree with a lot of the points.IT Chapter 2 is decent, it's funny, it attempts to have heart (which for some reason I just don't feel like it delivered on and it came across quite cheesy).Andy Muschietti clearly has a love for the source material and creates a sequel that benefits solely from it's strong cast. Some scenes seem overly directed and crammed with stylistic decisions that don't further narrative.The script seems a little muddled, there are some utterly brutal sequences, some incredibly funny sequences and some cheesy moments. It's sort of all over the place, whereas the first film had a strong foundation of a coming of age horror film.The cast as I said is incredibly strong, Chastain,McAvoy, Mustafa, Ryan and Ransone are all great with of course the stand out being Hader, although personally I believe the child actors Martell, Oleff, Wolfhard, Lillis, Jacobs and Taylor were somewhat better with my favourite being Jack Dylan Grazer.Bill Skarsgard is great when he's not being screwed with special effects. Should've left him alone and let him perform without any unnecessary CGI.The special effects were a little iffy, I think the deaging (and refatting of Ray Taylor) were jarring whilst other visual effects were just silly and didn't have the effect I believe they intended. Looking at you severed Stanley head.The cinematography was decent whilst there were some odd editing cuts with some reaction shots but this was forgivable.The score should be commended. King's cameo was a bit cringey which I think can be said with the ending, it all feels a little bit wet and cringey.The runtime didn't feel as long as I thought it was although the ending dragged on. The scares were few, this is down to the silly effects and the reliance on CGI.Overall this is a decent perhaps forgettable sequel that I think suffers from the glory of it's predecessor, Muschietti, his crew and cast should be applauded for their commitment in telling this story which I believe does the novel justice if not losing some cinematic flair in the process.",It Chapter Two
629,CriticalRaccoon,"A good film, though it's inferior to Chapter 1",7,28 November 2019,"It's rare that a sequel almost completely abandons the tone of a blockbuster success, but It: Chapter 2 does so to varying degrees.To be fair, the ""part 2"" of It was always going to be less scary, but It: Chapter 2 went in so many different directions it's almost unrecognizable at times that this was by the same director. It: Chapter 2 is clearly a product of Andy Muschietti, but it's almost like he directed it to be as different as he could.Blending elements of horror, action, fantasy and comedy, It: Chapter 2 concludes the story of the Losers Club and Pennywise in a way that fans of the book can probably be happy with, but I think the general public will be in for a letdown.Picking up 27 years after It was temporarily defeated by the Losers Club, It is back to feast on the town of Derry. The one remaining Loser in Derry, Mike Hanlon, calls out to his fellow Losers to fulfill the oath they took all those years ago: if It came back, they'd finish the job. So our band of merry folk return, only to realize that since they left Derry all those years ago that they have lost all memory of It, but they slowly come back once together again. In his obsessive years of research Mike has learned of a Native American ritual that can force It to reveal its true form and thus defeat it once and for all. Will the Losers finish this clown for good? Will it turn out to be a giant spider? Will fortune cookies end up killing them all?!So first off It: Chapter 2 is barely a horror movie. There is no sense that the town itself is hostile anymore. The Losers are now adults so they aren't really the target of It, though It does like to taunt them. There are a couple of scenes where It picks off random people but there's no reason to care about the victim's safety. There is really only one segment of It: Chapter 2 that attempts to be a horror movie - about 45 minutes of flashbacks to It terrorizing the young Losers during that time between them breaking up and when Beverly is kidnapped (although honestly the creepy CGI de-aging was more terrifying). Oh, and the fun-house scene that was in all the trailers where Bill attempts to save a kid from It; I liked that one a lot.It: Chapter 2 might not be scary, but it at least has some decent laughs and action. Bill Hader as the grown up Richie really does nail all the comedy bits as he's thankfully grown out of all the sex jokes. In fact some of the ""scary"" scenes elicit more laughs than screams which had to be intentional (giant lumberjack statues are not scary!). It: Chapter 2 is oddly fun when it chooses to be.Even though the film constantly jokes about weak endings (remember, Stephen King is notoriously bad at them), I can say that the ending of It: Chapter 2 wasn't that weak. As a lot of people know the ending of the original It is, well, not good. It: Chapter 2's ending is far more action-orientated, blends in elements of It's reality-warping powers, and really emphasizes that the Losers' own bonds were what saved them all along. Also, It doesn't just transform into a giant spider animatronic ... thank god.The most common criticism of It: Chapter 2 is that it is almost 3-hours long; that length for a ""horror"" film is almost unheard of. There's a rumored 4-hour long cut of the film too! It seems like the main reason for this extended length are the scenes of the younger Losers which honestly feels out of place. I'm sure the studio wanted the kids to come back in a meaningful way, but man does it feel unnecessary. The film really should have been at most the same length as the original, though I admit I'm interested in seeing the 4-hour cut to see exactly what the hell they they filmed but didn't include from Stephen King's notoriously long novel.In a way It: Chapter 2 is oddly streamlined despite the length. It all but eliminates the subplots that took up a lot of It, as well as the ones that could have been in Chapter 2 regarding the new spouses of the Losers. Maybe the extended cut has more of Bill's wife being kidnapped by Beverly's abusive husband, but I'm glad they cut it here.Even if you can criticize a lot about It: Chapter 2, its cast isn't one of them. Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise, and he yet again delivers a masterful performance as the nigh-omnipotent menace. The young cast from the first It is back (sometimes creepily CGI'd to death), as well as some great casting choices for Chapter 2 with James McAvoy as Bill and Jessica Chastain as Beverly (didn't they just try to kill each other in Dark Phoenix?!). These two get the most screen time due to their A-list pedigree, but the rest of the cast match up with their younger parts well. The obvious standout is Bill Hader as Richie who steals every scene he's in; there is no one else who could have played this part as well.It: Chapter 2 is flawed, but I still enjoyed it. I wasn't going into the film expecting a horror movie as I was somewhat familiar with the source material, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well Muschietti executed a difficult adaptation. While it was way too long, It: Chapter 2 moved fast enough that I didn't find myself glancing at my watch. I am a gigantic fan of horror films but rarely if ever get scared by them, so the lack of scares wasn't a detractor for me. For those that wanted a copy of the first film, It: Chapter 2 may disappoint.No one will ever say It: Chapter 2 is a better film than It, but that's not to say it's a bad movie. It: Chapter 2 is the slightly inferior little brother to a surprise hit that no one expected to be as good as it was. It: Chapter 2 is well made, has loads of laughs, great performances, an ending that doesn't suck, but just doesn't have It's magic. If you enjoyed It then Chapter 2 is a no-brainer, but for those on the fence I'd say just float on. (I apologize for that joke immediately)",It Chapter Two

Seriously though, Bill Hader was great. And besides all that , this movie could have ended 45 minutes earlier. A lot filler and repetition in the end.

632,mtrburrows,A flip on everything that made Chapter 1 so entertaining...,3,11 September 2019,"It Chapter 2 is one of the most disappointing films of the year - a confused, amateur, meandering mess that drags it's thin plot out for an unnecessary 2 hours and 50 minutes, with pointless characters, beyond predictable twists, and not to mention, the most cliché, uninspired, and ineffective scares I've seen in a while. FYI, loud music, booming sound effects, and an over abundance of CGI aren't chilling, just loud and predictable.Not one element of this film holds up to the original, with only 3 Pennywise moments standing out as entertaining parts of the movie, and Bill Hader doing a good job as an older version of Richie, even if his younger counterpart is still the funnier of the 2.Speaking of the characters, their older counterparts are incredibly one note and shells of their original selves - Bill is the guilty hero, Mike is the one with the information, Eddie is the worrier, Richie is the comedian, and as for Ben and Beverly....they weren't given a shred of depth besides ""in a love triangle with Bill, who would be cheating on his wife if he were to show any interest in this rushed and bland side plot."" It appears the screenwriter has lost his flow with this instalment as even scenes with the younger Losers Club are no where near as charming of hilarious as they were last time, only acting as exposition in repetitive transition moments which are supposed to provide character moments, but instead do nothing but drag out this thin ""find your artefact"" plot with its tired technique.The main issue however is just that the movie feels confused - what little horror is actually in this movie is severely overshadowed by forced comedic moments (even within these sequences themselves, seriously, when the Deadpool song began playing in what was meant to be a disturbing moment, it felt completely out of place) and fantasy elements, with an unbearable score that reeked or cliché adventure movie.In conclusion, It chapter 2 is an uninspired and uninteresting follow up to one of the greatest horror films of the decade with only a few memorable scenes to offer to the story.",It Chapter Two

Hellraiser scared me so badly, I couldn't sleep for weeks. But nowadays... (sighs) Horror movies are not as good as they used to be. Or maybe it's me. Maybe I'm not emotional enough anymore.IT. IT has an enormous issue no adaption can solve. It's based on a book. A book by Stephen King. A book so many people have read already that the expectations for its remake were pretty high. I've watched IT with friends. They kept saying, that the 80s version of the movie was far from perfect thanks to its cringe-worthy special effects, but they would always prefer the classic adaption over this one, as it remained close to the book. Whereas I thought the new adaption was amazing. Great set, amazing cast. I loved the details, Bill nailed it as Pennywise.The movie wasn't eye-popping though, but acceptable. What I didn't like - because I was unaware of it as I never made it through the book - was the fact, that the first movie didn't tell the whole story. Fortunately, I have to say now.IT2.

I assume there was a lot of discussion and or arguments between the studio and the people behind this project over the length of the movie.

637,thesandfly77,IT Evolution,8,8 September 2019,"33 years I've waited.....Since reading the book in 1986, then again twice over the decades.The 1990 miniseries was kitschy treat, making an icon of Tim Curry's Pennywise and introducing stubborn non-reading retards to a slice of the wondrous freaked-out cosmic horror hidden within the novel's 1100 pages; at school I was failed in a term exam for an essay on IT by a teacher who labelled it 'Satanic drivel', yet professed to never having read it :)) Yes, the world's full of them...2017 IT was a surprise - a realy great surprise as it delivered sometihng akin but deliciously different to the original adaption. Trouble was...They created a monster all over again. In this age of connectivity, IT - Pennywise - became a juggernaut of cultural reference, almost ubiquitous in everyday lives, instantly recognisable to multi-millions of consumers however invested in the actual story they were. He was the original killer clown and he had returned to take over the world.So how the hell do you conjour a second part to the tale, remaining faithful to the source material and somehow incorporate this all-pervading pop-culture icon without it becoming a blandishment of clown-memes?Well, they certainly went for an angle, and I commend the reach - further than I thought they would go but not as far as I would have liked.Pennywise was never going to have the same chiller-killer impact of 2017 so the move towards lashings of dark humour infused with the shlock-horror was a brave one and very meta - recognising the part that clown has come to play in the consumer psyche.So we get something that echoes the original Evil Dead series for sardonic black comedy and still manages to hold together the book's struggle of mere humans battling cosmic evil.Most admirably, they managed to make it entertaining over the 3-hour run-time.
Pennywise gets a slew of great moments and each adult actor is given the chance to inhabit the grown-up Loser to the best of their abilities; and note that they all do a splendid job.The effects are absolutely fine - lol at the facebook-smart intellectuals who parrot the 'poor CGI' line; you gotta ask why none of those creative geniuses didn't step in and offer their services to save the day. They'll be sat on the couch with the 'look at me, I'm not scared' crew when the DVD comes out.Some people just don't get it, or IT...The dread of IT was always beyond impactful first-level boogeyman frights - as soon as the book opened up the exposition into realms of ancient inter-dimensional cosmic horror I was blown away. Stephen King, brilliantly drug-addled, took us on a trip into primeval darkness, from the unsettling events in a small American town to the abyssal terrors of the universe itself. The reach was epic and they made a grab for that here too, almost fulfilling the wishes of many who wanted the deep lore, the trippy light-fantastic backstory revelations of the novel.So very nearly, but this cultural monster had to deliver at the box-office, had to sate the demands of the casual jump-scare popcorn junkie and so the compromise was reached; entertaining, chilling, sentimental and twisted, comedic and vicious, with a shot of lore to add some depth.They managed to keep a lot of the plates spinning and deserve praise for never allowing the span of the film to lapse into dreary segments of character development or predictability - there's always something round the corner, even if you're expecting it, you're still guessing it. I though the pacing was excellent for the most part.Ultimately, you can criticise IT chapter 2 for its level of personal-expectation fulfillment - e.g was the end true-form reveal a cop-out, a compromise or a clever concept? - but you can't criticise the crew's commitment to doing a classic book and cultural phenomenon justice over what is a sprawling but consistent and worthwhile epic movie.Thank you, Andy et al, I very much enjoyed your celluloid realisation of decades of wonder.",It Chapter Two
638,Krush_Burner,It Ends Where It All Started - Tonight,8,5 September 2019,"This is definitely one of the best Stephen King's adaptations ever, in terms both of style and faithfulness to the original source. Andy Muschietti did great work as a director, creating this long (probably longest horror film ever made), grim, intense and imaginative horror masterpiece.
The basic point is that second film is much complex and multi-layered than the first one, dealing with different albeit interconnected themes. On the outside this is a horror story about how adult members of the Losers Club join together once more to kill nameless monster they've encountered 27 years ago. This story has many spectacular merits on its own right: the images of It are very different, artful and scary. There's a lot of atmospheric moments, action sequences and monsters to remember. On the inside it's a story about anxiety and pain of letting the past go, which are inescapable parts of any adulthood as a process. But there's a bit of dialectic here, since the characters, intending to beat Pennywise, must keep their inner child to some degree, but within the framework of a grown-up experience. So, on the third level this is a story about the power of imagination, which can save human from evil, but in order to do so it has to be used with good hands and clear mind.
There's a slight amount of problems with this adaptation, however. Unlike the first film, the script (written exclusively by Gary Dauberman now) contains several plot lines which are unnecessary in the way they're introduced in the film; for instance, Henry Bowers' actions now add literally nothing to the main storyline. There's also a bit of jokes and one-liners overdose, which blurs creepy scenes sometimes.
But, luckily, that minor problems cannot overshadow the whole picture, which is still very enjoyable. Visit Derry, it's a great New England town. But beware of the red balloons. They're float.",It Chapter Two

647,yogsottoth,So mediocre,6,24 September 2019,"I had my hopes high for this one. The teaser with the old lady creeped the bejesus out of me and I thought it couldn't go wrong. Well it did.First of all, the fact that they couldn't remember anything about what happened and blamed Mike for tricking them was annoying. Why did you all drop everything and ran to Derry after Mike's call if you don't remember your oath or what's at stake? Why could Stan remember everything enough to off himself? Should have kept it like the book and have them meet up for Stan's funeral who never left Derry. The dinner scene was too long, trying way too hard to be funny (something that'll happen throughout the movie) and too early for a public, shared hallucination. Didn't like the beginning at all.Splitting the group up to find their horcruxes was an all right idea but there were no rules, no structure, no instructions and half the time I couldn't even tell if they indeed found the artifact. They went for jumpscares rather than creepiness, except the old lady. Now for the hallucinations, I have nothing against CGI, I love it, yet here I felt like those incredibly scary body proportions of the monsters were ruined by those bright CGI eyes. It made them look cute in the face. I was so ready to scream at the theatre but once I saw the faces it fell short. I really longed for good makeup and fangs. The artifact search ended up taking a whole lot of time therefore most of the movie felt like one episode after another, and no engaging pace, no team work, no adventures.The origin story was completely butchered by showing a 30 second blurry animation that didn't look like anything. And if you're not going to explain who the circus guy was and how the actual IT took his identity, just don't bring him into the picture. One photo? Really? Spent wayyyy too much time on the item search IMHO, should have focused on the origin story more.The bully was not used efficiently at all. Felt super forced and I still don't get how he survived a stab wound to the chest. Another character with forced screen time was the neighborhood kid. They literally put him in the movie for the sole purpose of getting Bill angry enough to attack IT alone. Just lame... Didn't feel anything for the kid tbh.The ending was horrible. I would still like the movie if it weren't for the ending. The person who came up with this idea should never ever come up with another idea again. Bullying IT to death?? Really? So anticlimactic, so boring, so stupid, so lame... Destroyed It's scariness and power for me. And they even had the perfect idea right there! The characters literally mention it! You are as strong as the shape you choose. So they were going to trick him into the tunnel, and attack him while he was small. That was perfect! Why not use that?!And why was IT soo incapable? Barely managed to kill one. I mean if you're gonna kill off only one character then don't kill anyone ok? It's weird.The opening scene was AMAZING as usual. That was story telling and scaring the audience at the same time. That animalistic bite and swallow of the flesh was soo cool to watch. And like I said three times, the old lady was creeuuuhhhhpppy! Loved it.That's about it. Could have been great.",It Chapter Two

Went out on a whim and bought it tonight. Figured I'd like regardless. Man! What a movie. Great acting. Great casting (the adults really look just like the kids). Lots of scares. Some humor. Some drama. It has everything. I was worried that the nearly 3 hour runtime was going to make it feel like a drag, but nope! I'd go as far as to say that this is even better than the last film.

The first time I saw this film I was a bit disappointed, not living up to the highs of the first one, but after a second viewing I enjoyed it far more.Just like the first film casting here is impeccable, every actor portrayed their teenage counterparts so well. Cinematography, score, acting, cgi everything in this film is well done.What drags it down for me is the pacing, and runtime. At 2 hours and 49 minutes you'd think more would happen. It's slow what makes that runtime feel even longer. It's why when thinking about revisiting ""It: Chapter Two"" I always second guess myself because of how slow and time consuming it feels.Nonetheless this is a solid sequel with more disturbing imagery, gore, and scares but for me the first is the better of the two.7/10.",It Chapter Two

This means bad CGI and many holes in the story that most 12ies will justify with crap that they make up in their 12 year old head.The movie could have been an hour shorter and dragged on with dribble.Give this one a miss until it comes out on DVD, or some streaming service where you don't have to pay for it.

The first scene seemed completely unnecessary and unsatisfying and way worse then anything Joker had to offer in terms of being disturbing The Zombie driver thing was just silly. And it just wasn't quite as scary. They being said the acting is again all top notch Hader and Skarsgard in particular shine. I'm reviewing as someone who has only watched the movies not the read the books so I'm sure people might be thinking but the things you were complaining about were in the books and that might be but I'm looking at purely the movie and to me the things above didn't fit.,It Chapter Two

657,cjamesdueck,Complete Failure,1,18 November 2019,"First of all, I've read the novel and liked it a lot- not one of my favorites (not even my favorite King novel) but I really enjoyed it. So when the first It (chapter 1, i guess) came out I was fairly pleased at how it was structured and executed. While I thought it could have been much better, and it relied a little heavily on the jump scares and had some cheesy effects, I liked this version of Pennywise and felt that, above all, the TONE was right. Well after seeing part 2 my low expectations have been confirmed and surpassed.My guess is that Cary Joji Fukanaga's involvement was crucial to the success of the first film. Much like with True Detective's decline between seasons 1+2, Fukanaga proved to be the one who really gave the show it's brilliance. Here, with It Chapter 2, Fukanaga is gone and this loser Gary Dauberman (eye roll) has taken on the writing duties alone- as in no supervision! He sucks, just look at his credits. Muchietti is terrible too obviously, because how could he misfire this bad with such a big project! All he had to do was stick to the blueprint laid out by the first film. Instead, Dauberman and Muchietti make this a bad comedy based on some idiot adults we don't know or care about. Nothing against Hader and Ransome, but they were used horribly in this. There are so many failed attempts at humor, the pacing is ALL WRONG.",It Chapter Two

661,MarkoutTV,Fortune Cookies Aren't Scary,5,8 September 2019,"The first It wasn't scary, but it was fun watching the kids interact with each other and having their friendship grow. Like the Goonies but with a killer clown.The reason it wasn't scary however is that it relied too much on predictable jump scares and not enough on taking its time and genuinely creeping the audience out. 99% of horror elements consisted of look at something - dramatic pause - jump scare and loud noises. Rinse and repeat. A jump scare isn't something that genuinely scares someone, it's just a reflex. To really scare someone you genuinely have to creep them out and there were moments like that: the Georgie scene in the beginning, Bev's abusive father, etc. But they were few and far between.This chapter doubles down on these weak elements of the first It movie, mixes in a gratuitous amount of CGI, and loses a lot of the charm of the Goonies since they're adults now. Although completely capably acted by all the adults and their chemistry still works well, it's not as endearing the second time around, with grown ups. To boot the best thing about the Loser Squad is always their interactions with each other but instead a large portion of the middle of the film is them all on their own for individual rinse and repeat jumpscare scenes. An entire block of scenes that to me, in a three hour film, should have been cut.So with It Chapter Two you have a movie that still isn't particularly terrifying, and when compared to the first one, it's bad elements are even more plentiful, and it's good elements aren't as good. A proper formula for a dissapointing sequel.",It Chapter Two

The looser's club returns 27 years later to defeat Pennywise the Dancing Clown.This was one of the most anticipated movies of this year and it really disappointed in almost every aspect. The plot arc of this movie is just dumb it could have been written and handled much better. The screenplay is clicheic, predictable and uninteresting. The acting is average but with a screenplay like that it can't be any better. The scariness and mystic of the first movie is gone, except for a few good jump scares and creepy moments. The only few positives about the movie was Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise performance which was as excellent as it was in the first movie and the adult casting of the looser's club in regards to similarity in their looks with their younger counterparts. Of course the CGI was very good but today what big movie doesen't get that right. All in all, a disappointing ending to a great first chapter.",It Chapter Two
667,fromTull,3 hours?! Daddy no! Bevvie will be good!,5,31 January 2020,"This was shocking. ""It: Part 1"" was the pinnacle of recent horror. ""Part 2""? A devastating fall from grace. It started with the best scene from the novel, done well! Every scene past that broke my heart. ""PART 2"" was bloated and couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or horror film. It bore no resemblance to the book. Chastain was phoning it in, Bill Hader & the actor playing Eddie were just loud & obnoxious-CONSTANT (blah) jokes & OVERacting. The best parts of the book were excised. Bills wife and Beverlys husband don't even make it to Derry! James Mcavoy and the actor playing Ben saved the production, but even they were saddled with cringey lines. ""It's Derry, I'm getting used to 'weird'."" And group chanting ""Turn Dark to Light!! Turn Dark to Light!! . . ."" repeatedly felt like lazy, over simplistic writing and I had second hand embarrassment for all actors involved for those five minutes. Condolences. Skarsgard as Pennywise was for the most part reduced to a CGI hybrid. More video game monster than the shadow clown we feared in part 1. Most of the time the actors were attacked by (poor) CGI creations that looked straight out of a Tim Burton movie. Plot holes a'plenty, and the ending is just straight up torture. ""It"" stomps around (LOUDLY) in circles for around 15 mins while the heckle and jeckle losers make jokes and poor Ben has to shout that Haiku like it's some kind of protective charm. After 3 hours ears & a$$ both are brutalized and the whole theatre moved like a flock of Whisperers (Or Golden Girls) when the lights came up. If you love the book don't see this. I counted only 3 cribbed scenes from the book. The rest is garbage from a screenwriter, not Stephen King. I felt like a fool for hyping it up and dragging 6 friends. All 6 were grumpy when the lights came up, but only 4 needed ibuprofen from my wife's purse, so there's THAT. The Final Cringe: who bullies a baby clown by yelling insults at it?

Should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad?! Some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie...do you not feel any guilt!This was AWFUL! Its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I'll leave these points here:1. The terrible acting. It was awful. The actors were either bored or overacting (Bill, Mike, Richie). Seriously terrible.2. What on earth was the need to make this a 3 hour movie?! It was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly boring3. The story had no story. Mike tells them there's an Indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for 2 hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual...WHAT?! What was the point of that?! Ben threw into the fire something he'd held dear in his wallet for 27 years for...no.....reason??4. Seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character development5. Erm what happened to Bills wife? Bev is kissing all the guys but is still married. They turned Bev's character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss Bill then choose the wealthy and better looking Ben for his boat?!6. What in the name of all that is Mike Myers was that terrible CGI about?! The old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a 15 foot naked zombie like monster7. Speaking of zombies...Bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum? If zombies can do that, why did Pennywise need Bowers?8. Speaking of Bowers...what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama? He did nothing. Except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely fine9. Stanley's suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself?! The act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear...not as a human sacrifice10. The grand finale. After spending 2 hours looking for tokens and Mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner's pottery class, turns out all you had to do was hurt Pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby?

I was so impressed by the way the film was made, the concept of it, the characters and the idea of feeling so emotional for them, feeling their fear and the way they have to go through this curse together. It was all so personal to them, so haunting and so scary.The thing that I felt was missing in the film which I think would have been a great idea even though they may not appear in the book, was getting the people of Derry involved in the Curse. Reason why every 27 years kids go missing without a trace and people dying without a reason. That would have added so much more excitement to the film.
Adding also to the film is seeing people getting punished for the crimes they have committed, you will understand this part once you see the film specifically the first scene.Anyhow I love the movie, it is long and very detailed film about the characters.

When I first started reading the book, I wasn't really captured by it. I put it away and didn't read it for some time. The next time I picked it up, I finished the whole 1200-page nightmare in little over a week. While not exactly following the events of the book, the first movie still managed to capture me and was a rather great horror film. Like the book, it relied on great storytelling and long-lasting scares. This one however, feels more like a interminable rollercoaster.A great horror story is one that not only scares you while it is unfolding, but leaves you with permanent scars. It, the book, is one such example. Other films that does this are, Hereditary, The Shining, or Psycho. It's hard to see how It Chapter Two would fit into that category. It's an endless ride with predictable jump-scares and incomprehensible intercuts that leads to an unsatisfying climax. The ""horror magic"" from the first film is all lost through somewhat cheesy comedy and poorer script writing (perhaps suffering from the loss of one Cary Joji Fukunaga).That said though, not all is bad. One thing they really nailed was how accurate the depiction of the adults were in regard to their younger counterparts. A few scenes, or parts of otherwise displeasing moments had me holding onto my chair. In particular the one where Pennywise lures away a little girl from her mother at a baseball game. Also while talking about the dancing clown, one cannot ignore the brilliant performance of Bill Skarsgård, who is scary good as the child-eating clown. Although this time around he had worse material to work with.Nonetheless, probably the main reason why this film fails to scare, is because it's not gruesome enough. Which might sound weird, but in comparison to the book it is not even on the same level. The book is bizarre, grotesque, mind-boggling, weird, crazy, down right abnormal. If the movie feels like Stephen King was on pot while writing it, the book feels like he was on acid. Once in a blue moon I would say this: Skip the movie, read the book.",It Chapter Two

Rich Delia, the casting director, earned his paycheck. The cast that was assembled for this lil ol' picture show here was superbly done. The chemistry amongst The Losers Club as adults was just as fantastic, as genuine, as it was when they were depicted as children. Each character reintroduced as an adult was easily identifiable and instantly familiar despite how much growth had happen within' the past 27 years. Speaking of chemistry, Bill Hader as grown Richie and James Ransone as grown Eddie can be simply described perfection. Everytime these two were on screen and interacting everyone in the theater, myself included, was having a blast.Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise was just as wonderfully deranged and vile as one could hope for. It irks me to no bounds that after getting home, and even now I still see a bunch of ''he's no Tim Curry'' posts/rants. They're right. He's no Tim Curry, and Curry is no Skarsgård. Both performances were amazing and I see little merit in comparing them. Skarsgård, I feel, excelled in bringing to light just how ruthless Pennywise is. Skarsgård's representation of Pennywise shows us that he's mastered what seems to be an artform of sadism by vehemently using other's weaknesses against them. Regardless if you're a child, or a determined adult come back to 'play' again, anyone sound of mind would follow the steps of Stanley than try to face Pennywise.Outside of the casting, the film was visually beautiful. Derry was bleak yet bright, dreadful yet seemingly peaceful (as long as you weren't a loser), and so on. You could imagine sitting in the second row of the theater, I got a whole lotta screen to look at. As I bent my neck in ways it never bent before trying to take the entire picture in, never once was it not worth it. Even afterwards, while rubbing the newfound kinks out I'd rightfully earned, I was still thinking of the cruddy looking theater with 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 5' displayed for presentation, or of the run down arcade where Richie visited to find his token. I wasn't physically at these places, but the way everything was displayed felt so memorable.... if that makes any sense at all.I can go on and on about all the things I enjoyed about this film, but this post would get way too long and ruin the movie for who read this before watching it. Instead, let's get into what I disliked.The overabundance of unneeded comedic relief. I'm all for comedic relief in horror films, but not when it's every other dang line, my dudes. For example: Richie gets barfed on at one point in the film. We're not talking ""need to change your shirt"" kind of barfed on, but barfed on so hardcore he has barf in places he didn't know he had places that requires a full body, deep tissue, down to the essence of his being sort of scrubbing. While that happened, Angel of the Morning begins playing. It felt excruciatingly out of place to me. It felt as though the humor of the song was supposed make this less disgusting by fault of humor? No thanks. This type of relief continuously happened to the point where things that were supposed to actually jilt the audience didn't do it at all; instead laughter ensued.A complaint I'm a little on the back and forth with myself about is there wasn't any warning beforehand about long intervals of flashing. I mean, yeah, as an epileptic you kinda take that risk when going to the movies, but at the same time when it's as prolonged as it was in some parts of the film you'd imagine there being some decency on behalf of the theater or production company saying ""Heads up, epileptics. This one's gonna hurt.""The rest of my disappointments are minor. We didn't get to see too much of Audra nor Bowers. While the ending was understandably not similar to the book, what the hell was that ""you're a clown!"" garbage? If you're going to do CGI, make it look GOOD. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Beyond all that (would be, could be) nitpicking, I did enjoy the film. Everything from the nod to The Thing to Stephen King's cameo was delightful. I'm patiently looking forward to the bluray release so I can watch part one and two back to back.",It Chapter Two
693,alantas,Watched IT without expectations,8,17 May 2021,"At the time when this move came out, I wasn't very interested in it. The first movie was ok, but not nearly as disturbing as the book. I didn't like the fashionable 80's nostalgy a'la Stranger Things and the forced comedy. When Chapter Two came out, the negative reviews deterred me from watching it. But now I could watch it with open mind and without the influence of the internet mob.I was actually pleasantly surprised. I might be one of the few people, who liked this film more than the previous one. I thought that the buildup and pace was well balanced and it managed to hold my attention for the full runtime. I'm not a big fan of the overuse of CGI, but in IT Chapter Two it didn't bothered me that much, because the scenes were very imaginative.The characters and cast choices were great in my opinion. They all got the room to breathe and every one of them had enough time to tell their stories. Maybe Mike was an exception. Their struggles were impactful and relatable. I have to admit, I don't remember the second book that much (I read it way back in the 90's), but maybe that's a good thing, because I wanted to appreciate this movie as a standalone creation. I think tonally it's more consistent than the first movie, despite having some of the comedy here as well. It just wasn't as intrusive or disruptive. I liked the Stephen King cameo as well.As a fan of the horror genre, I'd like to see more grounded, reserved and serious works and It Chapter Two isn't like that by any measure. But at the end it feels like it had more sincerity than most horror movies these days.",It Chapter Two

The atmosphere???,3,6 September 2019,"I knew it was going to be bad (even though I hoped it would at least have some creepy moments) because the 1st one was also bad. But I still could not help myself.. Still hoping for a worthy adaptation of a king novel (there are a couple).The cast is good, acting ok but the ""scares"" are hilarious. The scene at the Chinese place was straight out of a star wars circus.There is every cliche in the book with extra pointer to make sure ""you get it"".. Blasphemous references to actual cult films (Alien, Shining, The Thing, Nightmare on Elm St, etc) that feel more like an insult than homage.

695,cherchezan,Really boring with little to no plot,3,16 September 2019,"I have not wanted to walk out of a movie so badly in a long time. For the first half I was waiting for the movie to get good, or scary. It never did either. For the second half I pretty much figured that it won't improve much and I was just bored out of my mind waiting for it to end.Half the movie is about how they evolved and their personal fears and whatnot, you barely see Pennywise throughout the movie. You mostly see him at the end and somehow, even though he's humongous he manages to be outrun, he never follows them for a very long time, just a very dumb villain, he was not scary at all. He had a couple of great moments but they were way too few and far between.The cast was actually pretty good, they did some great casting decision, the older version of the characters actually look like they are those kids grown up for the most part. A few of them I think were amazing choices and the acting was solid. the special effects looked great to the point where the CGI was close to perfection in my opinion, except for a few moments, but overall it didn't feel obvious and forced (except for the old woman part).So a massive fain in my opinion, very bland, unexciting and plain boring. Ok to watch on your computer 10-15 minutes at a time, in the background while eating breakfast or something. Definitely not worth the money to go see it in a cinema.",It Chapter Two

The first had only a couple complaints from me. like too much CGI and unusual music choices. But overall it was good. The only good thing I can say about the second movie is the casting. Eds and Stan were nearly perfect. This movie however had even more CGI than the first. They did not think this through as far as the children aging. Kids grow fast. They should have shot all of the kids scenes during the filming of the first movie. By the time they got to filming the second movie half of the kids were noticeably older and they had to use CGI on their faces. Just looked weird.

The movie is 3 hrs long and yet the story felt rushed. It didn't even seem like they were friends at all honestly.
Sadly the story got lost in all noise. To add the fact that Eddie and Richie turned out to be a couple was just plain stupid. All in all I am very disappointed that Stephen King even signed off on this.",It Chapter Two

There is just so much to see. Scary part after scary part can become bit overwhelming at times, but viewer must understand that IT feeds more from fear than flesh.IT is bittersweet movie that probably needs similar small town childhood memories to really work. If you cannot enjoy memories of those never ending summer days with your long lost childhood friends, this is maybe not for you.Effects and CGI is just perfect, only minor hickups here and there, like too much face distortions and ""in your face"" pseudo 3D.Only real problem was with humor. It was too funny at times and one scene particular was just so cringy attempt of being funny (the vomit scene). At times it really destroyed all the serious tones and i was left wondering if filmmakers just totally jumped to the comedy-horror genre (Scary Movie style).But they made up for stupid audiovisual comedy mistakes at the end and i just really enjoyed this movie.",It Chapter Two

704,katiebugg-49971,NO! Not unless you have absolutely no other horror movie to watch! But was there a deeper meaning?,4,5 November 2019,"Obviously the quality is great. It doesn't come off as a cheap ""B"" movie or anything like that. It even has a couple of jump scares. But overall it was sooo long, had no good meaning/storyline, doesn't even compare to the first one, and the goofy imaginative characters were so silly that they were ridiculous! At first it didn't seem too bad, but then it went on for hours...The only way I would give this movie a somewhat higher rating is if there was actually a deeper underlying meaning. For instance when Billy is holding his brother in the water & he comes to some sort of realization.... does this mean all of the kids are bound by the trauma they each experienced? That they're all trying to forget their traumatic past? Did they all do something harmful in their past that they're running from? Idk. Just some analytical, deep thinking.

706,Billybobble1,Much better than expected,7,25 January 2020,"I am in no means a fan of modern horror movies and not really a fan of horror in general, if ghosts or the paranormal are involved I check out or don't even check in. There are exceptions, an obvious one being The Shining.I had seen and read a general dislike to this movie upon release but I have seen the original, and the recent remake of the first part so inevitably I was going to watch this. To my surprise I actually quite enjoyed it and I would normally be a prime contender to berate at the first opportunity. I thought it was good fun, though maybe that is not the soundbite you want from a 'scary' movie.I'm not sure I've ever been affected by jump scares, I just don't react to them, for me there was only one in this movie and it was obviously on it's way (ballon, bed, asylum), but nonetheless it was some of the imagery I enjoyed, that skit being one. The old lady I thought was fantastic.It's against the norm for me but I thought the humour was actually funny, I've definitely seen supposed comedies with much fewer laughs, I didn't feel this detracted from the 'horror' as 'horror' films don't really exist anymore. I was along for the ride and that's no small feat for me and this genre.The most horrifying scene is probably the opening scene, beyond that I generally liked most of the cast so it was somewhat irreverent to me how their journey's progressed as mentioned, I was onboard for the ride.It's a long movie but I felt it moved along at a decent pace, I can understand some of the criticisms, this could have had a much darker tone though I watched the original IT for the first time only a short time before the release of the first part of the remake, I can only really remember the second half of the original being ridiculous any way. I barely remember the first part of the remake ....but in this ....that old lady, that's going to stay with me for a while.Overall I think if you go into this with an open mind it's generally quite enjoyable, a bit silly and a bit sick. I think I will leave it there reiterating my words above 'good fun'.",It Chapter Two

In the time Chapter 1 took to get going you were hooked. But 365 days later Chapt 2 takes just as long to get up to speed. I think 6 months THEN release Chapt 2. You may think Chapt 2 is all adult stars, but the kids in Chapt 1 really shine through and add more in Chapt 2.

The cast was outstanding, the direction superb, and, for the most part, the writing tight. With a few missteps towards the end keeping it from being as good as it could be, I still feel that this film does justice to Stephen King's book, and even improves the ending of said book in some cases. Overall, I recommend seeing it
as, even though it doesn't quite reach the bar the first film set, it does manage to be an emotional and deep character study that engages to the end.",It Chapter Two
709,karmazyn,Great finale to one of the greatest horror novels of all time !,8,10 October 2019,"IT Chapter 2 captures the spirit of the book rather well and for most of it I felt really happy with the direction production team took. Certain important aspects of the book have not been explored or just briefly touched upon but overall I did enjoy it. I liked it much more than first movie, it is not that I disliked the first movie but I did not find it particularly scary, the setting and production values were top notch. Second movie is such as improvement over the first part. From the first moment you can see that they had bigger budget to play with.So the story continues when kids start disappearing fom Derry again, there are more murders, killer Clown is back, after many years of hibernation he got his strengths back. He is ready to take revenge on Losers Club who once almost killed It. You do not mess with devour of the worlds and think that there will not be consequences. The oath once took will have to be honored.Mike who stayed in Derry to research this extraordinary town was first to realize what is going on. He was not under the spell of the evil so as a guardian of the oath, called all the members of the Losers club. As we remember from the book some took it worse than others but this oath cannot be broken and the Losers clubs is once more reunited to face ancient evil.Speaking about the cast I was not initially entirely sure about cast of the movie, Bill in particular. His character as far as I can remember was bold in the book also role of his wife was far more important. Some other side characters important to the book were not properly fleshed out in this adaption. I understand it though, director wanted to focus on different aspects of the book. I can say that I was wrong and my original feeling about the cast was completely unjustified. All of the adult actors did a really good job, Bill's appearance aside, McAwoy felt the role and gave a good performance. He did not feel like a leader to me, he felt kinda lost but in the end he pulled it off in the end. He is a good actor. We also got to see Henry Bower once again. His part within the movie is fairly accurate to the source material. Really impressive job.I was also really happy to see Mr King in the movie, he acted really well, fit bizarre town just perfect.
Special effects, music, production values were really good. The clown was scary as always and there were few scenes which really superbly gave evil and vicious character of the clown. Bill Skarsgard really pulled it out, yet again he showed that he fully understands what is it to be demonic-killing machine. The way he moved, delivered his lines, it was very good acting.Bill Hader was funny as Richie, there was genuine chemistry between him and the rest of the cast. Jen Ryan playing Ben was just as I imagined this character to be. Successful, reserved but still kind and well just awesome. He is back and this time he will conquer Jessica Chastein's heart. Eddie is played by James Ransone. He does really look like adult version of his younger self. Younger cast once again shines on the screen.Although it is really hard to recommend this movie to anyone who has not read the book as quite simply they will feel lost and confused I could easily recommend this movie, it is a good adaptation and a very effective finale to one of the greatest Stephen King's classics.",It Chapter Two

The acting was good, and Isaiah Mustafa deserves extra cred for turning in a performance that was actually better than the more veteran actors. Of course Bill Skarsgård did another awesome job as Pennywise, though I thought he was under utilized throughout the film.The climax was rather anti-climatic, and really not suspenseful or exciting.

Having said, this movie had a lot of potential to be great. Let's start off with the Cast. Nothing was wrong with the Cast at all. Every Actor and Actress were so perfect for the older Losers Club. (Especially Bill Hader). On a Comedy level this movie is great just like the first. But unfortunately the scares were average. Though a scene when Pennywise eats a kid with McAvoys character in a glass maze was one of the film's best scenes. This movie also starts off really strong when one half of a couple is
the first victim of Pennywises' return. The 2nd act is where this movie loses its steam. Right where the characters wander off on their own to find out why they've return to the town gets really slow. (Also the movie never really touches on why the Losers Club can't remember almost anything. It's just glossed over) Fortunately, the movies 3rd act is solid and redeems the very slow 2nd act. The wrap up for the movies is strong. I still recommend seeing this movie if you were a fan of the first movie. Just don't go into it thinking it's going to be GREAT.",It Chapter Two

Were to start with this one.Well it's definitely a missed opportunity. It has none of the charm or character of the first movie. The Losers club are a far more likeable and believable bunch of characters in chapter 1 than what we're offered in this effort.Half of the intended to be scary moments are just plain ridiculous. I know horror is in it's nature far fetched but the scene with the Paul Bunyan statue is just plain stupid. I would expect scenes like this from a movie like scary stories to tell in the dark (a far superior horror film btw!) which is geared toward younger audiences, not grown adults.There's not enough Pennywise and way too much drama over the Losers club. I found the whole love triangle between Bill, Beverly and Ben in chapter one endearing, in this however it's just a boring unneeded distraction from the main story, mainly I think because I couldn't give a hoot about the characters. Especially the new buff Ben, who of course poor emotionally unstable Beverly would fall for now he's all ripped. That for me portrayed her character in quite a poor light tbh, shallow Bev very shallow. Does that class a spoiler? Maybe! But to be fair it would be hard to spoil the film anymore than they already have.The final act is again just stupid. unimaginative and insulting to Bill Skarsgard's tremendous character that he built in Pennywise.Overall this is a true testament to the acting power of children over adults with the only refreshing, truly enjoyable moments is when they are back on screen for short periods of time during this movie. Chapter one is a far far superior effort to this for many reasons. It truly is a missed opportunity to create a fantastic up to date 2 part adaptation of one of Stephen Kings finest works!",It Chapter Two
724,jenaycarter,Aquarius Creates,10,7 September 2019,"AMAZING! ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!I really like this movie! For starters I have seen the original Stephen King's IT the ( 1990 ) tv series version of course and I had nightmares as a child because of how well Tim Curry portrayed Pennywise and I gotta say I think Bill Skarsgård did an awesome job!
This movie of course aims to put fear into adults because the first IT Chapter 1 aims to the fear of a child and it's like now that IT Chapter 2 has come out , finally, some people are being really negative towards this movie. What I don't understand is that the audience asked for more scary because the first film didn't give them that. And now that they have revived it in IT Chapter 2 it's ""oh this movie is too long!"" Or ""Oh it's still not that scary!"" What more do you all want?!
The acting was good! The jokes were funny! Every scene from beginning to end was just great to me! And I don't normally say this about some horror remakes or just any remakes at all! But this one really had me interested. It gave me what I expected. I cried and I laughed and that's fine with me! I'm not about to sit back and watch a whole movie for two hours if I'm not interested.
Now I will say this though I really felt uncomfortable when seeing Stanley's suicide, which I already knew that he was going to die because he died in the original IT. But in this one, we (the audience) get's a chance to see and watch Stanley hurt himself. And I didn't want to watch him do that to himself again. I was also sad when I found out about Richie's Background which was a MAJOR plot twist!
The biggest plot twist that I've ever seen! And then we find out that Richie not only seen Eddie as a best friend but as something more. And that just hurt my soul even more to see that. And I'll be honest I cried. R.I.P Eddie and Stanley. Oh! Can I also point out the fact that Pennywise killed that little kid so brutal when Bill tried to save the kid?! IT SHOCKED ME! I literally said that this dude isn't joking! Like he's serious. Also sometimes most of the scenes would make angry with the decisions that the characters made. LOL and that's expected because that's how some movies are. I also like how the Adult version of the kids got a chance to see their younger selfs while having flash backs. Just so much happened that I could go on forever but I won't. Just know that this movie was really good.In closing, those bad reviews aren't really called for, but at the end of the day people are entitled for their opinions. And well mines is that this movie was just really really good! Great Job Everyone that contributed to the film! I know you guys really worked your hardest!

Loved how they were able to put across the same strong bond they had as children. The banter really shines through which made you laugh but care for them as they looked out for each other.Pennywise looked fantastic and really put across that creepy fear! How he sways and manipulates kids to get close to him sends shivers down your spine!I found it so clever how Pennywise used your fears against you and you have to overcome them. Although it was almost 3 hours long, I was stuck to the screen the entire time!The friendship really shined through and in the end, that is what wins it for them.Great remake on a horror classic!",It Chapter Two
729,CoffinVideo1983,When you're so bored that you start using the time to critique why you don't like the movie....,2,28 October 2019,"Honestly, I was expecting a lot more from It Chapter 2 after seeing the first film. I normally take a day to let the movie sink in before I try to write a review, but i was so bored during the movie that I used the time to start critiquing it while watching.To start with, I just don't know how well It really translates from book to film. Even with two very long movies it just doesn't capture the essence of the book and ends up being an extremely long way to make the point that you should face your fears. Perhaps a mini series would be a better way to go with it.
That being said, I'll move on to the actual elements of the movie....I thought the casting for the first film was excellent. They couldn't have found a better kid actor for each of the roles. In the second film however, I cant say the same. I did really enjoy Bill Hader as Richie and thought he brought a lot to the film besides just his comedy. The rest of the loser club cast I just couldn't get behind. All of the characters felt so unimportant that I basically forgot their roles the second the movie was over. Maybe thats the point to the ""Losers Club"" and if so, it was very effective.Bill Skarsgard was just amazing as Pennywise! I thought so in both the first and second films.
I would have liked to have seen more full body shots of Pennywise though. I think Skarsgard really embodied the role and had he received more screen time to do full body acting... I think he would set the standard for the role of Pennywise. Unfortunately, the films go so CGI crazy that most of Pennywise's scenes are just a clowns head on some random monster body.Speaking of CGI... there was a lot. And none of it was very convincing.
Also, I get that Pennywise is very personal as to how he uses each characters fears against them, but the vast array of ways he presents himself and does each scare is so different that it almost takes away from the fluidity of the movie. I think they tried to use every single horror trope there was throughout the filming.In conclusion, if you've already seen the first film... you have to finish the journey and watch the second. I will say that much. However, if this would have been a stand alone movie, I would definitely say to skip it.I give It: Chapter Two 4 out of 10.",It Chapter Two

731,sleons,Computer generated abomination,1,24 November 2019,"This film is hard to watch. There isn't a single ""scary"" scene that isn't pulled of with CG. It's hard to be afraid of a creature that belongs to the digital realm. The creators should only be afraid of how poorly this technology ages. Film that rely on this end up aging terribly (within a few years). The actor who portrays pennywise is great, I don't know why they used him so little in order to use this powerpoint created abomination. The suits in Hollywood have taken the fun away from making films. Now they are done surrounded by green or blue screens and doing everything in post. This film isn't scary, and that's something a horror film can never be. It has the stupidest comedy to ""lower"" the horror. The comedy and the horror doesn't work.

738,brucemiddlemissphotography,Mildly disappointed,6,8 September 2019,"I really enjoyed the first film, had a great nostalgic feel about it. At no stage would I have described it as scary but more disturbing but having read the book and seen the original mini series I felt it reflected the source material well. I always enjoy Stephen King, not for the scares but for the beautiful way he builds characters and friendships.Chapter 2 I felt dealt with the characters and friendships well and carried on well from the first film. As many have said in their reviews the homophobic attack at the beginning is brutal and really tests your stomach.What did I like about the film?
it didn't feel rushedI liked the fact it explained a bit about ITs back storythe acting was great and the characters developmentPennywise was fantastic and the risks they took killing people you wouldn't usually have expected.What was I not so keen on?the cgi/model creatures namely the old lady and the thing with the tongue were ridiculous. Now I don't know whether they were meant to look comedic but apart from the running at the camera which was a bit overused, they weren't scary and just a bit silly.this is more a moan about the dating of the source material, I know that this story is about the monster feeding on fear and as such coming together to take its power by not fearing it helps defeat it but it just doesn't seem to hold the impact you want it to. Please don't get me wrong I can't think of another way to end this and so should probably shut up but just felt deflated but I think this is because of the world we live in now and the high expectations we have.All this said this is still a good movie, which tries really hard and I think is successful. I just came out mildly disappointed.",It Chapter Two

It started out really slow, but did get going later and the story got interesting. Then the excess CGI monsters came out adding un-needed minutes, taking away from the story. Then I couldn't wait for IT to end. Very disappointing sequel to a great story.",It Chapter Two
740,gigitville,It could have been better,5,9 September 2019,"I wish this movie was better. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. There are pros and cons to every movie, and in the case of It: Chapter two, the cons are more prevalent, yet they don't necessarily outweigh the pros. It's a strange phenomenon that results in an okay, messy movie.So, the cons. Something that unfortunately continues from the first one are the clanging jump scares. There are way too many of them, and they would be scarier without the super loud ramping music and the clanging sound effect. There were way too many Dutch angles and it got distracting after a while. You definitely felt the length of it, but it didn't exactly overstay its welcome. It certainly felt like a 2 hour 50 minute movie, but it was entertaining enough to hold attention. The movie felt pretty messy, and honestly, didn't have much actual plot. This was especially true in the middle where it was 90% scare sequences while the Losers found their tokens. The middle should have been where they each found motivation to face Pennywise again, and the things they remember when finding their tokens were supposed to convey that, but it just felt like they jumped on board defeating Pennywise.More on the actual story elements, the whole element where they have to remember everything wasn't executed that well. About halfway through the film, it didn't really matter anymore but it also didn't come across that they remembered all they needed to. Plus, 90% of what they needed to remember, we've already seen in the first one. The love triangle between Bill, Bev, and Ben really wasn't earned and it didn't feel any more developed than in the first one. They had the same realization and emotional beats as the first movie. Plus, it was all Ben really had to do in the movie. He could have been the one to kill Henry Bowers so his arc was more about him finally overcoming his childhood trauma by defeating his bully. Honestly, all their arcs should have been about overcoming their specific childhood trauma. The only ones who really had complete arcs were Bill and Eddie. It would've been interesting to see a contrast between them as kids dealing with Pennywise and them dealing with it as adults, with maybe some fake out scare sequences where it's not actually Pennywise scaring them but it's their own paranoia and inability to know what's real making them feel like maybe it's not real. That would be an interesting obstacle.On the other hand, the pros. The transitions between the scenes were absolutely creative and had some great cinematography and special effects. There were some pretty interesting and new horror sequences and imagery, like the drowning sequence at the beginning seeing Pennywise while bobbing in the water, or Pennywise looking like a carnie Bill Skarsgard in Bev's old apartment. In the middle third, there were a bit too many long horror sequences in a row and gave a messy feel. I really enjoyed Bill's arc with him realizing it wasn't actually his fault that Georgie died, though his whole arc with the other kid in Derry dying at the fair felt removed from the rest of the plot. Eddie's arc becoming less scared and believing he could be strong and defeat Pennywise was also really great. It's unfortunate everyone else didn't really have an arc. Despite the CG on some of the kids and the pitching up of their voices (which is pretty weird for them to do), the flashbacks with the younger kids were all enjoyable and added a nice nostalgic feeling. The casting for the adult versions of the characters was great and everyone really felt like the characters from the first one all grown up.I didn't hate this movie. I just wish it was better. It could have been more streamline and better executed, with more thought put into the actual plot and character arcs than just the scares, but most of the horror was done well, and everyone's performances were great.",It Chapter Two
741,austincoleman-66971,This didn't need to exist,3,6 September 2019,"""Omg the cast is just so perfect"" isn't grounds to call this a good movie. The casting is indeed spot on and most of the actors (adults and kids alike) are great, but not even the best actors in the world can save an uncompelling story such as this one.Most of the 2hr 50min runtime is the EXACT same movie as the first chapter, except this time the jump scares come even cheaper. It gets old very quickly. Trim it about...hmm...an hour and a half and then we may have something.The most frustrating thing about It: Chapter Two is the way it so carelessly handles both the origins of Pennywise (including the way to actually defeating him) and the deeper themes and challenges of these characters. There was so much potential for emotional depth in this story, instead that was traded for the same sort of anthology type structure of the first film that, as stated before, overly relied on cheap scares. Ironically, this movie isn't scary at all because of that.Despite the length, this chapter added next to nothing to the original story. Go for performances and funny character moments. But other than that, I can't really say that this will be worth the amount of time it demands from you.",It Chapter Two
742,PoorManAlfred,Lost touch,6,12 April 2020,"IT chapter two kinda lost its touch and played it safe. However great visuals and having a nice cast. I didn't like the portray of the black character, he didn't get enough screen time and was looked like an afterthought when he was very pivotal to the story. Anyways I would recommend if you have seen the first chapter (which was more scary by the way).",It Chapter Two
743,SinisterTwist,Both good and bad,5,6 September 2019,"For anyone who is curious, this film does diverge quite a bit from the book and when it doesn't diverge, it liberally reinterprets. There are a lot of homages and plot points that will make some sense to people who are familiar with the book and/or miniseries, but may be confusing to those who aren't. (On a side note, ignore any reviews that state that you should have read the book before going into the film - the movie should be self-sufficient and shouldn't rely on the viewer having read the book, which would be poor storytelling.)This second chapter to the IT story is a decent addition, however I will admit that it does fall a little flat when compared to Chapter 1. There are some great scenes and jokes here, however part of the film's major issue is that it takes a while for things to really resolve, to the point where this really feels like someone had planned for the second chapter to be two films instead of one because of how much they try to cram into this movie. There are plot elements that are fine, but just feel a bit superfluous, like they could've been removed and the timeline tightened a bit just so it is a little less of a slog, such as the focus on the little boy seen in trailers. To be honest, most of the child deaths in this film could be mentioned rather than actually shown in order to make the film run a little less long and the story a little tighter.The story also feels like it shot itself in the foot a little with how much they changed in the first film. In the first movie Henry Bowers is pushed down a well, making it look unlikely that he would have survived - this in turn makes his appearance in chapter 2 a little harder to swallow, as it seems far more likely that he would have died or been crippled by the fall. (In the novel and miniseries he merely got lost.) There's no explanation for him emerging unscathed and while we could probably justify it via Pennywise, that just seems a little farfetched and it would've been a lot easier if the first film had just had him get lost as well.That said, there are definitely things to like in this movie. The acting is fantastic and the cast is exceedingly well chosen. While sure, the movie feels overly long and the Bowers stuff could've been handled a bit better, it's still an enjoyable watch. The opening scene was also very well done, as it was really effective in unsettling the viewing audience with its human on human violence as much as it was with its Pennywise on human violence. I also liked the resolution at the end with the Losers and certain revelations that come to light, as that was a nice, yet unexpected touch. I have to admit that I did kind of like how they defeated IT - it's a huge change from the book and miniseries, but there was just something about it that was kind of fun even as it was kind of ridiculous.Ultimately I think that this will likely be a movie more for the die-hards as its length and Stephen King references and nods will likely turn some of the casuals off from the film.",It Chapter Two

They also brought the original kids back for flashbacks we didn't see in the first one. It was a little long but jammed full of creepy Pennywise moments. I was so excited to see the reboot I was very happy with both films. The 1st chapter was so perfectly some I expected this one too fall short. I was wrong. The scene in the hall of mirrors is probably my favorite from both movies, Bill Scarborough is a super creepy as dude and much better casted for the role.

This Part II abomination is an absolute disgrace to the book and even the original mini series from the 90s which was perfectly cast but the ending fell flat only because of the monster spider looked so fake. Otherwise, it was brilliant.Only the 2 actors named above in this current film (the teens cast for Part I were good) and their talent was so misplaced (except Skarsgård who was brilliant) that the movie was lopsided and became stupid. Only the scenes of Beverly's ""journey"" were realistic with tension and the storyline strayed so far from the book, the plot was misjointed.In a nutshell, I paused the movie at 1hr 38 min because I was falling asleep from boredom and watched the rest of this hot mess just now a day later. The actor who played Mike was awful. His character is the binding to bring them back together and the acting failed miserably. And Ben?

An old ghost from the netherworld who can control who sees him and who doesn't? Why is the police/FBI sleeping despite a large number of kids disappearing? This premise is utter nonsense. Jeeper Creepers franchise had a similar one and honestly did a better job of making it consumptible than this duology has even though the visual/aural elements of ""It"" are far superior to the former. I haven't read King's book in which perhaps everything makes sense, but this review is of the movie, not the book, so let's not go there.Whoever Pennywise may be, I'm convinced that he most certainly is the creative director of this movie, and a very selfish one at that, because it's only in the scenes involving ""it"" that this movie comes alive. The rest of the footage is just an appalling and boring mass of blubber containing never-ending, illogical character introductions and conflict set-ups. This movie is like Bill Skarsgård's performances separated by long filler material. It was perhaps lost on the director that good makeup and state-of-the-art visual effects can't carry the burden of narrative for 169 minutes. McAvoy stands tall among the cast but his hands haven't the tools he can work his magic with. Skarsgård is awesome once again. I blame squarely the editor Jason Ballantine for this movie's failings, since it was his duty to ensure that the narrative be smooth, interesting, and agile, none of which happened.I constantly asked myself, ""When will the director be done with setting up characters and make them proceed toward an enthralling and unpredictable resolution of the conflict,"" and I got my answer as my mother woke me up after my second slumber during the first 90 minutes, NEVER. I gave up after that, reached for my TV's remote control and shifted to another title on Amazon Prime.

The CGI done of the younger versions of the main cast threw me off and ruined my immersion of the film and I went in hoping it not be predictable. I was hoping the writer and director would want to shake up some of the story, including the ending, to give audiences an entertaining and original experience. What we got was a rated R version of the 1990 miniseries. I did not leave the theater hating the film and found my initial experience enjoyable.

754,GaryKurt101,Welcome Back To Derry,6,16 September 2019,"It's strange to say that the dramatic parts of a horror film landed better than the horror parts, but that's It: Chapter Two's biggest issue - the horror just isn't scary. They sure think the horror scenes are scary. They come fast and furious with a ton of aggressive sound effects and CGI, desperately trying to prove to us that they're scary, but they're not.This film opens with a hate crime against a gay couple that strikes the wrong note right off the bat. This scene actually is brutal and scary, because it's one of the few scenes that isn't loaded to the brim with computer effects and it feels like something that would really happen in a messed up town like Derry. Even when Pennywise the clown shows up towards the end of that scene, most of his effects at least appear practical.Starting off like this gave me false hope that, maybe, this film would be stronger and scarier than the first. The next 30 minutes are equally strong with the audience catching up with the Loser's Club in present day. The transitions between each character's new life are beautifully handled and incredibly cinematic.Once everyone gathers back in Derry, it becomes a slightly dull series of predictable funhouse horror scenes as each character must return to a place of trauma before meeting back up to fight Pennywise. Blessedly, the final showdown, while drenched with the CGI I've spent so much time complaining about, is stronger than the finales of either the novel or the original TV miniseries.It Chapter Two is the very definition of a mixed bag.

It Chapter Two was my most anticipated film this year and actually has been since September 7th, 2017 right after It ended on the note of revealing that it was only the first chapter and there would be more. And more is exactly what we get here with the final chapter. More scares, more character development, more scarring scenes, more comedy from Richie, and yes, definitely more Pennywise.
Bill Skarsgärd takes your breath away quite literally with his chilling performance of the disturbing dancing clown. Every moment that he is on screen, he draws you into the movie even more than you already were. It's as if you are being lured in like all the other kids-his victims-were. Mind-blowing. Skarsgärd gave it his all, and he was backed-up by the superb actors that played the grown-up losers. I mean, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and freakin Bill Hader as Richie Tozier-what do you expect? Not a sub-par performance out them, that's for sure.
The brilliant dark tone and amazing cinematography that brought the horrifying story to life in 2017 carries on directly into the final chapter which made the connection between the two films seamless. 27 years is a huge jump forward but that didn't phase Muschietti. He was determined and clearly ready to deliver a finale that was so worthy to be an adaptation of the timeless novel that the author, the king of horror himself, made a Stan Lee-style cameo in it.
If all the performances, cinematography, clowns, and cameos didn't impress enough, the countless scenes of truly impressive and terrifying large-scale stunts (most of which involve Pennywise and his fear-provoking tactics) will leave you awe-struck. And don't worry, there are so many of these moments in this absolute behemoth of a motion picture.
With a runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes, you might be hesitant to go watch it and have to hold it during that last act after gulping down a large beverage. But, fear not, this is a cinematic event to witness in the theatre with hundreds of other movie-goers so you can laugh and scream together; just as it was meant to be:)
*cue ""We'll Meet Again"" song parody by Pennywise*
We'll float again. Don't know where, don't know when. But I know we'll float again some bloody dayyyy...🤡
So, even though we won't be getting another movie after this sequel, we still can float again-over and over-by rewatching these thrillers that already have made themselves into classics.

He perfectly conveyed fear when he needed to and even anxiety in certain areas. Bill Hader was also a stand out as he's hilarious as usual but he brings depth to the character of Richie.

766,heyitskeane,A bit underwhelming,6,26 November 2019,"Finally got around to watch It: Chapter Two and...it's okay. Alright.It 2 is the sequel to It (2017) also directed by Andy Muschietti, and follows The Losers Club after 27 years of the events of It. This movie is alright, it could've been a lot better, or a lot worse, but it's okay.Possibly the best aspect of the movie are the performances, especially by Bill Skarsgård, James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain. Honestly, the whole cast is amazing. The chemistry between them is just flawless that you really believe they were in the previous movie and now all grown up and back together. If that isn't good acting then I don't know what is. The directing by Andy Muschietti is also terrific, some shots were just like falling right into the novel (which I loved).The narrative however, not so great. It felt like the movie was basically doing the exact same thing from the first except now the characters are adults. Which also means the movie is just not as scary as the first one. And that kinda sucks.Another point is the runtime, which has been heavily discussed. Honestly, this movie is a bit too long. I get it they're trying to include as much as possible from the novel, which is great but when its almost 3 hours long and the narrative isn't that good, things start to get boring and dull. If they wanted to include as much from the novel as possible, they should've just made it a series, which could've been a lot better.However, there is one part that I really enjoyed from the movie. That was the characters themselves. Watching them reunite as friends (after most of them left Derry) was honestly quite heartwarming. So, it's a movie about a scary children-eating clown and that's my favourite part.Overall, It: Chapter Two was alright. It's not bad, but it's not great either. A shorter runtime and a more engaging narrative would made it much better.",It Chapter Two

For me the running time was far too long and could have easily shaved 1 hour off.
There was far too much CGI and I don't think it was scary at all.
There was just too much going on and where It originated from was just bizarre.
After such a solid chapter one it was a shame this is chapter two.
The 1990's mini series was head and shoulders above this.
The acting is excellent James McAvoy and the guy who plays Eddie being standouts.

When I saw this sequel to the first movie, it really ties everything together & we see more character development in the main cast. Both 'Richie' ( starring Bill Hader) & 'Eddie' (starring James Ransome) characters really stood up for me, as they were both really funny.I especially like the ending part, where the Losers Club destroyed Penny Wise, by not giving in to his scary appearance & antic, eventually diminishing him to nothingness. This is such a poignant statement in the movie, where we can sometimes giving in to bullies & people who were mean to us, but once we realize that we don't always have to give in to them & fall for their traps, their control over us would no longer have any effect on us.",It Chapter Two

Sadly it wasn't a patch on the first one for creepiness, it was more funny than scary, we found ourselves laughing at some of the effects/'jump scares'.
The performances were good, especially Pennywise and Bill Hadar, who stole the show.
A few nice little surprises in there too.

Absolutely no CGI, and Its a Masterpiece.The New Version of IT Chapter 1 and 2 have the same big issue. Everything is not terrifying due to CGI Effects all over the Time.
Pennywise maybe had only 4 Scenes in Real, and the rest is a CGI Animation.
Ok it is a Creepy Clown, but not a Clown as you remember Clowns.
This Clown looks like a Middle Age Harlequin Knock off, and not like a Clown you could see in Circus.
And this makes the Movie also less terrifying.In the 90s mini Series, ""IT"" was so horrible due to the Fact that he looked like a Clown! He looked like Beepo the Clown in my Hometown Circus and that makes it so horrible. If you would meet a Clown like IT in the Remake, do you would think it is a funny Clown? NOOO You wouldnt.
It Chapter 2 has a great Cast. A well written Storyline and of course, some Jokes!
But it is not a single Moment a good Horror Movie.

The casting could not be more spot on. There were parts that I found myself looking away for and parts my jaw dropped out of fear and horror. I can't wait to rewatch the original and compare them.The bad: it is 3 hours, and it feels like it. The pacing sometimes feels off and the plot got a bit muddied because of it. There's also so much strobe effect, my head started to hurt which brought me out of the film.It had some tone issues. Its a bad sign when you're in a full theater and 1 out of 5 jokes get a chuckle when the rest are met with silence. There were also too many unnecessary jump scares and unnecessary gore, which compared to chapter 1, made the horror fall flat.After the success of chapter 1, it was hard for chapter 2 to not let some people down. I would love to watch the 90s one, then chapters 1 and 2, and compare them both to the book. I have the feeling out of them all, I'll still feel that chapter 2 is the weekest.Either way, the series is strong and will forever be a classic and loved by many, including me.",It Chapter Two

Chapter 2 just feels cheap. The cinematography is terrible, the movie looks very cheap. The musical score is a joke. The editing is terrible, the movie drags and drags and is so slow and boring. The CGI is terrible, the creatures looked Corny, cheap and there was way.... too much CGI. I very very much hated the opening scene, it's extremely bigoted and hateful. There was absolutely NO rhyme or reason for that opening scene. Finally... I hate how much the loser kids are in Chapter 2. The losers had all of Chapter 1 devoted to them, Chapter 2 should've been all about the adults. It Chapter 1 is terrifying and suspenseful, it looks fantastic, the music is scary and the pacing is perfect. It Chapter 2 is slow and boring, clunky, corny, cheap looking, and way too long. It Chapter 2 almost feels like it was directed by a different less experienced tv show director.

Seriously it's ok if you just kill it in the movie and don't say anything about it being a permanent death.It's such a formulaic movie that literally mirrors it's predecessor and I imagine every sequel will always be the same .... Scary clown comes back, heroes assemble and go into the storm drains again, heroes rally courage to show they aren't scared of the clown then kill it forever again.

779,sugar_n_spice_makes_ever,The 'Losers' adults were a huge h-IT!,10,11 November 2019,"Chapter 2, oh, I honestly can't fault it in anyway! Although, be ready to be in it for the long haul as this movie nearly hits a 3 hour running time. I can't get over how accurate the casting was for the adult 'Losers' they were all SO alike to their younger selves, and the chemistry between them all was truly believable. I loved the whole childhood friendship nostalgia through this, there were plenty of flashbacks given. Bill Hader, who played an older 'Richie' was a pure delight to watch, he thoroughly absorbed his character; The cinema was rocking with laughter at his snide remarks & comebacks. James McAvoy (the magnificent role playing actor that he is) who portrayed 'Bill' was also very believable; he nailed the personality traits so perfectly to his younger self. I feel that chapter two gave us a lot more information & insight into IT'S origins, aswell as the grown up losers did. I personally saw a darker depth to the story telling in this one. IT was certainly a rollercoaster experience, many moments of laughter, fear & tears (believe it or not, I welled up a few times!) The CGI & visual effects were impressive, even when IT shape-shifted, though I was fully aware it was computerised at times, it still scared the hell out of me, and I'm not really a jumpy person. Although I've read a few reviews stating that IT himself didn't get much screen time, I personally don't agree on this, I genuinely believe he had just the right amount. Bill Skarsgård as IT honestly made my skin crawl, the casting team have seriously won the jack pot when it comes to him.",It Chapter Two

The kids had great chemistry and I don't think the adults had that same magic.I do like how much they followed from the novel with these adaptions.This is easily one of my favorite books, I do think adult Eddie, Mike, and Richie were cast well, and adult Stan even though we see him for like two minutes.This movies biggest weakness is being overly long and poorly paced, which is a problem the book faced too. I do think they should've interwoven the young and old a bit more like the book did and that may have fixed the pacing issues. I would love to see someone put together a more book accurate cut with the time jumps. I think that would fix chapter 2 a lot.All around, if you enjoyed Chapter 1 you need to watch chapter 2, but 1 captured lightening in a bottle and two just couldn't hold up.If these movies are redone in a few decades, which I'm sure they will be, we need to get the kid cast together to play the adults and talk about the Turtle!",It Chapter Two
782,oaspag-71318,2centswise. chapter 2.,8,17 March 2020,"Hi there! Just a 2 cents or a penny.I saw this film online (missed it in theaters, although theaters are becoming deserted with the virus happening) and was really looking forward to it. I can say it is a great film (not to Oscar level but very good yes). I read the reviews after seeing it and I am amazed (in the sad way) that it takes so much for people to find anything good these days (I'm not difficult in general with most films, no that does not mean I have no taste or I am witless -> Tastes will be tastes, to each their own). It's like that:Lots of films, lots and lots of films -> People want Excellence, each time now. Because, now, more critical and 'don't have time/money' to give to 'lesser' film...
That's a huge problem these days, and not just films basically everything in arts (movies, books, video games, art pièces, etc). Nothing is ever good enough.
I will respect people's opinion about this film, I just find it sad that people can't be happy (about anything). Are there derivative films, books, etc...? Absolutely, but the Entire domain of art is derivative in itself. I don't like this word but it is what it is; films are influenced by everything and many other films before. Things can repeat themselves at some point (at the 1millionth film). Everything has been made/done/created/invented...not much more to do/invent/be original.In other words people should be more lenient and forgiving instead of hypercritical and judgmental about everything. But such are our times.Anyway, to review this film here, for my opinion/feeling, I loved it.I watched the First It and it was great, I remember watching the It film in 1980s...great film. The remake was great...and this one too.''But...CGI...But...boring story....But....CGI....But....Not scary....But...Jump Scares...But.....CGI....But want Practical Effects/Make-Up....But...But...But.''Look we are in 2020, yes the audience still decides what goes in the film, but we aer Today and today, things are bit diferent about how they are made. That the films (It Chapter 1 remake and Chapter 2) are not like the original 80s anyone is normal...we are today/things in film are made differently for Various reasons.CGI is used to save money (albeit it can be costly), in general, it saves a lot, it is economical and why is used. It is also safer (don't need to have stunt people), there is a place for it, jsut like any other tools (like prostethics). No, it does not look good as those old 'real' effects, true, but it looks pretty good even so. There is good blend of real and CG effects in this film, ok yes, there is more of them, but I thought they are Extremely well-made (you can tell this is Not a crap VFX movie, they put Lots of effort in them and they look pretty impressive.) People are taken out of it becasue they can't 'suspend their disbelief' when they see a CGI pennewise clown. Suspend it. I did it, anybody can. It takes convincing yourself and not 'seeing CGI'...because that'S what people are doing, don't focus on that, focus on the 'whole'. But people focus on micro-détails and say :''That's it I'm disengaged in this film/I just don't 'get in it' because everything looks fake''. It is like when you were Young and your mommy would tell you a story in bed...you have to get in it - you have too even if you don't believe it for a second.Story: 5 or 6 friends from early days get back togethere to destroy an ancient evil force that lives in the town sewers; taking the form of a 16th century costumed 'renaissance-style' Clown. Pennywise. The town is called City of Derry. The Second Chapter is them as adults (first chapter was children). In first chapter they k*ll him and so it ends like that. In 2nd chapter he comes back 27 year later. Mike the friend in the group calls them all back - after nearly 30 years....it's awkward. But they were best friends so he tells IT is back, and IT wants to end it (them - not IT...I know confusing). The Clown is a manfestation of their fear...because clowns are a fear humans have. Clowns are scary because they related to childhood. Children....clowns make children laugh and give them funny balloons...except this clown...is no clown; but death with jaws and k*iller wits. He can sense their fear and this film has a lot of 'Nightmare of Elm's Street' vibes...where Freddy was in 'the nightmares'..came to you while you slept. IT is clear the director of this film plays on that. By going the people's fear and by exploring this past through flashbacks whence they were Young kids. IT 2 tries to blend pure horror with comedy, in some places it might be a bit shoehorned in...but most of the film did a great job of meshing 'jokes' with serious horror/scares. There quite a few jumpscares..but Nothing that really Terrifies you..but yes this film is scary (By moments) and have lots of comedy thrown in the two (because the film is trying to make moment of 'relief' and comedy...to not be continuously scary). Now I know some peolpe hate that because it is neither comedy nor horror but a mash-up. Yet, I would say, this film blends it very well and Nothing is so cringey or really dumb...or takes you of it. Because, the film is capable of exposing their lives with lots of details...flashbacks etc...these Feel like real people Not fake people. They crack jokes and constantly are 'self-aware' of their situation whic is 'implausible' yet they make it plausible. Because they laugh of it and go straight in it. And there are moments where they cry, they are completely frozen in fear....the film does really good job of showing Nuanced characters. I read the reviews and some said ''we don't care about them, they have 0 characterization....''. I have a diffrent opinion, I believe they are Very characterized, through Many Many flashbacks and we know their Entire life...I even felt bad when one person dies..because you Care about them - All. Like a group of friends. Real people, they tease each other, they make jokes, they Even face a Monster...in the film...talk about cool. Very few films can blend this so well. It makes me think of the film 'Drag me to Hell', 'Evil Dead', 'Army of Darknes''...those old comic-horror films of the 80s, that did a nice job of blending comedy and horror (also 'Shaun of the Dead'...like that).But if I were to compare these films to IT Chapter 2...I was much more scared in it, because the film going quite serious in its horror when it does happen; there are a Lot of F* bombs word in this film..which is a no-no in films..but here it works because these people are real and talk real. The actors were Really good and did their best to give it all. All of them went through the all gamut of emotions during the film. I understand people may not like this if don't like comedy-horror combo; either one or the other, but not both. As for the CGI, cut some slack. It was very good and loved this film. It is 3 hours long but I was very rivited for whole this time...I truly feel I had a great time watching this, even if 3 hours long. IT was not long because enjoyed it very much. I look forward the IT Chapter 3 very much. If people want to make a IT like they want...they can go do it, but making films is Huge process and you can't please everybody.

Its almost like a movie and a half in one.I will say as far as horror movies go this one ranks at the top this year. You have some typical horror scares but you also have some that are out of the blue. Some that are rather creepy and that helps give it its own feel. Its not the typical music shrieks and then music pause before scare kind of horror so if you want a couple of decent scares then this is one to catch.BUT then the problem comes. A movie has three phases. The beginning, the middle, and the end. Beginning and middle were pretty good. The ending... where they defeat It is so weak it hurts the movie. How do you stop a murderous, demented, psychotic, supernatural clown? You call him names. That's it. You call him names and that makes him so weak that he shrivels up into almost nothing. That ending truly hurt the movie and the irony is that in the movie one of the characters is a movie screen writer and that's one of the main criticisms of his writing is he is good but his endings aren't.

I wasn't aware of the run time (I watched it at home) so presumed it was around about the 2 hour mark when I put it on - very shocked to see this genre of movie come in at the near 3 hour mark. You can tell that they've just tried to put filler scenes in to stretch it out for some reason as it does drag. I found myself no longer becoming interested in the scenes because they were just full of jump scares.These jump scares were mostly complied of very very poor CGI. It took me out of the movie multiple times. I said to my wife it's more like a Resident Evil or even Scooby-doo type film at those points.I felt Pennywise didn't feature much either. Granted the fact he operates in the shadows adds to his mystery but I find it more scary when they showed a dark corner and all you hear is his voice. Much better than something running at you that looks like it's from Harry Potter.Adult actors were all good but overall it was about 45 mins too long and ended up becoming boring to watch.",It Chapter Two

Every cast member brought a great element to the story as well as they all worked off of each other masterfully. Both Adult and kid versions of the characters did magnificent jobs portraying their respective characters. I do recommend Stephen King and overall horror fans to go see this movie or wait for it to come out on video if you prefer not sitting in the theater that long because it is worth watching.

I actually fell asleep for 20 minutes.Problems: the unnecessary virtue signaling in the opening minutes (which had little to do with the rest of the film), a generally mediocre cast (exception: James McAvoy, whose talents were sadly wasted here), mediocre and unbelievable acting, limp and uninspired dialogue, and the usual modern-Hollywood over--reliance on CGI and slick camera work (found the latter failed attempts at.best).If you're expecting the same level of quality as last year's It, prepare to be sorely disappointed.

797,nicetryjan,Pales in comparison to the first,5,8 September 2019,"For one, IT (2) feels more like a comedy than a horror. I found myself actually laughing in some of the scenes that I think were intended to be frightful. A prime example is when Beverly visits her old apartment that is now occupied by Mrs. Kersh. Suddenly, this sweet old lady transforms into a tall zombie woman that chases her through the halls. Another is when they are sitting around the table at the restaurant and their fortune cookies start hatching with monstrous creatures. It was laughable and so was the CGI.Also, where was Pennywise? One of my only complaints about the first one was the lack of screen time for Pennywise but in the sequel he has even LESS. He randomly appears a couple times during the three hour film and when he does, it's very brief. Except for the dragged out ending where he becomes a ginormous spider. Apart from the ending, a scene with Richie and one scene with Bill, the clown has pretty much no interaction with the adult members of the losers club.Henry Bowers? His character was literally useless and irrelevant in the movie. I honestly don't even know why they brought him back since he was believed to have died in the first one. He was only there to try and kill the main characters who ultimately kill him. No relevance to the plot. How did he even know where everyone would be? Oh right, he was being drove around by his zombie friend in a car.Overall, it was a decent sequel that fails to live up to the first. The opening scene with Adrian Mellon being murdered was by far the best scene in the film. That scene alone was very intense, brutal, and felt like a good opening to a horror film. Unfortunately, after that, it turns into more of a comedy.",It Chapter Two

It wasn't as good as the first or as scary, but the film does a good job of exploring in depth of the losers' club again! Here are some pros and cons:Pros: the acting is good. Casting choices are execellent. Love how they being the young losers' club back! Some scary ass moments for sure. Pacing is good for a 169 min. flick (2 hours 49 minutes if you don't know at the top of your head). Cinematography is excellent (especially for the flashback scenes).Cons: It feels more jumpscarey than the 1st film. Not all the way through, but for me it was noticeable. CGI was good for one scene in particular, but in the rest that follows, it can be a bit noticeable that these are definitely digital effects that look a little fake for some people. There's a certain dynamic that could've been explored more; which I won't spoil for the people who haven't seen the film, for those that have might know what I'm talking about.Not as good as the first, but if you got almost 3 hours to spare, I say check it out.",It Chapter Two

I'm not saying they didn't anything other than what they could have, because why I liked the first one was because I felt like one of the kids. And that scared me. Penny wise in the first one was a lot more scary, which again, they couldn't really help. I would like to give this movie grief, but I just keep coming back to the realization that they couldn't have done anything more with it really. That acting by bill hader was amazing. Never seen his actor until now, but I'm a fan now. Penny wise, while not as scary, still great. Spoiler right here. She the little girl goes under the bridge, and penny wise eats her, it breaks my heart. It really reminds me of the scene in the first one where gorge dies. While not as good, like everything in this movie, still sad. To describe this move in a short sentence, acting great, plot was meh, but they couldn't really do anything about it. Watch it, understand what I mean.",It Chapter Two
804,sarahkaye-30024,Exceeded my expectations!,10,13 September 2019,"For all the naysayers, you seem to come in two categories-those who are fans of the book, and those who have never read a Stephen King story in their life.
To the fans, of course the films are not 100% true to the books-that would be impossible without making the film a week long in duration. Every adaptation has huge chunks taken out and new, dramatic scenes placed in.
To those that have never read any of Kings work, this is NOT a sequel. It's the second part of 1 story. The novel is written as a back and forth between childhood and adulthood, this would be impossible to play out on screen so it was written in two chapters instead. IT is a beast of a novel, so it would also be impossible to condense the story into one 2.5 hour film.
Now for my review...
Wow. Just wow!
I went into this with extremely high hopes for two reasons. 1, I'm a huge fan of the book-it might be my favourite novel of all time, and 2, the first chapter was outstanding! I was not disappointed!
Any adaptation of a much loved story is always a little nerve wracking, in case they fail spectacularly in their vision-but as far as I'm concerned they hit all the right notes this time! I loved the original adaptation, it was terrifying at the time, but much of the humour from the book was missing. This time around it's all there. Of course some of my favourite parts were missing, but they included most of the important ones.
The casting is outstanding, they managed to find children and adults who do actually bear strong resemblances to each other. Bill Hader as adult Ritchie is absolutely genius, the funniest lines in the film all belong to him and his younger counterpart Finn Wolfhard.
It's hard to say any more without rambling on for days, but I will say this: Never in my life have I laughed so hard whilst also hiding behind my hands out of terror.

Every single member of this cast had chemistry and you actually feel like they've known each other since they were children. It genuinely feels like they are childhood friends catching up. Bill Skarsgard also did an amazing potrayal of Pennywise. But I feel like that's the only good bit about the movie. The story was abit stretched and boring. The jokes were not too bad but some parts the lines were really cringy. Only a few scenes in this movie made me get goosebumps. The rest were just abit long and stretched. I wished they used less jumpscares because the overall tone of the movie was already creepy enough. Especially with Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, he is absolutely terrifying. In conclusion, this is an okay horror movie that has an amazing cast but is abit long and stretched. I also wished they used less jumpscares and depend on more creepy elements to make the movie scary. I'm gonna give this one a 6/10.",It Chapter Two

This film however was a total disappointment.
The editing was terrible where there were too many pointless and long scenes that add no value. The film was too long, dragging on for no reason as it didn't have a story to tell like the first It.
Also for a horror film it was not scary at all. Some of the horror scenes were just funny or weird and looked too clumsy with the bad CGI.

808,Duveteux,King's realm,9,7 September 2019,"This recent incarnation of It is not scary, but I still love both films regardless. They feel really true to the 80s/90s adaptations of King, which are indefinitely flawed and stray from the origin stories, as well, and arguably they are not very scary, either...There is a massive preference for humour over scares in the second instalment, which I actually think is a wise move.
It starts off uncomfortable and dark with the homophobic attack from the book and you think It has also come of age and that the film will be more adult in theme, but as soon as the Losers are back together you also feel like you're in the company of friends again. It becomes, like the first film, a story of friendship and overcoming personal demons rather than a horror story.I was worried the adult cast would ruin the warm feelings I had for the Losers, because the kids were so great. I would only question Mike's portrayal which is unhinged and considering he plays the pivotal role in the book as the narrator, he comes across like he's just lost his mind in this film and he's the least likeable or noticeable character... The book gives the black guy the ONLY voice for once by making him the narrator and that is completely diminished in this film, which I do have a problem with.
Derry is a rotten and prejudiced place, regardless of whether the clown has an influence over that or is to blame for that (I don't believe It is the cause, I think King was commenting on the evil in humanity and the clown just takes advantage of the fear we create in our own communities) and it's important to keep that at the forefront. It is always going to be relevant.It feels like the same kind of production as Christine and Thinner and Dreamcatcher and Stand By Me and Creepshow and the original Pet Sematary. And the King cameo helps this film feel like it's a nostalgic, warm and familiar place to be, too. We are back in Maine and back in King's bizarre and surreal realm where let's face it, even if It was a perfect adaptation of the book, everyone would still exit the cinema with similar questions!",It Chapter Two

Very dark, and much more disturbing than the first one, but for some reason, Chapter Two didn't quite live up to the first one. Something was missing, and I can't put my finger on it.

The second one didn't really do anything for me in terms of being scary like the first did. However that is not to discredit the amazing work of Bill Skarsgard, he was great in both movies.There were too many moments of comic relief which made it feel not so much like a horror movie and more like a slapstick.

It is literally the only movie in my lifetime to actually scare me, and it does scare me. It scares the life out of me. I was not very old when it came out and I saw it, only 10, but it scared me so much that it lasted well I to my adult years. And I LOVE horror movies. I watch all of the horror movies that I can possibly come by, and none of them have scared me. The only movie to truly horrify me is the original Tim Curry version of It. The last time that I was able to watch it in ends entirety was when I was 20 years old. I am now almost 33 as I am watching the second installment of the remake. if you are capable, completely remove your expectations based on the old movie. There is nothing that could ever or will ever come close to the amount of insane horror that movie brings, and I can't explain why. With that being said, love these new movies were pretty darn good. They stood true to the old movie, while adding some pretty interesting aspects. It's true, that pennywise was not as scary as Tim Curry was able to make him be, but these movies added an emotional depth that the old movie lacked. yes, the old movie made us feel things, but this movie made us feel a whole lot more for the characters. It wasn't just horror it was romance and drama and love and sadness and anguish and everything that somebody could possibly feel all wrapped up into one tiny horrifying clown bundle. I am sad to say, and this is why this movie is not a 10 and is instead a 9, that the clown himself and all of his monstrosity is did not terrify me the way that they are original pennywise dead. Maybe that is just me, and anyone like me who was subject to the original torture. I am not afraid of monsters, and so therefore the only time my bad dreams have ever scared me has been when they are of pennywise the clown. the original.

The movie itself was not bad, Pennywise was just as creepy as always, completely owning every scene he was in, the grown ups did a great job at portraying the adult versions of the kids, and I really enjoyed watching everything unfold. I just for some reason felt like the ending sort of fell on it's face. as the movie reached the climax, I felt sort of let down by how it was all playing out, the creepiness of the movie seemed to be replaced with a more humorous vibe.

It's definitely slow and repetitive in the middle of the movie since all of the characters have the same stuff happen to them. The movie also didn't make me scared of Pennywise the way the first movie did. Perhaps it's the way that CGI is used on his shape for the films ending and it felt a little too much.

This chapter however manages to be something even worse. The second chapter could have really built upon the lack of tension and scares but this seems to want to be a comedy. The grown up cast are ok but the flashbacks that were done via de-aging is so obvious and really off putting.
The film is also way too long. It is so bloated where you are given scene after scene of characters being chased by something. There is absolutely no fear element here what so ever!! I found myself laughing where Mrs Kersh chases Beverly. This was promoted in the trailer as a suspenful scene but comes off as probably the funniest scene in the movie.
The film is just so badly paced compared to other Stephen King films at 3 hours. The Director's Cut of Doctor Sleep and The Green Mile both clock in at 180 minutes and they are both hugely satisfying. Again just like the first movie, Pennywise is just not menacing. Everytime the clown is about to kill someone the scence cuts to CGI teeth or a CGI face.The fact remains that Cary Fukanaga's version would have been so disturbing and utterly scary if only Warner Bros. had the balls to go through with it. The concept art for Pennywise alone is more scary then Bill Skarsgard's performance!!

But, there were a few creepy scenes such as the old lady smiling at Beverly and the way she shuffled out of the corridor. I found the most subtle scenes were the creepiest. I did enjoy the flashbacks to the kids because it gave the viewers a nostalgic feeling for a childhood that they never even had and really added the the reconnection of the Losers.

I don't mind when movies are changing parts of a book. And sometimes it works better for a movie to adjust the storyline. Same goes with this movie. But what really really bothers me is the ending. Don't worry, no spoilers, but this is the dumbest ending I've seen in a decade. It's so simplistic and unconvincing, it's almost the ending of a child's movie. My wife called it 'Typical Hollywood dumbness' and it's a shame as It deserved better.
Bill Skarsgård actually did a better job as Pennywise than in the first movie and some scenes are certainly gruweling. But it never becomes scarrier, or more visual stunning than any of the other Hollywood horror movies of this century. Making it just an average movie.

834,ardnael,"Probably the worst ""horror"" movie I've ever seen",2,14 September 2019,"I really enjoyed the first one - not an avid Steven King reader but this is a classic. First off, Pennywise feeds odd fears. Apparently it was stuck in clown mode because everyone kept getting the same version of pennywise and it didn't adapt to each person's fears like they do in everything else It related. The adults look nothing like the kids. I mean seriously they weren't even trying. There's a music scene in there that gave me Deadpool flashbacks that actually was an editing accident but they were too rushed to fix it. There were so many stupid jokes that it outnumbered their very poorly executed jump scares 10-1. The movie was so predictable that I could say what was going to happen right before it did. Why and how did a child go missing in a fun house for that long - getting trapped inside a glass box in a mirror maze - and no one noticed he was gone?? How are these guys not in prison they literally left a trail of bodies, including one of them putting a pickaxes in someone's head, then puking, and then fled the scene. They left a guy buried in the bottom of a well?? And fled the scene were a kid was murdered?? And then went home. Yeaaahh no. And since when is pennywise a frikkin alien?? Why did the tub they burned everything in not burn up? I mean seriously leather or wood the thing is gonna go up. And did this girl just walk into someone's house, go into the bathroom and just start ripping baseboards out? Not even quietly. And then left it. Why did the kids have completely different personalities than they did in the first? And why did they start off talking about the part they don't remember AFTER pennywise but suddenly we are having flash backs before then and it has nothing to do with their conversation?
Okay so this guy slit his wrists because the memories hit him and he went mad. It's the reason they all stayed, because if not they would all end up dead the same way...but yet later they read some letter saying he did it because he wasn't strong enough to go back and knew they would fail if he was alive and didn't go. But wait doesn't everyone have amnesia about that summer? Which one is it?
Omg I could keep going. The only saving grace is pennywise had a fantastic performance, but it was incredibly overwhelmingly stupid. They tried to cover how stupid the movie is with generic one like comedy. Which completely suffocates the horror movie feel.
I can't believe they released this garbage. I can't believe they tried to pass those adult actors off as grown up versions of the kids. I can't believe they spent half that movie in conversation that contradicts itself consistently. ""We have to stick together or we fail"" ""everyone split up and find their artifact"" ""I can't wait there's no time"" (while everyone is right there in the house). Or how about at some point it turned into evil dead and a zombie was driving a psychopath around on a murder spree against the main characters with absolutely no explanation as to why.
Just horrible. If you're reading this and haven't seen it, don't waste your money. I'm sure it will be streaming soon enough it's just a pile of poop. Even my 11 year old hated it. He said the theater smelled because the movie was so much poop you could smell it. It was that bad.

835,kellylane17,"Disappointing, boring and far too long.",1,9 September 2019,"I never really thought IT was scary as such
a few cheap jump scares but nothing that would give me nightmares, However I do love the story, chapter 1 is enjoyable and I am invested In the characters, so I was excited for chapter 2. However about half an hour in and I felt like I had been sitting there for two hours. Around halfway through, two other people got up and walked out. I seriously considering going with them.I lost all interest in the characters and couldn't have cared less if they all died. I just wanted this film to end. This film is far too long with many scenes that just felt regurgitated from chapter 1.
As others have said the CGI just takes away from the scare factor. And it's just not believable. How you can be scared of penny-wise I just don't know.Don't waste your money going to see this at the cinema. Don't even buy it on DVD. Maybe if you really have nothing better to do and this film is on one of the many streaming sights give it ago.

836,pantelisandreou98,IT is a great time despite some problems,8,12 September 2019,"So.. here we have IT CHAPTER 2. I don't see this as a sequel but as a second part to the story. I'm gonna break it down to positives and negatives.First the positives:
+ The cast is simply magnificent. I mean insanely great casting choices with Bill Hader being the MVP!
(Ranking the losers later)
+ Pennywise is once again so enjoyable to watch, even though he is slightly reduced here, the scenes he is in are very very effective.
+ Most of the forms IT takes are very fun to watch.
+ This one is more darker from the first one.
+ There are also some really funny moments.
+ The introduction to adult losers is so well made.
+ Through the film and mostly in the end there are many heartfelt and emotional moments.Now to the negatives:This part also defers very much tonally, where the first one was very fast paced this one takes the time to develop and unfold. This can make this film feel very long (which it is - i mean it's almost 3 hours for god's sake) with some scenes during the second act being repetitive. They could have done better with some of the scenes there ( or remove some of them) to make the film a little shorter.All that being said about the second act i also think that the team was apart for too long! The losers are meant to be together, that's where the movie was at it's best, they even acknowledge that at some point.Talking about unnecessary scenes, most of the flashbacks serve nothing extra to the story but just being extra to the runtime. There were some flashbacks that were extended deleted scenes from the first movie. I think what could have been interesting was to show flashbacks of the time after they defeated IT for the first time, after the oath they made. By doing that right that could have brought some levity and originality to the story.I know i praised the forms of IT before but some of the special effects were noticeably bad and with a higher budget that this movie has i think they could have done better.One final point. There is a character with a subplot and i think you know who.. that just doesn't do anything in particular here, it's just for the sake of having that character in the movie because it was something major in the book.Overall the movie is a great time and i think it would make a great double feature (the way it's supposed to be seen for me) on halloween nights to come! Just like every adaptation though it has it's faults.7,5/10Ranking adult losers from great to simply good:
* Richie (Bill Hader)
* Eddie (James Ransone)
* Beverly (Jessica Chastain)
* Bill ( James McAvoy)
* Ben (Jay Ryan)
* Mike (Isaiah Mustafa)
* Stanley (Andy Bean)",It Chapter Two

854,wkallao,"A Disappointing, Boring, Uninspired Sequel",4,25 September 2019,"Where do I even begin? This movie is literally terrible. I kid you not.First off, the storyline structure is so messed up. The film is riddled with flashbacks of you Losers from the first film. The issue with that, is because those events took place in the first film, yet we never saw them - we don't care about those flashbacks! You cannot introduce something NEW in this film that supposedly already happened and expect us to care. A huge issue with these flashbacks is that it becomes formulaic. We get a flashback of one of the Losers, then we jump back to present day where they are in that location of the flashback. It's so boring and predictable to watch.Because of this, Pennywiise becomes so overexposed. He is not scary. We see him so much in this film, we are comfortable with him, thus he has no threat anymore. Because a bulk of this film is flashbacks, the main story is incredibly short. Because of the flashbacks and emphasis on that, the Losers don't feel united until the end of the film. We follow them individually, and it isn't interesting.Another issue for this ""horror"" film, is that is isn't scary. It's filled with cheap jumpscares and loud music. That isn't scary! There is creepy imagery, but that is entirely different from being scary.There's so much ill placed comedy, that makes this film appear as if it was meant to be a comedy. It's...embarrassing. This film is tonally EVERYWHERE, and there are really weird, and disorienting editing choices as well.I will praise that this film is beautifully shot, and Jessica Chastain literally carries this film. The ending following the climax is also very sweet.Over all, this is a muddled and disappointing follow up. I don't recommend.",It Chapter Two

There are great scenes in the movie for sure, but the lack of a story and the terrible ending destroy every potentialy intersting concept. Atleast 90 min of this movie are the loosers club just running though the city and having flashbacks. The flashbacks are great scenes on their own, but most of the times add nothing to the story and are not scary, because we know the Charakter will live on. For me the first movie could also be seen as a commentary on bullying and how it affects children. In this movie they defeat pennywise, by bullying him to death. So the massage now is: dont let yourself be bullied, but become the bully. Which i dont agree with. If they cut out about 70 min of this movie it might have been pretty solid.

Adapted from the Stephen King novel, Chapter 2 reaches for an epic conclusion to the story, with mixed results. While it has a lot of laughs and occasionally packs an emotional punch, the film is bloated and overlong. It also commits a cardinal sin of horror films: it's not scary whatsoever.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!Taking place 27 years after the events of the first film, Pennywise has returned to Derry, Maine to terrorize the town and feed on the innocent once again. The Loser's Club, now as full grown adults, must team up one last time to stop Pennywise once and for all. The film follows the adults as they reunite in Derry and form a plan to defeat Pennywise, while also drawing connections to events from the first film, as well as some moments we haven't seen before. While this flashback/flash-forward structure mostly works, and helps the audience to follow certain narrative arcs, it begins to feel tedious after a while.It's important to note that IT: Chapter 2 has some of the strongest casting of any film in recent memory. Not only do the adult counterparts of the Loser's Club bear an uncanny resemblance to the child actors, but they also fully embody the same individual personalities and quirks. The ensemble cast has great chemistry, and they do a fantastic job of selling the humor, the drama, and the heart of the film, even when the odds are against them. Bill Hader brings a majority of the comedic relief, and delivers a lot of levity and fun to many scenes. Bill Skarsgård also triumphs once again as Pennywise, with his creepy voice, quirky humor, and that iconic goofy-but-terrifying smile.The film also has some lovely cinematography and creative use of editing. There are several scene transitions which carry an element from the previous shot into the next, creating surreal effects that give the film a dreamlike quality.It's a shame that other components of this film don't hold together as well. While the script attempts to tackle some of the mythology and themes of trauma from the book, the results are mixed. Certain character arcs feel more resolved than others, and the film gets sidetracked at times. Henry Bowers is revealed to have become a patient in a mental hospital after the events of the first film. Pennywise helps him to escape, and while he does temporarily throw a wrench in our protagonists' story, this subplot doesn't really go anywhere, coming to an abrupt end when he's suddenly killed by Richie.The structure of the second act repeats one of the biggest flaws of the first installment, trudging through one lengthy jump-scare sequence after another. These set-pieces generally follow the same structure: a character walks into a building where a past memory took place. They then begin to relive that memory until Pennywise twists it into a nightmare, resulting in some goofy CGI monster which chases the character until they retrieve their ""artifact"". Some of these sequences are fun, but they could easily be shown in any order since they lack an overarching narrative momentum. The scares are so blatantly telegraphed that they often fall flat. Loud noises are startling and all, but none of these creatures come anywhere close to nightmare fuel.Once our leads finally have what they need to defeat Pennywise, they journey back into the sewers to perform a ritual to kill Pennywise for good. While the final battle is entertaining, it's also underwhelming considering the lengthy buildup. While it's satisfying to see our heroes defeat Pennywise for good this time, it simply takes too long to get there.Despite being uneven and needlessly long, IT: Chapter 2 is still entertaining and there's a lot to admire about it. It looks amazing, it's packed with great performances, and it has one of the most intruiging villains in horror history. With more liberal editing and a tighter script, IT: Chapter 2 could have been the masterpiece that it clearly strived to be.6.5/10",It Chapter Two
869,JNowak1999,Still a Good Sequel Nonetheless.,8,27 September 2020,"I first saw this a while after it originally came out in theaters, and I was rather Shocked at how the passing years in film took place. It basically takes place 27 years after the events of Fall 1989 with Pennywise being defeated by the losers and with all 7 of them coming together a long time after that event took place. But much to our surprise, the producers pretty much took the original IT a little bit too serious as Stanley Uris is once again, seen missing from the group. But unlike the original, Stanley goes AWOL from the group by simply (CENSORED). Yeah, you'll know what happened if you watch this.I'll admit that I did get confused at the plot points describing at how IT was basically an Extraterrestrial, not like ET from 1982. Not to mention, the climax of the fight against Spider-Penny was something that really shook me with all sorts of disappointment. I got real confused at how that turned out. All the losers had to say was (CENSORED) to defeat Pennywise once and for all.But all in all, the plot may get freaky and the Timeframe is rather long, clocking it at more than 2.5 Hours.

The final confrontation is amazing, I was not disappointed with it at all, the giant spider from the original TV miniseries as a huge disappointment but the monster for this film is AMAZING.

Unfortunately, that just didn't happen. Like the miniseries the adults are just not compelling. It's easy to believe a child will be scared of a clown, not so much an adult. Stephen King understood this. That's why his novel keeps switching back and forth between timelines, so you don't get that bored feeling. Unfortunately, both the miniseries and the movie separates the stories into just 2 timelines. Chapter 1, the kids. Chapter 2, the adults. What's worse, they made the most boring half of the series almost THREE HOURS LONG. It was long, pretentious and just NOT scary at all.

Whether it's the fact the adult versions of the original child cast don't quite gel right (bar Bill Hader's adult Ritchie), the laughable and none frightening scares, the ropey CGI or the unnecessary changing of the books canon, the film falls way short of it's predecessor in every possible way. Kudos though to Hader and Skarsgard for their performances and the odd funny moment that does creep in.

875,KahlilHerring,IT was a worthy sequel,9,7 September 2019,"The Horror in this movie is untraditional so that, for one, is going to turn a lot of people off. I didn't read the book so I can't compare, but I can tell it came off of the book's page because of how the events were transpiring in the movie.
For a NEARLY 3 hour movie, I never felt bored, pacing never dragged, though in the final act things did kick into high gear, but we didn't lose any info while it was happening. As for all the effects I genuinely jumped more than a few times (Dolby Cinema), though I found Pennywise more horrific in the first one.
The only main thing I can complain about is letting the characters have their own adult lives, we saw them AS adults but they revert back to their childlike mentalities. I just wish we learned more about THEIR lives, so they could've added character, the movie mostly drew off of flashbacks.
Other than that, dialogue, acting, were above average, script is the only thing that was ok. But of course the cast elevated it.Really an 8/10 but I'm evening out the rating.",It Chapter Two

I felt like there was so much in the movie to recap the audience on everything that happened in Chapter 1 that I wondered why the producers even decided to split the adaptation into two parts.What also frustrates me is how much time we spent watching each Loser confront their respective demons. The jump scares lost their effect after a while since each character's personal journey followed the same path.The friendship of the Loser Club is what makes the movie worth watching. It's most enjoyable when the characters are having fun with each other and expressing their love for one another and their history. Actually, the movie is more funny than it is scary.Chapter 2 isn't as great as Chapter 1, but the heart of The Losers Club makes it still worth watching.",It Chapter Two

It can be a tough act to follow when you've already created one good movie and you're up against the reputation of a well-known series and novel, but they absolutely did it in my opinion.

Speaking frankly, I really wish they developed Eddie into a man who overcame his hypochondriac behavior as he got older. I mean that's a personal preference, as everyone else did have some development in terms of when they got older and each ones backstory for the 27 year hiatus( which i do wish had more depth but the movie was already 3 hours... so what can I ask for?). As per someone I spoke with, if this movie was split into 2 where we saw some character development and lead up then the last movie was the actual fight...

I was however surprised to see some really terrible CGI at times considering the high budget, but most of the CGI is fine, possibly too much CGI. Bill Hader steals this movie for me, as a fan of his comedic performances I was skeptical he could pull this off, but he did 10 times over. Brilliantly cast, and brilliantly executed. People who are complaining that this wasn't scary enough needs to notice this movie on IMDB is listed ""Drama, Fantasy, Horror"" in that order.

The story is incredibly incoherent and the usually fantastic James McAvoy's constant overacting is absolutely cringeworthy. The rest of the cast are equally poor and the script apart from the occasional one liner from Bill Hader is dreadful. The CGI 10 foot naked granny was an abomination and not in a good way. The hastily put together flash back scenes (clearly shot after the original movie) with clear CGI on the kids who have now of course aged, was rubbery and tough to look at. The long drawn out ending was completely over the top and self serving. I mean we have only known these characters from one movie but the last 20 minutes was rolled out as if we had a huge emotional development toward each one of them. Every ""scare"" was more ridiculous than the last. The scene in the Chinese restaurant at the start with the half baby spider coming out of the fortune cooking was embarrassing. Within 10 minutes you can tell how awful this movie is going to be and it doesn't get any better. If they somehow pull a 3rd movie out of this, which I assume will be based 54 years ago, then they need to change each and every member of the crew that worked on this utter shambles of a film.

Pennywise was hardly in the movie. He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite. This one, I definitely should've waited until it came out on DVD. Just being honest. The first one was way to good for this to be part 2.

This movie is two hours and fifty minutes long! That's long enough to be split into two separate movies.If I'm being honest, a lot of things feel completely pointless, like Bowers. He stabs Eddy in the face and dies. That's it. Completely pointless character that did not need to be in the movie at all.They split up the characters for 90 minutes in the middle for each of them to get their token and experience a nightmare. They already experienced the ""it's not real"" nightmare before at the restaurant, so I don't know why they acted so scared and surprised when Pennywise scared them with illusions again.The little kid at the Chinese restaurant was pointless. Phil follows him around for a while, only to have him be killed off anyways like the girl in the beginning. Not really necessary.They also included a bunch of homophobic characters, because everyone that's not a main character in a Stephen King movie is a dick. A man gets beaten to death at the beginning for being gay and Pennywise eats him in the river, but neither of them reappear, making them also pointless.It's also got your standard Stephen King cliches like the writer, the drinker, the scaredy cat, the commit, the unexplain psychic power that a character has, and so forth.TLDR: This is the first movie done wrong.",It Chapter Two

And there's also a reason why the film is 2 hours, 50 minutes long is because it's the final chapter, the book IT itself is a big long book.

917,vlsummacumlaude,Proves That Less is More,4,5 April 2021,"I really enjoyed Chapter 1 and looked forward to Chapter 2. Sadly, as others have said, Chapter 2 was a major disappointment. The film was indeed too long and felt disjointed, unlike the finely tuned Chapter 1. The casting was good, but the acting was lackluster; the ubiquity of jump scares became repetitive and boring.But, for me, two things became especially apparent: That perhaps the nostalgia of Chapter 1 worked well with the cultural elements of the 1986 novel, and should have therefore been a stand alone (albeit incomplete) retelling of It. On the other hand, Chapter 2 could have been a truly terrifying and thought provoking film had it been more somber and psychological. For instance, Gen X'ers haven't had the economic or cultural success of Baby Boomers. Thus the cycle of fear could have been more aptly established by having far less financially/professionally successful characters return to their meager beginnings, and by weaving their current anxieties with their past ones. (This would have of course required changing King's story, but adaptations like the Shining prove that doing so is sometimes best).I also found the backstory of It to be lackluster. I didn't need to know what It was or how It came to be; It as an enigmatic figure would have been far scarier. The denouement of mocking It to death was also absurd and didn't do the story justice.",It Chapter Two

The second trailer looked intense.The week of release reviews were split, some enjoyed it while others left disappointed. This made me nervous going in, wondering if it would fall short.I left the theater pleased in the end. I enjoyed the film and time with friends. We all left laughing and chattered about our favorite moments in the following days. Honestly, I would like to see it again.That being said, was Chapter Two Academy Award worthy? No. Is it Razzie worthy? Absolutely not. Enjoyable is the word that comes to mind. One review I read mentioned said if there were a category in the Academy Awards for the casting director, they would deserve it, and yes, I wholeheartedly agree with that statement.The casting in this movie is excellent. The adult actors nailed their parts, and it was complimented well by supporting performances from the child actors. Humor is tastefully placed throughout the film, offering levity at the right moments.Of all the adult actors, Bill Hader deserves recognition. Seeing an SNL alum handle a more serious role so well is great to see. Some SNL actors just can't shake the shackles of being a comedy actor, but Hader successful blends humor with seriousness.Admittedly, I went in believing Chapter Two would turn it up notch when it comes to the creep factor, but it didn't. IT (2017) is certainly the scarier of the two, which disappointed me.At times, the film can feel a little crammed, maybe. The film couldn't focus on each character for proper development, even though it was about 3 hours long. However, the film colors in the background with added footage filling out the child side of the story, and for once IT's origins are touched on, even briefly.The finale was better than the miniseries, but let's be honest, those of us who have seen it know there was nowhere to go but up.In the end, Chapter Two is an enjoyable film with excellent casting and charismatic actors/actresses.

Gone is the realness of decent horror-film making that seperated Chapter One from the rest because it stayed true to keeping it practical in the effects department. Use only CGI IF NEEDED..
Chapter two takes it the easy way out. By cheap i mean lazy routes. not expensive, because this WAS way more expensive to make because Chapter Two relies TOO MUCH on CGI. Skarsgård felt underused and backset in his role. And you got cheap and ineffective jump-scares that 99.9% of most horror movies fails with today.Besides, it was two long, and felt dragged out with a mediocre ending (but that is okay because the Curry version ending sucked too)The cast is stellar though.

Also, I still haven't seen the first ""It"" movie, so I went in hoping that everything previous of which I was not aware would be self-explanatory! Largely, through flashbacks, it was! I learned that this film was directed by Andy Muschitta, who had previously directed Ms. Chastain in a very good horror film called ""Mama"", so I felt confident that I was in for a good cinematic experience! For about the first hour and a half, I was: the story was involving, and the film was quite well-made up to this point! Unfortunately, it went on for what seemed like the most interminable additional hour in the history of time! Attempts to make what should've stayed a small, tightly-woven tale into a forever escalatingly epic scarefest greatly diminished the effectiveness of the story! There were enough good performances and good moments to recommend the story to any horror fan, but, Mother of God, if ever there was a movie in dire need of editing, it would be ""It Chapter Two""! And that's a real shame! In trying too hard to wow its audience, the film instead ultimately burns a lot of the creative good will generated by its infinitely better first half!",It Chapter Two
929,Jo-Cino,I Fell For It Again!!!,4,11 September 2019,"This ""IT"" series has somehow created a world where there are no rules, no logic and the writers can do whatever they want without supplying answers, no matter how badly you will crave them.Nothing makes sense here; sometimes it's a dream, sometimes it's real(?) - sometimes they are dreaming yet pulling things out from the dream into reality... all without any explanation or reasoning to when it is one or the other... easily the most frustrating 'horror' series to watch if you want a solid story line.Another frustrating thing about this movie is that IT IS what IT IS because of the clown, Pennywise, yet, he is incredibly under-used in this movie for some reason. It seems they save his most screen time for the end of the movie when the 'fit hits the shan', but he's not really even Pennywise at that point, it's just some CGI Pennywise hybrid.The jump scares were easy to identify, especially if you are just half-way seasoned to the horror genre. The run-time was indeed long, but i don't think the complaint about run time is just that it's long - i'm fairly certain people would have no problem with run time it if the story itself was more airtight.Trust me, i'm taking it very easy on this movie... there's so much more to shred.** SPOILERS **
so, after all that, i haven't even touched on the end... that.. ridiculous, RIDICULOUS ending. (The running joke with mcavoy's character and how ""the ending wasn't good"" is very fitting for this movie and serves as foreshadowing.... typical stephen king)As they outlined earlier in the movie, the creature of IT was cast as an ancient curse that has survived thousands of years and with that, it would take a ritual of sorts to defeat this mighty creature... but hold everything... that would only make a LITTLE bit of sense and we have already established, LOGIC is no place for a clown movie like IT... no, no, nothey literally spent ninety minutes of the film gathering things from their childhood JUST for this ritual to NOT work - BUT, fear not - as it turns out - all anyone needed to do ALL these years was some good old fashioned name calling and the IT would go away.. and not only be defeated, but be defeated very meekly and easily... ""You're Just A Clown! You're Just A Clown!"" they would yell and in doing so, the mighty Pennywise shrunk aaalllll the way down to the size of a baby.seriously... they call him names for maybe...90 seconds.. and just like that, the horror is all over! this is how Pennywise dies - for good!JUST. SO. DUMB!!!Look, if the idea is to be entertained, then you will be entertained if nothing else because the cast itself is WAY too good to not appreciate on screen - Hader, McAvoy, Skarsgard and Chastain are terrific - but there's no surprises there and honestly, that's also what makes this movie even more disappointing - you had this amazing ensemble of talent and you gave them THIS weak story and this even worse ending.... if you are going to watch this movie, enjoy the performances because it's all you're gonna get... it's also the only reason i rated this movie a 4 and not a 3.",It Chapter Two

Filled with cheap scares and really really bad writing. It was hard to believe that it is from the same team of people (especially the director) who made the first one. I am a big fan of the first one and was really looking forward to a worthwhile closing. But man, was it awful. I considered the first one a true horror movie, but this one was just over-the-top. Spiders bursting out of heads (which reminded me of the Evil Dead movies) and all those ridiculous looking CGI monsters appearing again and again. Just an overkill. And what the heck, is it even a horror movie anymore? Apparently not. It is a horror comedy, again like Evil Dead. People behind us laughing continuously. Example, that three doors scene in Pennywise's house? The same house scared the heck out of me in the first one. But in this one, it was funny rather than scary. Such a let down.",It Chapter Two

I initially thought Bill Hader would play his part to comedic and be out of place but I thought he was one of the best performers. Although this was a film for the adults, the kids didn't get much screen time and what scenes they did get felt more like a nostalgia trip than flashbacks. The film definitely lacks what made the first film so good because of this.The film itself it a bit of a let down after the intensity of part one but they only had the source material to work with so they can't be blamed for not living up to the previous film.The ending sucks, but we all knew that!",It Chapter Two
932,raghu-mktg84,Spine-Chilling!,8,16 November 2019,"""Swear... Swear if It isn't dead... if It ever comes back... we'll come back, too"" said Bill in the closing frames of Chapter 1 to his fellow Losers Club mates, in Sep'1989. The Urban Legend at Derry said It will be back once every 27 years and we always knew It is going to be back again to haunt us on screens and in our dreams. It is Sep'2016 and Pennywise is back!Bill, Beverly, Ben, Richie, Eddy and Stan - the members of Losers Club back in 1989, all lead a life far away from Derry, in a hope to put back the horrible memories and move on for better. One fine day, they all receive a call from Mike, another member of the club who chose to stay back at Derry. The moment they hear him talk, they all could feel the chills already and they know It is back. Bound by the blood swear they made 27 years ago, they all have no choice but to get to Derry immediately to stop the Clown from taking more lives. Stan alone is not able to face It once again and commits suicide before even he could get there. Mystery unfolds at Derry when Mike convinces the rest on a ritual that needs to be performed by all of them to destroy It once for all. The only condition- each member needs to go alone and collect an artifact from their past that needs to be placed in the ancient pottery. In pursuit of the artifact, each one sets course separately just to experience more and more horror inflicted by Pennywise before they could collect it. Whether the Losers were able to succeed in their mission, is the rest of the plot.IT stands unique in what it offers in comparison to other horror genres. While Conjuring, Insidious, Annabelle etc have their equally fair share of spine-chilling moments, IT also gets on to one psychologically. The very fact that It targets children and takes them in the most gruesome way possible makes us subconsciously detest what's about to come in the next to next frames. Also the graphic content that is shown on screens cannot be unseen for so many nights. While most of the Losers are shown to have moved on, Andy Muschietti (Director) has subtly driven the point that nothing gets away from the clutches of the curse, by showing that they are only going through the same at a different place. Bill, is still caught up in the mystery of what happened to Georgie and turns up as a mystery writer. Beverly escaped an abusive father only to get stuck with an abusive husband. Eddie moved away from his mom's control, just to get controlled by his wife all time. Stan as always is never courageous enough to confront. Mike never left Derry. Richie used his loud mouth and foul language for better. The only person who has actually become better and stronger is Ben, who has lost weight and is an architect now. The detailing given to every character and how they confront their fears makes the movie run longer and longer. Except for that, IT Chapter 2 delivers what it promised.",It Chapter Two

Based on that alone, I could have given this movie 2 out of 10 stars. There is no excuse for the downright ugly parts of the script and the lack of being able to make any emotional connection with the audience while the movie obviously required it.The only aspects in which this movie shined (a little bit) is the acting which was decent (Yes! Decent, not good!) and the possitive character development, which probably came as a surprise to most reviewers.The very ending of the movie, which I am not going to spoil in my review, had a nice little twist to it and COULD have changed my overall opinion about the movie when walking out of the theater.Overall, it doesn't really matter, there was nothing in the movie that makes it worth watching a second time.

It ends up being a big mash up of good potentials being wasted. It has a great cast, a great idea, a great concept of a movie, but it does not have any clue on how to do it properly. If it were to be a trully mesmerizing horror movie, it should've went to more acting, less CGI, less jokes. Instead, they tried to put it all together and the result is...well...

Not readable awfulness with paper characters who are characterized with childish psychology, all written with a thin language full of colloquialisms and absolutely unnecessary descriptions of products from the era, which are placed to suggest that the author has done extensive research - when in reality he has rather an obsessive compulsive disorder that forces him to remember such unattractive details as a kind of upholstery in the most popular Dodge Chellengare Hemi from 1979 or name most popular Video Games from late 80s.
Eventually he was then just another nerd spending time in his imaginary worlds full of this kind of details. Anyway it's not that King had flash of genius this time, absolutely no, no no, I have seen other versions of IT - and it is totally usual stuff from Kings menu. This time director, art director, director of photography and actor who plays IT made the difference! They really have done amazing job with this material. This IT is beautifully shoot - also postproduction is really awesome. The clown is amazing, you can actually feel his hunger- crawlings for blood of his pray! Check especially two scenes first with Georgie when IT bites his arm off and second with little girl called Vicky! It will show you our old beloved Pennywise at his (his? I should write - it's) best.The stars are given to Skasgard for his IT creation.

Was very creepy, and MUCH better than the first part which I think was finding its feet. Everybody panned the alien spider in the miniseries, but with a bigger budget, essentially Pennywise's true form is just a fancier version which to be honest is the most accurate way of showing him (our puny minds can never properly see IT, only what the mind interprets), so vindicates the original mini series somewhat, maybe will be rewatched and reappraised?

961,justinleblanc59,IT was Fantastic,9,6 September 2019,"When the Stephen King's 'IT' remake came out in 2017, it had much to live up to, - just given the way King's films are potrayed, it hd to live up to the thirll like his other flms have done, while remaining true to it's origins as well as book portions - which it did - I gave IT 8/10 previously.Casting -The kids in chapter one were stellar - and the casting director was spot in with the choices that he made to select the high school kids to face the crazed clown.This film was no different. not only did the casting director pick five adults who portrayed the resemblance of the young kids very well, but also casted 5 'adult' characters that complemented each other on screen very well.It literally felt like they were the same kids 27 years ago growing up in the small town of Berry - I don't think there has been a film to depict such a great resemblance in all the movies i have seen with a continuous story attached to it.The fight back -The 27 year return to the small town felt like a smoothe transition for the viewers and I at least felt that these kids who had seemingly 'defeated' Pennywise before could do it again. i felt every fear that these grown adults now were facing to face the crazed clown.The 'token' segments even gave us more inside stories to what happened when they were kids adding even more depth the film's story and built up the ultimate showdown of why these kids must defeat the pennywise - who'm they have been fearing this whole time.-The film really thought of everything to add to, to make the smoothe transition towards the final battle between the now older kids. Everything just meshed so perfectly together.The only downfall I would say is how the kids from Berry had figured out how to defeat him - no spoilers here , but at first I felt with what the writers came up with , was a tad bit dull - but then you have to actually think about the given message in the film, as to why it worked , and why it hadn't worked before.The messages might seem clear to some , and not clear to others - but I am not spoiling it just for the fact I would want you to get that satisfaction of figuring it out yourself - within that given message the defeat of the clown makes sense , and although , the final battle scene could have had a few minor tweaks here and there, it ultimately wasn't too bad, it still worked.#DurationThe length of the film is nearly 3 hours and although some might be complaining about that - it honestly needed to be. The film flowed so perfectly and kept me intrigued for the entire time - It had to be that long because there was so much they needed to add, and they added the right segment to conclude the IT series. The writing was superb and excellentRating: 9/10 - It had everything you could ask for - the adults were just as funny as the kids were / the chemistry was there all the same / the resemblances to the younger versions were spot on / there was actually some jump off moments, although predictable on some occasions, it still was brilliantly done.I also did watch this in IMAX so it added some extra fright with the sound fx and music, but oh by gawd , i paid full price for this film, and honestly i would have paid double (maybe... thats a lot of money for a film - would definitely pay it for both films together)Really enjoyed the film and its a definite buy when it comes out.Watch the first one on Netflix because you honestly have to get the origin story and then go watch this ASAP , you wont be disappointed.-",It Chapter Two

The horror stems more from the themes than any suspenseful tension. The chemistry of the cast was a bit off too, almost as though during production something went awry, or maybe it was simply weak points in the script. The ""romance"" between Ben and Beverly, totally flat. The dialogue among them was just rehash of the poem and a forced connection. Jessica Chastain I felt was one of the weakest characters. Her performance came off as kinda just being there and at no point did I truly buy she was her younger self from the first film. That's not to say she completely bombed, but it is what it is.

All the separate components are amazing, but as a whole? Not so much. Yes, the casting is amazing, costumes and make up departments did great, the direction an sich is great too. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise does a fantastic job, but the movie never gets scary, at all.
Some things I don't get at all. What does the old woman dancing naked in the background add? I think it was supposed to be a creepy scene, but this just made it funny. Same with Richies jokes. Yes, Bill Hader has incredible talent, but here it just ruined the movie for me.
When I go to a horror movie I want to be scared, to get this uncomfortable feeling, like you do get when watching the Shining for example, or the Haunting of Hill house, wich also mastered this. And let's not forget about Alfred Hitchcock.
It chapter two didn't just lach in horror elements it also took too long. At some point I was just trying to look at my watch in the theater to check how much longer I needed to endure this movie. A lot of scenes just dragged on and took way too long, Bill reaching for Georgie in the sewer e.g. That just took way too long, we all know what's going to happen, so just let it!Overall, I had a good laugh during some of the movie, but it took too long and for a horror movie it just wasn't scary at all.",It Chapter Two
972,kaspergordon,It could have been so much more.,7,22 January 2020,"It is my favorite book of all times - I've gone trough it around 4 times, plus most of Kings other work, at least once. I've all ways hoped for a proper adaption, since the TV miniseries adaption, just a had too little budget, too little time to tell the books all most 1200 pages, and had to be toned to much down for TV.The way I all ways hoped for the adaption to happen, was like a modern TV series, like an HBO show or something. Perhaps just one season with around 10 to 12 episodes. Since even with both this movie and Chapter One combined, there's still much that they had to change or leave out, so much character development, so many great scenes, esential world building and exposition, they couldn't include in just two movies.Hopefully it will happen one day.
And hopefully sooner than later.
Even though they clearly did their best on these two movies, and you could tell a lof of the involved people, actually cared abouth the book and how the film turned out, it is still far from the ultimate adaptation of It, that a lot King fans have been dreaming of for years.Hopefully a new adapted series could then be set in the 50's and 80's like in the book, and be a scene for scene adaptation, that is more faithful and accurate to the book, instead of them mostly coming up with their own subplots, scenes, scares and incarnations of It, that more or less all were just downgrades and too different from how IT manifested itself in the book.Though Andy Muschietti supposedly IS working on a supercut of the movie, where he will combine both the first and the second movie along with deleted scenes and allegedly even a few new ones, shot for this version.If this really happen, then I really hope it will be intercut between the scenes with kids and the grownups, right from the beginning, like in the book.
Though a 6 to 7 hour combined cut of these two movies spliced together, still far from will be enough, to cover all of the book - a handful of extended and unseen/new scenes added to what we all ready have, still just isn't adequate, no matter how good this added material will end up being.But until a 10 to 12 hour adaptation finally is made one day, this is probably our best hope until then.Even though these two movies, have a lot of good things about them, like great editing, a great cast, especially for the kids, nice coloring, nice looking cinematography, okay music and good settings (Derry in particular is greatly captured), there's still a lot of issues the rumored super-cut may still have a chance to fix - though I guess a lot of it is hard to change by now, unless they decide, to do a rather extensive post production on this said supercut.But hopefully, they can tone the humor down a lot, the humor, wasn't as cringe-worthy in the first chapter, it was mostly just smart remarks and banter between the kids, that seemed rather natural.
But in the second chapter, they turned the humor up way too much, and made it too forced and self aware. Which doesn't fit such a dark and epic tale, or an R-rated horror movie in general.If they're going to shoot new scenes with Bill Skarnsgaard, I hope they're going to show a bit more of It's appearances as Penywise, when he's more aggressive, demonic, menacing and and mean-spirited in this jolly clownish comedian sort of way, like in the book. Even though Bill often did a great job with one hell of a screen presence, he was more than often too childlike, more like a weird creepy stalker in a clownsuit kind of way, that never really was described in the book - where it comes off more of this eternal interdimensional being, that thinks it's portraying a comedic human clown, and basically is overdoing it, with out it knowing it itself.Hopefully this cut, will also cut away, with all these ""shaking-camera-distorted-screaming-monster-clown-jumping-at-the-camera""-takes. Or just use it once, at best. They felt so forced, and, just took you out of the creepy atmosphere they were trying to build, plus the clown never gets any of the kids in these shots anyway, they could just cut to the kids running, they should be scared enough anyway, with out this type of forced modern trope, just played for cheap jump scares - the true horror lies in the tone and atmosphere anyway.Maybe they could even re-shoot some of the CGI shots - which is one of my biggest issues with the film. I mean, the scene with George in the beginning, is just so effective and well done, until Penywise gets turned into this fake looking videogame monster-clown, that looks more fun than scary and you out of the mood. A bit of ekstra creepy clown-makeup, some nasty prosthetic yellow sharp teeth, and a couple of yellow evil eye-lenses, on some guy that goes into beast-mode and bites into a child arm in a yellow raincoat, would make this so much more disturbing, effective and evil. They don't even have to use Skarnsgaard again for something like, since It is all ready changing it's appearance and looking different, and they could just cut back to when George is crawling away from the sewer again.A lot of the fake CGI stuff, could get fixed up this way, especially scenes when they distort Penywises face to this CGI videogame face, were it looks more comical than scary - just replace the face on Penywise in these scenes (that's a cheap thing to do), with some creepy guy, with evil makeup and prosthetic instead, and even it it out with good editing of the existing material.Though this won't cover up all the CGI in the movie, it will help make the overall experience of such a supercut way more effective and feel more real.Never the less, I really hope to see this supercut soon. AT least to hold us over, until the greatest book ever written, gets the adaptation it deserves one day, in a 10 to 12 hour and more faithful to novel kind of way.
I mean, if they could do it with a book with a book like The Haunting of Hill House on Netflix, then IT definitely deserves this too - even if they've just made this flawed, semi unfaithful, but still somewhat okay and well meant attempt, that still could have been way worse.",It Chapter Two

Without intelligent storytelling and without the correct atmosphere, an horror movie becomes just a noisy collage of frames.
After a decent first act, recurring jump-scares and cliches (lots (LOTS) of them) make you get tired of this film. It's a 3 hour loop of ""guy walking alone in town. guy sees something creepy. guy gets scared (even though it's clear for him/her that the situation not real). Clown shows teeth and makes loud noises. Clown stops the attack abruptly"".
At the end, the hope of an epic final battle vanishes with the anti-climatic solution that they could have figured out since the first part.

Henry Bowers had a brief cameo, honestly I don't know why he was even kept in the sequel for the little involvement he had. Pivotal scenes, like Stanley's death, were rushed or poorly handled. And for being a film at 2 hours and 40 mins, I felt that they did too much and not enough at the same time. I loved the adult actors in this film, they matched the younger actors quite well, they had modern technology at their disposal and an immense book to diligently pull material from and it just fell short of mediocre. They could've made Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 and really emphasized on the horrors they experienced as a kids, and then amp up the horror as adults. Aside from the Lumberjack scene and Stanley spider head... I did not get a horror vibe - AT ALL. The whimsical music also took so much from the film, as if they were in a world full of delight and wonder; it made no sense. As a Rated R film, they really held back.

987,andrealeonti,'IT' is a really bad movie.,4,13 September 2019,"Among the most anticipated films by the ""mass"" public in the world of cinema there was certainly IT - Chapter II, the final segment of the reinterpretation of the homonymous masterpiece by Stephen King by the Argentine director Andrés ""Andy"" Muschietti.Let's start from the assumption that those who have read (like me) and loved King's novel live seraphic with the knowledge that we will never see on screen anything that can even get near the famous novel: it's true, this often happens for every film transposition originated from bestsellers, but for IT it's an even more affirmed discourse, given the complexity and the bulk of the work, but (above all) given the presence of much more devastating scenes than any sequence proposed in the derivative cinematographic works.Starting, instead, from the end, if a horror movie (or presumed one) gets to make you laugh and get you out of the room indifferent and not ""disturbed"" there is something wrong with it.And in fact, to say it all, in IT 2 there are many things that are not good at all.Muschietti sins of excessive complacency towards himself and makes a film on the edge of ridicule: I cannot decide where to start from, and trust me it's difficult because in this film there are too many things that are wrong, so much banal and unlikely to arouse laughter among the public. The technical and directorial execution is not disputable (and God forbid, with all that budget) but Muschietti's direction has no soul. Blanda, insipid and austere: in almost three hours of film (THREE HOURS) there is not a single sequence, a single machine pass, a single roundup or shot that makes you awaken, now from torpor, now from laughter, and arouse in you attention or particular appreciation for the cinematographic ""eye"" by which the director has decided to tell his story.Here, another problem, the story: Muschiett's IT does not convey the minimum of malice or ruthlessness that transpires, instead, from the novel, it's rather a psychopathic self-centered clown with personality disorders who enjoys becoming now an horny mummy who tries to make out with Eddie Kaspbrak, now a Pomeranian dog (yes!), and that enjoys, repeatedly and always according to the same reiterated scheme, to blow up helpless young children and turn them into blood-hydrants for pure personal quirk.Third problem: SPECIAL EFFECTS. Here I really do not know where to start, a shameless and almost criminally liable use of CGI (which is however badly done). Thanks to the magical art of computer graphics, IT has lot of fun switching from one embarrassing creature (and to the limit of the comic) to another: first a mummy with a two meter tongue that begins to vomit on Eddie Kaspbrak on an improbable Dirty-Dancing-style music , then a nice old lady who after a few seconds of total paralysis (which would have made me run away as fast as I can) decides to bake some cookies for the poor Beverly Marsh completely naked (of course, right?). Stuff worthy of the best (or worst) comedies.(Few) Strength points: good actorial play and a always hilarious Richie Tozier whose caustic humor always tears a smile (but will never make you laugh like IT becoming a pomeranian dog).Big Love for the short but fantastic (especially for the ""aficionados"") cameo of the Master Stephen King, even if, if I had been in him, rather than making the appearance I would have sued Muschietti and the artistic crew, requesting the sentence to forced labor and the radiation from the world of cinema.In conclusion: an embarrassing film, in the full sense of the word, a film that does not scare and that makes you laugh very much. Well, actually, the only thing this movie makes you want to do is to look for Muschietti and ask him to refund you your ticket.",It Chapter Two

990,meanmrslinky,"A Long, Underwhelming, Gory Mess",4,26 September 2019,"It: Chapter Two disappoints in continuing the engrossing story of Pennywise the Clown terrorizing the town of Derry. Being just under a lengthy three hours, the film packs a fair amount of unnecessary and boring sequences. It relies too heavily on visuals, rather than building a real sense of foreboding and suspense. There are many scenes where it feels more like a dark comedy, rather than a film that is supposed to frighten viewers. There are some memorable moments, but unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good in the end.The film offers an excellent cast, very much resembling the younger Losers. You can easily see who is who right from the beginning. These actors were able to deliver the liveliness and humor of their younger selves, which worked very well. This may be one of Bill Haders best performances. The young versions of the Losers also make an appearance in the film. They too deliver a solid performance, much like they did in the first chapter.One of my biggest problems with this movie was the overuse of CGI, and the expected jump scare in every other scene. It was too predictable, and did not deliver one truly horrifying scene. You see Pennywise in many different forms, but not one of them is as frightening as the clown form. With that being said, Bill Skarsgård was underutilized. His natural ability to portray Pennywise was overshadowed by giant screaming CGI dummies with bobbling heads.There's an ongoing joke throughout the film that foreshadows the insipid ending. This is likely referring to Stephen King himself, as he has been known to make monotonous endings to overall adequate stories. This happens to be one of those stories. Rather than altering the ending, they make fun of it, which just comes off as lazy. Perhaps they were trying to play it safe, but it failed nonetheless. What brings Pennywise to his knees in the end is utterly disappointing, and quite pathetic. Fans deserved a better ending. Sorry, Stephen.If you're looking for a well written and scary sequel to follow the first chapter of It, you will be let down. Though there are some fun and enjoyable moments thanks to the talented cast, it does not make up for the inconsistencies and lazy story telling. The shockingly horrifying and successful triumph that was It: Chapter One should have had a better second half.",It Chapter Two

At two hours fifty minutes, it could easily lose an hour's running time with little difficulty - a generic 'getting the gang back together' riff being one of the chief offenders. It drags so much, that by the time the final hour or so rolls around, I was just tired. It's a pretty diverting final hour, but it too is needlessly extended.

The climax was actually funny. There were no moments where I closed my eyes or get shocked which I generally do in a horror film.

The only scene I enjoyed in the film was the scene with the old woman-and even that was ruined because the entire scene played out in the trailer. Worst, the movie wasn't even scary. CGI trickery.

But Pennywise was great. I still find him creepy. IT chapter 1 came around and is better. At least in terms of the story it told. More from the book was included and that is always welcome. Even the changes were good and the comedic lines and personalities of the Losers gave it its own flavor. Skarsgard made Pennywise his own and did a great job. Overuse of CGI is what ruined the horror/creepy factor in certain scenes of Chapter 1 and there was certainly no exception for chapter 2.Chapter 2 had great buildups that fell flat because of CGI. They tried to recreate what they did in Chapter 1 with the characters as kids, especially Eddie. It felt forced and a little too much comedy for a horror film. Many people dislike the length of the film and think they spent too much time on getting the viewer reacquainted with each character. I disagree, being a fan of the book, I was engulfed with their stories.Overall IT Chapter 2 is alright and it's a movie I will see again in the future eventually.

1008,djmichaelangelo-34810,bad decisions by the film-makers,1,23 September 2019,"Okay so there were some good parts to this movie, but also some awfully ill-advised things the movie-makers chose to do, which were a deal-breaker for me.The foul language especially near the beginning was a turn-off, and a lazy creative lack of good dialog. Needing to hear the F-word 800 times in 1/2 hour isn't really necessary. I thought I was watching a Quentin Tarrintino movie.Seeing a vicious bloody gay-bashing was disturbing and unnecessarily, the over-the-top brutality of it did nothing for the plot. Seeing that in the first 5 minutes of the film made me, as a gay man, more disturbed and troubled than any of the jumpy scary points later on in the movie.That said, it was a poor judgment call showing 2 gay guys openly kissing each other passionately for a lingering minute shortly after the movie starts. As much as it pains me to say it, some of Middle America is just not ready for that yet. I heard audible groans in the theatre behind me when that scene came on-screen, like bunches of people saying ew; and stuff.Granted this was a backwoods small-town theatre, so lots of ignorance there, but that's one thing Hollywood will never understand in their liberal bubble: they assume 100% of the audience seeing the movie will be totally fine with 2 men kissing on the lips within the first 5 mintues of the flim. The flim-makers just can't comprehend how anyone could ever have a problem with that, but unfortunately even in this day and age, they do. So quit trying to shove that agenda in everyone's face; stick to the movie's plot and important points instead. And yes I realize Adrian and his BF were in the book, I've read it a half-dozen times over the years.The ending was lame too, no surprise there....what, did they insult the spider to death? Kind of anti-climactic. The other thing that made me dislike this film was its length. So indulgent of these Hollywood film-makers, putting out a nearly 3-hour movie (which yes I did know it ahead of time) but it really seemed to drag in certain spots.

I was absolutely dazzled by the first movie's aesthetic design and the dynamic performances of the child actors, glued together by what seemed like genuine friendship in real life. Chapter 1 also followed the novel's story pretty closely, with some adjustments in the interest of showtime and visual impact, which I thought worked well while still capturing the essence of the novel.Sadly, I didn't see any of that in Chapter 2. While the actors were good and Bill Skarsgård once again shined as Pennywise, there were just too many broader flaws that could not be salvaged by performance. Too much time was wasted rehashing what we already understood about the characters. I felt like I was watching a ""discarded scenes"" compilation from Chapter 1, repeatedly shoved into the Chapter 2 storyline. And because of this the adult characters' arcs suffered as well. Surely in 27 years these people would have experienced new fears, passions, and growth. But they all seemed like echoes of the children trapped in adult bodies, with the exact same personalities and fears. I think the creators tried far too hard to copy the success of Chapter 1, without really understanding why it worked. Although the explosive visuals and cute humor worked with the young main characters in the first movie, these things undermined the sequel. I simply did not find it believable that these grown adults' deepest, darkest fears were things like fortune cookie monsters and old lepers and the like.The ending was also extremely disappointing. I was looking forward to this because in the novel, the final battle was a dire, existential battle of determination. This one was a rather deflating and stale one. It turned Pennywise the ""eater of worlds"" into yet another uninspired CGI monster. Seemed like that's where all the extra budget went into, unfortunately.",It Chapter Two
1011,searcherer,The kids did better,7,9 September 2019,"Not that it's bad, it's just that the adult era, if you'd say, was basically a stretching of the attempt to come up with a conclusion of the events in chapter one. All the elements of the novel, both the characters and the concept, were presented in chapter one, while chapter 2 merely turned-off the camera for 27 years, turned it back on, and had the heroes get back to finish a job previously thought over with, without anything new that's genuinely rooted in their lives as adults, all while spending considerable amounts of time glimpsing back on their past experiences and throwing flashbacks of their time as kids that at some point it felt like the idea of this second chapter was not really as a continuation of the first, but rather an attempt, and not a successful one at that, to apparently try and reflect on it, while at the mean time reliving the same kinds of horrors again, up to the point where they finally re-battle again and the nightmare would be over for good. I think this second chapter simply suffered from an attempt to make it more understandable to audience who didn't see the first one, which in a way made it somewhat fall short of expectations for those who did and also resulted in its running time being prolonged, my opinion.That said, the movie is scary - though not as much as the first - and is technically excellent. It also delivers a nice conclusion where what has been seemingly a physical challenge that couldn't feel more tangible or real is cracked down by realizing and confronting the essence of its existence, our fear.",It Chapter Two

It just wasn't worth the money.I thought it was just the exact same as the first one but longer and more boring. The film felt like it was being dragged out. There was a few one liners from Bill Hader's character Richie, but most of them were out of place. James McAvoy's performance was also okay. The CGI in the film ruined it for me because it just wasn't scary or frightening and was quite comic at times.The third act was just a big CGI mess and also went on for too long. I hope they don't make anymore prequels, sequels or whatever in the future because this film was a major let down.",It Chapter Two
1013,amybourque,Another messed up Stephen King movie,7,15 October 2019,"The movie starts off good. As a survivor of domestic violence I cringed during Beverly's opening. But once the monsters came out it was just a farce. The monster under the bed was scary at first. Then when it pulls up in a car and fourth walls the camera it looses all. The old woman was terrifying. When she passed the door I was shaking wondering what was about to happen. What came out of the door was so fake looking I actually considered leaving.
The ending of IT was horrible and not frightening at all. A babydoll clown. Ugh. The lepper was obviously fake and just gross, not scary at all.
The Logger scene was scary. The people in the background was freaky. The clown makeup scene was scary. The jump scenes were overdone. It was a good scare while in the theater but there was no take you home scare. It didn't last past the credits.
The movie was funny. I loved Stephens cameo.
But it was drawn out. The water scene was disappointing because it was going on and on so it made you think something scary was going to happen. The walking through town and seeing their younger selves was an ending. The water scene was an ending. The letter scene was an ending. Three endings is overkill.
I just need to say, Talisman is in production and it's my favorite Stephen King book. If they mess that move up, I will never read anything else or watch any of his movies again.",It Chapter Two

It's cause it isn't what you expect it to be. So lets get it over with right away: This isn't a scary movie. It's not scary, it's not going to give you nightmares, it doesn't even have the jump scares that makes you flinch in your seat.However, it is a movie with unexpectedly strong character arcs. In flashbacks, which are nicely woven into the movie, we see how the characters that seems grown up and successful in their modern selfs are actually stuck in the past. Pennywise feels less like an actual threat, and more like a metaphor of how they're hunted by the destructive and abusive relationships they had with other people in the past. There's also scenes which are downright funny, which also play on the actors chemistry with each other.James Ransone really does a stellar job to portray the slightly neurotic and foulmouthed Eddie, and he steal the show several times. Bill Hader surprised me with his performance and one of the most heartbreakingly bitter-sweet ending scenes I can remember.This is a good movie, but not if you want to be scared.",It Chapter Two

I think the problem with this is the same as the 1990 adaption, the 2nd part is weaker than the first.By no means is that a swipe at the acting or atmosphere of the movie, Bill Hader is tremendous as he always is, James McAvoy is awesome as Bill, Jessica Chastain is brilliant as are the others.But what I find tiresome about this movie is the overuse of CGI, say what you want about the 1990 version but at least it was over reliant on cg. I felt for example Mrs Kersh was a lot scarier in the 1990 version because it was all practical. I'm not completely against CGI but when it is overused it just feels cheap.I like this movie obviously I prefer chapter one but overall a good two parter.",It Chapter Two

1027,MirkoS,Was this intended a comedy?,1,8 September 2019,"Look, I don't mind being entertained at the movies, but there does come the expectation with such an adaptation of one of the best and most beloved horror novels ever written that it accord some respect while remaining true to the source material.My main problem with this film lies in its tonal inconsistency. I could never tell if it was attempting to set a somber, foreboding, menacing feeling, or if it was trying to create an atmosphere conducive towards a lighthearted, hilarious jump-scare filled marathon. In one moment it hangs heavy in emotional gravitas (the opening scene is especially brutal and difficult to watch, and Stanley's suicide is also fairly dark), and the next, it's so ludicrously over the top and in your face in its execution of its ""horror"" elements that it produces a jarring sense of tonal discord. What exactly is this film attempting to be? The horror was so absurdly explicitly comedic in its execution (not helped by questionable effects work) that I must assume that was the intent. Yet in taking such a directorial approach, it effectively nullified the entire foundation that the movie required to establish and help foment the dreadful tension, atmosphere, and tone necessitated by the narrative (and of which made the book so stellar), and further relegated all the work by the actors and all other aspects of the film that had helped establish it up to that point void. If it wasn't intentional, then it does nothing so well as to exemplify how the filmmakers hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what actual horror really entails.""IT Chapter Two"" spends much of its runtime plodding through a mindless, rote, predictable checklist of the characters recovering their artifacts from their youths, to the same tired, mindless, rote, predictable jump scares thrown at you one after the other which you can see coming from a million miles off which further robbed them of all their potency. How am I supposed to care at all about the protagonists' emotional plights (which are portrayed in a serious light) when their antagonist and its supposedly evil forms who are responsible for them are utterly stripped of their malevolence and are portrayed in such a formulaic, repetitive, explicit, and laughably juvenile manner? Yes, I know ""IT"" manifests itself also as a Pennywise who does utilize a childlike humor to lure his prey in, but that doesn't mean it wasn't the only way nor that the entity wasn't terrifying in all the revelations of its truest forms. They were terrifying in the novel, and here they're a downright riot. A little subtlety, suggestion, imagination, minimalism and unpredictability goes a long way and would've done this film wonders, as that's where the real core of any effective horror resides. It would've not only have helped maintain tonal consistency, it would've made it genuinely unsettling. My theatre was howling at every turn, and I'm completely left at a loss as to whether that was what the director intended.As is, this film suffers an identity crisis. It is inconsistent, predictable, ludicrously (and unintentionally?) hilarious, redundant, overly drawn out to the point of boredom, and worst of all, a downright insult to King, who I'm shocked made the cameo he did in tacit approval of this screen adaptation abomination of his finest work. The glaring tonal juxtaposition and abysmal execution robbed me of all interest in witnessing The Losers' Club finally confront this ultimate evil terrorizing a small Maine town every 27 years, because in the end, it wasn't an ultimate evil at all......it was a goddamn mockery of one.And due to that, I walked out. Truly, truly awful.",It Chapter Two

1029,alanc88,So So Long; Couldn't Wait For It To End.,2,30 March 2020,"After 27 years, IT decides to come back to Derry to start killing again!
Only Mike out of the original seven has stayed in Derry, all of the others buggered off elsewhere and seem to be making it in the big wide world.
When IT returns Mike calls the other six up and tells them to 'come home' tomorrow because they had all promised 27 years ago to stick together. Where did MIke get their telephone numbers from - they've been gone for 27 years?
Luckily for Mike the rest of them have nothing better to do so they all turn up at the Chinese restaurant; except one who decides to cut his wrists in the bath - a bit extreme I think. Why didn't he just not go and say stuff them? They don't know where he lives or anything. They haven't been in touch with each for 27 years -highlighted by the fact that they were all introducing themselves to each when they met up!
At the restaurant, they all reminisce about the past which becomes really loud talking over one another with plenty of F-bombs being shouted - who comes over to ask them to keep it down? - Nobody!
When they start to see little insects coming out of the fortune cookies, they all lose it, screaming and shouting and then smashing the chairs and tables to bits - the chinese woman comes in and says is everything OK and they just ask for the bill. No police called or paying for the damage!
I should have stopped watching at this point but I enjoyed the first film and wanted to see how it all panned out.
There are numerous bits in the film where I've thought how did that happen, where did he come from, why did they did they do that etc, that other reviewers have written about so I won't repeat them except for the ones below:
1. What was the point of Bowers in the film? He killed someone in the Hospital and escaped, (driven by a zombie in a getaway car), and no police are called looking for him.
2. Bill buys his old bike back from an antiques shop for $300. Whenever he gets off his bike, he always just drops it in the middle of the road - are there any cars coming down the road unable to get past his bike - no, of course there aren't.
3. The group go there separate ways to figure out what is holding them to the first part of the adventure: ie: from 27 years ago. During the kill IT ritual, they must burn it in some sort of laether bag(?). Ben burns a signed year book entry which only one person has signed, (Beverly, who he has fancied since childhood). He has carried this in his wallet for 27 yearsand he decides to burn it - yeah right!
4. When they go to the derelict house to confront IT, they ALL have torches. Where did they come from, they didn't have them when you see them outside the house seconds earlier.
5. This ritual and running through the house lasts an eternity. I really wanted to switch off but I also wanted to see what happened at the end. The ritual failed, (sorry you burnt that treasured keepsake Ben), so they decide that to kill IT they had to call it names - yes, that's right, call It a clown and it will start to shrink and then you can rip its heart out and squash it.
Three hours this took. There are no scares to make you jump; no real comedy; not sure if was supposed to be a horror or comedy because it failed on both accounts.
Next time, I won't look at the higher reviews, I will look at the 1 and 2 score reviews because I think you will get far more honesty from them.",It Chapter Two
1030,kevinM23,Average Story but Well Told,7,22 December 2019,"First of all, I'd like to mention the genre of this movie isn't really, adequately horror. I'd label it as a thriller. Perhaps it is me who has desensitized through all the video games I have played since a kid that an image of monstrous creature no longer spooks me. Set aside a couple of jump scares (usually from loud sfx,) the movie wasn't scary at all.Humor is alright in most movies that aren't designed for comedy as long as it's paced and utilized in a manner it isn't awkward. In this movie, however, there were a couple of scenes that humor just didn't belong. It wasn't only awkward but also embarrassing to watch. The movie unnecessarily overdid humor and I wonder why in a supposedly horror movie.That said, the story may seem average, redundant, cliche, and even cheesy, but it was well told through cinematography and editing. The overall stream of storytelling flowed smoothly on screen that made it quite riveting and enjoyable to watch. How the scenes were weaved and intertwined between the adults and their child counterparts was just well done.In conclusion, it has issues but not that bad.

1032,a_pospech,Tripple dose of It,7,7 September 2019,"It (2017) may be just the best horror movie I've seen. After its's success, the ""need"" for a sequel was obvious. Not an easy task to make better movie. Hard to impossible probably. Usually sequel must have more of everything. And that's exactly what It Chapter Two delivers. There is more of a story, more new revelations (some of them with somewhat unclear ""why"" - like the memories from childhood - did these happen before or after they defeated It in 1989? If before, why weren't they in the first movie...). It's looonger, there are more of frightening moments (more like 2.5 hrs of almost constant dread), it's grosser, with more scary scenes, more elaborate and frightening monsters and many many many startling moments (yes, those standard ones when sound goes down, screen goes dark and...). There are new elements too - abundant humor. Sometimes when you're thinking ""what they will come up with now"" the filmmakers may have felt similarly, and the character reacts in a funny way. You can end up laughing heavily with goosebumps all over your body. Great job here. One more thing Chapter Two resembles is playing horror video game with all the elements of action, puzzles, boss fight, etc.
However, the delivery of ""more of everything"" in Chapter Two is what emphasizes It (2017) is a better movie. Because it was the amazing balance of story, fear, visual storytelling, that made ""It"" just perfect. Chapter two feels like ordering a triple portion of a great meal.

My biggest complaint is that it seems like Bill Skarsgard is only in this 3-hour movie for maybe 2 or 3 minutes at the absolute most, and what I mean is that 95% of the time you see Pennywise its always cheap-looking CGI. There are probably 20 or 30 times in this movie where a CGI Pennywise rushes towards the camera with his head violently shaking back and forth for some unknown reason. This same exact ""jump scare"" happens over and over and over until you could literally fall asleep right in the middle of one.Another massive failure of this movie was the constant idiotic humor from the comic relief characters (mostly Bill Hader). I love Bill Hader, and comic relief is totally fine, but most of his humor was really badly written and ruined any chance of this movie being taken even remotely seriously. The humor seemed like a last minute attempt by the filmmakers to save this awful movie from total failure.Im sure people will think Im just a hater but let me state for the record that I rated the previous It a solid 8/10, and that was actually a cool and well-made horror movie, whereas the sequel was a headache-inducing mess.",It Chapter Two

-Bad dialogue. Any one who thinks some of these jokes are funny must be a thirteen year old boy. Why did the adult characters still talk like when they were eleven? I laughed maybe once or twice.
-Absolutely horrible CGI. Me and my family were laughing at how terrible the effects were. The monsters ended up looking more silly and stupid than scary.
-Way too damn long. It became almost painful to sit through this almost three hour long film. Parts of it (especially the middle portion) were so boring and seemed pointless, making it feel longer. I understand the book has a lot of material.. but maybe do three movies, or it should have just been made into a miniseries or something.
-Too much minor characters, not enough Pennywise. We want to see Pennywise dammit, not all these lame monsters. And the mullet guy? Sooooo pointless. He should have been cut completely.
-Lame jump scares. Not scary at all. I didn't jump once. You'll only be scared of this movie if you're a little girl.
-Dumb ending. So Pennywise basically gets bullied to death and that's how they kill him? So dumb.. not exciting at all.
Just to add some positivity: the acting was pretty good, especially from Bill Skarsgaard, who is great as Pennywise. The film looks really nice as well. But that's about it.

To start off with the negative - the background story of what Pennywise really, actually, is, is convoluted, cliche and, by the end of the film, doesn't make much sense. It's as if the screenwriters were so sure they were going to make money off of the sequel that they had no problem with adding a lazy plot device, ie, ask the Indian, and that they put no extra work into layering out the details of said lazy plot device.
They turn my main man Mike into a liar, a literal parody of the ""crazy guy in the attic,"" tried to convince me that Bill's big problem with ""bad endings"" is more important than exploring the Richie/Eddie thing that, let's be honest, we were all pretty sure something was happening in the original TV movie, or even the short climax of Bev and Tom (that one guy you see for like three seconds, you know, enough to realize he's a bad guy, but not necessarily a great actor) and their abusive marriage.
The actors were great, don't get me wrong. Even when they shredded Mike's character or made Stanley seem like more than just a man who was terrified, they represent the character's they're supposed. It's just not the character's you might remember from the classic novel. Wasn't the fact that Mike was the literal lighthouse in the sea, and the fact that Stanley was just a terrified man, not make the books, not only more realistic, but more enjoyable. (I mean we all like to think we would be Mike or Bill, defending the Universe, but in reality we're definitely Eddie, who was scared , or Stan who was content with death over facing the ""Eater of Worlds.""
On to the positive, the actors are THE highlight of this movie.
Jessica Chastain is a Bev Annette O'Toole can be proud of. She's terrified of It, yet does her best to be more than just the ""damsel in distress,"" it definitely helps that she's gorgeous, plays a layered character and delivers in her performance. James McAvoy can just find one part he doesn't shine in to give the rest of us hope and Bill Hader is witty, sarcastic and everything Will Tozier should be. Jay Ryan is gorgeous, and a great actor, and yet, somehow, seems to have a fat, scaredy-cat kid, hiding under all of that layered perfection. James Ransone, I had no idea who this guy was, but I'm amazed he's not doing more movies and being an A-Lister. He plays his part well and I actually felt emotion, real emotion, when he died, people reading this, it was intense. Isaiah Mustafa is good, but definitely the weak one, in this six-way. Andy Bean is another actor that I just want to watch more of. His few minutes on screen, and his voice-over, (spoiler: there are so many voiceovers omg there are just so many voiceovers and just those have to be like 30-45 min of the sound and editing time), are just fantastic. Bill Skarsgard can just stay a few million miles away from me, by the way, I don't know what it was but this guy freaked me out so much. It was probably his very presence, but I immediately wanted to run away when I saw his face. If anyone has a career in horror or suspense it's this guy.
I approve of this movie, I really do, I love when Directors take the gems of my childhood and don't rip them to shreds but I just feel like the plot and the entire movie could have been so much more. I give it an 8 out of 10. The actors save this lazy plot and the directors should probably thank them for that.",It Chapter Two
1050,MovieAnalysis,Are you ready to float again?,7,7 September 2019,"IT Chapter 2 is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Stephen King and a sequel to the movie IT(2017). The film is directed by Andy Muschietti and stars Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, and Andy Bean as grown-up members of the Losers Club. Bill Skarsgård also returns as Pennywise.
The film takes place 27 years after the actions of the first part in the year 2016 when ""IT"" comes again to haunt the children of the town ""Derry"". All the members of Losers club are adult now and have left Derry except Mike. When Mike finds the traces of return of Pennywise, he calls all the members of Losers Club for a reunion and recalls them the promise they made to each other at the end of the first film. Will they defeat Pennywise again or it's his turn this time?
The film reveals the unknown secrets of the Losers. Around half of the film deals with revealing these secrets via flashbacks. Although it was fun to watch our beloved young characters from the previous film again. Pennywise is more horrifying and dangerous this time.
The main drawback of the movie is its length. The movie is approximately 3 hours long and we feel it while watching. The movie could have been 20 minutes shorter. The movie switches between emotions and comedy several times and hence we don't get connected to the main protagonists of the film. It's their childhood only which makes us care about them.
If we talk about acting, Bill Hader as Richie and James Ransone as Eddie were outstanding. Hader makes you laugh almost with every dialogue. I personally wanted more from Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy may because of their previous performances. Bill Skarsgård once again is fantastic and revives the character of Pennywise with his Deadly Smile.
There are too many jump scares and some of them really do work but at the same time, there are some silly scenes too which makes you laugh. I enjoyed the way Muschietti presented the movie. He differentiates between the true horror and imagination of fear.
If you loved Chapter One, you can definitely watch this Chapter too but just don't go with too many expectations and you will enjoy it.",It Chapter Two

1052,moviefest-90757,To Much Nonsense And Not Enough Substance!,7,6 October 2019,"Bigger is better! But that's not necessarily the case for ""It: Chapter 2,"" which fails to make full use of it's overbearing runtime and lacks in original scares, but thanks to a faithful approach to the source material and a stellar cast, they help keep ""It: Chapter 2"" afloat.
.
I actually have quite alot of issues with this one, so let's get stuck in. First and foremost, the film is drenched in CGI, atleast one out of every 3 scenes was full of it, and after a short amount of time, it began to get really noticeable. Then there was the constant use of weak jump-scares, and the worst thing about that was, I honestly don't recall jumping one single time throughout the film. Then the runtime, I mean wtf, there were so many times throughout the film I felt scenes didn't need to be there. And finally, the balance between comedy, horror and drama was so off, for example, there would be a brutal or heartbreaking scene and then seconds later someone's cracking a joke or trying to be funny and vice versa, and that not only took away a sense of realism from the losers, but it also made it very hard to feel any emotional connection to the adult losers because I was never sure when I should laugh or cry.
.
Don't get me wrong, there were definitely a few times I laughed and 97% of the time it was thanks to Barry, I mean Bill Hader, who's an absolute star. Bill Skarsgård is terrifying and terrific, I wish they had more of him in his natural state because those scenes were the scariest of all. He generally is a brilliant Pennywise and I honestly don't think anyone could trump his performance as the killer clown. The rest of the cast all did a solid job with what they were given, so not really any complaints there, the cinematography is beautiful, thank god Muschietti managed to successfully replicate the eerie atmosphere from the first, and although there was too much of it, I did enjoy some of the CGI scenes of monsters, a handful were quite interesting to say the least. All in all, its definitely a film worth watching, but it's ultimately a film that will be quickly forgotten.",It Chapter Two

1054,chelseatayla,It was alright...,6,18 September 2019,"Pros:-Loved the opening scene, the homophobic threat of real people combined with the supernatural threat of Pennywise was really effective.-The adult cast were well selected, resembled their child counterparts and were (for the most part) believable as the grown versions of their characters.-Bill Skarsgard did a magnificent job as Pennywise, (duh)-Liked the added information of Pennywise's/It's origins.Cons:
-This movie is not only looooong but you can feel it. It tended to drag, to the point I found myself bored in certain parts. Particularly when the group split up and did their own thing in the middle. I found myself most entertained when the characters were actually interacting, particularly with Ritchie and Eddie.-There were lots of jokes that fell flat and broke up the tension. A few were well timed and gave me a giggle, but more often than not they weren't effective.-It's true form was a bit disappointing (a clown head on a spider body?), at least with the mini series they committed to the alien arachnid creature.-Lots of jump scares, yet not a scary movie. I think it failed to create the tension that the first movie and even the mini series managed to achieve.-Henry Bowers, completely wasted. Might aswell not have been included. Again, could have used the character to create more tension, instead didn't really achieve anything.-Probably a very unpopular opinion, but I found Jessice Chastain and James McAvoy a little dull (and I actually believe they're magnificent actors), maybe it was just the way they portrayed the characters or the characters themselves, but I actually found these two the least believable out of all of the Losers.-Not much growth or character development, to the point I almost didn't care about the Losers fate in the end. (other than Ritchie and Eddie who were the most believable and I think really stole their scenes with the others).As a whole, it wasn't a bad movie, but wasn't anything to brag about it. I found myself bored in parts, entertained by others, a bit fatigued by the end of it. I've heard rumours of a Pennywise origin story movie with Bill Skarsgard returning, which I think has the potential to be fantastic.",It Chapter Two
1055,rebeccarage-11322,IT CHAPTER TWO SPOILER FREE REVIEW 🎈,9,7 September 2019,"IT CHAPTER TWO, SPOILER FREE REVIEW.
I'll start with the positive. IT is basically Goonies for horror fans. Pure nostalgia. Wanting that last adventure with your friends before you're too old. (God that's depressing) Anyway, my biggest fear for this movie was that it would fail purely because let's face it in the book and the original mini series, the switch over to the kids from the adults is pretty boring. So I'm super happy to announce I needn't have worried, this switch over was seamless , it was cast perfectly to the point they looked like the kids had made a wish on Zoltar to be big, and I actually enjoyed this more than part one. The chemistry between the cast was spot on and I it felt like watching real friends. I was totally immersed in the story from start to finish, I didn't find myself zoning out for any of the run time.
Look out for the cameos and the nods to all your favourite 80's horror.
Ok now for the bad, same criticism as I had for the first one, TOO HEAVILY RELIANT ON CGI!! I thought there was missed opportunities for scares that were ruined by the heavy heavy CGI. Skarsgard has perfect control of Pennywise but when the CGI kicks in it becomes cartoonish. I don't wanna spoil it so I'll just bullet point the dodgy.
1. CGI
2. The first 15 minutes felt like a totally different film, that's not to say it wasn't good, just different. (And yes I've read the book)
3. CGI
4. Angel of the morning???
5. Small Pennywise
6. CGI
7. Too much Georgie
8. How much I cried in the end
9. The de-aging CGi and voice overs, especially Eddie.
10. Oh and as I final point did I mention the CGI?",It Chapter Two
1056,TorsoDahlia,"Disappointing, way too long, but still fun.",5,7 September 2019,"Having waited two years for this to come out I am left with a scurry of emotions. While not as good as the first part, in some ways it is better as Pennywise is actually a little bit creepy here compared to his silly demeanor in the first one. However, he reminded me off Freddy Krueger in the last 4 or 5 Freddy sequels where he would say a silly line or two, get a scare then vanish. Skarsgard's Pennywise was always abnormal and silly, but great fun at that. While he is still No Curry (as actually being scary is important) he is not the problem. The problems and there are many is the pacing, writing, character development or lack thereof, and some of the performances.It starts off with the infamous murder of gay adult Adrian Mellon which thankfully they included as it is one of the most important in the book as well as one of the creepiest. Sadly, here it is rushed and is only done in around five minutes or so. Not good. Xavier Dolan is an excellent actor and Mellon is a very important part of the story relating to Derry in present day so rushing it was a huge mistake. Still. at least it is here even if they stupidly rushed it and did not do much with it as they should have. People who have read the book know what I am talking about.For a film that is 11 minutes shy of three hours we could have used more character development instead of cheap scares and constant flashbacks back and forth every few minutes. Yes, this happens in the book and it works but in the film not so much. The problem is the grown up losers do not have much to them outside of annoying Richie and uptight Eddie who are spot on. Plus, if people who pay attention at movies, there is a big reveal involving why Richie acts the way he does which is new and it works perfectly. I was not expecting that and it worked even with Hader as Richie.I enjoyed the film although it is nothing amazing by any standards. Chastain's Beverly and McAvoy's Bill, two very important characters offered nothing here as adults. They finally gave Mike something to do as he is integral to the story and the actors who plays Ben & doomed Stan are fine, but nothing you really care about as that belongs to Richie and Eddie.Essentially, missed opportunities here and a film the drags for long periods of time when it shouldn't. One would think with how painfully long it is at times and feels even longer at others times, that there would be more insight and character development but nada with the majority of the characters. Skarsgard was funny and effective as always drooling and giggling when on screen and Bill Hader's Ritchie has perfectly timed observations and one liners that pick up scenes where we are bored to tears.A good film but a disappointing one as it did not need to be this long at all despite the huge size of the epic novel. The ending of Pennywise/It, (let's face it they showed him more as a clown as anything and that is another mistake) was interesting in the way it was handled, but we were left with 20 minutes after the fact of over the top cheesiness by the losers. Some will hate this, some may actually love it, and I'd imagine many may be in my spot acknowledging a mixed bag that often dragged, felt empty and just felt off as a whole.",It Chapter Two
1057,jonatan_juntunen,The best they could have done,9,6 September 2019,"The movie was really amazing - love the cast, everything. However, it sure does get complicated with everything for those who have not read the book. It simply does not have enough screentime to make that possible - and thats funny, seeing how the movie already runs close to three hours.The movie is looooooong. Is that a bad thing? Nope. The screentime is well deserved, but no kidding, when i left the theater it felt like i had spent 27 years there already. Again, the movie sure does need this, even though it can feel very longstretched at some bits. It does also heavily rely on the first chapter. While it was exciting seeing the young cast, it did not bring anything new into the movie except some new scares and also some refreshing for the adult counterparts. The movie does rely on quite a lot of cgi, and i cant push this enough. This movie would have been so much more effective without the cgi. Use practical effects. You do not hire someone like Javier Botet and then still rely on cgi.But again, this movie is still amazing, and is a great addition to both the first chapter, but also the steven king universe in general.

As much as I love James McAvoy, Bill Hader was the shining light of the film, right behind Bill Skarsgård that is. He plays the character perfectly, just the the first one, but my biggest, & really only, disappointment with the film is that it didn't have enough Pennywise. It had more creatures other than Pennywise than Pennywise himself & I think that was just a waste of talent when it comes to Bill. He was born for the role & will always be remembered for it.

But no, they find it in themselves to be joyful enough to make a quick joke to which by the way nobody in the audience laughed.Why do you writers/directors approve of this? Don't you realize it's ruining the film?
Don't you see? It's like you quickly forget what you are shooting and throw in completely random stuff like this? It doesn't fit with what you're filming whatsoever. Don't worry, someone will make a parody of this film and they will bring the jokes in that you want to bring. It's the same as if you go to a comedy film like ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and at the end of the movie a monster shows up to eat Sarah's face, just for s & giggles.

But I mean in awful as in yes they were over the top but my god they actaully creeped me out!Take the scene when the Loser club meet up as adults and they are eating their Chinese reminiscing and wondering where Stanley is, we know where he is!, and when the get their hidden messages in the Fortune Cookies, I was proper squeamish. I wanted to look away but I couldn't, it was so over the top but it was fasincating at the same time!Same when Beverley goes to her old home, we have the creepy old woman running around in the background, the kinda glimspe and you miss it, doing the twitchy thing I hate in films, but when she bursts back through into the room.....well one part of me wanted to laugh at the thing coming out the other part of me was thinking WTHolyF is going on!! I was like that throughout and it was riverting stuff.Watching all the Loser club, relive their childhood, trying to find their tokens to do the ritual brought back the memories they have lost and wanted to keep it lost. I know I would.I loved the cast, mixture of the unknown with the known. I love the actor who played Eddie, and it was nice to see little Henry from Dead to Me.This newer version actually worked for me, but I am open to discussion on different things. Yes again, things are different, and I can imagine that a lot has changed from the book (I will be re/reading it soon) but if you take it for what it is, a horror film then it works. A coming of age story, where the adults are still haunted, their life choices are dictated by the actions as children, still trying to make a path for themselves, yet held back by the actions from 27 years earlier, it works. Because of this, you feel their fear, you sense the apprehension of returning to Derry and facing Pennywise when all you want to do is hide under a cover and never speak of it again. It would have been nice to have the Club, together in more than a few scenes and really develop on what had started from the first film, but I still found myself rooting for them to defeat Pennywise, I mean they have to right!It has made me want to pick the book up right away and re-watch Tim Curry Lorde it up as Pennywise. Where Curry is more comical and easier to watch, Skarsgård is bloody scary to boot!Just make sure you have a spare 3 hours for this film as it's a long one!

And things just go downhill from there. The Loser's Club of the first film reunites 27 years later to have another go at defeating Pennywise, but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them, the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film. The film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults. The effect is that you never really care about them as adults, they're just an excuse to show CGI monsters that never really scare you on any level. The pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next, while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you'll have to endure. The middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (verbatim quote and all) a little bit of Toy Story erector spider, a dash of Poltergeist's Native American mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they're up against.

1084,kingmasada,Nostalgia riddled primal fear,9,29 October 2019,"Ever since I found the story of It, I've been drawn to its story and concept. It features stuff from your worst nightmares, a scary clown, creepy crawlers, hideous monsters. And yet, it is not the stuff on the surface that scares you most, it is the absolute manifestation of your emotional fears. Crap that you have buried under layer upon layer of mental walls, making it disappear from your mind and thoughts. Until it is uncovered again.This film embodies this. Takes a shovel and digs its way into your fears. This is what happens when you let a director loose who wants to do the source material justice. Not only for the fans, but because it is such a clear representation of what deep, emotional fear can be like. And when the shovel stops working, it takes a pickaxe. Then a drill. Then dynamite.Skarsård has been compared to Heath Ledger wearing his role. And they're not wrong, the comparison is spot on. He lives and breathes Pennywise. If not for that brilliant casting, the movie would have falled flat for sure. And it's not only the clown that's been handed to capable hands, the rest of the losers are all one by one perfect in their adult rules. This is beautiful film making in a genre that has gone mostly unnoticed by talent. It's a great movie to end this decade of excellent horror movies.It's not only scary, it's sweet too. Banding together with your friends to beat the demons of your past, together. It gave me the greatest sense of nostalgia for them, the characters and their lives in Derry.I loved this movie and it's one of my favourite of the year and one of my favourite King adaptations. I would like some more, please.",It Chapter Two

I wanted to give up so many times but I just stuck with it as I had invested so much time already. Just as people have said overloaded with cgi garbage. Not one bit scary and the only bits I found funny were scenes that were meant to be scary.

1090,Shazam1303,Good Movie But...,7,6 September 2019,Sadly it's not better than Part One. They had the chance to up the ante on the Horror but they didn't. It was bloodier than Part one but by no way scarier. I actually wished they would've shown Pennywise more. A little more dialogue and some more terrifying scenes in his clown costume would've been perfect which points out the biggest mistake they've made with this movie. The other creatures are wayyyyyy too much CGI !! The scares automatically don't work because the CGI just looks too fake and digital. Almost laughable at certain parts. That ruined a bunch of moments for me. As already pointed out by other reviews Bill Hader runs the show since he's given the funniest dialogue throughout the movie. Sometimes the humor killed the scares too but it's still acceptable. As a Fan of IT I give the movie a good rating and it's still better than a lot of horror movies that are out right now. Just sadly not perfect in this case although they had the chance to create something classic.,It Chapter Two
1091,parrykyra,"Entertaining, emotional, great movie",10,7 September 2019,"IT: Chapter 2 lived up to all my expectations, it was funny, emotional and was full with jumpscares.

1092,olgavalentovaov,"Please, Stop",4,14 September 2019,"That's what I spent most of the movie thinking. Just...stop. Just...don't.
I came to the cinema excited, certain that I was in for a great movie. I was wrong. Oh boy, was I wrong. Throughout the first maybe thirty minutes I was bored - the movie took its sweet time gearing up, but still I held onto hope that the latter parts would make up for it, but as the movie droned on, my hopes slowly dwindled. At the end I was squirming in my seat, bored out of my mind and wishing for all the main characters to just die so that I would be released from this torture.
As I watched, I tried desperately to figure out just what was it about the movie that made it so...bland. What was the main difference between the first IT movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and this one, which I was thoroughly disappointed by? And I think I figured it out. Of course, the movie has more than just one problem. The characters, Bill Hader's in particular, were bland at best and infuriating at most, and the predictable attempts at comic relief just irritated me. As a viewer, I could see most of the one-liners and half-baked punchlines coming from a mile away, and in my opinion, and all of the jokes just seemed so out of place.
The story line was dragged out, it was repetitive and mostly uninteresting, with the same jumpscares and just what were those zombie thingies? They were laughable. And when you find yourself smothering a laugh when you're supposed to be scared, that's how you know a horror movie SUUUUCKS.
Anyway, back to the main reason this movie blows. A story, which worked so very well when its main protagonists were children, just doesn't work when the kids have been replaced with adults. Perhaps it's because the main villain takes on the form of a clown, and a clown chasing adults just seems...silly somehow. I know, I know, it can be done, has been done very well, but Pennywise just doesn't cut it. The clown is a great character, and he pretty much carried the movie, but his creepiness, his malice, ""shines"" the most when he's interacting with children. The way he talks to them, the way he lures them in, the balloons...it all just sends shivers down your spine. But with adults, not so much. The filmmakers perhaps realized that themselves, beause there is very little interaction of Pennywise with the Losers club until the very end, and the main characters are mostly chased around by weird zombies and an asylum escapee, who...you know what, let's not get into that.
And the movie doesn't even give Pennywise a proper send-off. The way he's defeated is childish and laughable and annoying all at once - which can again be mostly chalked up to the fact that the main protagonists are adults. Holding hands and chanting? Overcoming their fears and realizing that without their own fear, Pennywise is nothing? Those aren't exactly grown-up methods.
The final scenes were just painful. I wanted to leave.
There are many other little and bigger things I was annoyed at, but the movie was mostly just bland, like your average C-grade horror movie. It's kind of sad.
PS. Stanley, what the frick? ""I am scared I'm going to die, so I'll just kill myself?"" How is that a conclusion you came to?
Also, don't call yourselves the Losers Club, PLEASE. You're adults now, the irony isn't cute anymore.",It Chapter Two

1094,cassnkait-45044,"Not exactly horror, creepy and good",8,8 September 2019,"Let's start by saying Bill Hader was amazing, perfect, and made the movie. Pennywise was great, still love this version of him. The movie could have trimmed it down to be under 3 hours, long and drawn out. Lots of blood and F bombs, the comedy was great, as it was in the first. Beverly was boring and I think that's because of who played her, Amy Adams should have been cast instead.",It Chapter Two

I went with someone but if I had went alone I'd have walked out, and I've never ever even contemplated doing that. I literally would have. I was on the edge of my seat, only bc I was ready to leave!!! It's 3 hours of my life I'll never get back and it was pulling teeth to get through it.

1096,unwhiskyetaulit,what a drag it is getting scared,6,14 September 2019,"I 'm not really a fan of the ""big screen"" adaptation of King's novel.
What really annoyed me in the first part was how Pennywise was replayed. Only with Georgie did we see that mix of seduction and terror. And though Skarsgaard made a lot of efforts he never really reached Tim Curry's performance.In It:Chapter two though, Pennywise was better ""written"" and Skarsgaard was more convincing...sadly, Skarsgaard's performance is mainly cut by too much CGI.It seems that this Chapter Two wanted to be ""more"" than the first part. Scarier, Gorier, more violent, more disgusting.
Sometimes, it gives credit to the movie...but mostly, it fails to reach the objectives and makes the movie finally boring.This fact is also due to unnecessary lengths like the ""artefact's quests"" of each character.
Some says that it deepens the character's profile, their story arcs;
the problem is that these arcs are unequal.
Bill Denbrough's arc's probably the most interesting where the ones of Richie tozier, Ben Hanscom or Mike Hanlon are barely told.
And most of all, these quests lead to nothing...Think of it, you could remove all these ""artefact's quests"" part and the ""failed"" ritual part using them and you won't lose a thing, the movie could still tell his story...
As for the long long long ending. All these lengths to finish by ""le'ts imagine him weakier than us and we'll beat him"".
Ok, The ritual of Chud is a battle of will but the way it is shown is really caricatural...Like the ""mocking"" of Apollon in Star Trek original series ""Who mourns for Adonais"" episodeAs for the jump scares : use it too much and you lose the effect...After one or two jump scares, when the next one you're there, nearly saying to the director ""Ok guy! Come on, do another one quick so we can go through the story"".So what remains : the actor's play...
Well, Skarsgaard was much better in this one, Mac Avoy is convincing though sometimes exaggerating his stutt...stut...stuttering!.
But not really enjoyed by the other's actor's play..well at least for the adult ones.
Isaiah Mustafah and James Ransone are OK; Jessica Chastain is inexistant compared to Sophia Lillis ""light"" and nearly each apparition of Bill Hader are boring.So I would be unfait to tell the movie was bad but cut one hour of It:Chapter Two and you have something better",It Chapter Two

1098,mbald-93738,"""IT"" happens...",6,6 September 2019,"Just got out of the theatre after seeing IT Chapter 2. This movie unfortunately felt a lot like the book, which if anyone's heard anything about the book, they know some things work and some things don't.There are numerous scenes that would have elevated the film if there was no jump scares or have scary scenes be immediately followed by a zinger by adult Richie.The tone in the first one felt a little disjointed at times but it over all had one tone: spooky. I can't really say the same for this film.That's not to say this movie is a huge disappointment, the cast is excellent across the board, especially Bill Skarsgaurd, who was great as usual. There's one scene in paticular that I personally think was more intense than the Georgie scene in the first one (really well done). However, this scene can't carry the amount of okayness in this film.There's a running gag in the film that involves adult Bill and how he's a writer, one of his books was apparently great until the end. If you look at both IT 1 and 2, the ending was the worst part.",It Chapter Two
1099,DanielNeil1237,Good follow up for the most part. With issues,6,6 September 2019,"IT chapter two is pretty good for the most part and a great follow up to chapter one. All of the casting is amazing with a stand out from Bill Hader as Richie. Well, Jessica Chastain, James Macavoy and everyone else is also all great as the adult losers in the movie. Bill Skarsgard is once again great and entertaining as heck as Pennywise and all the returning young cast from the first one are good during the flashback sequences. Andres Musuchietti once again like with the first movie does a great job directing and the cinematography is also great with a unique look added to the film. Even the humor is really funny and some of Pennywise's forms are coolly taken directly from the book which I am a huge fan of the book. Issues with the film are with the some of the story choices they can feel very rushed, or sloppy with the pacing feeling off at times. The movie also is missing that unique heart the first movie had of the kids standing up against evil by themselves, it isn't really there anymore though the film has pieces of it. Also it isn't as scary as chapter one but instead a little more shocking and disturbing, or as well put together overall as the first one. The final act can feel really silly at times though being still very book accurate. Overall It Chapter two is a good conclusion to chapter one finishing off Kings book. It sadly isn't as great as the first but still very likable being very book accurate and with a great director, cast. If your a huge fan of the book like myself you really will enjoy it and its book accuracy. I can't wait for the directors cut to see what they left out on top of this nearly 3-hour movie.",It Chapter Two

I dont know why i didnt like it so much but its been a couple days now and i still catch myself getting pissed off how bad it was.
Too long crap ending stupid monsters, as a gag its not funny enough as a horror its too formulated. Bad film shot well with some comic relief",It Chapter Two
1101,JDreviews101,"The real evil clown is screenwriter Gary Dauberman, not Pennywise.",5,10 September 2019,"With the movie already having almost a thousand user reviews on IMDb I guess not many people are going to read this, but nonetheless here we go. After liking It (2017) very much I had high expectations for this movie, especially since the official cast was revealed.It Chapter Two starts well for the most part, but as the movie unfolds you soon start to realize that some of the adult characters are pretty much the same as their younger selves, and it seems that they haven't matured at all in 27 years. I understand that the adult characters had to be 'recognizable' for the audience to re-establish the emotional link we had with the kids from the previous film, but you really CANNOT write a kids dialogue intended for adult characters that are supposed to be grown-up and mature human beings.The screenplay of the first film, written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga & Gary Dauberman, worked very well because of these two main reasons: 1) the lines of dialogue were INTENDED for kids and 2) because Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman did the least amount of writing on it. I don't know what happened that Chase Palmer and Cary Fukunaga were not brought back together to work on the screenplay for It Chapter Two, and letting Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman take the wheel on his own is probably one of the worst decisions Warner Bros has ever made. Because of his sloppy, careless and lame writing It Chapter Two suffers tonal inconsistencies and misplaced humor throughout most of the film, and it is definitely not Andy Muschietti's fault as I'm sure as a director he did his best to keep the script's tonal mess at a minimum.The actors did pretty well with the material they were given, but for me the standouts were definitely Jessica Chastain as Beverly, Jay Ryan as Ben and Andy Bean as Stanley (although his presence was fleeting). Bill Skarsgård was once again great as Pennywise although, because of the dumb dialogue by Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman, at times it sounded like a completely different character. In addition, Teach Grant was surprisingly good as an adult Henry Bowers. The kids were all fantastic once again. On the other hand, we all know that James McAvoy is a great actor, but he really needed to work on his North American English accent a bit more here, as in some instances you can hear his Scottish accent creeping in. Unfortunately, I have to say that Isaiah Mustafa, Bill Hader and James Ransone delivered the weakest performances of the movie. I can't understand how you can give dramatic crying scenes (exactly four of them) to a comedic actor that has stated before in interviews that cannot cry in front of a camera.The overuse of CGI was annoying at times, and that was one of my main complaints with the previous film as well. Cinematography, editing, sound and music were all great. Benjamin Wallfisch crafted a truly beautiful score for both movies, and definitely elevated some of the scenes by making them more emotionally powerful, especially in the first film.All in all I was disappointed with It Chapter Two, and it was mostly due to the sloppy and careless writing of Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman.",It Chapter Two

Although the movie isn't nightmares-giving scary, it is on a good amount of scary, which I personally thought was a good thing (but some may not agree).One of the great things about this movie is that it perfectly blends horror elements with the comedic ones, something that is difficult to achieve.
Verdict : If you loved the first movie, you will definitely love this one. The movie features the thrills, the scares, the laughs and a satisfying conclusion (not to mention a dream cast). It Chapter 2 can be declared as a worthy second half.",It Chapter Two
1107,gerimease,IT had me laughing more than shuddering in fear,7,7 September 2019,"I am a fan of the book and also enjoyed the original IT movie. Tim Curry was a great Pennywise and the movie itself had enough creep value to make me not think about the ways it strayed from the book.However this 'remake' is lacking in several ways. From part one to this film Pennywise is hard for me to watch. The ""sing-song"" voice of Pennywise reminded me of Winnie the Pooh on a few occasions . I also felt that the CGI presented in this movie of things that were supposed to be scary, weren't. Big, misshapen heads with googly eyes were portrayed in different variations and seemed to be the main horror theme. But, they made me chuckle at the absurdity of them.The references to the movie The Thing, including a line from the movie also made me chuckle in a scene that should have been more frightening. There's also a Shining moment....I was excited when the film finally referenced the Ritual of Chud but was then let down. And the ending...the way they defeated Pennywise was lackluster and ridiculous.I love love love Stephen King books. He is a masterful story-teller, and his books are horrifyingly frightening and delicious. It's sad that for me, only a few book to movie translations remain as 'good' movies in my mind.If you want to see a few, they are Salem's Lot (some younger people may not even bee familiar with it) and The Shining.I recommend seeing this film as it has a few moments that make it worth it, and a bunch of Easter Eggs. But see it on video/blu-ray/etc, don't waste a movie experience, it's just not that worth it.",It Chapter Two

Just like Bill's book on the movie, this end sucks. Again the monster is defeated by the power of bullying. A lot of sub plots unfinished. What happen to Ben and Beverly for example??? AND EVEN WORST I can't stop thinking about the poor line between what's real and what doesn't. When they're eating, after seeing the fx of Pennywise, Mike is hitting the tablet with a chair, and we see it's all an illusion, right? Then, later, Eddy is attack, the monster actually spit on him or whatever. So, my point is HOW THEY/WE CAN KNOW WHEN RUN AND WHEN JUST CLOSE OUR EYES AND SAY ""IT'S NOT REAL""????

1109,Appearance,It Chapter I & II vs. memories of the book and the tv mini-series,8,18 September 2019,"When I was 12 years old, I saw a trailer on TV for the TV miniseries. They mentioned it was forbidden for the ""under 12"", so, of course I had to see it. What followed was one of the most scary but invegorating tv experiences of my young life. I could'nt sleep very well the following nights. Strange thing, though. I hadn't had enough. When I found a pocketbook display in the local supermarket with ""it"" part 1 I asked my mother to buy it .Well, I asked to buy directly the three volumes but my track record with books wasn't really great to say the least. Until then.
True enough, ""It"" made me start to read for pleasure. And I never really stopped afterwards....I watched the TV miniseries only again once when it came out on DVD...more than 27 years ago...So, what follows is a review of both movies tainted by my 27 year old experiences...I watched the two chapters in a double screening. The book was kind of being cut in two. It was the only way I could experience this new adaptation.So I think the movie was great. I was not disappointed at all. This adaptation is one that the book deserved. Chapter II lasts almost 3 hours and it didn't seem that long at all!The casting is great. Special mention for the adorable Sophia Mellis who portrays an amazing young Beverly.
The effects, the general creepy atmosphere. ""It"" is a great horror drama....BUT...
(I feel a little bit like a daddy who's kid has great grades but is hammering on the flaws...so be it)
Three things bothered me.First, one of the great things in the book is the sense of togetherness of the group. Stronger together... I missed that a little bit in this modern version. An exemple I can give is the way the ""cleaning Beverly's bathroom together"" scene lost all it sense the way it was directed and edited. I was like "" what the hell?"" And I think, in general, the main characters were more alone than I remember in the book.Secondly, the appearances of IT felt a little bit too much. It felt like the director was showing off ...""See what I can do!!"" .A little voice in my head was saying ""why doesn't he kill them already?""(I know why....)Thirdly, ""It"" is a being that feeds on fear. (that's why!)...That being said.. in this version we see IT eat/bite a lot....why?Lastly, the whole origin story of IT with the Amerindian sacrifice ritual felt bogus and forced. Was that in the book?Anyway I think they did a great job. I just needed those little grievances out of my system. The special collector director's cut box is probably going to find it's way on my shelfEnjoy IT !;-)",It Chapter Two
1110,therevanchist-14739,It was decent,6,29 October 2019,I feel like the makers of IT seen the success in the feedback for the little bits of humor they put into the first movie so they decided to go overboard with it in this second film. Which took away from the horror experience to me. Instead it's more like mostly humor with bits of horror in there when IT is supposed to be a horror film.

1114,williamjosephmaples,What a mess,1,6 September 2019,"The two aspects of this movie that do the most damage to it is the writers strange and nonsensical choices and the over-use of cringey cgi.The story was already written for them. Sure some things could be changed to the adaptation into a movie, but the changing of key events and motives really showed a lack of interest in the source material. In my opinion after seeing It 2, the writers had no reverence to what made the book so effective. This story tarnishes the evil created in the novel and, even as a seperate story, fails to create anything close to enjoyable for the audience.While that alone made me want to walk out time and time again, nothing bothered me more consistently than the constant, bad cgi. The creators think a goofy monster running and shaking its head is horror, and man are they wrong. The movie is ugly and devoid of any real suspense because of their insistence on showing instead of tellingI gave this a 2 because of a few good jokes, a single decent scene with Pennywise underneath some bleachers (before he becomes a cgi mouth), and my own silly want for this movie to be better than the 1 that I think it really does deserve.I have to be honest, this movie made me angry. It tore apart my favorite story and my favorite characters, turning them into something that was just too hard to look at. I hated It 2. I would tell the director that. I would tell Steven King that. He approved this travesty, and I wish I went with my instinct and hadn't seen it at all.",It Chapter Two
1115,danielx-83141,It Chapter 2 review,5,12 September 2019,"It was good, but not as nearly good as its predecessor. It mostly suffered from pacing issues and characterization. Sometimes, there were scenes that were supposed to be scary but they turned out to be really ridiculous and outlandish. Unlike its predecessor, they didn't really know how to utilize the CGI in the movie, and as a result, it looked a bit fake at certain scenes. In addition to that, the movie was a bit too long.Of course, there were some good things in it as well, such as Pennywise himself. Most of the adult cast gave solid performances. Bill Hader as old Richie Toizer was good. Sometimes there were unsettling scenes, though they weren't that scary.Verdict: despite its mixed reviews, and some issues here and there. It Chapter 2 did a pretty solid closure to the franchise. It has some interesting ideas to bring the table, though it could have been executed a bit better.
Final score: 7 out of 10",It Chapter Two
1116,sarahwood-64752,"IT had me in the first half, not gonna lie.",6,7 September 2019,"I set my expectations very low for this film. I was very disappointed in part one as I disliked the CGI heavy scenes which caused pennywise to lose any personality that Skarsgard attempted to bring to the character. However, the first half of part two is exceptional. The opening scene with Adrian Mellon is gruesome, horrifying and straight out of the book. I wish Andy would've allowed more time for us to be reintroduced to the ""Losers"" as adults but I was okay with the short clips we got of them. Stan's death was painful and I did look away from the screen. The Chinese restaurant scene is perfect- the cast played off of each other, I loved the humor in it and I loved what they chose to do with the fortune cookies. I appreciated that the Ritual of Chud being introduced to Bill by Mike. One of my favorite parts was Henry Bowers seeing the balloon outside of the psych hospital, great re-introduction to him. I did not enjoy the dead Patrick scene- a dead boy underneath a crazy mans bed is scary enough, it wasn't necessary to CGI him to hell.The best pennywise moment in my opinion was with the little girl with the port-wine stain underneath the bleachers. It was creepy and the CGI was at a minimum, I loved seeing Bill show a little personality. The movie took a total turn for me during the Mrs. Kersh scene. It was a great lead up, her peaking around the corners at Bev was very unsettling- and then, the worst CGI'd saggy, gray old lady pops out. I busted out laughing in the middle of the theater. After that scene, the movie lost it for me. I was so beyond  because so many reviewers were saying ""The Bev and Mrs. Kersh scene is terrifying""... I guess we weren't watching the same movie. Granted, this is all subjective but that was probably one of the dumbest scenes I have seen in modern horror.The ending was, okay. I did think that Mike was gonna raise baby pennywise as his own instead of ripping his heart out, but whatever. The biggest issue is the jump scares and the forces horror. Things can be scary without CGI, I wish Andy Mushietti would've realized that.",It Chapter Two

Mostly I was interested in adult versions of the characters. And, you know, they're insanely good. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader and others (sorry, don't remember the names of the actors) - they played just great and, most importantly, when you look at them, I see those same kids from the first film. Well, Bill Skarsgard was quite good, although I still think that Tim Curry coped with the role of clown (namely clown) much better. Separately, I want to praise the director of the film Andres Muschetti. He has a lot of talent and I hope he has a great Hollywood future ahead of him. Picture, music, screamers (though not all) - all at the highest level. The plot, of course, strange, but that's all Stephen king

Featuring some of the authors most cornball horror elements and a baggy, unfocused narrative that strays into juvenile sci-fi at times, for me It is one of King's weaker novels overall.So it's a shame that, with this sequel, the director has failed to marshall the more interesting elements of the source into an effective film. It is overlong, tonally jarring and many of the repetitive scares are like something from a kids TV show - I'm really surprised more hasn't been written about that.I can't deny the calibre of the cast - these are all good actors - but they never play to their strengths, with the exception of James Ransone and Bill Hader, and the adult ensemble fail to gel in the way their young counterparts did in the first film. Between some toe-curling overacting from James McAvoy and Jay Ryan's total charisma vacuum, there isn't much to write home about. There are also big problems with the script and it is ultimately way too long, unfocussed and grossly sentimental.There are some nice elements here and there and I get that Muschietti harbours a great love for the material but this really is an unexceptional film.

I could keep going but you get the idea.So, I thought it was entertaining, fun, and extremely cheesy. Which is okay and of course expected from Hollywood.

The best (horror)movies always give you the feeling that they know how to tell and visualize it's story.

All the emotions, all the flashbacks and the present storyline is everything we needed as an end. Finally i have to admit that King's cameo was brilliant and made the movie way better.

And because of this, the last scene of him adding 'E' for Eddie on the bridge makes you question whether he liked him, or was just grieving. It felt lack luster and like Richie was never able to have a resolve.I'm of the opinion that ambiguous endings is a little lazy in most cases, especially when it comes to a resolve of a character and I wasn't a fan of what they did with Richie, however, that was my only complaint of the film.",It Chapter Two

Because of that I've seen people question Richie's relationship to Eddie, more specifically whether him adding the 'E' on the bridge was because he felt something for him, or if he was just grieving.And because his whole arc was about self-shame, the fact that he never came out made it seem as if he never got a resolve and an end, and as this is a duology and not a trilogy, he never will get a resolve.The ambiguous and implied ending just doesn't cut it for me, and it would have been awesome to see him get an end, it just felt lazy to me.",It Chapter Two

In the first film, the kids were first learning of the monster and had to find time throughout their lives to deal with it. It was hard for the kdis as they were constantly restricted by the family/ school and social elements of their lives, but in this film they are all adults and don't have to deal with those issues. Not to say they have no issues or the ones they do have should be dismissed but it just feels way less engaging to me knowing that at any point they could just up and leave if they so desired.Right from the beginning they have a goal in mind of reuniting and killing the monster again, but they have to spend the whole time meandering around to find each of their special mcguffins before they can do what they came here to do.This is all just used as a way for each of the characters to have a bunch of individual scenes with pennywise, resulting in what feels like way more pennywise moments than the first.I'm sure a lot of people will thoroughly enjoy these moments but for me, as a result of there being so many, they are in turn much shorter and left a much smaller impact on me than the first. I vividly remember the projector scene from the first, I struggle to think of any really memorable scene from this aside from the finale.On that: without spoilers, they keep eluding to the idea that the ending might have been changed from the book as one character is infamously a writer who writes bad endings. I haven't read the book myself but regardless of if they changed the ending or not I still felt a little unsatisfied. It all just begs the question of 'why couldn't they have done that the first time?""And I think that is ultimately my problem with this film, and I know people are not going to like me saying this but i really feel like it does not need to exist. I KNOW it's part of the book and for many a very vital part but It really does feel like the first film just did everything this film did, only better. I heard somewhere that one of the hardest parts of making this film was condensing this second part of the story into only one film, and it does make me wonder if they ultimately split it into 3 parts and gave everything more time it needed to grow it might have been better.One of the things that instantly comes to mind is the ultimately pointless use of the return of Henry Bowers, he is set up early on but before we know it he's done and swept under the rug to be forgotten, If this film was split into 2 I suspect he would have been used better.I guess what I'm trying to say, If I didn't know there was a second part to the story after watching the first film I would have been completely satisfied just believing the first film was it. I don't believe this film and part of the story really adds anything interesting or necessary that enhances the first film. I know this wasn't the case at all but it feels like one of those films where it feels like they have no idea for a sequel in mind and just ended up retreading the first, that is at least how I feel on the matter.",It Chapter Two

Firstly of course it was too long. There was way to much CGI. No offence to Bill Skarsgard but he doesn't hold a candle next to Tim Curry's version of Pennywise. Then you have the insinuation of Richie's feelings toward Eddie, give me strength, that was totally uncalled for.And then of course they go and change the entire ending of the movie.

1162,kintsukana,Full spoilers ahead to save you the headache.,3,10 September 2019,"The three stars are for Bill, the creature design and the CGI budget.So much time is wasted. 20 minutes of nothing but swearing or wooden acting followed by a one or two minute CGI scene that ends in a jumpscare. It's a rinse and repeat formula for the entire movie. The preformances from most of the ""adult"" version actors feels very phoned in. Bill Hader was a terrible choice as was Jessica and the guy that played adult Ben. Wooden and stiff throughout.Thankfully Bill Skarsgård's odd yet terrfying portrayal of Pennywise carried the entire movie, the downside is they've piled so much CGI on top of him it really takes away from the dominant portrayal he had in the first film.
Whoever designed the forms Pennwise takes (aside from the ho-hum zombies) needs a serious raise because this film truly has some really effective monsters in comparison to the first. It's just an absolute shame all the ""scary"" parts are overloaded with CGI, while I understand practical effects can't be used everywhere something more grounded in reality is much more terrifying than the 90,000th movie with 90% computer generated things. Considering all the actors were more than likely forced to act vs a green screen rather than Bill's Pennywise it may explain why the majority of the actors seem to be bored and just reading lines.I also wouldn't consider this a horror movie after sitting through the poorly paced nearly three hours. Long movies don't bother me but them being long AND boring for vast amounts of screen time do. So much comedy has been forced into every other horror scene it's like someone watched a Marvel movie right after watching IT and said ""yeah lets do more of that"". It was a bad call and the movie really suffers from it. There are a few really great scenes such as the old woman's house, and the two with the young children in the first half, funny how with the kids both scenes are mostly actually Bill as Pennywise rather than 90% CGI with Bill's face stuck on it. The same cannot be said for the actual jumpscares.
I know in the original tv miniseries the giant clay-mation spider at the end got a lot of flack, well this version suffers the same fate except instead of clay-mation it's some hastily done you guessed it CGI. The ending is really so farcical that the threater errupted in laughter at Pennywise being ""bullied to death"". I am 100% ALL for an anti-bullying message but this is supposed to be a horror movie for adults not Naruto where love and friendship wins the day. You will be rolling your eyes during the last act and the superly hard forced ""sad moment"" feels very cheap because of it.Very disappointing after having the expectations after the first movie set so high, save your money and stream it.PS: Stan Lee is the epitomy of the creator making a cameo appearance in movies, it seems now that the man has passed on others want to get in on it. Next time Steve, leave the acting to the actors and just say no. Such an unnessesary cameo.",It Chapter Two

Obviously the 1st movie was a bit childish let's say kinda bored me too but i said there is no way i am not going to watch chapter 2 and i was right.
Excellent actors the choice in actors is excellent the comic relief was a bit too much some times and they were more than 5-6 times we laughed but it was on point, After all the main antagonst is a clown clowns are meant to be kinda funny in this way. If you watch this movie as a movie that wants to play a bit with your mind or something it's really a good movie had some nice jumpscares but i do believe we witnessed too much before even watching half of the movie but that's not the thing. I might wanted a bit more hardcore scenes but in general if you forget the tags that a movie receives it was actually a very pleasant movie even if it lasted 3 hours.

I enjoyed this a lot, but the adult actors (with the exception of Bill Hader, he stole the show) were honestly just not as engaging, and Pennywise was not as entertaining to watch. He almost felt like a filler character who popped up at times rather than the central looming enemy that was always ""in"" the scene, even if not physically present.

The effects on all the different monsters seemed weird and out of place. The ending was confusing and very disappointing.

Bill Hader is my favorite character in this movie.. He done an awesome job! Laugh my Ass off!

1175,Kakesphere,What exactly happened here?,6,7 September 2019,"I have looked forward to ITC2 since the credits rolled on the first, and thought the spirit of IT 1 matched the best parts of the novel and the miniseries.I am so sad to, at this point, be unable to recommend the second. (Ymmv, as I was toggling between the events onscreen and the voice in my head that kept thinking things would get better.)The ""worst"" parts of the first film, the episodic beat of the encounters with Pennywise, as well as the CG, are writ larger in Chapter 2, with graphics being the worst offender. (Where there were just a couple tetchy moments in IT 1, there are gobs in 2.) Together these two elements bloat, neuter, and generally disable this movie from about 30-40 minutes in all the way through to the end.The adult losers are all fine actors, but the vocals (accent/dialect/whatchamacallit) could've been coached much better than they were for those from across the pond. Sadly this was true even for a particular actor who's got to be among the best in the biz. Muscle-memory-wise, I felt like Isaiah Mustafa and Andy Bean (however little he was on screen) matched the performances of their Chapter 1 counterparts the best. But due to script choices and the abundance of flashbacks, some other characters/actors never even got the chance.And oh, the flashbacks. I'd read that they had to budget to de-age the kids, but even with help those differences were distracting. Had they reduced these scenes instead of mainlining them throughout, it wouldn't have been an issue for me.In all, Chapter 2 felt like a different film entirely, which I get is what was supposed to happen. But rather than two apposite halves that somehow make a whole, this half felt blander, safer, more cynical, and about as energetic as a tree snail.Will I still get it on BluRay? . . . I plead the fifth.",It Chapter Two
1176,tineshnairmogan,CHAPTER 2 WITH AN IMPRESSIVE ENDING,7,14 September 2019,"POSITIVE (PROS)
After two years of waiting for the second movie of the franchise, It Chapter 2 has come to cinemas. I expected more horror than the first one and it did fulfilled it. The story of how the first movie scenes which were connected to the actions developed in the second movie are well screenplayed by the team.The actors acted in the film can be seen as they well known studied about their characters in order to be connected to its audience from the first chapter. For example, Eddie's fear on helping his friends when pennywise strikes them. In addition, Richie's human sense that made audience engaged to the character to his hilarious dialogues and making fun of his friend. That's brought life of the characters of the child actors to the adulthood. James McAvoy as Billy has a standing ovation and the cast chosen are reasonable for the movie demands.Horror sequences are well made and make the audience to the edge of their seats especially the arrival of Pennywise to hunt the main characters in the movie.The movie also focuses the spirit of a team of friendship that represents their togetherness. The scenes in the movie will make the audience to remember their childhood lives and to be together with their old friends. This could be another plus point for the movie to be more emotional and message giving movie besides horror.
NEGATIVE (CONS)
The run time of the movie is a minor con that could be minimize by avoiding several scenes in the movie sequences. The dragging of the screenplay that made the movie to be 2 hours 50 minutes which is longer than the first chapter of 2 hours 26 minutes. Scenes such as the horror sequences of the Losers meeting point which is the chinese restaurant can be cut to shrink down the time.The ending of the movie where the Losers make pennywise to be weak in order to kill it can be improvised as the larger half clown-insect legged horrifying pennywise shoudln't be dead by only listening to the negative words of shringking him to be small in order to kill it. This is because pennywise is a powerful character and its capabilties. The ending of killing it can be done as the Losers may have weapons to kill it and take its heart instead of saying and cursing it with just words to make it small and easy to be killed.CONCLUSION
It: Chapter is a wonderful ending of the franchise and it still makes a wonderful box office collection. It is a fun-filled, horrifying and more hilarious minor scenes that brings you a whole package to the audience.",It Chapter Two

1178,mrgums-87207,Well delivered,10,6 September 2019,"I saw this earlier and really loved it. It indeed did have some comedy-like scenes but I felt it was comedic release. I really did enjoy seeing Stephen King play a small role in the movie as he did with several previous movies. Bill Skarsgård was phenomenal, so glad he didn't turn down the role for the second movie. I felt like some of the funny stuff was the adults trying to reflect on their past without being so serious. They were remembering their childhood after all and the last time the characters were together was when they were kids so they acted based on their good childhood memories such as joking around about mothers and stuff kids their age do and had done last time they were together. The only disappointment was Pennywise not being on the moon when Henry Bowers was in the mental facility. I really wanted to see Skarsgård's face and voice on the moon. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will probably see it a second time in theaters.",It Chapter Two
1179,martinmalave,"enjoyable, funny, but less scary than the first",7,6 September 2019,"It's faithfull to the book and that's good and that's why i think that, althought this movie is good, the first one is better. in the book, the adults part is the ""least interesting"" and they try to make to make up it here, and they do it very good. i liked it a lot and the performances are very good, the direction is also very good and has its own style, but it's less scary and longer, you get tired in the last minutes, it is not a jewel but it is very good",It Chapter Two
1180,alaisdair-68338,Disappointing doesn't begin to describe it,4,14 October 2020,"The highly anticipated sequel to the first film comes with a huge 3 hour run time that flips between the adult losers and their younger counterparts as they return to Derry to destroy It who has returned after 27 years and begun kidnapping children again. While the adult cast offers a broad range of talent and they all deliver outstanding performances, the long run time allows for a lot of filler making you feel every single minute in the film's incredibly show second act. The scares are still here but have been dialed back to be more creepy than scary. Fortunately Bill Skaarsgard's performance as Pennywise is still as unsettling and terrifying as ever and is worth the price of admission alone.It's been 27 years since The Losers defeated IT, forcing it back to its slumber and while all of them have left the town (bar Michael) their memories of Pennywise and the atrocities they endured have become a faded and distant memory. When a river of missing bodies are washed up in the river at Derry, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) who has been monitoring the activity since the others left. When he convinces them all to return after 27 years Beverley (Jessica Chastain), BIll (James McAvoy), Ben (Jay Ryan), Eddie (James Ransone) and Stanley (Andy Bean) arrive back in Derry to regain their memories and destroy It once and for all.The film has a 3 hour run time which for any movie is a big ask for an audience to sit through, particularly only after one film. While the first film was a huge success it does feel a bit much to ask fans to sit through 3 hours of the concluding chapter. There were times I thought a third movie may have been more appropriate, however there is a lot of filler scenes, particularly in the second act that could have easily been scrapped and weigh the film down before ramping up to the final showdown. The film allows each character to have several interactions with Pennywise and while one would be enough, by the third time it happens it fuels into overkill and you start to feel every minute of the film.Factoring in the above, there is a distinct change in the level of horror in the this. While it is still present, it feels severely dialled back compared to the first film with the film being more creepy and eery as opposed to the scary horror dished out previously. If you are looking at this as a standalone film then the horror elements are there but if you compare it to the first film it pales in comparison. This can also be attributed to the introduction of humour that has a hit and miss effect. Fortunately Hader balances the line perfectly but when other characters try it misses the mark and a lot of echoes and awkward silences in the cinema followed.
The young cast of the original movie return as the story drifts between past and present. Diving into what happened after they defeated Pennywise the first time, their relationships and how they changed is a great offset to the story of the adult Loser club. The young actors all again bring their A game to this second part and a fleeting but terrifying appearance from Georgie actor Jackson Robert Scott is truly effective as a quick scene provides one of the more terrifying parts of the movie.Effects wise the CGI that is overused in the film (for necessary reasons) goes from laughable at the start to gloriously epic in the balls out finale that will blow your mind. While I don't want to spoil anything the explosion of illusions in the final moments of the film do make this journey worth it. It just takes a bit longer than it should have.
It Chapter Two boasts an incredible cast but by trying to stay faithful to the source material (namely the book) is fleshed out with a run time that could easily be carved back or adapted into a third instalment to save the film from the middle act slog. Fortunately the performances from the cast both young and old are spectacular and while the jokes don't always land from other characters who aren't Hader, scenes that will become integral to this adaption are the reunion dinner at the chinese restaurant that boasts a chemistry that is undeniable. The Losers re-discovering their fortress as adults and flashing back to their unveiling when they were children is incredible storytelling. While these elements are great, particularly for a horror film, the toned down scares are turned to the creep factor make for a less engaging experience if you are looking for pure horror.",It Chapter Two

The story wouldn't change if they took out all the part where the losers try to find there special artifact or something. I felt like the story went in too many directions and it felt messy.

He looses all his powers, because someone called him an ugly clown! And thats just half an hour of this film, the rest of it was story telling, that kept going on and on about who they were in the last movie, and why they have came, so practically 2 hours of this show is just wasting time on who they were!

My only complaint is the overt use of CGI, which in some scenes felt artificial. Bill Hader was spot-on as Richie Tozier.

Atmosphere and music were cool to and the movie makes a few interesting points about growing up, fear and friendship. (Often a little on the nose tbf)What I didnt like was the use of splatter effects and horror elements, especially since they did not really work.

1219,Personian,"It 2 Beautay? Yes, By Caesar's Ghost.",8,24 November 2019,"I think of ""Annabelle"" and ""Stranger Things"" as the beginning of the cinematic encroachment on children. If there's any part of these two films defined as something that couldn't have been made even a few years ago, it's not the special effects. It's the graphic depiction of violence against kids. Or sexual violence. Or child sexualization. But this film also stars Jessica Chastain, who on her own would have steered this right, if ""It: Chapter Two"" were not clearly shaped by healthy input from all the marvelous actors. Their moral compass may have helped to keep this film's tone absolutely solid throughout a tangle of issues. (And if you know the book, you know it's not their fault.)Now I always see horror films in terms of cruelty versus sincerity, both with the filmmakers and with the audience. Horror is mostly about cruelty, but the stand it takes on that issue defines a film (and filmmaker) (and audience) for me. This movie is trying to straddle both worlds. It mostly succeeds. These days tone is all-important to filmmakers, since any movie that sucks tonally is going to suck overall, regardless of how good it is. (Fellini was especially prone to this, I think. Try watching ""Juliet Of The Spirits"".) These days studios have all stepped up to the challenge, and here we see a great example of walking the tightrope and not losing balance. If a moment seems about to devolve into being unintentionally funny, the movie usually seizes that opportunity to do something *intentionally* funny. The cruel people will laugh, and the sincere people will take it as grotesque. Considering that a good third of either installment is just a rush of plot points, maintaining a trustworthy tone is quite a feat.Is it scary? If you're daring it to scare you, no. (Movies don't scare you if you're daring them to.) But at a slow burn, it's there. (For adults. Do *not* let little kids watch this. If they take it at a slow burn it could be traumatizing.) Horror has developed since the wave of gore films in the 80s to things like torture and jump scares, and seems to now be landing on nightmare. I think that's the wisest thing horror could do. (More properly, it's landed on nightmare and cruelty. ""Hereditary"" is a good example of horror that I'm sure only plays properly to sadists.) ""It: Chapter Two"" doesn't just fend off unintentional comedy, or just fend off someone's expectations of a scary image, there's a feeling of recognition in these scary images. Mining nightmares yields up the most universal symbols of fear. Those are the horror scenes we've all actually been in before. And since nightmares are common scenes we all nonetheless write ourselves, if one of us writes that out to a script, we should be witnessing our own inner lives. That's part of why it could really hurt kids, if they see it. As constructed as it is, it's very real.",It Chapter Two

By no means was this movie amazing/ a perfect 10/10 but I still found it pretty enjoyable. Don't go into this movie expecting to be terrified, as it was mostly jump scares and felt like a comedy during a lot of the scenes of the movie. Most of these comical moments coming from Bill Hader's character, who I feel like stood out the most from the others as I enjoyed all of his scenes. The casting of the adult losers club was phenomenal as they all had a striking resemblance to their younger counterparts. Bill Skarsgard did a great job playing Pennywise once again although a lot of the things Pennywise was doing was extremely weird.(Like when he sung and danced in front of Richie near the giant statue.) The scene under the bleachers, and in the fun house creeped me out the most, probably because it involved the death of children, and Skarsgard's performance. I will say, I found the ending to the final battle a little underwhelming considering all the losers club had to do was trash talk him to weaken and defeat him. My man Pennywise wouldn't have survived an old school call of duty lobby. Overall, a fun, and at some points trippy movie that I recommend seeing if you enjoyed the first film.",It Chapter Two

Way too long, way too goofy, it relies too much on comedy for some reason than anything else, the CGI monsters were so goofy looking they weren't even scary, the acting was over the top and just everything about it was just so unsatisfying. how useless and unnecessary they made Henry Bowers. In the book he plays a key role, here he's just a crazy dude that just happens to be there. God this is the most disappointing sequel I've seen in a long time. The ending was horrendous too, in the miniseries and book it's not as bad as everyone say it is (though the miniseries was kind of lame) but the ending to this one was so silly and I just hated it. I also don't get how critics were saying Richie's secret romantic love for Eddie was also in the book, I didn't think that at all. It wasn't even ambiguous. Such a disappointment for a sequel to a horror movie I loved (It the 2017 one) and it sucks because I worship the book and I had high hopes for this one.

1269,ngmb,This movie trash,3,10 September 2019,"I've never taken the time to review a film on IMDb before but I needed somewhere to vent about the almost 3 hours of my life I'm not going to get back.Let's start with that, the length. This movie is longer than all The Hobbit films, and just about the length of the first two lord of the rings films, and it had no right or reason to be. There were so many subplots, and characters who's inclusion was clearly for no reason other than ""it happened in the book"". Dude, it's a film ADAPTATION, cutting the little sideplots that have no real relevance to the main characters or story is part of your job in adapting the book. Perhaps if you were doing a longform tv show adaptation, you could get away with it, but not here. Furthermore, the film spends an unreasonable amount of time showing us flashbacks of stuff we've already seen, or reexplaining plot we already know from the first chapter. To add to this, there are several ""scary"" scenes that felt entirely secondary to the main story, but seem to have only been left in because there hasn't been a scare in a while or because the movie needed more Pennywise, and that leads me to my next point...The movie isn't scary. It isn't creepy, it isn't tense, it's rarely even horrifying because of how predictable it ends up. The scares are all comprised of the consistently most formulaic jump scares I've ever scene, or big huge monsters crafted with poor CGI, that removes the rare shred of tension and believability the scenes had left.Finally, let's get to the Loser's club. Yes, the casting was great, and yes the performances were decent. Good job CD and actors, you're probably the sole reason I'm giving this thing any stars. That being said, I still didn't really care about any of these characters. The movie's success is hinged on the relationships of these characters, as that's what takes up the majority of what's left of the runtime when you take out the subplots. Unfortunately, it fails to be compelling because aside from a brief reintroduction to the characters and where they ended up (the most enjoyable part of the film), the movie doesn't tell us anything about these people we don't already know. Perhaps this was the reasoning behind the added flashbacks (with terrible de-aging on Finn Wolfhard that rivals Superman's Justice League moustache), but yet again, these scenes did very little to advance the characters in any way from what we already knew of them.I didn't have high expectations for this movie (I thought the first was a fun little movie, but nothing special) however it still managed to disappoint me in almost every regard. Do yourself a favour and go watch The Shining again instead.",It Chapter Two
1270,ricardo_naud,"Awful, not even close to the first movie",2,5 September 2019,"I liked the first movie, it was entertaining, well done and had some good jump scares. This second movie, however, is awful. I had to come in here and write my review after the movie to bring some justice-- don't trust the rating! The first movie is far, far better than this. As for the movie, it begins nicely, but after the first monsters in CGI appear it just goes downhill-- I honestly couldn't believe how ridiculous and bad the CGI was, seriously. It didn't seem to match the movie so far and sure as hell didn't blend with the live action on screen. It was forgivable though, especially with the joke soon afterwards.
Unfortunately, the movie does not get better. The majority of it is spent in scenes that are ""individual to each character"", which I will not go into detail to avoid spoilers. But they are boring, not scary and do not add to the plot. Hey, I thought we were going to see a group effort to get rid of Pennywise, right? Like in the first movie! But no, I guess the writers fell short and had to make up a stupid excuse to make movie with these stupid individual scenes. After several of those, it seemed like it was finally moving forward, but it just went on and on and on... I did my best effort to stay as much as I could because I wanted to see the conclusion, but after 2 hours of this nonsense, geez... what a test of patience! It has been a long time since I've walked out of a theater during a movie, but I couldn't stay for the end of this one. It came to a point where my patience was stretched enough to the point of no return. I walked out of the theater with a little over 2 hours in the movie.

SFX / Sound Design: Powerful, interesting
Pacing: Not rushed
Casting: Unbelievable (might be the first time you'd think ""they got it right"")
VFX: Far beyond expectation in execution and artistry
Originality: Meets expectations, exceeds projections
Transitions: Synchronous, hypnotic
Emotional shifts: Rich, if not slightly exhaustingThe scares were exhilarating and did not leave the imagination wanting for any greater payoff than what was abundantly delivered.
The scare-reveals far exceeded expectation in their detail, artistry and morbidity.
The score was markedly brilliant and matched the theatrical expectation of a cinematic experience.
The sound design and voice modulation SFX were crisp, with rich harmonics, overtones and punchy bass.
The casting decisions prove: that careful effort will produce amazing results
for continuity-in-storytelling and suspension of disbelief; expertly executed here -in multiple ways.The presentation of victimization by the antagonist is so talent-fully executed,
the audience feels split between sadness and satisfaction as characters meet their demise.One scene, truly emulates what it might be like for a mammal to act like a reptile;
and how it might go about doing so -right at the exact moment its prey finds itself
entirely inside that predator's kill zone (cheers to the actor, director and editor).This film genuinely straddled two incompatible worlds fluidly; one of horror, shock, torment and terror; with another of actuality per how humans speak and think, how they make decisions differently from each other, and somehow too;
a parallel world where humor remains a legitimate mode of thought even despite
any level of absurdity-of-circumstance.This film can be watched -easily once every year and half or so, with friends or by oneself; and not be bored. Other films like 2001, The Goonies, Caddyshack -all also have this quality.The theater staff DID float a red helium filled balloon inside the room during the film; causing the words ""oh (hell) no, oh (hell) no..."" to be audible from folks in the back of the theater LOL!All in all; very satisfying.

Myself and my wife watched Chapter 1 and 2 back-to-back over the bank holiday weekend: the way to do it I'd recommend. A lot of my friends who watched both in cinemas 2 years a part were disappointed because they went in hoping for more of the Losers Club which they remembered enjoying so much in 1st film, but what they saw was very different to the 1st, as we're dealing with adults now. But I'd argue that's a good thing. Having come straight off the back of Chapter 1, I was ready for a different type of feeling, more grown up movie. And boy do we get that right from the shockingly scary grotesque unfortunately very true opening sequence that let's us know we're not dealing with rock throwing bullies from 1st movie. This is now the real world. From there we're introduced to all our grown up characters and boy do they shine: perfectly cast, especially Eddie the nervous germaphobe boy. From the very satisfying intro we're quickly thrown back into the world of IT we're all familiar with. But the sequel ups it a notch exploring more of IT who delightfully has more trauma of the now grown up losers club to dwell on and playing with to terrify our characters. We also get some welcomed timed flashbacks to the kids' Loser Club new 80's scenes. The kids are noticibly older which some ropey de-aging visual and voice effects try to work around the male kids' broken-voices, which does throw you off slightly as your brain tells you something is wrong. But not enough to ruin movie and TBH I'd rather have the kids back than not, so they did a good job considering. Back to the adults and I revelled in the individual scares they're taken through as they have to revisit their childhood and IT who is now delightfully more evil as Bill S chews up the scenery. Horror effects a joy to watch with great mixture of cgi and practical effects, and homages back to classic horror movies like The THING and the Shining: clear influences on the director. A joyfully self-aware Stephen King cameo is welcomed. And the ending extremly satisfying which I won't ruin but just to say it fixes the main problem with the original TV movie, and possibly even the book (I haven't read so can't comment except for reviews I've read), which they hint at throughout the movie in fun quips to how King often struggles with happy endings. But this one, much like King's movie adaptation of the Mist, is a very satisfying conclusion for different reasons. Overall an extremely entertaining sequel that's just different enough from the 1st but which wraps up at end making us feel nostalgic to watch the 1st again, which I'm looking forward to in a year's time I think. Thank you Stephen King for keeping us scared while always reminding us about the beauty of life.",It Chapter Two

I was so excited when the remake came out. Thinking it would definitely be an improvement with so much new technology.
Unfortunately that is one of the things I think sunk this movie . Too much reliance on really bad visual effects that didn't make much sense to the storyline. The over use of CGI and cheap scares made this movie nearly unwatchable . The movie got lost in all of the silly scare tactics ,when it should have relied more on the emotional connection of the characters , especially with the cast it had .
Both the young actors and their grown up counterparts acted their hearts out, but even that couldn't save the poor writing and directing of this movie . Bill Hader is hilarious and a big reason I was drawn to sit through over 2 hours of this nonsense . But a large quantity of poorly timed jokes and one liners was something even Bill Hader couldn't quite overcome. What could have been a kind of touching scene of Richie finally figuring out at the end ,that he loved Eddie all along, elicited nothing more than a blank stare and shrug from this audience ,because the rest of the movie was mind numbing and left us all exhausted. Not to mention thankful we didn't pay to see this in theatre! I am sorry for anyone who did spend their hard earned cash on this.
2 more things before put this review out of its misery .
One , what was with the very disturbing display of homophobia and a horrific hate Crimea's the beginning that no one in the town seemed to care about? You know , the one that went absolutely nowhere and was pointless ? Why? What was the point in throwing that very serious real life issue in there ,as if it were nothing ? In a movie filled with disappointments this is amongst the worst offenders .
Two, in spite of it all, Bill skarsguard is a genius and even faced with a very lacking script , did a great job at playing the menacing and very naughty pennywise , down to his last breath.
I gave one star for Skarsegaurd and the other for the rest of the actors that tried so very hard in this film.

1291,onekingprods-54469,A Messy Screenplay Makes for an Unfocused Film...,5,7 September 2019,"What many folks are picking up on is that Chapter 2 lacks the focus and atmosphere of Chapter 1. It's very busy, yet it never seems to actually establish a connection with the characters as adults, nor expand the mythos of Pennywise and Derry much further than what was done in Chapter 1. Further, there were plenty of scenes in the film that didn't serve to move the story forward, and could easily have been excised, allowing the movie to feel a bit tighter.People like to poke fun at the 1990 miniseries, but, for all its foibles, I have to say that it created a better sense of tense atmosphere in Chapter 2, told a more cohesive story, and used Pennywise to greater effect. Plus, the adults seemed more fleshed out and sympathetic and were all given moments to allow you to really connect with them and root for them. Finally, in the miniseries, I have to admit it was nice not hearing f-bombs every 2 seconds and having to deal with typical woke Hollywood virtue signaling.So, while Chapter 1 gave us great characters, great story, and great atmosphere, Chapter 2 almost completely fails in all 3 categories. If you think you can wait a few months for Blu-ray and streaming, I would recommend it.

I found chapter two to be a bit weak for several reasons:1) The origin story of IT seemed a bit weak and left more questions than answers. However it's a key part of the story for its conclusion, so it is what it is.
2) It felt like more CG was used and obvious in this chapter. This is probably due to the transformations of IT were larger this time around for the adult characters.
3) The movie was nearly 3 hours and there were several times I wish it would just end.
4) Pennywise (the clown) felt like a backseat character. Instead we focus more on the kids/adults, which at points drags on.
5) Some scenes felt unnecessary including the bleachers and funhouse scenes (I know this contradicts the last point :p)
6) The slow burn ending seems a bit cheesy. Horror movies deserve an abrupt, and uncomfortable ending to keep you thinking after.
7) Predictable jump scares where the camera pans back and forth. The most terrifying scenes in the movie were when Pennywise would just give a blank, uncomfortable stare.However! I still enjoyed it for what it was. Pennywise is a great villain/monster character.

1296,coreyjameshines,Missed the mark,5,27 November 2019,"*Spoilers
I haven't read the book but I felt they got the Henry Bowers character all wrong. He worked in the first film because he was a villain grounded in reality, he represented everything wrong with the town of Derry.
Take the opening scene, contextually it felt misplaced. If the hate crime was instigated by Henry Bowers, and he was tied into the story through the arc of Richie, it might've worked. But as it is the scene seems ill fitting. The tone jumps from very bleak to camp almost instantly.
It worked when they were kids, not as adults.
What does work in Chapter Two is the scenes in which Pennywise is human. Like for instance the make up scene, or the old lady. Henry Bowers should've remained the cold and callous character he was before. The embodiment of IT's tyrannical hold.
These characters had a whole movie to set their arc, they fear more than zombies and spiders and those fears are based in reality. Which is exactly what the opening scene was trying to set up, It falls flat. If they ran with the same tone and actually gave it weight to the story, It might've been a better film, who knows.",It Chapter Two

Also the parts that are supposed to be scary come across as silly because they have so many huge CGI monsters. This movie also resorts to cheap jumpscares for horror and the atmosphere isn't as nuanced as the first.However, the acting is fantastic and the casting is perfect. All the adults look and act exactly like their younger counterparts, to the point where I forgot they weren't the same people. The characters are definitely the main thing driving this movie. All the scenes with them together are just fantastic. The weakest parts of the movie were the ones where they split up.This movie's also way more accurate to the book than the original tv movie and it selves into more of the lore a little bit.Sometimes this movie reminded me of Evil Dead 2, which can be a good thing or a bad thing for different people",It Chapter Two

For the most part, he just channels one of his characters from Split and gets paid heavily for it. There is no suspense, no surprise, just clever CGI that fails to scare or horrify.

The casting was pretty spot on with most of the adult actors having remarkable resemblances to the child actors but I couldn't say I felt any connection with them as adults as when they were children. Flashback scenes saw the youngsters had all shot up a good 2ft, a splash of cgi and some terrible dubbing to make the boys sound like their previously unbroken voices left me cringing.
I was hoping for a little more from Pennywise and for him to really go for it with the scares but various manifestations received more giggles than screams.
All this just seemed to take away the credibility from chapter one.
And the plan to defeat Pennywise was something cooked up in 100 other 80's horror flicks complete with ancient Indian burial ground.

The story however, not so much.
The first 100 minutes are spent mostly on reliving the past rather than developing the present. The only thing that keeps the audience intrigued are the jump scares. The rest is mildly entertaining and provides a very forgettable plot. So it is a 7/10 as strong casting made a huge difference in the final presentation.

1324,larrydelacruzph,A Satisfying Final Act,8,4 September 2019,"As a massive fan of the first chapter, I counted down the days until I get to feast my eyes on the closing segment of the saga. And while CHAPTER 2 certainly delivers on ramping up the production (more blood, brutal kills, intricate set pieces) a compelling aspect of the first part was sorely missing.What made CHAPTER ONE absolutely bone-chilling was that the terror wasn't confined to Pennywise alone, but by other residents of this mysterious town who are hellbent on terrorizing these poor kids. From the adults to the parents to the bullies, fear was at every turn, and the killer clown was more than happy to exploit this.And while it does occasionally touch upon this in this second half (the brutal hate crime, the bullied little girl with the birthmark) that element seems to be discarded altogether, giving the viewer less chance to feel absolute dread for the new batch of victims in this go around.Of course, they are not the focus of the story. With the grown-up Losers Club returning to Derry with all their baggage in hand, the horror seems surface-level, at times even comical and groan-inducing. You don't really get the teeth of the terror, as in-your-face as the brutality may be.What does translate is the tremendous chemistry between the actors much like the cast of its' predecessor. There is a fair amount of levity (albeit misplaced at times) that equals the first chapter and a genuine sense of camaraderie between the actors. The highs are high and the lows are heartbreaking.Shortcomings aside, its still a fitting end to a saga that deals with some heavy topics coupled with effective scares and even a dose of heart. It's not even a question of ""is it worth watching?"" If you've seen the first one, the answer simply is ""yes"".",It Chapter Two

Stanley did not sacrifice himself, he was just a coward and why did they make ITs true for half a clown?? Its meant to be a full blown alien spider type thing!

1329,thesimplecritic,"Long, Drawn out and Underwhelming",5,16 September 2019,"It was always going to be difficult to successfully follow up the 2017 film, but this sequel falls well short of the original. With a massive 2hr 50min runtime this film is 45 minuets longer than the original and it feels every bit longer, this is due to the poor pacing of the film as it insists on visiting each characters fear once again for what feels like 20 minutes each, which gets very repetitive, very quickly, it's because of this pacing I found myself disconnected and often checking my watch. Without trying to spoil anything, the story is incredibly familiar to the first film and gave the feeling of watching a poorly re-hashed version of the 2017 film, but just with adults instead of children. I also failed to find this film particularly scary, its starts out well with some good jump scares, but the movies scares quickly become predictable and lose their effect, and the role of It or Pennywise felt much larger than in the other film and this greater screen time of the titular character led to his presence on screen lose meaning and fail to invoke the same sort of fear.However, it's not all negative with this film, the casting of this film is outstanding with the adult's likeness to some of the children being almost scary, with Eddie played by James Ransome being the almost the spitting image of his younger counterpart. The acting is also great in this film with all the main cast performing very well, Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the clown is outstanding again, unfortunately the good acting cannot make up for the poor writing and poor pacing, leading this film to fall very flat.5/10",It Chapter Two

1331,aGlassofCinema_com,It... should have been way better,5,19 September 2019,"Full disclosure, the original Stephen King novel It is something I talk about with great reverence. The 1000-something page book is a fantastic piece of horror fiction for a lot of reasons. So perhaps I'm being too harsh when I say that It: Chapter Two fails to meet the standard set by both the book and the first film in the duology, and frankly is not really worth your time.Chapter Two picks up 27 years after the 2017 movie, and Pennywise has returned to continue his Derry-based buffet. Mike Hanlon (played by Old-Spice-commercial legend Isaiah Mustafa) never left the town since the original ""Losers Club"" thought they beat the monster. After he finds a blood soaked message, he calls his old friends one by one to bring them back to defeat the monster once and for all. After reuniting and remembering one another, they are sent off to find ""tokens"" from their past somewhere in town in order to complete the ritual of Chüd that will hopefully put Pennywise in the proverbial ground.The above ensemble cast play the grown up versions of the kids from the last film, and do a fairly good job. When they're together and they aren't mostly screaming, the chemistry between them is great. Bill Skarsgård is still absolutely horrifying as Pennywise... when director Andrés Muschietti actually uses him in the film. There is one particular scene (partially featured in the trailer) where he lures a little girl below the bleachers of an ongoing little league game. She quickly realizes that he's not someone to be trusted, causing him to begin to cry and explain that no one likes him because of his scary makeup. The girl happens to have a large birthmark on her face, and she tells Pennywise she understands because people make fun of her face too! They laugh, and suddenly he promises to blow that mark right off her face... on the count of three! Oneeeeeee, twoooooooo, and then there's a 3 second beat of silence where Pennywise says nothing and only drools and stares..... before HE EATS HER FACE. The scene is a fantastic example of what the movie could have been. Its a travesty that he barely has any other opportunities in the movie to monologue like this, and is instead relegated to lines like ""kiss me fat boy"". It feels like the character could have reached the heights of a psychotic Hannibal Lecter. But alas, not in this adaptation.Aside from a segment with a creepy old lady and another in a dimly lit hall of mirrors, nothing in the near three hour run time ever again comes close to this moment, and is mostly jump scares populated by CGI monsters. It's predictable yet exhausting for the viewer. Stories like It have the opportunity to affect terror and long-lasting fear through slow burn scares like the segment above. But the movie falls into a predictable and tiresome formula: character is alone, they hear a voice, they proceed to an isolated area, the music swells enough to make my ears hurt, cue jump scare, character runs away, end scene. The first movie is like this as well, so if you're here for more of the same you might be satisfied. However one difference that doesn't help the movie is that the tone is all over the place. It was clearly a horror movie, while Chapter Two has a multitude of one liners and awkward directing choices that cut through the tension and deflate many of the scenes. Is it a drama comedy? A fantasy epic? I'm still not sure.There are also a few minor changes that I found to be distracting and unwarranted, one of which involves Richard Tozier (played by Bill Hader) who is suggested to be gay. This seems like a blatant attempt to make the movie ""socially relevant"", and while multiple scenes dropped hints, they added absolutely no value to the story. It makes even less sense when you note there was absolutely no mention or suggestion of this in the first movie. Another issue is that the numerous flashbacks of the Losers Club were riddled with de-aging CGI effects, which was super distracting and made the fear more difficult to appreciate on the faces of the kids. It was like they'd all gotten Botox injections right before they filmed their scenes.So to summarize, the music is annoying, the scares are cheap, it's not even a horror movie, and worst of all, the star himself has no opportunity to shine. For a movie that should be about floating, it spends most of its time sinking.",It Chapter Two

First off, 2 hours and 49 minutes?? Lengthy movies like this try way to hard to be something they are not. I was a huge fan of the original1990 mini series. Although the second part, when they are all grown up, is way worse, both in the original and the remake. This movie was just awful. They tried to incorporate modern day virtue signals, with lame jokes and put the horror in a subcategory. Hate these movies that try to appeal to everyone. When they do that they are putting their middle finger to fans of horror. I am not a fan of CGI either. Movies like this and all the terrible comic book movies, are just low-low hanging fruit or a money grab; they rely on special effects only, and forget about the plot, the character development, the soundtrack and the actual genre. The original 1990 version, is vastly superior, it is scarier, has better music, has better actors, and has a good ended. Also I hated the ending. I hate when these unoriginal remakes, have like 3 different endings back to back to back. Hollywood is dead. No more good writers. No more good movies. When you try to be relevant and make a movie for a small minority of people, you are going to end up with a horrible movie. I read some of the others reviews on this cite and I would say more people didn't like it than did. And they still gave it 6 stars. And to get back to why the first 15 minutes of the movie seemed familiar to me, it was because I had rented it last year and I remembered I turned it off because of its horribleness. I thought I'd give it another shot but nope. Always go with your gut. I usually like to give at least one positive note when writing reviews, but I couldn't find one for this crap movie.

Is it to sell tickets? Weak script so if you make 'em laugh, they'll like it more kind of attitude? Frankly I find it pretty bizarre and distasteful to focus more on comedy than horror when it comes to this particular story. The stakes are too high to be telling jokes. People literally die with one liners being their last lines of dialogue...wtf.
Not to say that it's ALL negatives here. There are some great moments hidden amongst the wreckage. The acting for the most part was pretty solid, within the more realistic and emotional moments. But we don't need one liners during situations of legitimate freakish danger...it doesn't work. If our protagonists don't seem to be scared, why should we be?
All in all, it's worth a watch, but sadly left me wanting more from a franchise that I personally felt fell into the same formula working for studios these days (Marvel I'm talking to you, etc). Let's make jokes. Lots of jokes. My family and friends are dying all around me...at least I saved money on my car insurance by switching to Geico kind of formula.

You'll see what I mean when you see it.And from there it just didn't come together beautifully, like it did in the first installment for me.Yes lots of CGI, which added to the over the top element. Felt more like just a bunch of cheap jump scares versus building up to key moments. It was missing so much magic of the first installment.Even the actors, who are a great cast, felt slightly mistimed. There were many times where you knew they were trying to establish some connection because of their history together, but it came across as a delivered line rather than an emotional connection and believable.It just didn't come together and close off what should have been an amazing ending with the storytelling and buy-in to the characters.

The looks and their acting is uncanningly similar. Kudos to casting. Bill Skarsgård has delivered an amazing thrilling clown performance as before. The movie is about as frightening as last one with often jump scares and gross gore details. Comedy is a high element in this second part by portraying it in words and actions equal. However, use of zombie make-up or graphics feels a tad bit more than required and backfires couple of times removing horror from serious scenes. There is an unexpected special appearance which fits well. Also, there are a few easter eggs or trivial similarities that remind you of previous works of Stephen King.

It lacks the same charisma and chemistry the Losers had and the dread pennywise instilled in the first part. Even with a long runtime the the adult cast gets less screen time and even more so together. This leaves the children cast to do the heavy lifting around their frienship in flashbacks and a constant reminder to the mastery of the first movie. Having already scared us the first time, pennywise gets less screen and even fewer scares. Yes this dampens the very essence of the story; the Losers and Pennywise. Yet the story arc is the best among a lot of horror movies. The characters are neatly tied together where each loser gets their moment and their sunshine(atleast for the survivors) still seems earned. So kudos to the author himself. May be a parallel storyline as per the book made the book equally impactful. It is still remains one of the few horror movies to cherish.",It Chapter Two

However, I implore people to really give this movie a chance. This is one of THE best horror movies I've seen and was shocked it was so good even as a sequel. My rule of thumb is that sequels are usually worse than the originals, but I don't think that is the case here. The adult versions of these actors not only greatly resembled the characters' looks, but they also captured the original attitudes EXTREMELY well. Bill Hader is worth seeing this movie alone, because his comedic moments are stellar.As far as plot and story goes, this movie far exceeds the first one. Pennywise is also much more prevalent in this film, if that's even possible. Bill did a PHENOMENAL job in the first It and this one too. The special effects for this movie are also stunning. Way better than some other horror movies. What I also loved about this movie is that it had touching and funny moments mixed with the terrifying ones. It provided a great laugh and scare.

1350,levi_hartline,Beep Beep,9,7 September 2019,"As a fan of Stephen King novels, and especially IT, I absolutely loved these movies. The first chapter was great but certain lacked certain depth and story building. I understand this was due to the nature of the horror genre as it stands today and to keep audiences interested you need to saturate your film with ""gotcha"" moments (laughs or scares). I was able to overlook the lack of story or character backstory in chapter 1 mainly because of how great the kids were together and how absolutely terrifying Bill Skarsgard was as the clown.Chapter 2 dove into the depths and explored the lore and the Losers club in a way that I was expecting some of the first chapter to. Again, I felt there were some weird and misplaced jokes in this one as well, but with a 3 hour runtime, and having to tackle such a complex story, I'm happy with what they managed to cover. The cast was yet again brilliant and Andy Muschietti's direction was incredible.My verdict,Beautiful and breathtaking set pieces, cast top notch, stays faithful to the book, Pennywise and his many forms were super cool, jokes and jumps land a little off at times but definitely one of the best King adaptations.",It Chapter Two

Some amazing cinematography in the film especially the start with all the balloons coming down from the bridge.I'll go and see it a second time as I've got a Limitless card and see how I feel second time round.It's not a bad film but my personal opinion is it a scratch on the first film,It Chapter Two
1352,Heisenberg999,A bit of a letdown with some redeeming qualities,5,6 September 2019,"If you're reading this review and you haven't already seen Chapter two, and you didn't rewatch the first Chapter, go rewatch it if you want to get the best out of Chapter two. This film doesn't stand on its own at all.
I liked the first Chapter way more than this film. Instead of improving on the mistakes of the first film, Chapter two was an even messier film.
Let's start with the good things. The film looks beautiful. It's filmed beautifully and visual design of monsters and creatures is very imaginative and unnerving. All that is supported by the beautiful production design, which only suffers in act 3, when it's too dark to tell how the background looks. On the technical level in general, the film delivers. Sound mixing really helped to build an atmosphere, and the makeup and costumes were on the point. Regarding the acting, the majority of the actors were very unutilized. James McAvoy's and Jessica Chastain's characters were far more interested in their child form. Those two were completely wasted because of the bland script. Star of the film, and easily the best part of it was Bill Hader. Every scene in which all of them were together, he outshined them completely. In every scene he was in, the spotlight was on him. Besides comedic chops, he showed his capability to deliver a great performance in more serious and dramatic scenes. Bill Skarsgard was also fantastic, but I wished he was a little bit more in the film.The biggest issue I have with this film was its tone inconsistency. This film has huge tonal issues. The film is filled with humor, but that wouldn't be a problem if the humor was dosed and appropriate. In the majority of the film, the humor and scary scenes intertwined. They intertwined in a way in which you don't know if the scene is supposed to be scary or funny, and that's a huge problem for a horror film. Jokes were decent in most cases, but their timing was catastrophic. For example, when I was watching this film in the theatre, when I thought the scary scene was happening at the moment, someone was laughing at the fullest, and vice versa. That's a shame because the horror sequences were decently directed, and the jokes were mostly funny. But when those two elements intertwine too often and at the wrong moments, both of those elements lose their effect.
Except for tonal issues, the film had its problems with pacing. The film is 170 minutes long, and that's very unusual for horror standards today. The film is very scattered and its length could be felt. There's some redundancy in storytelling because very often the group gets together and splits apart, that happens way too many times. Act 3 was way too long and at that point, the film really started to drag.
The script was very weak, it wouldn't even be a stretch to call it bad. I guess the absence of Cary Joji Fukunaga as one of the screenwriters hurt this film very badly in the end. The first Chapter did not develop all of the kids, but at least some of them were somewhat developed. In Chapter two for the most characters, there's not any further development for any of them. Ben's motives are borrowed from Chapter one and nothing else has happened with him as a character, he's just there. Mike is only a walking exposition. Bill and Bev were way more concise and compelling characters in Chapter one. And Bowers, he was a terrible character in the first Chapter, and somehow he's gotten even worse in the second part. I also would love if the film gave any meaning to Pennywise and his actions, beyond: he's just an evil force who kills.
Speaking of characters, the chemistry between old Losers, compared to young Losers was nonexistent. Every time the film switched back to young actors, it became way more interesting.In the end, compared to the first Chapter, the sequel declined in quality. It's not a great film, but it has some redeeming qualities in it, such as visual effects and Bill Hader's performance.",It Chapter Two
1353,SeerDerek,"Please Keep ""IT"" Simple. (Stay away from the poltergeisty feel)",5,22 September 2019,"The movie was really interesting right from the start.
I love when movies focus on the past giving us a sense of what that character is about.
While also expressing the homey feeling of the neighborhood kids so close to each other and having adventures good or bad.
I know when I was 9-10 in 1976-77 those were the best years of my life. Everything new, and finally allowed to go on (unexplored journeys such as the corner store LOL).
Lots of movies such as ""Goonies"", ""Stand by Me"" & ""Sandlot"" have that feeling to it. ~That's great! Anyway, so sorry.The flashbacks while
showing hidden gems you have to look for or happen to notice. Little clips in a flashback will explain a great deal of the characters past or issue.
Connecting pieces of their story. I love that! I really do!BUT!
(Just my pet peeves)
It seems at least to me anyway that almost EVERY MOVIE that starts off great has a Second Personality.
At the beginning of some movies they either make you feel relaxed, on the edge of your seat or my favorite, it makes you feel good and warm, even intrigued and wanting more information about the character. So I expect that during the movie. It never comes.
IT ALWAYS turns into some sort of a chase or crazy fight for an hour in a half. (Not a fan of those movies).
But you can pretty spot those movies out by the trailer.Back to the Movie ""IT""
However, when they made their plan, it started to become a little Poltergeisty for me.
However, the part that I didn't care for was in the book. However,
My intuition tells me Stephen King didn't really have that scene in his mind while writing this chapter. At least the scene in the movie that I am referring to that you will never know about until you watch the movie LOL okay.I'm not trying to spoil anyone's time by going to see ""It"" and expecting poltergeisty things happening the whole movie. It's not like that.
There are some very good pieces and creative scenes in this movie.I have said all I can say without giving away the somewhat predictable scenes.
If you are like me, you read the reviews first and weed out the ones that are ridiculously negative reviews because someone was chomping popcorn.
I don't go see a movie based on reviews that I read. I do take in consideration valid reviews but only the ones without spoiler alerts.
You can also tell about a movie by watching the trailer. If the trailer is all action, funny, sad, mysterious, etc, then you know that is pretty much all the funny, sad, exciting parts in the movie.
Then you realize the trailer was the funniest or biggest part of the movie.
I think trailers should leave out the best part of the movie and only show parts that lead up to an exciting or anticipated part then STOP! People will be driven insane not knowing what would have happened.
Nothing wrong with a Movie Trailer having cliffhangers and I mean 100% true cliffhangers.",It Chapter Two

Not just brave because of the silly jumpscares in this movie, but also because of the movie's runtime, which is... yep, it's long, repetitive and quite unnecessary in many parts.If I were to choose a scene from this movie that I felt was completely redundant to the overall plot of the film and remove it... we would get a 90-minute movie. That illustrates how the sequel of the remake ""IT"" felt to me.Look at the character of Bowers, for example. I thought he died in the last movie. Why is he in this movie? To create more jumpscares? Usually, with characters like him, he would be what we call ""plot device"". He was a... what, scare device?The scene with the little girl being eaten? Scary, but what's the point of that scene? Pennywise likes to eat children? We already knew that from the first film!The cast is pretty good (with Bill Hader being outstanding) and Bill Skarsgård does a brilliant job, once again, as Pennywise. The cinematography is passable, not as good as in the first movie.There are some entertaining scenes, but I felt as though in the second half of the movie they couldn't help themselves but to throw jumpscares in every scene, which made it more predictable as the film went along.The charm from the first chapter is mostly gone. The sequence of events throughout this movie is very haphazard - especially in the beginning. The momentum loses its way towards the end and quite honestly, I wasn't expecting the exposition in some scenes.The standoff is very disappointing, but the performances are solid enough to overcome it.Did ""IT: Chapter 2"" float?Yes... slowly.5/10.",It Chapter Two

As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining.

1365,Muzan03,"The second half is worthy, well-cast and mostly faithful adaptation of the book",7,4 September 2019,"For most of the people out there who will watch it for the scares, there are plenty of them abound. The talked-about homophobic scene is quite good a starter. But what I found the most satisfying in the scares territory were The Ritual of Chud, and The Walking Tours of each of the Losers. Both are the longest among the scares, and the filmmakers did an amazing job of presenting them from book to big screen, albeit somewhat different. I personally thought they were hard to adapt. Like the Paul Bunyan scene but most especially the Ritual of Chud.Apart from the scares, the movie will make people laugh out loud as well. Bill Hader and James Ransone are quite the comic relief. And the appearance of Stephen King is spot-on and funny too.There are those who complain that the movie is overlong and not as scary as they expected it to be, but I can say that most people who read It and those who did not but appreciate the first movie as the package it was will be satisfied.Because it's not just the scares that make us follow the story. It is the characters themselves. The coming of age. The nostalgia. The old times. The friends who come along and stay. The friends who come along but leave. The unconditional love. The promises whether honored or not. The power of belief. The guilt. The personal fears we want to overcome. The strength and weakness of memory. How most of the times the bad things we want to forget stick with us longer than the good things we want to remember. It evokes something powerful in us that makes us the humane people we are. We identify ourselves in each of the Losers. And that is one very good side It shared with us. It makes us remember. It makes us hope.And the score by Benjamin Wallfisch made It all the more powerful and the well-cast characters they were.It is not a perfect movie. There are scenes that don't work as intended.

There is absolutely nothing interesting, no story, no events, no delivery, also nothing scary, it's more like a comedy satire of a horror movie.

I knew from the moment they announced Chapter 2 that it was not going to be better than Chapter 1. Here's the thing, sequels can be hard to make and its always awesome to see them be better than the movie that came before them, but unfortunately 9 times out of 10 when it comes to horror movies, the sequels don't hold up to be better. The main reason on why I think this especially for IT (and this is just my opinion): too much background information on the entity of Pennywise/killers. When it comes to something like Pennywise in horror movies I personally find it better to leave the imagination behind the mystery of what ""IT"" is. That's honestly why I think ""The Shape"" in the Halloween franchise still holds up till this day, because even though yes Michael Myers the person has a background, he is still shown as an entity of evil to not know what he is thinking so it leaves room for imagination. I believe they did a good job with Pennywise by the end of the first chapter by leaving a mystery behind what he actually is, but enough to know what his goal is.I wasn't a huge fan of most of the CGI parts, because it just felt too unreal to me personally and some of it looked pretty bad. Unfortunately this movie did not scare me in the slightest, but the saving grace of the movie that I really like is the way it was delivered for certain tension based scenes and the characters. I care for all the characters and I can appreciate this movie for being a character driven kind of movie for all them dealing with the trauma they have went through growing up leading towards going back to their hometown after 27 years.VERDICT: Overall this movie is fine for what it is. I can tell it was made with a lot of heart for the franchise. Not better than IT Chapter 1. Go see it with your friends to have a good time if you like horror movies.Score: 7.3 out of 10",It Chapter Two

Poorly stitched together story line, uninteresting characters, not at all scary. Awkward flashbacks to child actors in scenes that were not in Chapter 1, so they felt out of place rather than filling in back story. It's almost like they realized that they hadn't finished the child story lines in Chapter 1, so they finished them for Chapter 2. But the flash backs were unnecessary except to correlation adults to child actors. My wife left with 15 minutes remaining. I almost regret staying.

1400,elijahfuchs-60353,Rather disappointing,5,8 September 2019,"The sequel to the 2017 hit follows the adult versions of the Losers Club, as they confront Pennywise 27 years later to kill him once and for all. I liked the first ""It,"" however I don't feel it is as good as people and critics say it is, and does contain some noticeable flaws. ""It: Chapter Two"" does feature some impressive aspects, but overall feels very long, repetitive, and filled with script troubles. The casting choices, which I'm sure is pretty much a consensus, we're brilliant, and the adult versions of the kids from the first film truly look like the grownup versions of their characters. Along with the casting of the losers club, Bill Skarsgård is back, and really shines in his performance. There is some genuinely cool imagery, and it is fun to see the certain abominable figures that Pennywise manifests himself into. While I didn't wholly dislike this film, I do have problems with this movie that I couldn't stop thinking about throughout the film and need to be addressed. First off, the characters are so much more bland than they were in the latter film, featuring almost no character arches at all. What made the characters so much better in the first film was how the character's personalities and traits changed throughout the course of the film because of their teamwork and the adversity they were facing. In ""It: Chapter Two,"" there is not really any change of heart in the characters, and most of them feel the same from the beginning until the end. Certain characters may have somewhat of an arch, but it didn't feel very well earned, and sort of predictable. This film is extremely long as well, and features very little tension, (with the exception of one scene in my opinion) with a heavy emphasis of jump scares surprisingly. The formula for how the scenes escalated became very repetitious due to the focus on providing a jump scare. Another issue I had with this film is one I share with the predecessor, and that is the over reliance on CGI. While CGI can look good, this film is scattered with very obvious CGI, and it takes away from the film's reality and scariness. One plot point tries to explain Pennywise's origins, and it felt very jumbled and confusing. Overall, this film was entertaining, but disappointing for the fact that I expected better filmmaking and story writing quality. It's not a terrible horror film, but isn't really much different from a lot of other things that you may see out there.",It Chapter Two

1404,optimusprime-48255,The fat kid has to...,3,15 September 2019,"... get rich and grow a six pack to get the girl. What kind of message is that?What made part 1 lovable was the story of the losers club. It took time to develop each character and felt like a kids movie at times. Also it wasnt just jump scares, but was really creepy at times as well.Part 2 now is a whole different story. Even though calling it a story is wildly exaggerated, because really there is none and it is little more than a couple of scenes thrown together that serve as build up for jump scares.I watched the movie with a female friend and she predicted every jump scare and was able to cover her eyes with her hands at the right time.At some point the losers discuss they should not split up - the single dumbest thing people in horror movies always do, even though no one in their right mind would actually do that. Disappointing: one of them says ""we have to split up"" - no further explanation, no questions asked, and of course they do split up.Plot holes - theres many of them. Of course part 1 had a couple as well, but it was a lovable movie, so the viewer could forgive that. Part 2 though is a hot mess.Not a plot hole, but has anyone noticed that eddys band aid is on the wrong side of his face when the losers go down into the sewers? Though not a big deal, i am still always amazed how things like this happen in big budget productions.And speaking of big budget, how did they mess up the cgi this bad? Even the clown looks ridiculous most of the time. The scene in the mirror cabinet, when his tongue is hangig out, might as well have been generated in snapchat app - it is that bad. And unfortunately it is exemplary for many more scenes to come.Well anywho, in conclusion It part 2 really isnt a movie that has a well built up story. Its rather a juxtaposition of isolated scenes that serve as built up for jump scares and as that it is totally different from the well made part 1 and a huge disappointment.",It Chapter Two
1405,kylerobertsiscool,Lacked the spark that made the first film great!,4,8 September 2019,"I enjoyed the first 'IT'. Pennywise was legitimately scary and the children's characters were genuinely believable. However, this time around the film just feels like any other mediocre horror. The characters as adults were mundane and have little depth despite the near three hour runtime (which drags a lot by the way). I felt more emotion towards the nameless victims killed in this film than I did for the main characters. Pennywise himself loses that scare factor completely for me. He is shown far too much. The filmmaker appears to favour cheap jump scares rather than building tension. Despite these flaws, I was still mildly entertained watching IT Chapter 2. Most of this is down to both the terrific acting and great comedic timing in the film. Although, as the film progresses jokes are often overused and very hit or miss. The ending is also quite the nail in the coffin. It feels anti climactic and altogether unrealistic. Disappointed to say the least, but still somewhat entertained. 6/10",It Chapter Two
1406,popcorn-reviews,Perfect Addition To The First,9,9 September 2019,"This takes all the things we love about the first- humor, scary factor, characters- and seems to amplify it. It isn't as witty as the first and seems to rely more on excessive cursing for the comedy, but makes up for it plenty with the plot. There is much more gore and jump scares in this one than the first- and I found it to be slightly less scary- most ""scary"" scenes were shrouded with comedy. Aside from that, the true beauty of this film is the character development- we learn much more about the characters, their secrets, hidden fears, their pasts, what became of them, etc. and it does a good job of executing the character arcs. Most of all, the ending is absolutely beautiful, and the way they wrapped up the story and the characters was done very well. The ending monologue is a tear jerker.

1416,dannymacquade,"Didnt float my boat, sadly.",5,11 September 2019,"I loved 2017's ""IT"", I have heard a lot of criticism about how the fim wasn't scary. But i dont watch ""IT"" for the horror. I watch and love the film for the journey. I dont watch ""IT"" for the scares, but for the adventure. ""IT chapter 2"" doesn't feel like an adventure to me. It's a movie of moments and a non compelling story, strechted out over a bloated run time.The story here just isn't that compelling. Pennywise returns, the losers retun to deal with him. Thats it, stretched out over 2hours and 50minutes. The film moves briskly to start. Opening on a grim note showing just what lurks in the shadows of Derry. The opening shows promise that is never consistently maintained, just peppered throughout. And then the film gets bogged down in flashbacks and having the characters slowly remember what happened the first time around. The reasons why they fear IT.IT when in the form of Pennywise, is amazing. Bill Skarsgard giving the role everything he has. There is one amazing moment in the film involving a little girl at a baseball game who encounters Pennywise, a fatal encounter framed beautifully with just the head and hands of pennywise visible from the shadows. But this is the only standout set piece for me, and it doesnt even involve the main cast. Every other scare has IT assume the form of some grey CGI monster. And the CG in this film is clean and shiny. Any tension built during these sequences dissipated upon the reveal of the CGI monster. When it comes to horror, i much prefer my effects practical. You dont seem to get the same feeling of grime from CG. The monster can seem to lack presence and weight.The Losers club is cast brilliantly. The casting director went above and beyond with these actors, with everyone looking like adult versions of the kid losers. the film is also very funny, funnier than i expected. And the film is shot brilliantly and features some smooth tranistions into flashbacks. No one can say this film isn't well made, but i found it lacking the sense of adventure i came for. And when adventure failed me, the films horror aspects did nothing to fill the void. The film is worth watching, I believe you should give everything a chance.

I guess the CGI effects were 'impressive', but not in the slightest bit scary, the film was devoid of any real buildup of suspense, there were no surprises (apart from the cheap scares) no twists, just a poor remake of a classic horror filled with CGI cheap screamers which, in my personal opinion, hold no imagination and very little originality. The children who were once branded 'losers' have all grown up to become famous actors, comedians and real estate tycoons and they're now back on the hunt for Pennywise whilst constantly having flashbacks to their childhood, I genuinely didnt mind a few of these but to place dozens of them throughout the movie really did nothing but bore me. Mike has transitioned into some Morpheus-type figure phoning around the old members to convince them to return to Derry to fight Pennywise. Bev is in (yet another) abusive relationship with a male figure, this time it's her husband who beats her with a belt for answering a call to Mike, but after this event she up and leaves him and we hear nothing more about this relationship, which after watching their absuive exchange one would think it would have more significance to the overall theme of the movie, but it doesnt, just that it forces Bev to leave for Derry. Halfway through the movie you get the impression they ran out of ideas or simply gave up on the nitty gritty detail of what makes a fantastic original horror and just turned it into some unfunny cheesy comedy.",It Chapter Two

Sadly, it was quite bad.Not only was the plot poorly scripted, this movie felt like it lasted for an eternity to the point I was really hoping for some kind of intermission that I knew wasn't coming.The casting for the adults was decent, but the actor who played Mike, who got everyone back together, was unbelievably bad. Like, how's he working in Hollywood bad. This movie should've been scripted around the kids from the first one.This movie really hits you over the head with CGI. The scariest part from the trailer, the old lady, gets ruined because they went the CGI route. And that was just the tip of the iceberg.

Unnecessarily convoluted story line (which adheres to tightly to the source material in many ways for it's own good, and veers too far from it in many others)The sub-par acting of McAvoy, Mustafa, Ryan and Ransone.The insertion of ""woke"" aspects to the story line for no good reason (A common problem with sequels to popular franchises these days)The lack of genuine tension building. It's as if they were trying to see how many cheap scares could cram into a nearly 3 hour movie.The matter-of-factness that permeates nearly every ridiculous conversation in this movie.(SPOILER) The preposterousness of the ending. Pennywise deserved better. His withering-away to the Losers chants of ""You're just a clown!"" is both ludicrous (given what we know about Pennywise intellect, personality and power) and extremely unfair to the character.

I have seen most every horror film out there, and one thing I can't stand are cheap-ass jump scares as when they are overdone, it takes away from the film...well this film has jump scares, but so well timed it leaves you thinking you know exactly when it will strike, but it doesn't. The CGI is mind blowing! Yes, you read that correctly horror fiends. There are scenes that had me squinting away from the screen as the 2 hour 45 minute run time played on, making we wonder, ""is this going to end?"", but it doesn't.

The song playing in that particular scene was ""Angel of the Morning"" never put that song in there right at that moment is a genius. It is nice to have comic relief in a horror movie. Otherwise it just gets boring to watch a two hour movie where everybody is constantly getting killed 24/7... Best of all, I was at a premier showing and got a Pennywise action figure ($35) with 4 heads (interchangeable) not a bad prize for an $8 admission ticket...

Also I must mentionned the overuse of humor in this chapter versus the first one especially in the more serious scene which totally kills the horror mood... This ain't a comedy...

You will enjoy a wonderful visit with a little old lady who just doesn't seem quite right in the head. I'm not sure what audience this movie was made for, little kids or nostalgic adults yearning for a new adaptation to an old classic.I do know that for most the heavy use if CGI to replace a well written horror story is getting old. Remember back in the day when you could use decent acting with a good foreboding music score and illicit a grand scare. I miss those days and this movie misses them also.In the final hour or so the movie picks up a little steam as most movies do so that was to be expected. We get an answer to Pennywise's true form and how he got here but I'm not sure if we got the answer as to why? The group is beset with challenges from everywhere but internal and external and we will lose one beloved character (not going to tell you who).

1456,jerrykcookus,An amazing piece of the big picture,9,6 September 2019,"First of all, don't expect a ""horror"" movie. King's best attribute when telling a story is how amazing human beings can be and how powerful the mind and heart are. And Andy has this on full display in this second part of his screen adaptation.If you have never read or even listened to an audio book of ""IT"", you're doing yourself a disservice. There are so many elements to the story that could easily make another 2-3 movies after this sequel. From the history of Derry, to the origins of IT, and even the macro-verse, so much is left out of the movies to simply tell the best version of the story.The book is all over the place. There is no chronology as it mirrors each confrontation the losers have with IT back and forth from adulthood to childhood. In between these events we get sprinkles of deep character development, history, and cosmic spirituality.This movie took the best, most screen adaptable parts and allowed us to follow the adult trials of the losers. Less time was spent on Audra (Bill's wife) and the night Bev and Bill spent together in the novel was simply a kiss in the movie. You could see the effect the ""love triangle"" had on Ben and how strong a person he really was by never allowing the others to know in order to maintain the bonds they had.Over all, this telling of the story itself is light years ahead of the beloved mini series most of us watched. It focuses directly on the 7 and pennywise: the way he impacted their lives directly and indirectly, the love they have for each other, and how powerful connections with others and the mind can be when focused on a collective goal.The CGI was better than the previous movie, but still not great. That is the only reason I gave a 9.",It Chapter Two
1457,goodselln,"Teeter-Totters on what is ""Good"" and ""Bad""",7,16 December 2019,"So this title had many things going for it, some good and some bad, and I guess I'll just make a pro's and cons list to spell it out:Pros:
1. Opening Scene. Truly well done, it was uncomfortable and sad to watch with the gay couple being beaten, but matches how the original book started incredibly well, and really got the ball rolling for the film. It excited me on what I may have started to watch.
2. Casting. I was most impressed with the casting of Jack Dylan Grazier and James Ransone who both played Eddie, it was uncanny how I thought they resembled each other well, and even at one point went on here to double check if they were father and son.
3. The Message. It leaves you feeling peaceful with themes and imagery about childhood: it's fears, its joys and sorrows, growing up, recovering from trauma, and how it still affects us to this day whether we can face it or not. But the important thing to remember was about not being alone when we feel like it.
4. Bill Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise.
5. More info behind Pennywise. Its been awhile since I've read the book, and can't find time to make the commitment of rereading it anytime soon, but one thing I was frustrated with was how it never felt like there was an explanation behind Pennywise: what was it exactly and where did it come from? There was no myth or lore behind him (at least from what I remember in the book), so this movie introducing more behind that was something that I appreciated.
6. The Final showdown. Honestly, I liked the movie version better. Pennywise's final form was a letdown in all honesty, but the ending in the book felt so out there and just plain weird, like wtf was Stephen smoking when he wrote that?)
7. Surprise Cameo. Can't say who, but it was an absolutely delightful surprise to see who it was, I'm so glad I wasn't spoiled on it!Cons:
1. Way too much CGI was relied on. This is a continuing issue with a lot of big budget films (ironically), and I seriously wish we could go back to when studios spent more on special effects and relied on makeup, because except for Pennywise, a lot of the special effects felt so cheapened with the reliance of disturbing images and/or sequences that are in abundance in this film. Not to mention was mainly used for jump scares, which brings me to my next point...
2. Way too many jump scares. The middle part really slowed the whole film when the main cast does the one big no-no of horror: they split up. Sure, they had to go find their tokens throughout town and have Pennywise try and terrify them into submission, but at the base of those scenes, it was mainly disturbing images and jump scares that fueled them, and it got repetitive.
3. Bowers Character. His whole appearance felt cheapened and dramatically made less important than what he was in the book.
4. This movie tried to be too funny. Thanks Bill Hader...Some parts got a chuckle but some felt pretty forced and pretty mehh.
5. Another reviewer said this too, but Stan's letter's at the end tried to justify his death by making it seem like a noble sacrifice to try and bring them all together again, but that's not the case. He committed suicide because he was too afraid to go back and face his past trauma's. thats it. it represents how sometimes digging into our pasts and confronting our past traumas, fears, whatever happened that has affected us even years later is too hard for some people, and it's a sad but realistic factor of the human condition, so the letters felt like they'd backed off from the harsh reality.
6. The scene of them walking through the town with the blue filter to make it look like it was night/just before sunrise. It literally looked like it was filmed during the day and they placed a terrible blue filter over it. Could've had better editing there...I did overall enjoy the film for the most part; out of a lot of horror films, I can appreciate the story behind it and the positive message it tries to tell people at the end. Does it deserve the award of best horror film ever? Hell no...But maybe in another 27 years, they'll absolutely nail it!",It Chapter Two

1459,nastiarus,Commercial generic adaption of a great book.,1,10 September 2019,"Started great, 40 minutes later went downhill. Ridiculous, laughable and not scary at all CGI scenes started to flood the scenes. The movie had some funny moments in the beginning that were totally into place, BUT it took the wrong direction and went being semi-comedy through all the movie where it actually (supposed to be) serious scenes. Horror started to feel semi-comedy, the script was not okay. This adaptation could've been great if they respected the book ATMOSPHERE for the least! I'm not even referring to the book things (which they didn't respect the majority) I'm just talking about simple atmosphere and vibe.
This is just one more mediocre generic movie that wants to sell to the structure that is going to like this kind of trash.
Shame on directors and actors that don't realize or (maybe they do) but prefer way more money over an artistic quality work that maybe wouldn't sell as well because of the, you know, the world's society nowadays who are just controlled by the same thing.
I mean, I know there are movies that still are great, of course! That majority you don't find in commercial cinemas, but, this one is an adaptation of a great book and this is just unrespectful.

1465,sovhitman,"Overall more comedy than horror, but good",7,19 September 2019,"So from the beginning it's obvious its more comedy written than the original(with tim curry) and the remade 1st chapter. However, its needed to keep it afloat(get it?). I give a 7/10. 6 outta 10 for the casting and acting. Ive never seen a more grown up version of a character be more accurate, both eddies and richies adults are spot on perfect! The 7th star for being better than the 80s version.
The horror is not there. Every jump scare isnt scary. And the fears IT thrives off of are lackluster compared to 2017. But over all lots of fun. As with all movies, theres some bad parts and just, ""wait what?"" Like when ben comes down the stairs asking if bill left even though he never saw him even enter. Also richies told to be gay for one scene and then its never mentioned again. Also the bully friend who died in the 2017 film chapter 1 is back, but only seen as an ex machina to get the main bully out of jail and then drives the car and then hes gone for the film entirely.

1468,cristianapetrache,Bending film genres,8,16 November 2019,"Director Andy Muschietti chooses not to play safe by mixing elements of gore and chaos with priceless bits of comedy, successfully breaking the barrier imposed by film genres. Instead of making a predictable type of horror, he crafted something much bigger than a film. From scares, drama and laughter to pain and tears, 'It: Chapter Two' had it all.Growing up being surrounded by Stephen King's work has definitely made me appreciate these types of films and for me, the 'It' experience was even more entertaining because I got the chance to watch some of my favourite actors play some of my favourite characters. The cast was extraordinary; Bill Skarsgård, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, James Ransone, Isaiah Mustafa and Jay Ryan played the adult versions of the Losers so elegantly, their performances being the highlight of the film.Bill Hader- former cast member of 'Saturday Night Live' and writer and director of the Emmy nominated series 'Barry'- starred in this year's It as Richie Tozier. At first, Seth Green (who played 12-year-old Richie in the 1990 miniseries) showed interest in reprising his role. After Hader was proposed by 'Stranger Things' actor Finn Wolfhard (who played the younger version of the character in the 2017 film), the comedian was ultimately cast. Being a huge fan of his, made me beyond excited and very curious about how he would act in such different circumstances than the ones he was used to. I believe I speak for everyone when I say that Hader was the heart and soul of the film. Not only did he do a mesmerizing job (bringing joy to the viewers), he also carried the gravity of the script on his shoulders. He helped Muschietti's adaptation achieve the desired impact, making the entire audience fall in love with Richie. His dynamic jokes, including his ""feud"" with Eddie (James Ransone), gave depth to the story.A pleasant surpriseIt felt like a family film which is definitely unexpected, coming from a horror movie. It was more funny than scary, but this is a good thing because when it comes to 'It' the terror consists of gory and psychological details. Was it better than the first chapter? I would pick the new one over 'It' not necessarily because it was more frightening, but because it made me experience more.It had a few general issues, but then again it is pretty hard to adapt Stephen King books into movies, especially one that is so beloved. Some might not like all the aspects of the film, because of the way they imagined the whole situation depicted in the book. The script blended well in this lively fusion of drama and horror, everything fell into place eventually, building up a great, enjoyable film.The original piano piece ""27 Years Later"", which featured material from the previous film's ""Every 27 Years"" indicated the story's development while hinting Pennywise's return with an eerie approach. In fact, Benjamin Wallfisch's entire soundtrack implied the suspense and the dread that was meant to merge you in the plot.The viewing experienceWatching it in a cinema makes a huge difference because the viewing experience is highly improved that way. The obvious advantage of watching 'It' in a film theatre is the fact that it gives a whole new dimension to the story and to the way Andy Muschietti chose to represent it on the big screen. If you are waiting to watch it on DVD, I feel like the entire setting will seem slightly sloppier. It just wouldn't be the same, something would probably seem off, but I assure you that, if you are a big fan of Stephen King's creations, once you watch it in a cinema you will genuinely fall in love with the adult Losers' Club.The 2019 instalment serves such a satisfying ending which concludes the story perfectly. The atmosphere was magical in the last few minutes thanks to the emotional dialogues delivered by the cast. For a moment, I felt like all I wanted to do was stop the clock and let the film go on for another couple of hours.It never felt too long; it actually got better with every moment. The runtime was precisely what made the film so delightful. The narrative could have been seriously messed up if the editing crew had decided to cut it down to less than 2 hours and 50 minutes.",It Chapter Two

I also recently saw the ORIGINAL ""It"" (1990). So I pretty much knew how ""It Chapter 2"" was going to play out.But honestly, I didnt really like this movie. The actors were great and all (except I didnt really like the adult Eddie for some reason?) , but the story and movie just wasn't good to me. There were way too many cliches. I couldn't believe it considering how good the first move was. For example, when they were all starting to hold hands in a circle, I was like ""Ben and Bev are COINCIDENTALLY going to be standing next to each other and make eye contact before holding hands""- and it happened.Also, I wasn't scared of Bowers in this movie. I wasnt scared he was going to hurt the main characters with his little knife. It would of been more intense had he stolen the axe from the library, then his character would be intimidating and be important.Also, I understand the first (2017) movie was successful, but they didnt need to make this movie FULL of flashbacks. Maybe they took notes from the 1990 movie that used flashbacks? But even then, flashbacks were only used to tell the story as the movie didnt begin with them as children like the 2017 version.There were also wayyyy too many jumpscares, and very little plot. There was basically no main storyline. Pretty much flashbacks of things It did to them separately and them making jokes.ALSO LETS NOT FORGET THE DEFEAT OF PENNYWISE. All I can say is ""Really?"" All they had to do is insult him? I'm sorry, but is this a little kids' movie? They could of insulted him and said mean things to him as children, and for what I could remember, they did, didnt they?I never read the book, so I'm not too sure how much they wanted to change, but I thought it would of been nice to get a better idea of what their life was like as adults. Bev could of spoke about her abusive husband more and their backstory and why she stayed in the marriage. That way we'd be more connected to the adult losers like we were to the kid losers. Also, (again going against the book) it should of been Billy or another loser that stayed in the town rather than the one that did. Considering his parents died there horrifically and his family were somewhat mentally abusive and he seemed as though he didnt really have anyone to rely on, HE should of been the first one to leave that town and have a high ranking job as a way to escape his childhood. He just seemed obsessed with It, instead of growing up and growing into a person who got over the past.I honestly wouldnt recommend this movie.

1474,Roger-Shallot,It's Dull...,5,8 October 2019,"I wasn't too impressed with this one, unfortunately. It felt stretched out and could easily lose at least half-an-hour of its run time. The adult characters were nowhere near as well written or - surprisingly - portrayed as their junior equivalents and the CGI was often a wee bit shaky. I understand that there was meant to be a sort of twisted 'circus' quality about some of the monsters but even so some of them were rather unconvincing.The first film wasn't particularly scary but there was a pervading sense of menace - that seemed to dissipate this time and the first hour or so began to drag. The chap a few seats down from me was snoring from pretty early on and I cannot really blame him.The second half of the original TV mini-series was weaker than the first (as was the book, to be fair) but this second chapter of the new film failed to avoid the same fate.A very big missed opportunity, but that goes for quite a few adaptations of Stephen King's deceptively hard to film work.

However. IT round 2 is not good. Not enough scare moments with the actual clown. Too much boring dialogue and nothing new here at all. The ending is just ridiculous, not scary just stupid.

After it's premiere I went to the cinema to see chapter II everyone was promoting. First scene I facepalmed myself. When losers club get on the reunion after 27 years. In the end of the scene you see creatures(that really made me laugh not fear) flying and crawling for no particular reason at all. The ending of the movie is absolutely disappointing. Pennywise as a giant spider with his face attached to it. I think the director got carried away. I think he wanted to fear the new gen (10 to 16 years old),It Chapter Two

I've been excited for this movie to come out since the 1st one in 2017, but was completely disappointed with the lack of scare factors. They show way too much of Pennywise, that by time he and Bill were in the fun house, I wasn't scared of him anymore (and I'm paralyzingly afraid of clowns). Too many random zombies for no reason. I felt there was a zombie for literally every character, when it should've only been for Eddie, maybe even Mike. I will say one thing I seemed to enjoy, was the way they made the characters really resemble themselves as kids, they didn't change them. But, overall, I would not watch this movie again, nor do I recommend to anyone.",It Chapter Two
1485,maxemandeh,Quick thoughts,7,13 September 2019,"The movie was great maybe not as much as the first one, and it was not even close to being as deep and real as the first one.The cgi was great, but at times a bit overused.
Some of the grown up characters didn't feel like the same characters as in the first (Ben and Beverly), and some felt too underdeveloped from the first one (Richie).But somehow, between all the jumpscares, i enjoyed every second of It. While it could have been shorter and it could have been more story driven, the jumpscares were fun, and much scarier than the first one.Will you like it? maybe. It depends on if you want to watch a movie thats entertaining from a technical view with great cgi and wacky jumpscares or if you want a deep heartfelt sequel that tells the story in the most optimal way.Personally I'm just happy to have these great characters in a new story, especially Pennywise.",It Chapter Two
1486,SoenGaudou,Ça 2.0,10,14 September 2019,"You want your boat, it's nice this boat (flu-sou in the 1).
Yesterday I had the very good idea to watch This: Chapter 2, the session took place at 8:05 p.m., and then the film started at 8:25 p.m., and then the movie ended at 11:00 p.m. (I was exhausted). I watched it with my brother and my mother, we thought it was great. And then the film is super scary, one of my biggest freaks of horror cinema, in fact I would say that it was the film that scared me the most, because there are jumpscares, but I'll come back to that later.
The Clan of The Ratés are going to come together again to beat the big bad guy, being an adult because in the movie they're not a kid, and besides you have James McAvoy in the role of Bill, and I'd say he's the most endearing character , after I still love the other characters but there is a character in I don't care completely, Stanley, the
dude dies already from the beginning
, I don't understand why they put him in the cast, and then his role served no purpose, and then the other one is asthmatic and he had more burns to come.
So starts first in
a carnival, with two homosexuals spending their time together, but after they've come out of the carnival, a group beat them up and throws a homosexual into the river and that's where we'll still see the first appearance of that, and it doesn't Don't do something very, very nice, he eats the heart of the gus.
And it starts great because the film already puts us in the mood from the beginning (like all horror movies).
SCARY AND ANTAGONISTE:
So I'd say it's more scary than the first one, and then there are more jumpscares, not to mention when
The little girl wanted it to make her disappear her stain on her face, and then all of a sudden you have 15 seconds of silence and jumpscare
intense, there's also the moment when
Ben (child) ends up with the Clown in the locker. Every scene in this movie is scary, super stressful and beautiful:
Ex: The mirror scene where Bill tries to save the child, and then the child gets trapped between walls. And behind it's that and it starts to break the window
, this scene put me in a tense situation. Every scene stressed me out, the hairs of my arm bristling, my legs shaking, the jumps. Now I'm going to go on the antagonist. The one who sought the look of That is genius, the eyes offbeat (it makes his look scary), the face all white with the two traces he has on the face and in addition the voice that goes perfectly with. A big icon of horror.
PERSONNAGES:
They're all cool because I really like James McAvoy in the role of Bill, because he's super endearing, after I really like Beverly, and I felt so much emotion I had towards her, because for a moment she was thinking about her past with her father, she was living a difficult past, traumatic and besides his father is a real jerk, and if I could also remember what is on him in the 1 is that he is a pervert, a rapist and he wants his daughter to be like his mother. Richie Tozier always as endearing, funny I really like the moment when he says ""We're all going to float""), often he comes out hilarious phrases. Ben is also clearly one of my favorite characters, and then he's lost weight (we're fighting the squeaks) and he's super well interpreted. Eddie, the asthmatic, pretty much interesting but he doesn't really bring much to the film and lately there's Mike Hanlon who is my favorite character because he brings a lot to the film, because he knows how it was born (I think) and then that's the element important part of the film, a valuable person.
IMPRESSIVE SCENE:
This film features an impressive scene, neat at the level of special effects, I'm talking about the end fight scene. the
It's impressive and I'm in love with the scenery.
After for the script, I find it very correct, it's sought normally, it's clean and then it makes you want to see the movie a lot.
CONCLUSION: That: Chapter 2 is an excellent sequel, even better than the first. Stuffed with jumpscare, with an endearing villain and super creepy. In short a great discovery, if you want to see it, it's now or never.
I do not recommend for under 16s.",It Chapter Two

Maybe they had a good screenplay and didn't stick to it. That happens sometimes. Either way, this wasn't good story telling.All these botnet user reviews telling me the cliche thing they think will make their movie review sound legitmate makes me really distrust everything.

Great cast chemistry, excellent character development, tense scenes, build up of suspense, and only a few jump scare moments.In contrast Chapter 2 was well acted, but the chemistry was off, we got very little insight into who these characters are as adults, the scenes were less tense and more dull, the suspense was lacking and the movie as a whole relied too heavily of jump scares than actually building any real suspense. Quite frankly, it was poorly written and directed, and that includes the fearful monster of Pennywise - who spent more time as some deranged CGI character than Bill Skarsgard's excellent portrayal from Chapter 1.IT - the book - has over 1000 pages, and yet I found myself questioning the direction that the production took. Sure, changes have to be made to made scenes work for the screen, but Chapter 1 did it masterfully, Chapter 2 left a lot to be desired. Leaving out whole, and important, sections of the book and adding new scenes whose only purpose seemed to be the unfortunate victims of the horror trope jump scares. It's been done to death, sure people jump, then the scene goes back to being some strange CGI concoction that's more gore and gross than scary, leaving the actors to carry the whole plot.Hey! Hollywood! Well written suspense and thrill can be just as scary as jumps and gore.It's such a disappointment when Chapter 1 was so good; and it set some very high expectations that Chapter 2 failed to meet.The running time is almost three hours, and I think I was bored for all but 25 minutes of it.",It Chapter Two

The special effects weren't that special and at times just downright cheesy and laughable. Many of the incarnations Pennywise takes whole haunting them look like were taken out of an 80s horror film with poor stop motion and cgi work.

Yikes.,10,7 September 2019,"If you're immature, have zero patience, haven't read the book, or have a very short attention span, you'll not only dislike this film, you'll probably hate it. Yes, there are poorly timed jokes and funny one liners and such, and there's too much CGI (Then again, Chapter 1 had lots of CGI as well but not nearly as many people complained about it) BUT the writing in this film is good overall, the character development is great, the character and story arcs are awesome, the acting is really great, the cinematography is brilliant, the visuals are fantastic, loose ends from Chapter are tied up, it's more faithful to the book than Chapter 1 is, it actually made Chapter 1 even better than it was, there were so many easter eggs for IT fans, horror movie fans, and Stephen King fans in this film (I don't want to spoil anything but Stephen King's Christine makes an easter egg appearance, Stephen King's Dark Tower series makes a little Eeaster egg appearance, Stephen King's The Shining makes a few easter egg appearances, IT : Chapter One makes an easter egg appearance, John Carpenter's The Thing makes an easter egg appearance, the 1990 made for TV IT miniseries/movie makes a couple of easter egg appearances, Andy Muschietti and Stephen King both make appearances in this film, A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 5 makes an easter egg appearance, etc etc...Yes, this film could have been better, no doubt, but it was still really good overall. It has a bit of everything..horror, humor, sadness, etc...it plays on so many emotions depending on who you are or if you have a pulse or not. Way too many people are butthurt that it wasn't what they expected so they're just trashing and bashing this film instead of being open minded. Trying to be ""critics"" when they just need to enjoy the movie especially when they couldn't make a movie even half as good. Besides, most ""critics"" have no idea what they're talking about most of the time anyway. They thought ""The Last Jedi"" was ""phenomenal"". Most of them are so bad, they need to find another profession because being a ""critic"" ain't it, Chief. LMAO, enough said.

1498,alexaserra,Not perfect but still pretty good,8,11 September 2019,"It chapter 2 is a good movie. Not perfect by any means but still stands up on it's own. It's not a sequel, it's the second part of a whole story which is too long and complex (as is the book) to fit into one continuous film, hence the 3 hr running time. A lot of bad reviews derive from this fact so let me tell you something. We are watching a movie based on a 1200 page book with 8 main characters (It+losers club), and I'm not counting Derry which is a main character in of its own. You have to develop 8 main stories, not once (Childhood), not twice (Adulthood) but three times (Flashbacks). You have to intertwine them and elaborate on a lot of detail. Granted, there is A LOT of dragging in some parts but you can't tell a story that has so many details and it's so complex in less than two hours. It just wouldn't stand.The casting and acting are both outstanding. The under-use of Skarsgard as Pennywise is criminal, this movie needed more of him on screen. King's cameo is genius. Very tasteful and surprising not to mention well deserved.They definitely went overboard with the CGI and poorly timed comedy. It takes away from the dark and ominous mood of some scenes. Also, Too many CGI loaded jump scares, it desensitizes the audience and turns horror into comedy.But despite its flaws, I welcome this movie to my list of top horror movies of the last 20 years. It's a very well crafted, adapted, produced, acted and shot piece of cinematography that does absolute justice to the book that birthed it.",It Chapter Two

1501,Fancorrect,IT Chapter 2 Review From FC,8,8 September 2019,"The truth is IT chapter 2 will probably feel a bit too long as a horror film for most viewers but it was a great closure for this remake sequel. Now, don't go in expecting the movie to be a scare fest because it isn't. It's a psychological thrill & although there are some wtf moments, it's not meant for that. So your date may be disappointed if they prefer jumps on every corner. The director Andy Muschietti was able to bring it all together both with great performances & with an amazing visual world that highlights what the character Pennywise really is all about. And that's probably what I personally enjoyed the most about it. The rest of the cast all deserve some kind of recognition, from the kids all the way to the grown ups. Bill Skarsgard once again plays an eerie Pennywise with his own twist but not too far from the original creepiness & James McAvoy still shows his skills no doubt about it. But it was Bill Hader who stole this one IMO. His character ""Richie"" will get your attention from the beginning & never let you go. Plus he ends up getting some help from his battering partner James Ransone's who plays ""Eddie"". They will make you feel as if they really grew up together (no joke/all jokes). So in conclusion, I (FcYoPeace) enjoyed this remake very much & I recommend more if you enjoyed the first one. But if you didn't, still go see it.... you may like this one.PS: I hope you love the Easter egg as much as I did.",It Chapter Two

1505,nnrbrtsn,Overproduced and painfully scare-less,4,21 September 2019,"IT (2017) was in my opinion an okay movie. It did the book justice (for the most part) and was somewhat scary. What went wrong with IT is that it wasn't the jump scares so painfully obviously set up that was scary, it was the tension building up and the mystery unfolding.IT Chapter 2 does basically the same thing wrong - but to a higher degree. Every other scene was a build up to a jump scare that just wasn't scary especially since you could predict it from a mile away. It seems to reuse the one aspect of the horror genre over and over again and every time it happens it becomes less scary and more comical. By the end of the film the girl next to me who at the start was hiding into her boyfriend was nonchalantly checking her phone and didn't even flinch for the most part.Another thing that bothered me in this film was the sound. Goddamnit. Wallfisch's music is usually beautiful and don't get me wrong there was nothing wrong with the score but it really really was soiled by the sound mixing. The music was just too loud in the fight scenes apart from one scene in particular which was actually really good sound mixing (confusing, right?) using the absence of sound as building up tension. I wish they had used that technique more than a jump scare.Some good aspects of the film was that the acting wasn't terrible. Chastain and McAvoy were great at taking their characters younger actors and channelling them through their performance. The rest of the loser club were okay. Bill Hader started off rough and it really felt overacted and it wasn't till the last few scenes where he really showed off some decent acting chops. As for the rest of them, they were forgettable but I think that's more the movies fault than the actors.I did enjoy the CGI and Pennywise himself was terrifying. Skarsgård is a great actor and I'm not really that scared of clowns but god damn did he bring out a new phobia in me.The book goes very deeply into psychology and the meaning of life etc and I'm glad the film didn't dive too deep into that as it was interesting in the book but translated to film it would have been waaay too much. I feel like the film wasn't serious enough to pose a huge psychological question and went for its feel-good ending instead.Overall, if you watched the first film it's interesting to watch the second film maybe once but it just didn't really do much for me as a standalone film. I know that it's a sequel but it really just copied the first film but oh look! They're older! It didn't try incorporate original ideas or more adult themes at all.",It Chapter Two

The story differs so much to the original mini series. Quite a few references to other king films which was cool and the ultimate Easter egg as well as King appears as the shopkeeper selling bill his old bike.

The adults coming together and trying to kill a clown just didn't do it for me. I really enjoyed the first one 2 years ago but when you fall asleep watching this like i did a few times that's pretty bad. Definitely had some good moments but it was more funny than scary and the cgi was hilarious and not scary at all. I think going forward when making a movie like this they should stick to only showing the clown in certain situations and make it as scary as possible. I feel like they showed him to early and often and made it more hilarious then funny. We need more 80's type horror movies and less cgi. Overall it was just ok.

After defeating pennywise in the sewers and banishing him for a long 27 years when the losers club makes there blood oath and swear to come back if pennywise was to ever return. 27 years later pennywise comes back, he is back to his ways again (killing people again in other words). I believe it was a really good movie and it told a good theme that friendship is really important. I would rate this movie a 3.5/5 because the scary scenes were not as frighting as they were anticipated to be. Don't get me wrong I would recommend this movie for anyone 17 and up. It was a fantastic movie and it had really good humor to it. I thought the cast was brilliantly put together. One character that I liked in the book and the movies was Richie, because of his witty humor and he knew his morals when it came down to running or staying and helping, but it was hard for him because he was scared, scared that his ""secret"" would come out. But i thought Bill Hater did a fantastic job with the character. In this movie the characters looked almost identical to there past one. I thought the director's veiw of this movie was incredible and spot on because it followed the book amazingly and was executed the movie effectively and efficiently.

1517,vintageallyson,One of the few horror sequels that actually works.,8,14 September 2019,"I personally love this movie. I'm a huge fan of Stephen King and the first IT movie, so I may be a little bias, but I thought this sequel was amazing. Each scene was necessary and the scares were even bigger than the first. The adult actors clearly studied the mannerisms of the child actors, so they truly fit into their characters' shoes. Stephen King's cameo also gave the film that added spark.There were a lot of details from the book that were also in the movie, which I loved. Richie's crush on Eddie was new, but it felt right and definitely fit the story either way. I think it's a great movie to see if you want a good scare and love a great story. I'll definitely be buying this when it comes out.",It Chapter Two

1519,djsc-94169,CGI overkill,2,21 September 2019,"First thing, his film is waaayyy too long. The first half is entertaining and creeping with glimpses of Pennywise. However, the main problem with this film, is when they decided to let the CGI team run away with their ridiculous ideas. The CGI part when Pennywise becomes some monstrous spider is plain silly, and just seems to go on and on and on. Why in a multi million dollar film, did someone what realise that sometimes less is more.
This seems to be a problem with a lot of Stephen King films. The idea is good, the films usually start off well, but then just seem to spiral out of control, into a CGI mess. Instead of creepy, Pennywise became boring, non scary, and too be honest, I couldn't wait for the film to end. I didn't seem to be alone in this, as the majority of the audience also appeared bored and disappointed.
Not a patch on the original.",It Chapter Two
1520,prototypecmv,Pathetic at least,3,4 October 2019,"'IT chapter 2' is a film based on the Steven King's novels, that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of Derry. The direction is poor, seems like they didn't even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show. I remember a scene in the theater where I would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders. The cast looked like they were bored every minute of it, being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained. They did not make any try to act, just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it. The story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time. There were many points during the film where I was annoyed, even bored, ready to sleep on my chair, the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it. To sum it up, 'IT chapter 2' is a movie for young kids aged 10 - 14 because they would be the only ones to appreciate it. I would not recommend it for anyone over that age plus I would not pay to watch it again. It was a really bad try, I would add, pathetic at least.",It Chapter Two

In this movie pennywise is creepier than ever making for some truly scary scenes. Also the acting from all the actors is top notch especially Bill Hader as Richie. In his performance I found myself emotionally invested in his character.
Overall I think this movie is very good but it does just fail to land with the ending. The ending was emotional and that side was very good but the pennywise part was found very different for an ending although I definatelt preferred this over the It miniseries.",It Chapter Two

There was some memorable moments and scary scenes but a lot of other scenes that were loaded with a Ton of CGI and special effects that look so fake.

While I realize that left them with big shoes to fill and that Stephen King often makes his monsters ridiculous in the book, (making them difficult to translate to the screen) they could have done so much better than a CGI 12 ft cartoon character of a woman. The most unnerving scene in the whole movie was the old woman in the apartment, then the ruined the ending of the scene. The director obvious had the talent to pull it off in the first film , why get lazy in the sequel?

When my fiancé dragged me to the theater to see this, I was expecting the torment all over again. Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of scares and creeps. But after the first hour and a half, it gets tiring.The only redeeming factor is the acting. The adult cast did a fantastic job interpreting the actors that came before them and translating that into adult versions of the characters. It doesn't quite make up for the lazy story arch or overdone effects.Plus, the end is dumb as all get out. Pennywise is supposed to be this big, seemingly unkillable, alien that eats people, then the main characters literally call him names to make him sad and he just dies.If you're wanting scares and a halfway decent story, just watch the first one.

IT suffers from a rather predictable script and can't seem to make up its mind on if it wants to be a comedy or a horror film. There are only a few truly scary moments, as the film follows a pretty linear pattern of events. What shines here is the cast, which offers some strong chemistry and the ability to keep you connected with the characters. The film offers many flashback moments which help tie the overall story together nicely. Overall, I thought it was an enjoyable movie and sequel.

1537,garofan,An Abhorrent Sequel To An Already Awful Movie.,1,12 March 2021,"Welcome to more or less, Part 2 of my previous review. I remember back when this movie was announced, I thought the Muschiettis learned from their mistake. I mean, that's just human nature, right? Everyone makes mistakes at some point in time. I was being generous, I was willing to give them another chance. Then it came out, and there was no more generosity. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. With that out of the way, let's dive into the plot...About 30 years after the events of the last movie, we begin with a scene depicting a bunch of local bullies beating a gay couple and throwing one of them off a bridge to It. I geuss this scene is here to raise awareness about bullying and hate crimes against gay people, which I can fully understand. But the surviving gay guy never appears again after this, nor is he at least mentioned in passing. Not even once.This attack is what prompts Mike to make a few calls. First Bill, who is still the same as he was 30 years ago; Then Eddie, who is also still the same as he was 30 years ago; Richie, who is also still the same as he was 30 years ago; Ben, who is also still the same as he was 30 years ago; Stan, who kills himself anyway; And Beverly, who is, because I can't stress this again, still the same as she was 30 years ago. Seriously, none of these people changed in any way, they still act like 8-12 year old kids despite being middle-aged adults. And from some interviews with the Muschettis and even the cast, this movie is supposed to be like Grown-Ups where they're learning to be kids again, but really, they already are. It really bugs me. Also, Mike drives an old Toyota Camry and works as the town librarian, unlike say, Richie, who drives a brand-new Ford Mustang and works as a stand-up. This is racism at its finest; Absolutley all the white main characters have moved out to become rich and successful (Bill a novelist/writer, Eddie an insurance agent, Richie, again, a stand-up, Ben an architect, Stan an accountant, and Beverly a businesswoman), while Mike is sad and broke. If it were up to me, I'd have made Bill a low-profile scientist, similar to Nick from Godzilla '98 (an infinitely better movie) and in addition, give him a change of heart where he is sympathetic towards It, because at one point, he literally outright says that he hates It, and Beverly would be a teacher. While I'm at it, write Mike and Stan completely out of the movie, and have Beverly be the one who doesn't move out to become rich and successful. Oh, and retcon her being kidnapped, that just doesn't fit It's M. O.
Why would an instinct-driven beast kidnap a human girl? I don't know, and the movie doesn't, either.So the group meets up in a Chinese restaurant, where they get into all kinds of mischief, and surprisingly, no one calls the cops on them. Instead, after this incident, they go to a hotel, where Beverly tells the others that she has been having nightmares -- psychic visions -- for the last 30 years of them dying do they not return to fight It. When from a realistic standpoint, the changes of dying if they do fight It are higher than if they don't (yeah, I'd remove this part of her, too.) Then Mike, having returned from the library with Bill, tells them about a Native American ritual that he showed Bill via drugging him he's thoroughly convinced can kill It (I'll get into that later), so they split up and go off to find things that mean a lot to them, personal tokens, more or less, then they can them to burn for the ritual. But during these fetch-quests, they each cross paths with It. But they return to the hotel and retrieve their tokens before It can eat any of them.Back at the hotel, Bill finds a warning from It that he ""won't be there for (a random kid from the restaurant he and the others yelled at for no reason, whom reminds him of Georgie because he lives in his old house) either,"" but before Bill can save him, It eats the kid. Then, in a blind rage against It, Bill heads into the sewers to kill the creature once and for all, but he's stopped by the others before he can go any further, and they make it to a cavern below the sewers, where they preform the ritual, but no surprise, it doesn't work, because it never did in the first place as they learn from It. Uh, It's still alive and kicking, so clearly that ritual didn't work, so I don't get why Mike made them go through all this for nothing. It attacks the group and even manages to fatally impale Eddie in the process, much to everyone's terror (personally, I'd have him survive.) Perhaps because he threw a metal pole at It, thinking it could indeed kill the creature because he willed it to. And while Eddie dies, he reveals a tactic he used against It earlier in the movie and the others realize this is how they can defeat it. ""There's more than one way to make a person smaller."" So they bully It. And to ensure it doesn't escape with its life, they've got it cornered on all sides, allowing Mike to dig into its chest, tear its heart out, and give it to the others so they can all crush it (I guess my theory that his grandpa raising him to kill living creatures in Part 1 was part of preparing him to kill It was right) The problem here is, this basically implies that bullying is okay in certain circumstances, when we all know there is never any circumstance where bullying is okay. Besides, It isn't even a person, it's a creature that's indifferent towards what humans say in front of it. As shown in the scene where It makes the random kid its next meal, Bill futilely begs the creature to take him instead. But it doesn't listen, instead, it goes for the kill. So there you have it, this movie is literally contradicting itself. There's nothing wrong with putting down a ""monster"" (which is in the truest sense of things, a relative term), as one would do to animals that are dangerous to humans. Bullying it is not; In fact, the movie begins and ends in the exact same way (someone being bullied), first with the local bullies and the gay couple, and now with the main characters and It. Maybe it's supposed to looked at as okay here because these bullies in question are arbitrarily ""good"" and the one on the receiving end is ""evil"" in the same sense. But moving on, Eddie's death tears away at Richie, and he even insists Eddie is still alive (similar to how Bill thought Georgie was in the first movie, but this time, it's even worse because he actually saw it for himself) as the cavern collapses in on itself (for some reason), forcing them to escape. And after deliberately diving into a lake despite a sign explicitly telling them not to, they once again go their separate ways.Shortly after, it's revealed Stan wrote a letter before killing himself. Therein, he says he did it to give them a better chance against It, as opposed to him being there with them. So in a certain circumstance, suicide can actually help?! What kind of message is that? It seemed as if the Muschettis wanted me to come out of the movie feeling good, but all I felt was really bad.If you recall Part 1, I noted Bill's parallels to Trump, but the Muschiettis seem to compare It to Trump (I know, ironic.) It is ultimately a predatory animal (albeit a highly intelligent one dressing up as a clown) that is doing what it biologically should. Bill on the other hand is genuinely loathsome on a human level.Also, the fact that Jessica Chastain, such a stunning, funny, and intelligent woman, went from Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (which also stars Ben Stiller, a much better director associated with Janeane Garofalo, another great woman whose name starts with a ""J"" who's even my user avatar) and The Tree Of Life to this in just a mere eight years is jarring. Sure, she's done some bad movies before this, such as The Huntsman: Winter's War, but this one takes the cake. Thank you for reading my review.There are also rumours of a third movie circulating. Yeah. Like that's ever gonna happen.",It Chapter Two

Andy Muschietti created some memorable scenes and delivers a solid movie that never gets boring even with it's more than 2 hrs and 1/2 length, with the help of Gary Dauberman screenplay that gives a satisfying conclusion to Stephen King's book adaptation to the big screen. The emotive part that worked in the 1st part is still present and now with a nostalgic sense.
There is a well assembled cast, there is chemistry withing the Adult Losers club and the actors seem they really studied their kid counterpart.
Jessica Chastain is great as always, even here voice matches, Sophia Lillis tone. Amy Adams used to be my favorite to play adult Beverly but Chastain proved to be the right choice. James McAvoy, as Bill, always delivers a good performance. His character seems a little blurred at times but even so he has his moments. But the strongest performances in my opinion were 2: Bill Hader, as Richie, which we already knew he will be funny but he also delivers other emotive shades and his character has a secret, something new in this version, that works fine. The other is James Ransone as Eddie, he hasn't been bad in other movies but here he really has a strong performance with some emotive moments.
Bill Skarsgård already owns the character of Pennywise and feels comfortable with it and we also get to see the kids again in some flashbacks (some of them digitally altered because they've grown up) which connects very good the story with the adults.Also, Spolier ahead, in this version the losers have a reason to explore the town and gather some things to destroy Pennywise, which is something fresh that gives more sense for the characters to be exploring Derry alone.The movie has some easter eggs from the previous TV movie version and even a Steven King cameo with a whole scene making fun of himself!
(Spoiler, it was great to bring back Brandon Crane, the original Ben as kid and trying to make us believe he is the adult Ben).The ending is pretty good, it gives conclusion to a well crafted story. Maybe it had too much CGI effects but it is definitely better than the previous version.On the other side, the movie is not really that scary, even less scary than the 1st chapter. The most creepy moments were already presented on the trailers so the surprise factor was blown away and, again, the CGI effects don't really help
(Spoiler, the old lady, probable homage to the shinning in it's computer version, seems more like a Goosebumps monster)Most of the humor is fine but there are some unnecessary jokes that feel out of place and break the scary moments.In general, the movie is a good. If you liked the 1st one you will like this, maybe you will not have a scarier version but a satisfying conclusion. If you are a horror fan, maybe you'll feel a little disappointed but even so it is interesting to see a scary movie with an emotive and well crafted story.",It Chapter Two

If the gruesomely shot gay bashing was meant to spark some diabolical issue with the town, it might have made sense to add it. But essentially this group of homophobes murder a gay man then for some reason leave the boyfriend alive to I guess call the police on them? But when he finds Pennywise eating his boyfriend, I really scratched my head. Pennywise hunted children because of their fear. And did the boyfriend not report anything he saw to the police? Do these people not have phones or something?It was just the first of many plot holes. Why did they all rush back if their memories had been erased? What was the point of grabbing all these artifacts and then burn them? Why did they even need to separate? So were all the flashbacks as kids before or after they stopped Pennywise? No time was spent on why they even left the town?",It Chapter Two

The original elements of creepiness got lost amongst the in your face CGI. For example, the old women in Beverly's old apartment, the staring and the eye movements were building great tension and fear to then be ruined by a 12ft naked old lady hopping around a kitchen.I don't think it needed to be 3 hours and I think Bill Skarsgard's performance was over ruled by bad CGI and countless jump scares and flash backs. Plus the whole giant pennywise spider was what killed the tv mini series, and it was hated by many, it's fine for the book I guess but I can see history repeating itself.The ""meh"" reviews are right this time I'm afraid, wait for the TV release.

But this..this abomination, this dumpster fire, this garbage excuse of a movie should have never existed.
The actors, although well selected, couldn't save it.
First, there was no story, no character development, no lessons to be learned. Zero. And if a movie doesn't have a story it's just a bunch of cheap scenes plastered together with no purpose or connection.
Second, the ""movie"" had a huge problem with the tone. Was it supposed to actually be a parody, is that the reason everyone next to me in the movie theater was laughing? I also laughed at how bad it was. Cheap, overrecycled jokes, repeated till they were annoying the crap out of everyone, horrendous CGI monsters, by the look of it designed by 3rd graders, ridiculous and extremely overused jumpscares, which were not creepy, not scary, just poorly executed. I believe the purpose of the ""scares"" was actually torture for the viewer. Maybe it's a new trend in Hollywood, ""horror"" is actually the feeling of waiting till the damn movie is over so you can do literally anything else with your life afterwards.
Lastly, this piece of crap has absolutely nothing to do with the book. Dear book lovers, please be warned, stay away from this disaster or you will feel insulted. In fact dear everyone, do yourself a favour and pick anything else, you too will feel insulted even if you've never read the novel. This movie will suck the life out of you and all you will want, is to find the closest exit door, run and erase the stupid existance of this movie out of your mind and soul.",It Chapter Two

1564,chrisw25-318-68611,If You Only Want To Be Entertained Then Go,2,8 September 2019,"On the eve of seeing this, yet another sequel, I pondered as to the logic behind 169 minutes. No horror movie has ever required that amount of time to get its story across and this one shouldn't have either.SPOILER ALERTLike the title says, if you only want to be entertained with scary scenes and the redundant CGI that carried the first one (I rate the first one higher, btw), then, by all means, have at it. But I can't get by the time invested only to be rewarded with a weak story, an almost carbon copy to the first and over-the-top CGI and scary scenes in an attempt to top the first movie.The writers threw anything and everything at the viewer because they simply could. With a story so weak, clouded by fluff, one hour in, I began to realize that the first act wasn't even necessary. Penny-wise returns. Let's call everyone and draw out where every adult is now, after instructing them to return to Derry. After we complete that immensely painful intro, let's take them, once again through their childhood memory and ultimate fear, one at a time. THIS IS WHERE THE MOVIE SHOULD HAVE STARTED!! This is your first act! You could have started here and resulted with the same conclusion and saved us at least 45 minutes bringing the movie down to an appropriate two hours.Now, getting to all the weaknesses. First off, the LGBTQ community should have nothing to complain about after the opening scene of two gay men being the catalyst that launches Pennywise's return. And why did the clown return? What happened in 27 years to have the clown return NOW. Not even a conjuring by reading evil script was used to create this, as cliche as that would have been. At least it would have been something.No character arcs to speak of. Bev had an abusive marriage. Okay. That's terrible. End of story. Ritchie had the worst kept secret in the whole movie that he loved Eddie, but yet the movie did nothing to move that subplot. And WHY, why was the psychotic kid, who escaped from the asylum in the movie? He accomplished nothing, absolutely nothing. He came, he stabbed, he died. And Stan, who just couldn't cut it. We see him commit suicide, then the ending is a cop-out tell, don't show moral of the story in the form of ""not a suicide note"" that rambled on and on. Twice, I got up from my seat to leave, only to be forced back down with more monologue from the grave. Oh and the moral of story? Still? We're all losers. Great message, again!And now the ending. Sigh. After everything that happened, two plus hours of waiting, what is the solution? Let's talk the clown down to baby size(""You're nothing but a clown! You clown you. Stupid clown"") , rip his heart out and collectively squeeze it to death. Are you kidding me? Did I just sit through this tale of redundancy to be rewarded with that?I don't mind being entertained but entertain me with some originality with a decent story. In a perfect world, I want a unique script with great characters, taking a great story and driving it forward to a creative conclusion. But, like Billy's book from the movie, the ending was terrible... and so was the beginning... and middle.Two stars out of ten, one for the ""I"" and one for the ""T"".",It Chapter Two
1565,tommygal1974,Hoped for it to be more than it was,5,8 September 2019,"I am a fan of the book and mini series, and Part 1 of this remake really creeped me out. I can honestly say that the first one (which we rented again just before going to Part 2) honestly made me not want to miss any of the frightening moments. We pre bought early admission tickets and took off early from work, eagerly anticipating this movie! Even the trailer sent a few chills up my spine! We were excited, so perhaps that eagerness helped let us down. While there is a strong cast of dedicated, capable actors, with a moderately strong plot, the excessive CGI made it almost laughable (SPOILER TO FOLLOW).Starting with the Chinese restaurant, that could've been genuinely thrilling, but the CGI just made it look a little cheesy as human headed lobster spider things just didn't match the spookery of the first part. There is something to be said about less being more...sometimes not seeing and seeing reaction would be even more efffective,The scene with the old woman, seen in the previews started as frightening, but the globular plasticized old woman took the magical scare factor down.The leper and the brown soupy vomit took away from the the truly frightening element of Eddy seeing his worst nightmare come to life.Honestly, if they just removed the excess CGI, and let the creep factor be realized more with what you don't see, it would have gone further.The deeper story line of the power of friendship really shined through. And I wish the suspense without excess CGI would have been more realized.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, or that you should not see it -- I'm saying maybe don't spend those extra movie theater prices, and make your own popcorn and adjust your expectations.",It Chapter Two

Stephan King knits unbelievable, profound stories together that usually makes you wish you could actually be a part of that story. I'm surprised he made a cameo appearance considering the lack of creative writing.If you like a movie solely for its ability to make you jump (and put you a bit closer to deafness) then this is your movie.

There were absolutely NO scary scenes. Random gay characters (which OK, that's fine) that I really didn't understand why they added other than to lure a larger audience rallying for gay rights. It wasn't a part of the original story. It should have stayed true to the book. Instead, I wasted 3 hours of my life that I will never get back. The only saving grace was that they brought back the child actors (who are awesome) to make sense of this crAp. The child actors had great chemistry and were better to stay true to the book. Adult Beverly was not nearly the bad a$$ that her child version was. Great, she still smokes, I am super impressed🙄.

They have the role of explaining and justifying, or reminding, but I, with the poor memory I have, never remembered anything from It # 1. As such, I will have to see It#1 again.
If you watch the movie, I propose a little attention exercise: Stephen King himself has a 1 minute appearance, in which he says 4 or 5 replicas.

With IT being a 3 hour movie, seemed to loose focus on the plot but those who have seen Chapter One, cannot afford to miss the 2nd part.
Full marks to Screenplay, Production design, Editing, Background Score and spellbinding VFX. Special mention to Bill Skarsgard as he has lived up to his character as IT. The only miss was the X factor of the concept. There are parts where you don't feel scared and IT failed to raise curiosity like it's first chapter. Overall a one time watch.",It Chapter Two

Of all of the horrors I've seen, I've never been as disappointed.Just how part 2 can differ so vastly to the first I don't know. Part 1 had a natural chemistry between the actors, who we could all root for and feel part of the action. It was succinct and not drawn out, and whilst a bit silly in parts, I very much enjoyed it.Part 2, I could go on for hours, but we don't need that. But what I didn't need was gratuitous CGI to generate any possible horror character any 10 year old child has ever dreamt up. Zombies, skulls with spider legs, flaming skeletons, you name it and it's in there.
That would be fine, if it actually suited the plot or storyline and wasn't just thrown in as an excuse to create a computerised monster for the sake of it, like some form of horror bamzooki.Indian tribal rituals and shouting nasty words like ""Bully"" and in fact calling a clown, a clown, is the answer to defeating this extremely powerful being that can generate some form of photosynthetic energy through the back of its head to incapacitate all the cast. I should have seen that one coming!
An absolute shambles from start to finish and under no circumstances did the thinly built plot require a 3 hour cinematic.To think of how strong the message and storyline is from the book and original film/series, yet this far into movie making that's the best we can do?Skarsgard's acting, of which there is not enough of, is mesmerising and the only saving grace.

When it was just the adults confronting their figurative demons and interacting with each other, I was entertained. That may also have something to do with the fact that horror just isn't my favourite genre. With that being said, Richie's token scene may have been my favourite in the film, and the expansion of his character was done quite nicely. Hats off to Andy Muschietti (sp?). Solid beginning, great ending, and a mediocre middle, with particularly brilliant performances from Bill Hader, James Ransone, & Bill Skarsgård (of course).",It Chapter Two

1581,mark-1478,A film that does not know what it wants to be !,5,31 August 2020,"I don't normally review films but this one really bugged me. I saw the first chapter, and whilst not a film i would rush back to see it had a certain charm, but this was a total mess, tonally, length, script, heck even the acting was poor.I kept putting off watching and now i see my gut was right.1. The tone was all over the place. The first film felt very Goonies meets horror, but what was this? It was like Hangover meets horror. Was it supposed to be a comedy horror? Who knows, but it if it was its been done much better elsewhere.
2. Above brings me to script. Endless use of the f word & ""you've got to be .... kidding me"". Who talks like this when faced with grotesque creatures? Again is this comedy or what?
3. Repetitive. First hour was decent enough, but the next hour was tedious beyond belief, by splitting them up (yes i know its the source material!) we were then proceeded to an endless stream of character goes to some dark, dank place and encounters a hideous creature (a shape-shifting Pennywise i guess) running towards the camera, full CGI on show. ENDLESSLY! As a result this ""horror"" was just not at all scary, save for one or two bits. In fact, the most horrifying part was the very beginning, and that was something involving all humans.
4.By the two hour mark i was willing it to end it had become so boring (not a word i use lightly, I'm all for long, slow burning films). I was constantly checking the time, and worst still, knowing there was still another 40ish minutes to go. If ever there was film needing to be trimmed down, this was it. In fact, the first part was bad enough in terms of length and dragging but this was on a whole new level.
5. I honestly believe Chastain and McAvoy must be secretly wondering why the hell they signed up for this, they pretty much phoned in the performance. And don't get me started on Bill Hader. I can only lay the blame at the directer and scriptwriters.In all just a mess of a film and one you might well wonder why on earth you wasted almost 3 hours of your life watching. Just very poor.

This adaptation, both parts, are barely above mediocre and that's only if you've read the book and can fill in the gaps for everything they left out. The director went in not knowing what he was going to do with the story and how he wanted to do it (in an interview, he actually said he's still not done and plans to shoot more footage to add to these) so it comes out feeling disorganized and sloppy; they don't quite fit. The movie relied too heavily on CGI (which, more often than not, just looked ridiculous) but still failed use the technology to do what the miniseries couldn't and include the best parts of the novel. Instead, we again get vague references that make no sense without having read the book, things that were totally ripped off from other movies and references to other Stephen King work.

Who btw, only got It Part 1 on the strength of the first half of 'Mama' (before CG ruined that films ending)
Does the frustrating act of NEVER making us the Audience feel that any of the protagonists are in REAL danger!
Pennywise just likes to scare and scare and get an inch away from destroying any of the adult ""losers"" which will save him ultimately but relents EVERY time?
Now, It does kill Eddie towards the end of the movie to save face with King (who's got a fun cameo non-related) but that ""kill"" was there for It's taking anytime in a MULTITUDE of scenes which makes it less potent and really a peg for some much needed infusion of emotion.
Ultimately the Film is chalked with CG which makes the ""suspension of disbelief"" nearly impossible!
Horror films aren't cartoons Hollywood.
Please watch 'the thing' (1985) to see what real dread and practical effects can do!
Nonetheless,
With good source material from King and a ridiculously high budget from Warner, the director still couldn't out do the made for TV version.
Great actors weren't enough to save this ""what could have been film"" but there still is a few scenes of real tension like maybe best demonstrated with the girl under the bleachers.

And there was too much gore and not enough scares. And don't get me started on the unnecessary swearing. I'm not against swearing but it was overdone. The whole movie was overdone. I still enjoyed seeing Pennywise however the corpses felt dated as we have seen so much of that before. The kids were still really good in their scenes but the adults seemed almost unnecessary.

1. Having the main characters as adults somehow looses the appeal and sympathy for them.
2. The jump scares are over used. Pennywise is a sinister villain but sometimes particularly with horror less is more and this is a classic example. The sinister pennywise from part 1 is now a parody of himself in part 2.
Whilst this is an improvement on the TV movie it is still overlong and I feel anticlimactic.",It Chapter Two
1617,ahmadrezaardeshir,Higgledy-piggledy,1,5 December 2019,The movie was very disjointed! You could guess all of it. Predictable jump scares and repeat. Very weak. It's good for the kids tho,It Chapter Two
1618,wkronz,A Beautiful Mess,8,19 September 2019,"Following up a film as large as 2017's It, which became the highest grossing horror film of all time, can be very challenging. However, director Andy Muschietti and writer Gary Dauberman provide a more than worthy sequel, which may not have pleased everyone, but it certainly pleased me.
Andy Muschietti proves his sheer talent for directing horror, arguably more so than ever before, here. Every tilt, pan, dolly, and zoom serves a purpose and enhances the immersion for the audience.
The cast is another remarkable aspect. The Loser's Club is perfectly casted, with each actor looking just like their child counterparts. The performances are solid all around, but I found Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, and James McAvoy stood out most to me. On the opposing side, Bill Skarsgård once again turns in a menacing, physical performance as Pennywise, and utilizes his expanded screen time to invoke further terror. Teach Grant as well, gives a quite understated performance as Henry Bowers, and provides a delightful sense of mania that always entertains.
Furthermore, the characters are for the most part, well continued, and explored. Nearly every Loser is given an amazingly compelling, and satisfying arc, all the while continuing their character from the first with ease.
The film is also improved on a technical level from the first. The editing, most of all shines. Its pure creativity in its match-cuts and wipes make for excellent transitions between scenes. The cutting during scenes adds a great amount of intensity too. The visual effects are leagues ahead of the often laughable effects before it. All the creatures and terrors are wonderfully designed and rendered much better.
It: Chapter Two, unfortunately is not devoid of flaws. Especially in its structure.
While the story is intriguing, it's unfortunately muddled by flashbacks, that aside from Richie's and Bev's, come of as redundant, and incredibly repetitive. It really shows the films length, and while the runtime itself isn't a bother to me, it makes it apparent what could've been cut.
And, of course, there are the jump scares. Nearly every modern horror film is plagued by these. Beside some clever uses, the jump scares here are infuriating. They constantly ruin the suspense of scenes and become tiresome.
One more rather minute issue is the comedy. While very well written, I did find a couple of instances where it was poorly integrated into otherwise more serious moments.
It Chapter Two follows up its predecessor, and even surpassed it in quality. Muschietti crafts a brilliantly satisfying, if not muddled and sometimes repetitive story, that grounds its persistent terror in thoroughly developed characters, amazing performances, and technical marvels.",It Chapter Two

It brought new thrills and chills and kept that creepy feeling throughout and had just the right touch of comic relief in all the right places. They got it wrong in Chapter 2. This was NOT a horror movie. They focused much too heavily on the humor and fell totally flat when it came to bringing the terror there should have been to light. Even some of the more gory, or what should have been shocking, scenes where made much too light of.Get stabbed in the face by a psychopathic middle school bully?! Let's laugh about it and make light of it as if it's nothing!Dying on the floor after getting spiked through the chest?! Yeah, let's joke about that too!Literally nothing in this movie could be taken seriously and it kills the entire flow of what could have and should have been an amazing end to a brilliant start!Another huge disappointment is the utter lack of creativity that went into this one. There were a few nice nods to the book that never showed in the original 1990 TV adaptation staring Tim Curry, but everything else was just something reused from the first installment. Nothing unique, new, or special.Needless to say I went into this film excited to see something as wonderful as I found its predecessor, and left feeling exasperated and severely disappointed.",It Chapter Two

1626,aaronmoon-00086,"Solid performances, a fitting end.",6,9 September 2019,"I went into this movie very scared that I would be disappointed, but overall, thankfully, I wasn't. I would say that this films strongest aspect was the excellent choice in cast. Actors were outstanding, and did an excellent job in mirroring their child counterparts. The comedic exchange of dialogue between these characters had me laughing pretty hard throughout the entire film, which ironically also causes issues with this film.I wouldn't say that this film is particularly scary. For the most part, it relies on a repetitive use of very predictable jump-scares and disgust to try and scare its audience. There isn't a lot of suspense or build-up to these scares either, they just kinda throw it at you. I actually probably laughed at them more than I cowered from them, which brings me to another issue.This film has some pretty heavy tone issues. There is a lot of comedy in this film, and there are times when said comedy definitely ruins what could have been a decent scare. Not to say that this is a bad thing, but it kept me in a state of comfort. When I watch a horror movie, I want to be horrified. However, this films use of comedy was much more effective than its use of horror.The next thing is that the pacing could have been done much better. The film definitely did not need to be as long as it was, as many scenes just go on for way too long. There are several scenes that could have been much shorter. You could probably comfortably fit this version of the story into 2 hours.In short, despite a few issues, I'm satisfied with this movie. Though they can't very well fit the entirety of Kings novel into one movie, I think that what we have here does the book justice. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, and despite that, I still enjoyed it.",It Chapter Two

Also, the balance of humor and horror in the first film was really well done, but in this one the balance Is gone. Jokes are made in serious moments and they really feel out of place.

I decided to go see the second film purely based on the fact that it had James Mcavoy and Jessica Chastain in the cast. I had the same reaction as the first, what a waste. Too many unnecessary scenes, especially the first one which was nothing more than a typical traditional hollywood political statement. Way too many lines put in for comedy value. Almost every other line was supposed to get laughs. Why was this? It's a horror movie not a comedy. I don't remember Stephen King writing for comedy value. Ok I understand 1 character is a stand up comedian but there was still way too many one liners. I felt much more connected to the characters in the original film than this tosh.

Bill Skarsgård is awesome as always and I´m proud to be Swedish after watching his acting in both the first and second movie. It was a bit much CGI effects and I also thought the way of taking IT down was kind of weird. The fact that they ""made him small"" by kind of calling him weak and ""just a clown"" is in my opinion not that strong. I haven´t read the book though which I for sure will after watching these two movies. Kudos to all the actors also which all did amazing performances. For me this movie was intense and the length of it only did it a favor in my opinion. It didn´t feel stretched out and everything was well made. The factors bringing it down is though, as I´ve already mentioned, some plot related stuff and also the overuse of CGI in some points, I wanted to see more of Pennywise and just witnessing Skarsgård doing his thing, but, overall, it was a well made movie and it affected me just as a scary movie should. Also, the scenes with Bev and her dad was very intense, just as in the first movie. The movie had a way of always keeping you on the edge of your chair, which is important for me while I´m watching a scary movie.TL;DR: 8/10, great story and actors, as well as nice monsters and ways of fearing the viewer. A bit too much CGI effects and some questionable decisions regarding the plot.",It Chapter Two

Either that or they had spent the money and were told by higher ups that they ""had to show it"".This is all made worse because the first act was fantastic, my expectations were met, all the characters were well introduced, and the lead actors were on top of their game, everyone seemed up for it.The problems begin when the gigantic fetch quest that was act 2 reared it's ugly head. Our film crew seems to be a fan of video games. They should have known that spending at least an hour fetching trinkets was fun to play, but not for a general audience to watch. During the many, mnay actions scenes, you *know* that the main characters were not in any danger. Rendering the whole experience dull, and plodding bore.It's not all bad, the last battle was fun, and the closing lines were actually quite touching, but getting to the end was a nightmare (not the kind the makers had in mnd), I just could'nt wait to leave the cinema. I'll have to download a copy and edit out a good 40-50 minutes so that I can have a watchable version of this movie to finish off the enjoyable first chapter.

The director did an amazing job again with the scene changes, they flowed every so easily. This movie falls nothing short of scares from gory to jumpy, just like the first it has you sitting on the edge of your seat with suspense. The tie between past and future remained present throughout the film and really captured and even developed the characters more, just when you thought you couldn't love them any harder. The underlying theme and notion of the movie was just as powerful as the obvious; friendships last forever, the bond the kids (now adults) formed and continue to grow really give this movie the extra kick it needs to set it apart from any other horror movie out there. It's not just about the monster or killing it, it's about finding yourself and accepting who you are and how that makes you stronger. The ending was beautifully done so much so that there could be only one flaw, and while I'm biased I hated to see Eddie was killed off. As the joke goes in the movie ""just like one of bills books, the ending sucked"". Nonetheless the movie lived up to its expectations from beginning to end.

Half the movie is flashbacks with several of them being scenes from the first movie. Every character went to relive some unseen memories of Pennywise from their childhood before they cut into present day to deliver even more scare scenes for each character... It's the most predictable and unbalanced movie i think i ever witnessed. Also the jump scares were way to predictable, they fool you once and something will pop up from the dark when the camera switches angle. And by using that method repeatedly it took away what they tried to achieve with Pennywise and the horror they did fairly well on during the first movie.The actors did a decent job although none really stood out besides Beverly, and i would say that is in large parts because of her character in the first movie. The rest is pretty tame and there is little to no development for any of the characters.Overall i was left bored through all of it. Way to long for my liking, especially for a movie with so little depth to story-line, felt like the premise was to kill the clown and had to put an hour and a half with fillers to be able to call it a movie.

1657,ajbr-48095,I don't get why people are so disappointed in this film,7,7 September 2019,"MINOR SPOILERS below.Yes, this film does have plenty of flaws. I thought that the beginning scenes where Mike called the Losers back to Derry were WAY too short and rushed. The film definitely could have used another 20 minutes or so to flesh out the adult characters before the Jade of the Orient scene. I'm also still not a fan of the overblown CGI jump scares that they carried over from the first film. And there was a little bit too much misplaced humor, although most of it didn't bug me.However, I think the good in this film definitely outweighs the bad. The casting is great, with Bill Hader as Richie and James Ransone as Eddie being the standouts for me (I especially loved what they did with Richie's character in this movie). At almost 3 hours long, I never got bored or lost interest. And honestly, while not perfect, I'm surprised that the pacing was as good as it was. And while overall the movie wasn't very scary, there were several genuinely intense, great scenes: the opening scene at the fair, the Hall of Mirrors scene, the scene with Victoria and Pennywise under the bleachers, and the scene in Beverly's apartment (minus the unnecessary jumpscare).While objectively this film is a probably alittle worse than the first one, I enjoyed it just a little bit more for one reason: it felt a lot more Stephen King to me. This film felt almost EXACTLY the same tonally as the book, mainly because this film is darker and a bit more gruesome than the first film. And I loved that.

That part didn't actually bother me a lot... just found it funny. But... acting wasn't bad... just the script they were going off of. Pennywise's lines weren't even really that great.Oh, and there were definitely some scenes where the CGI on the creatures just looked cartoonish... ie: fortune cookie scene when they first hop out of the bowl.. and then I think it was the scene with Pennywise's ""daughter"" when she changes form.Not sure how the first half of this set was so good, and the second half was rubbish.Funny tidbit though.... that's sort of how the original miniseries was... the kids did awesome, and the adults really didn't... but back then it really felt like it was the acting, this time it felt like it was the script.",It Chapter Two

Everyone in the cinema was laughing throughout the movie, at the parts that were meant to make you laugh and the parts that were meant to make you scared. Not once to I hear I single scream out of anyone, after almost 3 hours I didn't jump once. The ""monsters"" looked like they were straight out of the goosebumps movie, just over the top CGI.

1671,benwallwork,A fun sequel that isn't as good as the first,7,14 September 2019,"It Chapter Two is a fun sequel is by no means a great film. The film suffers from pacing issues, plot lines that don't really go anywhere, an over reliance on cgi creatures at times and many scares that are more silly than scary.
However, there is still a lot of fun to have with this fun, for example: the opening scene, while gruelling and disturbing, is extremely effective and creepy, the characters and casting, for the most part, are on point, many scenes can be creepy and it was interesting to see the writers include some lore from the books.
It Chapter Two is a strange balance of scenes that aren't scary or effective and scenes that are, however the scenes that aren't are still very enjoyable and make for a good laugh. Although it has its short comings, I'd still recommend IT chapter two, as it's a fun and enjoyable horror film and is genuinely filled with passion from the filmmakers.",It Chapter Two

That's why, Bill in the movie was continuously targetted for writing bad movie endings as Stephen King himself admitted that 1990's ending was poor.
The best thing is to see too many fear factors. The Paul Bunyan Statue attacking was awesome. While Mrs. Kersh scene from 1990 is improved a lot and is the best scene for me among all It movies.

1680,mjjenkins-40538,I think some maybe even most people are treating this as if it were a straight up sequel when they really shouldn't.,10,4 September 2019,"Although Stephen King's IT novel is more of back and forth from adult to kid and back and forth from adult to kid and so on, IT : Chapter 2 should be looked at like it's the 2nd half of one big story, which is exactly what it is rather than a sequel. It's really not a sequel. Just like the 2nd half or ""adult half"" of the 1990 TV Miniseries/movie is not a sequel, it's just the 2nd half of one big story/movie. Let's face it, unless they're the Godfather Part 2, Aliens, Terminator 2 : Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, The Empire Strikes Back, and maybe a couple of other big time hit sequels, the sequel almost always gets hated on, critiqued to death, disregarded as ""unoriginal"", ""same old same old"", ""not very creative"", treated like the ""intruder"", etc etc....it's the same for 90% of remakes..but people need to realize and understand that IT : Chapter 2 is not a sequel and that IT : Chapter 1 and IT : Chapter aren't remakes to the 1990 TV minseries/movie either.Secondly, almost every negative review on Rotten Tomatoes or YouTube or on the Internet somewhere (and I'm pretty sure they'll make their way onto here sooner or later as well) have complaints about the runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes and that it's ""too long"" and blah blah blah. I don't see how you can make this whole story put to film not be at least 5+ hours long (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 combined)..at the VERY least. The novel is over 1,100 pages long ! 1,138 pages to be exact. ""IT"" should have been a 10-15 1 hour episode series on Netflix to be done properly, to be honest..but if you go the cinema route with it (and they did, obviously), between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, it has to be, at the very least, 5 hours or so if the Director or Writers want to be even remotely faithful to King's novel and make fans of King and the novel at least somewhat satisfied. And you also have 7 protagonists..SEVEN..6 of which are main protagonists. That's A LOT character developing and character story arcs that have to be told and take place unless you want a lazily and poorly directed and written film with terrible story telling and bad or no/next to no character development.This film delivers great character development and great character and story arcs for all of the main protagonists/characters of the film. This film is really entertaining overall. There are pacing issues but those really seem minor when you step back and look at this film as a whole. This film was really good on it's own and holds up very well on it's own. Yes, it relied on Chapter 1 some, obviously, because Chapter 1 is part of the overall story (Again, it's NOT a sequel. I'm really talking about how well Chapter 2 is made when saying ""it's really good on it's own) but when you put Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 together and make it one big story/film like it should be, it's AWESOME. Pennywise is also at his most serious and gruesome in this one. This one doesn't cut away just as someone or a helpless kid is about to get bitten or eaten until after you see and hear plenty enough, if you know what I mean. More gore in this one. It definitely earns every bit of it's R rating. Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, Bill Skarsgard, and James Mcavoy are excellent, especially Hader and Skarsgard. Nobody was bad though..everyone was, at least, good. The CGI was also much better in this one..of course it would be though because it had a much bigger budget to work with than Chapter 1 did.My biggest con..and it's the same as my biggest con for Chapter 1. Too many ill timed funny jokes. 2 or 3 jokes when it's the right time for them are great and it works. It lightens things up even if just for a few seconds and during the RIGHT times. And this film has a few well timed funny moments as well, don't get me wrong. But the funny/comedy/jokes at the wrong times, especially in a horror movie, just suck, to put it simply. It ruins scenes especially scenes that are supposed to be or should be horrifying and terrifying and scary and making you nervous and tense and scared and such. And unfortunately, this film has those ill timed/placed jokes as well.Overall though, this film is great..especially when you look at as whole with Chapter 1.",It Chapter Two
1681,nzmichaelclark,"A Great Film. However do not look for a scary film in this, as that is not it's purpose.",7,13 September 2019,"It Chapter 2 is the second part of this horror adaption, from the movie which came out in 2017, It.
The film starts with a truly graphic opening scene, with beating of a gay male couple during a ""hate crime"", with the result of one of the characters called Adrian Mellon being thrown off a bridge into the waters below, to be FLOATED towards the clown himself, Pennywise the dancing clown.
After this opening scene we introduced to the Loser's Club as adults, and what their lives and jobs are like after 27 years after the first part of the tale. This brings me to say how physically perfect the casting in this film was, and how they actually felt like the younger versions of themselves. However, their chemistry is different to the kids.
After we find out why Mike has brought them back to Derry, we start explore the flashbacks, which show us the friendship that are being drawn back to after all this time, and even gives us insight to certain things that the first film never really explored, which I thought was well done, as in the book, they explored things that they did as children, and even with a different fashion they went with, it still felt true and faithful to the book.
The comedic sense that they went for during the second act of the film didn't feel pushed, and actually felt right, as most of the gags which adult Richie told were actually also told in the book. By the way, Bill Hader played as extraordinary Richie. I like the approach that they took with the Ritual Of Chud, as they were able to make sense why the Loser's actually needed to explore a certain of Derry, to find the artefacts needed to destroy It.I liked how they decided to explore Richie's character differently to the book, as making his character gay gave that part of the film a different depth that neither the book or miniseries had. The Paul Bunyan scene was a lot of fun, and had a great appearance of Pennywise. The most suspenseful part of the film however was definitely Mrs Kersh's scene with Beverly, when she went to her old home, where her and her Father once lived. I love Mrs Kersh for five awkward seconds just paused. As a Witch she was quite disturbing, and seeing Bob Gray turn himself into Pennywise was a lot of fun, disturbing fun of course. I won't explore everything of the second act, but as this film was very long, but it did drag just a little bit. Bill's part of film was also very good, as he in the film had met a kid, a kid he was afraid for, as he said to Beverly, ""I can't let it happen again"", a reference to Georgie. It is very emotional to see Bill trying to kick through the mirror house glass to save the kid, as Pennywise bangs his head against the glass to kill the child. Stephen King's cameo was also hilarious, especially as his character also told Bill that the ending of his book that he had written was ""terrible"".
Eddie's part of the film was also good in the second act, and boy does he look like his younger self from the first film. I like how it explores his hypochondria. I like how brought Mr Keene in this scene, to be as unnerving as ever, especially as he is made out to much older now. We also get to see a flashback of the Leper attacking a shapeshifted version of his Mother, which also comes back after his flashback to jumpscare Eddie. Before I go onto the third act of the film, I liked what we got to see of Henry Bowsers, with that same menace and hatred in his eyes, but he could of had a little bit more to him before his death. Still, good scenes which contained him.
The third act of the film is when the Loser's all draw back together, as Bill is willing to confront IT alone. But they find him just in time. This where the climax really picks up, as this is the final showdown, the Ritual Of Chud, where they can defeat the Clown from the Macroverse for once and for all. The final scene is entertaining and puts the two character of Ben and Beverly together, a dream that always had since he wrote her that poem. The end does go on, but gives it the feel that was needed to conclude this film, and was definitely not a disappointment. Pennywise's final form was interesting, and the part where Beverly had to swim in blood was entertaining, especially with the appearances of her Father Alvin Marsh and Henry Bowser's, who said to her as a reference to The Shining, ""Here's Johnny"".
This is a great conclusion to the story, the flashbacks well merged into show the friendship and remembering of what happened before. The first film had a chemistry which was hard to match, a story structure which was a little bit better adapted to this, but only tad this movie does a great job of using it's material from the book. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was again magnificent, but didn't star as much in this film, but was nevertheless creepy but also clown-like and oddly funny. This is a great film, and while the kids set the characters in a better way, the adult cast did a great job of carrying that legacy on, and altogether felt like the characters. These two movies were both more of an adventure than a horror, and its purpose was well met. But at times it was quite horrifying, and because of Richie, at times quite funny too (especially when Richie is put into the Deadlights pause in the final battle). This gave time for relief like the first film, as did the book at times, which captured Richie's character perfectly.

Over 150 minutes, and it has to be exceptional. Sadly, IT: Chapter 2 only ticks one of those two boxes. For me the first 30-45 minutes was ok, before it then became silly and tedious. Too much budget, too much time, and too little plot. I'm happy to suspend a degree of plausibility, but I should have just suspended my watching of this film.

The cgi was better than the first movie but the de aged kids looks absolutely awful.The movie undermined a lot of important book characters. Stanley uris and Henry bowers deserved more screen time as did Myra, patty, Audra, and Tom Rohan who had a lot more important roles in the book than they did in this film.I like rhe way they did the flashbacks to them as kids but I do feel they were somewhat repetitive and should've had less of them to make room for more important scenes of the adults from the book.Eddie and Richie deserves a better love story and Eddie deserved better last words.",It Chapter Two

Sure, I laughed because it was funny, but I can count on one hand the amount of times my heart actually skipped a beat. The cast was amazing so naturally the expectations were high.

Though there's also parts where it's actually serious and I couldn't stop laughing. For instance when adult Billy is drowning the zombified Georgie and Georgie is still trying to say ""You lied and I died"" so it just comes out as a bunch of bubbles. Once again, like the 2017 It, the actor for Pennywise takes himself way too seriously. The final fight with him also dragged on, but most of the movie did.

The casting and chemistry between adults are phenomenal. The adult cast made me believe that they were the kids twenty-seven years later because of their uncanny similarities physically and personality-wise. The special effects and CGI also shaped the film to be exceptionally lifelike and believable, especially in horror scenes. Despite the length of the movie, I never felt bored because the movie was fast-paced and kept me interested. Of course, Bill Hader's comedic lines aided in that regard as well. Furthermore, Bill Skarsgård's performance was exceptional as per usual. I enjoyed every part of this film. The only downsides from my viewpoint were that the movie failed to give a proper recap of the first movie. Therefore for people, like myself, who have not watched the film in two years may feel lost in the beginning, especially during the introduction of the adult characters. Overall, the two ""It"" films complement each other very well yet are each fantastic in their unique way. Without a doubt, ""It Chapter Two"" is a horror movie classic.",It Chapter Two

The book-readers will appreciate all the call-backs and Easter eggs. Regardless of whether you read the book, it aims to be an epic 2 hour 49 minute sequel and I think it succeeds in concluding the story in the best possible way.I can't get over the casting of the adult Losers. MacAvoy and Hader are highlights but I feel bad to single them out because each adult Loser has enough time to shine in this movie. The way that they combine and transition between the adult Losers and younger Losers stories is imaculate every time.What makes this film scary, is that you can almost except the younger Losers to be afraid of what they encountered, but to see the adult Losers' reaction to Pennywise makes this film as immersive as It: Chapter One as well as adding something that Chapter One did not have.I do think that it tries a little bit harder to have a comedy side to it, but these moments are genuinely funny.",It Chapter Two

The emotional catharsis (the realization that belief makes your reality, we are a reflection of others' opinions, etc etc barf) didn't work at all and its attempt was an rehash of ideas we've seen done well many times. The extra-long runtime seems to come from attempting to cram every kind of little jump-scare scene, all of which were utterly predictable failures with way too many ghosty variations of the ""monster"" that made It less and less scary and less clear as a character.In all, this was a disappointing, washy and welcome ending for It that didn't leave me wanting any more.",It Chapter Two

There was even applause in my theatre when the credits started rolling. This film was far more disturbing and darker than IT: Chapter One and it was executed perfectly. Pennywise is far more active and talkative in this film as well. The opening scene is heartbreaking, but it also disturbs you to your core. It captivates you and keeps you on the edge of your seat, especially when it comes to the final battle with the Losers and Pennywise. I'll definitely be seeing this again!

The monsters or ghosts are weird. I get dumbfounded and highly motivated after watching it.My mental condition went up and down when I watched this because all the casts did freaking awesome job. They played with our minds.. There are a lot of scenes that will make you realize that your mind is the scariest. If you only wait for never ending jumping scare scenes, you'd better looked for other movies as this movie is super different with the others. The genre that this movie offers is more into psychological horror, so it is not only frightened your feeling but it also has something to do with your mind. Be careful.",It Chapter Two
1714,vidstarcevic,Pennywise is just not scary,4,8 September 2019,"The story is Expectingly good and i would say nostalgic if are a fan of the book and the mini series. The casting is great, especially Bill Hader (Richie), who made me laugh throught the whole movie. One of the biggest problems with this movie is the same as in the part one, and it's pennywise the clown. He is like a walking cgi, and a bad one i would say. Most of the time he would appear on screan, and the audience would just laugh. There is literally a scene where he looks like a snapchat dog filter, and thats the part where i gave up on him. Not to mention those stupid dance moves of him, where you guest it they used cgi again. If you want a real horror experience watch Tim Currys version of pennywise, they cant compare on any level. The other thing im disappointed in is the thing they went for the jumpscares and not the atmosphere, but thats the problem of all ""new era"" horror movies. For me the 1990 version is far better, and they had like a far lower budget which is saying something about this movie.",It Chapter Two
1715,staceyswale,Great storytelling,10,8 September 2019,"I went to see this nearly a week ago, on IMAX, and never written a review on here before. I thought that I needed to soak up the film, watch the first again, and due to the amount of negative reviews, I felt needed to add my voice to the mix.First, see it in IMAX. The cinematography, sound design and music truly deserve this.I am a huge horror fan, have been since a young age. Now in my thirties,I still love horror, but my tastes have changed. IT was one of my favourite novels as a teen. The grown-up half of a book, split between the teen adventure and adult horror. THIS is a grown up horror film. It has all the usual hallmarks of your favourite ghost, monster or body-horror movie but it also has great cinematography, unique storytelling and, above all, emotion. Some of the criticism has been that it isn't horror enough. I'm not sure whether people were expecting a Saw or a usual James Wan-alike film, but this isn't a identikit horror affair. In fact the most horrific parts in this movie arn't reserved for Pennywise, they are the 'real-world' events such as the first scene and Bevs relationship with her husband which are the most shocking. The weight of emotion in any scene with Bill reflecting on Georgie was so powerful and heartbreaking to watch, truly something most horror films cannot do. The humour too is great. Perfectly placed and gives a real feel to the characters and their relationship with each other, harking back to their childhood. The casting of the teens to adults is perfect. The way they look, the mannerisms, everything is perfectly crafted to seemlessly move between past and present. The cast play their parts perfectly, each showing their craft in different shades, although Mike could have been a little more developed I feel.Yes, some of the sections of the film are strange, off-kilter and, sometimes, crazy. Have you ever read a Stephen King novel?! This is a pretty crazy story and I think they did well to ground the movie and make it seem believable without losing the best parts of the story. Yes, some of it is obvious CGI. A lot of it simply had to be. There did seem to be a lot which used makeup, prosthetics and acting too though. Maybe I'm being naive.The pacing of the film is great. If anything, there were a couple of areas they could have slowed down and built up more. 3 hours + of this quality story telling would have been brilliant. I'll guess I'll have to wait for directors cut...",It Chapter Two
1716,onlineoutlaw,IT Was a Great...Comedy?,8,9 September 2019,"Yes, you read that correctly. Comedy. This movie had the tone of not wanting to take itself seriously and simultaneously wanting to be your standard, cliche drama/horror film. Honestly, I loved it, and thought it was genuinely funny. Call me heartless or sadistic, but I let out some chuckles when Pennywise struck three of his four victims (the exception being Eddie, that death was actually done a lot better in terms of emotion in this film than the Tim Curry miniseries). Here's why, though: I can't take the thought of some killer clown that sounds like Winnie The Pooh on a bad day (I kept waiting for him to say ""Oh bother"" during the film) seriously in the slightest. There were maybe three parts in the entire film that made me genuinely startled, and of course they were the jumpscares I saw coming. My brain has yet to learn after all this time to always expect it to happen at any time. Now, I went to see this movie last night only because my friends had goaded me into it, because I've never really been a fan of present day horror films or It in general. I'll watch the original miniseries if I'm bored or really want to see one of the subjectively best performances Tim Curry has given in his entire career of acting. But I ended up loving this movie, not because I liked the source material, not because it was a good movie, but because it went from being overly brutal (like the scene of Adrian being beaten by those teens at the beginning) to so over to top to genuinely funny, I couldn't place any emotion to feel but joy and humor for just how far this movie would go to try and be creepy. Other scenes like the final fight between the gang and Pennywise (besides the incredibly annoyingly over the top part where Georgie kept yelling ""You lied and I died"" during Bill's last hallucination scene--One time would've done it for me, but the creepy factor went sour with an overexaggerated performance), the scene where Mike drugs Eddie so he can see his visions and memories, and one other scene I can't seem to remember as of right now (but it caught my attention for sure) were pretty cool and interesting scenes. The camera angles and some of the transitions were very smooth and construed all the emotion I needed to feel during said scenes. The one time I was genuinely confused and could only laugh by cracking a joke related to one of our friends was the scene where Beverly visits her old apartment and runs into the old lady who decides to strip and chase Bev through the apartment complex. Though I must say, while I was completely indifferent towards this just like with 90% of the 90s miniseries, this time around the story was actually memorable to me. Likely because I actually enjoyed it, as was mentioned before. Whether or not the writers or anyone else involved aimed at it to be an unexpected comedy horror is unknown to me, but if it was meant to be genuinely scary, that makes it all that much better. So if you want a great laugh and ponder upon whether or not the movie knows what genre it wants to be, I definitely recommend this movie (plus there's a cameo by Stephen King!!! :D). Cheers!",It Chapter Two
1717,anwynn-56714,What a waste,3,9 September 2019,If you love the book you will hate this movie. Well cast and the acting is good but the pros stop there and you are left with 2 hours and 50 minutes of cons. Seemed more like a dark comedy than a horror movie.

1719,pdjackson-85572,THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL!!!! GET IT IN YOUR HEADS!!!!,10,10 September 2019,"Seriously, to start off, the amount of people coming on here leaving reviews and saying that Chapter 2 is a sequel to 2017's IT, get it in your heads, Chapter 2 (the title gives it away) is NOT a sequel. Hence the reason it is called CHAPTER 2. When you read a book and finish chapter one, do you think 'I will have to read the sequel next'? No, you don't. You carry on reading and move on to chapter 2 as it's part of the same story. IT Chapter 2 is the second half of one whole story. Not a sequel.Secondly, people complaining about the run time, you should have known how long the movie was before going to see it. It is not hard to either come on imdb and check or simply look at the difference in show times at the cinema. Additionally, if you had any idea or knowledge of the novel by Stephen King, you would understand that this is an epic storyline. The book is over a thousand pages. This story could have been made in to a 10 or 20 hour TV series easily and would still be full of scenes that didn't get anywhere near 2017's Chapter 1 or 2019's Chapter 2.To summarise, if you are going to read and take the side of all these low scoring reviews, do the film makers and Stephen King fans a favour. Just stay away from both movies. They are not for you. The film makers have done a tremendous job in bringing the story of Pennywise the Clown and the Losers Club to our screens while staying as true as possible to Stephen Kings novel (seriously, if you have read IT by Stephen King, you will agree).If you go in to this movie thinking it's going to be a fright fest, you are going to be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there are a few decent jump scares here and there but as with all Stephen King stories, they are about characters, people, struggle and resolution.Thank you to the film makers for bringing this to our screens.",It Chapter Two

1722,connormccance,Glad I saw it but wouldn't watch again,6,14 September 2019,"Coming off from seeing It Chapter 1 I was pretty siked about Chapter 2. Chapter 1 wasn't that great but it still was a good solid movie. Where Chapter 1 failed was with the cheap jumpscares rather than having more psychological horror. Well It Chapter 2 was an overall disappointing finale. Granted it still had it moments like pennywise killing the gay person and killing the little girl that made me want a movie about pennywise just going around killing kids it still failed to keep me fully interested in this endgame of a story. It Chapter 2 wastes alot of time with the Henry Bowers story that could've been taken out completely as it served no purpose at all in the movie. I also felt this in the first one as he was very under utilized and could've had a bigger purpose in both films instead of an obstacle that goes away quickly. I was also not a fan of the middle portion of the film as it felt very predictable and not that entertaining. I really didn't understand why ""Angel of The Morning"" played while Eddie was getting vomited on as it felt like I was watching a Deadpool movie and not a horror psychological thriller. I did like the relationship between Richie and Eddie. Having them be insecure about their feelings for each other made Eddie's death more tragic and allowed you reevaluate how they acted toward each other. Overall I felt as if they saw that people liked the comedy in the first one so they doubled down on it in this one which was ok I just wish we had more scenes like the girl under the bleachers getting baited by pennywise. Stuff like that is creepy and more scary then some CGI clown shaking towards you. I believe they should've waited another year or two to put this out as the CGI was not the best and the script could've used some more work as well. Also cast was amazing of course. Good finale to It but I guess we'll wait another 27 years for a better remake.",It Chapter Two

The film felt choppy and all over the place, I felt like I didn't know what was going on. They didn't explain the ""ritual"" well at all and the way they kill It was pretty dumb.

1724,danielagigante-35250,Shocked at the Reviews. This is an awful movie.,1,18 September 2019,"I cannot believe this movie is currently sitting at above 7/10. It was not bad but awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I created this account just to write this review. But, where to begin?Character Development: I liked the first one. What I think made it special was the character dynamic. In this movie, you have the ""same"" characters, as in, the characters in adulthood; however, the problem is it's not the same characters and you never build a relationship with any of them. This would have been possible if there was an attempt at character development, but it seems the writers were ok with just going, yep, it's the kids you loved all grown up! Enjoy. I didn't.Not scary/chilling/dark: With the exception of Bev going home and the short interaction with the older woman, this movie was not even remotely scary, chilling or dark. The CGI was silly, as is so often the case. The jump scares certainly didn't make me jump, however cheap they may have been.Not funny: There are a few clever parts. Some witty one liners, but nothing particularly funny, despite all the pathetic and constant attempts at humor.The Indian Ritual: So, Mike has this idea that everything is tied to this ancient indian ritual and they have to perform it in order to kill IT...or something. So, we lose about an hour or more of the characters exploring the demons of their childhood gathering what can only be called ""horcruxes,"" only for them to be totally ineffectual. I guess this is supposed to be where the characters are developed, but the focus is more on jump scares and other nonsense. No real development takes place.Bowers: I haven't seen any discussion of this, but what in the world is going on with Bowers? Is he possessed, just pure evil, why did he turn out this way? This is never ever touched on. It's just so strange. Also, why is he even in the movie? What purpose does he serve? Perhaps worst of all, a convicted murderer (Bowers) escapes from an asylum after murdering a guard and no one seems to care. No cops, no reports, it's not even addressed.Length - Wow. Long. 2 hours and 50 whole minutes. And let me tell you, it feels like it. Honestly, if this were 1.5 hours I probably wouldn't be writing this review. A kooky clown movie doesn't need to be three hours long.""The Losers"" aren't Losers: With the exception of Mike, and even then it's debatable, the Losers aren't really losers. They're all somewhat successful, good looking and ostensibly well-adjusted. Part of the appeal of the first was these rejects getting revenge and working together to fight against this wicked evil force. Totally lacking in Chapter 2.I'm sure there's more but that's really all I can think of. Some people have said you shouldn't give this one star if you haven't read the book. However, the movie should be able to stand alone. It's obviously not written exclusively for the people who have read this insanely long book. And, if it is so much like the book, then I can say with the confidence the book blows, just like the movie.",It Chapter Two

1731,TheAngryReviewer,Disappointing,5,11 October 2019,"After I saw the first film I was left wondering what would come next, Would they beat the famously terrible ending of the mini-series and would bill skårsgard beat the legendary performance of tim curry. I have to say the answer was a flat no for both those questions. The writing of its character was heavily dependent on jump scares that just aren't as scary when you expect them to happen and they end up just being some cliche jump out and say boo sort of thing. There are only genuinely scary scenes in the film, the first was the riverbank scene it was edgy it was shocking and brutally violent, the second was the scene underneath the seats at the baseball game it was similar to the opening scene of the first it film and it used pennywise taking advantage of the innocence and cluelessness of a child to lure them away instead of some cheap scare where he would just jump out at them, the third and final was the hall of mirrors scene, this scene builds tension and creates fear within the viewer by showing the helplessness of bill the confusion and terror of the kid and the vicious intentions of pennywise. Apart from the 'horror' aspects of the film I surprisingly found it quite funny there were often scenes in which I would find myself laughing, often when the film wasn't trying to be funny, but sometimes the film would attempt to be funny and the jokes were out of place for the movie, the joke involving The puppy was a joke I felt was more in place in a kids movie not a horror movie and looking back at it I find the joke irritating. The final scene was a disaster, the portrayal of pennywise as the giant spider clown made the crappy rendering of the miniseries look like Jurassic park, The death of pennywise was cheesy and annoying and left the viewer with a craving for more, it was dissatisfactory of the death of this god like being who has reigned terror in Derry for centuries would be defeated by some playground insults and the power of Friendship. My final comments will be about the terrible pacing, this film had a lot of story to tell but it did it in such an awful way spending way to long on the eventually pointless hunt and made the 2 hour 43 minute film feel like being on a plane, where you feel trapped and bored for extensive amounts of time.

Also it was nonstop entertaining to see the kids getting in trouble with pennywhise and being consistently frightened. I was exighted to see it: chapter 2 but I realized compared to it's predecessor it was bland and boring. The adults didint feel as fun as the kids and it was just wierd.

I still thoroughly enjoyed the film however it wasn't that scary or jump scary.
The first film had me peeking through my eyes whilst this one I sat whilst eating dominoes.
At first, I found the film confusing as I hadn't watched the first one in a while but when they had the short videos of the past, that helped me to remember who the characters were and what had happened in the previous instalment.
I liked how the story progresses and how you learn about how they changed as adults and how none of them could remember the past.
I loved how creepy the film was, especially the head with the spider legs coming out of its sockets, creeping towards them as well as Pennywise swallowing the girl.
I also enjoyed the last fight scene with Pennywise attacking the gang after they try and summon the ritual.

Why the felt the need to reverse the idea of the losers each meeting Pennywise was strange, it's so much simpler in the book, they all return home, and each have their own reintroduction, this painful ""token"" quest Mike sends them on is pointless and weird, why complicate the issue. The ending in the book is impossible to film, so that has to change, but the giant CGi spider thing is daft looking and totally removes the viewer from peril. The premise of not being afraid is vaild, it's execution was weak though. At times I felt it could have been creepy, Mrs Kersh starts as a good example, she's weird and off, shuffling around in the background, only to turn into a bad CGi naked giant granny, it's funny, genuinely funny. Far too much reliance on CGi and, it's too funny, bits of humour are good of course, but it's even injected at the finale. There are moments in the book that would have been easy to slide into the film, the giant bird for example that attacks a young Mike, but instead they went for the giant Paul Bunyan statue, all very odd and strange choices from top to bottom really. It gets stars for the cast who are solid as the grown up Losers and the actual casting is fantastic. And there are moments to enjoy. Wasted opportunity overall.",It Chapter Two

Yes it may seem cheesy and dated nowadays, but there was a great sense of eeriness and realism.The part 1 remake was very good in my eyes! It was updated, fresh and focused a lot on the characters and their relationships. Fabulous! Maybe a tad too much cheap CGI, but not overkill.Part 2, has just seemed to lose it's way. The opening was actually quite good...and dark which is what i was hoping for (i won't mention what happens in case you decide to watch it) But then as the film progressed i felt like i was watching a comedy? a comedy with cheap jump scares and absolutely no character focus or development. I genuinely did not care about any of the adult characters, at all. For some reason Muschietti seems to be more focused on (really bad) CGI jump scares than the authenticity or the development of the characters. At least in Tommy Lee Wallace's original starring Tim Curry, props and costumes were used rather than this cheap, non scary effects. When a film is filled with CGI it loses it's realism and i lose interest. It's like, they couldn't be bothered to make the effort to scare it's audience and a lack of effort really shows in this film.I will usually see a film through to the end but i has to turn this off. I was so bored and after 2 hours of bad effects and boring characters, i didn't want to waste any more of my time.Disappointed and gutted as there was mass potential to be scary.",It Chapter Two
1750,psycadelix,How could they get it so wrong?! Gutted.,1,7 September 2019,"Anyone who's read the book will find this an abomination. Anyone expecting a horror film, it isn't. I enjoyed the first, it had suspense, Pennywise had his dark, crazy moments, just the way he would stare for a second or 2 had a creepy factor. This has nothing, NOTHING. When a supposed horror film has the people laughing at 90% of what's going on, they've done it massively wrong. They tried to make IT a comedy!. I know a lot who haven't seen it yet will find that hard to believe, but it's true. There are so many ""comedy"" 1 liners thrown in at times when a normal person just wouldn't react that way, it's unbelievable. The CGI is terrible, real bad and they use it for 95% of everything going on. It doesn't follow its own certain rules that it sets down in parts. Many, MANY of the things wrong with this film I won't say due to spoilers.
SPOILER FREE about the end. If you thought it couldn't get anymore ridiculous than what you know from previous, well...you'll see.
The acting was decent, that's the 1 star.
IT is the only book I've read twice and enjoyed just as much the second time round as the first and everyone knows how big the book is. I'm gonna read it again to try and rid the memory of this terrible, terrible vision.

After the skateboard kid scene the story platued and just stayed stagnant. A lot of flashing lights at the end and just some stuff that doesn't even come close to relating to the book from this. If other people love this film thats fine. Its not last Jedi so I'm not Angry at this film like I was that one. As the title says gor this review it just wasn't for me.

Must see. It's a Conclusion movie
The follow up to the 2017 versionSo the first part laid out the story. A remake of a TV series from the 90's. This time though it had that North Hollywood magic which it made it one of my all-time favourite movies.
A lot of the same cast. Which was perfect the first time around. This version added seven more adult characters. Bill Hader who plays older Richie was perfect with his one liners and James McAvoy was on queue as Billy..
Once again though Pennywise steals the show with over the top performance.. there's a few concluding scenes throughout the movie that either explained or ended past storylines which I liked
Once again though I found myself laughing at many scenes. As I do not scare easily, lol. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. But I guess I was expecting a little bit more.

You just don't see this a lot anymore, people are cramped nowadays with Wowing of effects CGI, whatnot, and don't really care of about being human, and this sequel really brings down the emotions to us.

It seems to me like small things that worked fantastically in chapter 1 got milked dry in chapter 2. For example, random swears & jokes coming from Eddie & Richie, these were absolutely fantastic in chapter 1 and, although many are still funny in 2, they pale in comparison to 1. Also, the use of what I'll call 'surprise big tall grey monster running at you' that was so fantastic with the evil painting woman in chapter 1 seems like it's the only use for jump scares in chapter 2, everything is a big tall grey thing that runs at the characters with exaggerated foley on footfall that stops being scary the second time it's used, and it's used a lot.
The chemistry between the adult losers is far from bad, but with constant flashbacks showing the same characters with the younger cast the chemistry feels so clunky and forced in comparison. I found myself really not caring about any of the characters or what happened to them despite loving the kids in chapter 1.
Overuse of CGI for the monsters let's the film down also (SPOILERS) that Bev with her head on fire what on earth was that????? (END OF SPOILERS).

The Grown Up versions of the teen characters from IT reunite to battle him again. They are expertly cast and the best that we've seen of a set of child to adult Actors next to THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT.We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of screen time that the teens got. It may even be up to a third of what the adults get. They look exactly like the same age as they were from the original, even after 2 years of maturation. That's because they were digitally de-aged and you cannot tell at all.This is one of the better Sequels in a while that lives up to its predecessor. The story is a bit more complex and the adults all do a marvelous job of echoing their younger selves. We get to see more of what Pennywise can do as he pulls off more creepy illusions. The best part of these Movies is the dazzling visuals that the Director conveys. There's plenty of symbolism and this time around, we were very impressed with the sheer amount of incredible transitions. He uses these as effortless ways to show past events or put us in the shoes of the characters.One of the cons here is its near 3 hour run time. Most of the scares and plot points work, but there definitely could have been some edits to bring it closer to the original remake at 2 hours 15 minutes. Scenes in the 1st and 3rd Act drag some and that does damper down some of the enjoyment.This is still one of the best Horror Movies of 2019, in a year with many many disappointment genre pieces. And seeing what the Filmmakers have done with the characters that have grown in 27 years is worth watching alone.

1797,charikoopa,Felt so at home seeing this!!,10,16 September 2019,"When I was around 12/13 years old, I would constantly rewatch the original 'IT' movie. Am I gonna overshare? You bet. I grew up on a street where there was no other kids to play with and had quite a lot of family drama going on. I was never very well liked (don't ask why, although it was probably because I was the weird kid) so when I started watching horrors, naturally I was drawn towards the Losers' Club. They were like the friends I never had, so it's safe to say these characters hold a special place in my heart. Fast forward to 'IT: Chapter 1' and I was pleasantly surprised! Like most, I usually despise remakes ('The Omen' made me incredibly angry but let's not go there), but after being left impressed I was excited for Chapter 2.True, the CGI was a bit much at times, but it was compensated for with the amazing acting and script. Both the adults and kids played the characters incredibly well and I was laughing through the film (Richie was usually the culprit). I did have to hold the tears in at least five times and, by the end, I was unable to. I sobbed. I was a mess.I'm in no way opposed to that, though, because I love a film that makes me feel emotions-- I think that because the characters are so special to me, I was 10x more prone to bawling for them.The thing about this movie is that it really feels like they didn't try to top the original. Didn't try to make it better. Not in a 'we don't give a damn how it turns out, we just want $$$' kind of way, more of a 'let's try a different take' kind of way. If that even makes sense. The same goes for Bill Skarsgaard-- it definitely doesn't feel like he was trying to be a better Pennywise than Tim Curry, which is wonderful. He plays Pennywise brilliantly, obviously an incredibly talented actor (along with the rest of the cast) and the clown's personality shines through. He made me giggle quite a lot and I was glad to see more of him in Chapter 2.

This movie was absolutely dreadful. Bad acting, extremely far fetched, baseless story, 3 hours of utter nonsense. I know you really can't make comparisons to the original tv IT movie but there's no comparison on how good it was to this. The beginning jumps right in and if you haven't seen the first IT recently you may forget the characters a bit. It seems like they tried to shove in all of Mike's phone calls to the other 6 in a way too short period of time. In the original when Mike called them they all had flashbacks and you really saw what they were up to and how they remembered Derry. The way this movie did it felt rushed and half hazard. The whole thing with Mike's ridiculous ritual was really way out there and so unbelievable. Here Bill I just made you trip on this drug root I put in your drink to see how the ritual will be performed. Did they really have to add a hate crime to the beginning of this movie because I certainly don't remember that in the book? Also the part with the little girl under the bleachers made no sense either. If IT feeds off of fear and is powerless without fear how did he eat a little girl that was standing there smiling and happy to come closer if she seemingly had no fear of him? Plus all of the ridiculous far fetched characters like the old lady at bev's old apartment. Her fear was her father not some monster like old lady. The original when she goes back to the apartment was perfect with her drinking the blood in the tea and such. The part with Richie in the park and the paul bunyan like character chasing him in the park was so ridiculous. The fears just didn't match up properly. The end blew as well. I don't know I can go on and on but this but it was just poorly executed. Ben's character had no heart, the guy playing mike was dreadful, the guy playing Bowers was awful and that whole thing was also very poorly executed.

I loved the first movie a lot and was so exited to see this, but half way through we were close to walking out; and a few moments later another group did. I'm sure all those giving it high scores must be huge Stephen King fans that can't ever admit to disliking one of his adaptions.What I hated the most was how loud and obnoxious some of the adult characters were. I get that they are trying to bring out the characters their young actors portrayed in the first movie but in the real world children grow up and mature. Children acting like children can be endearing, adults acting like loud annoying children is, well, annoying. The characters did become more tolerable in the second half of the movie as their personalities begun to mellow a little.Watching the second half was more like a seeing rehash of the first movie. I felt like I was sitting through it all again when watching the house and some of the cave scenes. I'm not sure how the book went, so perhaps they were trying to keep it true to the book, but I felt like they needed to change the setting for the second half of the movie so it didn't feel like a repeat.There was lots of other things that bugged me about this movie, don't get me started on how a guy can be stabbed deep with a blade to the cheek and moments later be patched up and talking like nothing has happened. Not to mention how he survives so long having been impaled by a giant claw and is still able to crack a joke. The flash back scenes with the kids were probably the only shining moments of the film, but even some of those fell a little flat for me. It's rare I score a movie under 5 or 6, unless I really disliked it. Sadly this is one of those movies.I would like to note, there were definitely some very confronting scenes in the movie where they didn't hold back. The bashing of the gay men at the beginning was extremely brutal, I mean you can hear the bones in his face smash as he gets repeatedly punched and kicked. The domestic violence scene where a women gets punched by her partner was also confronting, though makeup did extremely well with hiding any bruising to her face *roll eyes* There is also a scene that strongly suggested that child molestation was about to take place. All the above scenes is enough reason to not let young children or even young teenage kids see this movie. However that didn't stop some parents from taking their 12-15 year olds to see it at my local cinema.",It Chapter Two

The book is 1138 pages and trying to narrow that down is such an incredibly difficult task. Andy and Barbara Muschietti did what they had to do to fit hundreds of pages down to the three hour cut that we saw.Of course no movie is completely perfect, however the roots of the story were presented in a way that did the main cast a proper amount of justice along with the clown.There were a few missteps in the film, but one needs to sit back and realize the magnitude of closing the door on one of the most intricate stories ever written. Filmmaking is not easy task. All of my respect goes to the filmmakers. Sit back. Relax. Enjoy the film that the Muschiettis have made for you.",It Chapter Two

1810,carakinnick,Perfect Casting and Kudos to Bill Hader & Finn Wolfhard!,10,16 September 2019,"Simply put, IT Chapter Two was beautiful and I loved it. I laughed. I jumped. I screamed. I cried. (Six times to be exact, but who's counting? I mean how can you not cry during a movie when little kids are dying?)The film was so well cast. I can see every single one of the kid losers in the adult losers, whether it's a certain feature or mannerism, what have you, and I can tell that the adult actors took great care to watch the first film and study their younger counterparts in order to make the performances as successful as possible.Bill Hader's performance as Richie was brilliant, hilarious, and moving, and he stole the whole movie. (I felt the same way about Finn Wolfhard in the first film.) James Ransone's Eddie was spot on; his timing was impeccable and I loved how often he incorporated lines that kid Eddie used in the first film. (I wonder how much of that was scripted or improv.) James McAvoy's performance as Bill was also very moving, as was Andy Bean's very short lived performance as Stan. EVERYONE WAS FANTASTIC, but those guys were definitely my personal favorites.As a huge Finn Wolfhard (Young Richie) fan and supporter, I was very proud of his performance. It was nice to see Richie dealing with an intricate emotional issue while still being right in the middle of the action and also maintaining his fun banter with Eddie. (This was true of both young and adult Richie.) I was also really impressed with Wyatt Oleff (Young Stanley) and Jaeden Martell's (Young Bill) performances. They were involved in two scenes that definitely gave me some good jumps and screams, especially Wyatt. If you haven't seen it yet, you'll know when you do. He was BRILLIANT!Andy Muschietti was as true to the book as he could possibly be, while also writing in some creative liberties. Some of the liberties incorporated aspects from the book that couldn't be told in full detail, and some were completely created by him. Richie's story-line was hard for me to accept just due to the simple fact that it was not in either the book or the original miniseries from 1990, and I really didn't get that vibe from the 2017 film either. However, I felt it was very beautifully portrayed, and I'm not ignorant enough not to realize that this is ANDY's movie, BASED on Stephen King's novel.People are always quick to say, ""I liked the movie, but the book was better."" Films based on movies are just that; based on them. They are never the same. And I am a person who loves the movie if I loved the book. Always! IT Chapter Two was no different. I loved it from start to finish. Well done to everyone involved!",It Chapter Two

1813,gramsden-21958,What do you know?,9,20 September 2019,"This film will divide viewer's opinion based on one simple factor. Have you read the book or not? if, like me, you have read the book there is so much in this film that will delight and satisfy those who know the story well. The film cleverly uses many small and subtle scenes and visual/verbal hints at things that are in the book that don't appear in the 'other' version, but nevertheless tell the informed viewer that they know what they are doing. If you haven't read the book then you will miss more than you will see. it seems clear that those who decry this film as being too long don't get the fact that it is long but indeed not long enough to tell the full story. if your patience is run thin with this film for goodness sake don't read the book you simply don't have the cognitive stamina for a good and thorough story well told. I agree with a previous comment this is perhaps about 40% of the book. please do us all a favour read the book before you comment on what is wrong with the film. I agree that CGI can sometimes let the film down but given the tools available there are few choices to be made to recreate the sheer imaginative horror of Stephen King. if you think that CGI is poor just think back to that frigid spider of the 1991 series.

1816,thegamerzoneofficial,"Entertaining, Not What It Should Be",6,6 September 2019,"First of all, this review is written by a 16 year old who went to this movie with friends for some scares and laughs. Now I did see chapter one and I've read the books, although I knew that this wouldn't be anything close to it. I don't have a problem with the movie differing from the book honestly...
I have never laughed as much as when I saw this movie. I went to the cinema on the day that it was released with some friends. Now the start is quite interesting and immediately sets the mood for the rest of the movie. It starts off with a cruel kill which was good.
The story itself was alright in my opinion. I've seen plenty of people who were convinced that the movie was way too long, it didn't bother me during the movie though. It did at the end of the movie.
The CGI was hilarious in this movie because it was terrible. The character Pennywise is always entertaining to see, also because of the amazing performances of Skargaard. He once again was amazing. However, when one of the losers would get into a 'chase/fight', the cgi looks ridiculous. It's unrealistic, ugly and most of all: funny.
That's where the movie goes wrong. It sets an atmosphere for a grim story but it instead takes a turn into comedy lane. The intended jokes were quite good in my opinion and really funny, but when a cgi creature would come on screen the entirety of the cinema would laugh. The cgi ruined the atmosphere of the movie.
The last thing I'd like to say is that I'm everything but satisfied with the ending. It was terrible in my opinion. That's all I can say without spoiling.Overall I think the movie was a bit too 'Hollywood-ish' , but very funny and entertaining. Jump scares were great in my opinion, the casting was a 10/10, the story just was a bit too Hollywood and not nearly as good as the original.
It wasn't worth 3 hours of my time in the end, But the incredible performance of the actors made it okay.",It Chapter Two

1822,goshevan,IT all wrapped up.,9,9 September 2019,"Before talking about IT Chapter 2. I must say that IT the prequel left me wondering about a lot of things. IT Chapter 2 puts a lot of those thoughts into place. If you haven't read the book like me then you may have felt the same.First off, I did not like the homophobic tones of the movie. However the book was written many years ago and I think it does create a necessary conversation.The transitions in this movie are so well thought out. From the beginning transition I got chills and could tell I was in for a ride.
The characters stay true to themselves through out both movies and it really helps to create different emotions beyond fear. Story wise it felt a lot less cluttered and forced than the first movie. Which helped to solidify the story in my mind and tie off any loose ends.
Overall the aesthetic of the movie is fantastic and creepy at the same time. Some of the CGI was average at best which became an immersion breaker sometimes but it didn't kill the whole movie. IT Chapter 2 was a solid movie and I loved almost every second of it. It left me feeling satisfied with a lot to talk about with friends.",It Chapter Two
1823,pazzagaming,IT: the inevitable sequel,7,16 September 2019,"Following the first blockbuster movie, it seems a sequel was inevitable - which eventually did materialize to ""IT Chapter Two"".It's a very reminiscent movie, quite poignant in many places - I was impressed by the cast, their scripting, and the range of personalities on offer. But this movie is but an echo of the first chapter, and like many sequels to cult classics, relies on retrospective references to please the fans - nonetheless, this was enjoyable.That being said, a lot of the movie had a repetitive tone as each character explored their fears, one by one. This all dragged out longer than was necessary, as did the entire production. It might bore you if you like a more concise plotline.This was mixed in with some backstory for each character, a generous dashing of nostalgia, creative flashbacks to Derry's past, and so forth - this kept the visuals and scenery constantly changing.The child-eating Pennywise had, of course, returned - but without any really good reason for this happening - apart from some interesting lore that emerges explaining the origins of the clown. Sadly most of the scares were jump scares and usually predictable - although not always. Some encounters were framed very creatively in interesting locations.Georgie was still gone, and at no point was able to be saved. There was a great cameo appearance by a recognizable face, though.If you liked the first and grew attached to the original characters, you'll like this - but it doesn't offer too much new. Despite that, it has enough saving graces to be worth a watch. I'd call it a nice mix of humour and horror.7/10",It Chapter Two

This movie has done what horror movies lack and that's great storytelling with aspects of horror! I really cared about these characters and I loved watching this movie, sitting there thinking ""yep that's exactly how that character would of been grown up!""Yes I agree some parts dragged on with talking and not exactly talking about story plots, as well as not much hardcore adult scenes, but you follow these characters remembering the past and seeing more of Pennywise salting his dinner waiting for that right moment to devour it!Over all if you take this movie out of the theatre, watch it part 1 and 2 in a marathon I can definitely say people would love it so much more than they are now!

Don't get me wrong the rest of the cast carries their performances very well also.The length of the movie, to me, would only be a problem if you're not here for the story, if you want to know Pennywise's origins, and have a deeper dive into the mental state of each character than this movie is for you. If you just wanted to be scared and have a story that moves it might be a little slow at times but you may still enjoy it.The gore is well done, I don't have a problem with the CGI scenes they were done really well, looking even better than the first film. There are many scenes that filled me with dread or anxiety, very little ""fear"" but I can't remember the last time a movie scared me.

Feel like they're really bestfriends even though adult Losers looked like don't have strong bond as when they're kids. It's much better then the what 1990 miniseries actors show back then.

The cast is excellent and the acting is good. The humor for me lands most of the time and there are some decent scares mostly from two scenes the one with the little girl and the first scene. But the IT movies are not just about cheap jumpscares and its actually about growing up and losing your memories. Some things i find a bit meh like Ritchie's secret i feel that might anger some people. Some things i didnt like are the pacing it just doesn't flow as well as the first one and sometimes the humor does detract from the scares or an emotional moment.

1845,dylandoza,Disappointing follow up,5,4 September 2019,"It Chapter Two was a disappointing follow up that left me frustrated and honestly a little tired. The film opens strong with a first act that'll make you feel like you never left Derry at all. Which is a credit to Andrés Muschietti and his great camera work. Unfortunately after the first act the film just slips through the cracks deciding to emphasize comedy and characters instead of focusing on what in my opinion was the most intriguing part of the follow up, Pennywise's revenge. A lot of time is given to the losers club in an attempt to make you feel every bit of their journey. The problem with this is that you lose some run time that could've gone to horror sequences and more shocking moments.
Chapter one was so great because they blended everything perfectly. The scares were spot on and it was funny when it had to be. Don't go into chapter 2 expecting a horror movie, they couldn't go more than 10 minutes without making a joke and as previously mentioned so much time was given to the main cast that Pennywise is hardly in this movie at all. In the end you have a movie that was advertised incorrectly, you go in expecting the emotion and frights of the first movie and instead you get drama and constant gags.",It Chapter Two

Some of which I totally understand, and some of it is just people who think they're looking down on everyone from their high horse.I want to start off with what (in my opinion) was the high point of the film... The casting.. Every single adult who played the part portraying the child characters honestly did a flawless job.It did a good job at building tension AT TIMES. It did rely heavily on jumpscares that were sometimes predictable.I'm seeing a lot of negativity about overdone CGI as well. I don't agree with those negative reviews, because it was really no more CGI than what was used in the original reboot.Now... The ending. This where the spoilers start, so if you haven't seen it, don't read past here. I didn't think the ending was very well thought out. IT was literally defeated by name calling. They could have just done that when they were kids, right? It kind of rendered the whole story being told for almost 3 hours completely pointless.

Then, with just that phone call from Mike to return to Derry- she fought her way out. Each character had an introduction but they were a little too abbreviated. Maybe when the director's cut comes out. At two hours and forty five minutes, I understand why that would be a lot.. but the character development is important. Steven King's cameo was fantastic as usual. My friend jumped out of his seat several times and scared everyone even worse, for Pennywise is twice as frightening this time around at least.

1853,charlesjf-43608,Formulaic Horror sequel saved by its comedy,5,21 March 2020,"As a fan of the source material, the 1990 miniseries, and the 2017 film - ""It Chapter Two"" manages to deliver unexpectedly well considering its plot was based on the unanimously agreed 'weaker section' of King's novel.Whilst CGI remains at the forefront, with it being used so frequently that it can prove distracting in many instances (along with some intense strobe lighting near the finale prompting my theatre to post an epilepsy warning on the door) - it's sort of what you're buying into when choosing to watch a film like this. You're never going to be particularly intellectually stimulated - but it provides a much higher level of enjoyment than many other recent horror films (although perhaps overstaying its welcome at almost 3 hours in runtime).Interestingly, many of the ""scares"" in the film are almost instantaneously followed by humourous moments - which occasionally presents the scenarios as being quite jarring, the payoffs tending to be much more satisfying than the CGI-ridden creations that come before. This in my view saves the film from a trap it could have, and very infrequently does, fall into - taking itself too seriously.Whilst by no means being a masterpiece, nor even the best ""clown"" film of 2019 - ""It Chapter Two"" is well worth a watch for fans of the novel and the first film; I doubt they'll be too disappointed.",It Chapter Two

IT series was never a horror series.But in the chapter 2 they destroyed the universe, they put all the character development into garbage and the last fight was so terrible that even 8 years old can write better.I never liked Stephan King movies in the past and as expected from him now I am never going to watch any of his movies in future.They used to call Bev 'a slut', in this movie he makes her slut. I think in the duration of 3 days she was with 3 guys. There was no role for Bill (why you still alive). If you are a fan of James McAvoy, you will regret it as he was all roaming in entire movie and do nothing.I think they have some extra scenes remain after chapter 1 so they thought why not make a new movie and we have ""It Chapter 2"".",It Chapter Two

A lot of people seem to complain about the level of humor, but I didn't find it to be all that different than the other adaptations of this story. I personally found the original 1990 mini-series rather laughable, simply because I couldn't get over how cheesey it seemed. It's true that it's not quite as scary as the prequel, but that does not automatically mean that it sucks. And I really liked the way this version improved upon a lot of things from the mini-series (especially the ending)! If you're a movie snob, don't bother watching this series because it's simply meant to be entertaining and enjoyable; there's no deeper meaning or polarizing conclusion.

Very long for no reason and way way way 2 much CGI.
Less was definitely more in the first chapter and although some of the scares were good the CGI made it somewhat comical and a let down.

Movie with aspects that fall short. It: chapter two is the second half of its succesful predecessor and story.
Based on Stephen kings best selling novel, it does not stay true to its roots of horror. This movie relies heavily on jumpscares and never truly makes us feel afraid and anxious as the first one did. It was a fun experience and a enjoyable movie, but a disappointing let down since it is a step back from the first movie. The atmosphere is off and not fearful, and the movie feels as if it was made for pre-schoolers, and maybe then, it would not enduce as much fear as the first one. The absolute most disappointing part is the build up to the return of pennywise the clown. It's anti-climactic feeling of powerlessness that pennywise carries is saddening. It: chapter one portrays pennywise as the devil, the monster, the all powerful clown, and it: chapter two portrays him as a lacklustre man in clown make-up trying to get revenge on the losers' club, even though he show's his cosmic power.",It Chapter Two

1864,NourMartinez,The film that grabs defeat from the jaws of victory,7,21 October 2019,"This should have been an amazing movie...
It had a great cast with genuinely interesting characters, and although it was cheesy at parts, to me that's expected from IT.But somehow this film messed up big time.
The film derails from it's plot so often and it's so unnecessary, more than an hour is just completely reliant on flashbacks, which is supposed to get a nostalgic reaction from us, but I mean this isn't a film released in the 80's with a huge cult following, meaning that nobody got nostalgia from it because we literally saw those kids 2 years ago in the film.
And you know what, i'm not even gonna go into the CGI for the kids, just know, yes it's distracting, and no it doesn't get better.
And every single friggin' flashback was so formulaicadult goes to a place and remembers a certain event that took place there as a kid, this event seems harmless to begin with but then he encounters Pennywise, it then flashes back to his present self and encounters Pennywise again.
Now i'd be fine with this but this happens with every single main character apart from Mike and each of these sequences are like 15 minutes long and they're all exactly the sameThe story doesn't progress further than:
It's back
go to Derry
Freak out and have a 15 minute dilemma on whether they should just leave
Decide to stay and retrieve tokens
Go kill ITIt's literally just that and it's ridiculous. I mean if they had just focused on the characters as adults they would have gotten more done, it would've been a better movie but for some reason making the kids CGI and showing 15 minute formulaic flashbacks that don't do anything for the film that a 2 minute conversation couldn't accomplish is just really damaging for this movie considering that the scenes with the adults were amazing and there was a real connection and comradery between them, which is why it's so disappointing that this film is just made up of flashbacks and very little elements of the adults despite the adults being the stand out part of the whole bloody movie.it had the recipe for greatness, but instead of going through with the sequel we wanted, they were reliant on flashbacks. That sucks.
(Also, i'm not going to spoil anything, but for those who have seen it, I felt that the ending for It chapter 2 would've been more fitting for It chapter 1 and vice versa, it seems like they messed up last second on their storyboards and got their endings muddled up)",It Chapter Two

1867,bbaki-15022,Worth the time and the money!,9,13 September 2019,"I was really looking forward to this one, especially after the fantastic 1st part, which totally nailed the story on so many levels - the faithfulness of the story, the scares and the actors.
And then the first reviews came out for this one, I got scared: almost everywhere it was only called as average at best. Still, today I went to see it, and l was happy to do so.
I think, many people just view this story as a simple horror story. However, in my opinion, that's a big misunderstanding as the story of IT - as a whole - is not a horror. Not at all. It is a drama with horror elements. The book itself is one of the most important one of my library. Though, only having read the book twice in my life, it played both time a crucial part of that period; the first time as 18-19 years old - before heading to College and the 2nd one being around 26-27 years old. Because what this story is about? We all remember how we told each other in primary/secondary schools, that with those friends how we would stay always in contact, how our friendship would stand the test of time. Then you move on, and realize that how quickly you forgot those friends. As 18-19 year old, having read this part of the book and seeing how such strong connect can break up easily, it upset me, made me question a lot of things. As 26-27-year-old, I understood better, I saw other parts of the story relevant. Started to understand that its the part of the normal life, that people - who you call friends, and cannot imagine your everyday's life without them - just vanish, but still can be brought back when needed or called upon - you don't need serial killers to do that, it's completely fine, when other reasons lie behind them.
I agree with those, who say this film should be seen as a whole (part 1 + 2) and not a typical ""longer, better, scarier"" type of movie. For me this was a really, really good movie, where I have seen some brilliant acting, and seeing people learning to face their fears of their childhood - which they thought they burried, but was always a part of their life.
As negatives, I do agree, that the movie tends to drag at times, and some parts I found unneccesary or - due to the lack of time (when the film was also long enough) didn't get enough explaining, therefore their appearances being meaningless. Here I talk about Henry Bowers and the Silver; both got their screen time, but would have nothing happened had they had been cut from the movie. They just arrived and the movie quickly wraped up their part.
Some reviews critised the humour of the film. I didn't find it distracting, as I have seen the movie more as a drama than a horror, I didn't feel that out-of-place. I mean, okay, they weren't highly sophisticated jokes, but, easily could have been much worse.All in all, I really do not regret seeing this movie.",It Chapter Two

1876,Oz-Sultan-Schmooz,A panoramic psycho funhouse fantasy horror,8,12 September 2019,"A sleepy backwater town in New England is once more about to be violently disrupted and manically stalked by the sinister and psychotic Pennywise, the dancing clown. The film picks up twenty-seven years later. A series of events rouse the fears and calls to action the one friend who chose to remain, waiting for the inevitable return of IT.Six phone calls later, and we are given a glimpse into the lives of the six friends that turned their backs and moved away from the town with its dark history.It's a slick and quick profile of the friends who are reminded of a promise, a promise to return to that town of childhood memories, memories that have been buried deep in the psyche. They are once again reunited, all except for one.The casting is excellent and reflects the young actors so accurately from the first installment, including another mesmerizing performance from Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise.The dynamic is quickly restored and so too the memories begin to awaken and with that, the audience is drawn into the first fantasy horror sequence that will be used in more intense scenes later.Overall, the film works and reflects an authentic attempt to give cinematic life to an ambitious novel from a (if not 'the') master of the horror genre, who treats his fans to a brief cameo role.This is much more than a clown and demonic desire to kill and feed on the flesh, firstly the clown is just one manifestation as will become apparent throughout the film. The essence of this story is overcoming the deepest, darkest fears we experience as children and then to return as adults, six, forty-year-old childhood friends to once again face those fears, those disturbing memories and the dysfunctional parental/family issues that haunted them and have tried to suppress over all those years.Pennywise, represents the imposing fear, larger than life, in a way we amplify our problems and fears to appear more sinister than what they really are.
The film unfurls with charming moments of nostalgia that resonates in all of us, particularly if you are of a similar age to the friends reunited. I would go as far as saying that is the beauty within this slick horror flick.Inevitably, the film culminates in the grand confrontation and a panoramic psycho funhouse portrayal leads the six friends to challenge the various manifestations of Pennywise. There was an element of looping ideas from the first installment, which felt a little lazy, maybe a deliberate attempt connecting the two films, whilst all the gory, twisted, CGI horror scenes flash across the screen.The ending to this orgy of horror in some ways imitates the 'lead' character Bill Denbrough, a local and internationally renowned author who is further renowned for the bad endings of his books and maybe that is an ironic inside joke between the director, the screenwriter and original author. But I felt the ending did not satisfy my compulsion and invested intrigue over the two installments. That being said it is a richly entertaining and fascinating portrayal that does justice to the majestic novel published in the mid-eighties.",It Chapter Two

That being said, this was a mostly jump scare movie, it almost felt like on of the sarcastic Scary Movies, I was expecting more tense moments. I think the comic con interviews and others, only made this movie worse
I love a good scare, something that keeps me up at night thinking about it, but all I could think was about Bill Hader and James Ransone being absolutely hilarious. Bill Hader is except when it comes to playing any roll, this movie allowed him free range to be himself.
An other thing I just hated was the ""de-aging"" Finn's massive buggy eyes from it, the blurry faces, the boys looked more out of place next to untouched Beverly. On the lines of effects, I was surprised by the almost Witcher like creature thru decided to go with.
Maybe I'm just totally desensitized, but this movie felt more like a comedy and a romance than it should have. I found myself laughing through most of it, not shielding my eyes, except for the scene with Bev and her husband. Or maybe it's just simply Adults don't give off the same fear reaction that kids do? The movie was great st making you feel like you're apart of the loser group, would you be afraid? Or would you snap out of it and fight?

It chapter 2 was a good movie but to me didn't need to be as long. I have no issues with long movies as long as it doesn't just stretch the runtime to stretch it. The length needs to add detail, meaning, entertainment and feeling. I feel like they stretched the movie during certain parts that they didn't need. The mid way point of the movie where they all went separate to get the artifacts seemed totally unnecessary. This movie also wasn't even close to as scary as the first one and only made me jump a few times. The jumps scares weren't pulled off well because the tension building up to it wasn't pulled off very well. Another thing was that it just wasn't as creepy or had as much gore as the first one. Bill hader made the movie for me. He was hilarious in every scene and that was what he was supposed to do. He made the movie a lot better for me. I think there were some great parts in this movie, but it never felt fully complete. I was so excited for this movie, and I enjoyed it, but I walked out of the theater not as satisfied as I wanted to.

I understand that a book and a movie are different ways to tell stories and to perceive them. But this movie just added things over and over again, which made the plot poor and unplanned. We couldn't see any real character development and that made me do not understand their decisions.

IT 2 did Not Fail. The Action started right away. The cast was perfect and the plot sublime. I was into every minute of this Iconic 3hrs horror fest. The SFX and CGIs were excellent as well as the town of Derry, where SK does all his movies...his horror screen. From the Losers Club, I found myself as one of them and how Pennywise zeroed in on each one. The story was somewhat different from the original novel. However those slight changes made the adaptations of the mini-series with Tim Curry to Bill Skarsgard was fantastic. Tonight, I will be a guest on a podcast discussing IT and IT 2 with some comparisons of the 1990 version. I can't wait to have an intriguing conversation about These movies.

1929,callanstuart96,A sequel that doesn't quite float like the first,4,14 September 2019,"IT chapter two fails to deliver on the quality of chapter one by disregarding the story Stephen King wrote in favor of blockbuster action.This sequel doesn't quite float like the first, and the problem really lies with the artistic direction of the film. Having read the book I can safely say this isn't really an adaptation, more of a jumbled blockbuster that doesn't know if it's a horror or a comedy, where chapter one captured the essence and atmosphere of the book, chapter two completely fails at this aspect. There is no atmosphere, no suspense, cheap jump scares that never offer more than a light ""ooh"" from the audience and the awful cgi that plagued the first film. Pennywise is relegated to a side character, and not a very scary one. Bill Skarsgard does the best he can with the role, but pennywise lacks any of his wit and personality so well written by King, here he's no more than a cliche horror movie villain, and serves no more purpose than that of any other average horror movie villain, the writers failed to capture one of the most terrifying horror novel antagonists of all time.The casting is stellar, with Bill Hader standing out as the comic relief character of Richie Tozier, and his character from the novel is well translated, James Mcevoy and Jessica Chastain also do solid jobs with there characters, however I feel like they're doing just that, playing characters. They don't feel lived in, they don't feel like these were the kids we seen from the first movie. Unlike the book no backstory is given to these characters, what they were doing for the last 27 years. What is there motivation to return to Derry? In the book the characters mull this decision, here they return to Derry without batting an eye. And again why hasn't pennywise returned? This is never explained to the novel ignorant audience. It feels as if neither the losers or pennywises' motivations have any real depth, leaving the audience not caring about what happens to these characters.In the end the movie really went down the sewer along with pennywise as it failed to capture the essence of the novel, it's an uneven, tonally inconsistent sequel that's not very scary or a very faithful adaptation. Read the novel instead, where you'll be scared and moved by the losers battle with pennywise. Beep beep Andy, you failed to make this one float.",It Chapter Two

And I can get along with everything else.The crew's psychological fears their facing with the it and all.Movie was going just fine until the last hour.
As soon as you see the main monster continuously it's just not scary anymore.Plus isn't it an ancient monster ? Why was his ""true form"" a clown spider ? And the way they defeated him was so cartoony too.I could see such defeat in a friendship cartoon.

1938,lotashite,Honest opinion,4,8 September 2019,"I went to see the new sequel yesterday and I have rated, from my opinion it was very disappointing, the film includes everything from from the trailer but the main part that disappoints me was there was less PENNYWISE now I'm pretty sure it's called It for a reason(describing) pennywise. And for being a 14 yr old filmaholic I have been excited about seeing this film since they announced they started filming, I haven't read the book but I Thought I knew what I was going to expect. till Yesterday. I did think it was a good idea putting the Adrian Mellon scene in there.Spoiler part
Pennywise is the main character now I watched a video before it came out just to see if I'd been warned by reviews and it was talking about the mrs kersh scene and it said whilst she ran towards Beverley she would slowly turn into pennywise. but yesterday when I was watching the scene, because it was a big screen and it was pennywise, the usual. I closed my eyes till I heard pennywise's voice but then and I opened them to see different sort of creatures. when I saw this throughout the film it did unexpectedly Disappoint Me. Could Andy Muschietti not of replaced all the other creature bits with pennywise.Overall because of this disappointment i would have to say Henry Bowers was the villain of the film.",It Chapter Two
1939,repulsivefox,Disappointing,5,5 September 2019,"I was very excited to see this film, have been since 2017, when I saw the first one. Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.I love the way the first IT didn't want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie.",It Chapter Two

1942,mike-snare,A very mixed bag,5,6 September 2019,"Oh, was I looking forward to that second part!
Now that I've seen it - it just fell short for me.
Here are my main issues:# PACING/NARRATIVE CHOICES
Yes, ""IT"" surely isn't a thin book - so in his screen adapdation, Muschietti was challenged to decide upon which scenes to show/exclude. But even with a running time of almost 3h, there are sections of the movie that feel rushed, while others drag along painfully.
The first part of the movie dealing with the Losers Club getting back to Derry is told in a lackluster, schematic way - the same narrative issue when everyone has to find
their artifact. This doesn't feel lively but constructed and predictable.
Having visited their old den in the woods, the movie ramps up its speed, feeling increasingly overpaced and underdeveloped....
Maybe that's only me, but I hate it when movies forget about basic human needs like sleeping, eating or the occassional visit to the bathroom.
Sadly, ""IT Chapter Two"" is one of them.# Visual choices & CGI:
The depiction of Pennywise in Chapter 2 was partly a disappointment. Why sacrifce the scaryiness of his shadowy clown by dragging him into broad daylight?
Moreover, ""IT Chapter Two"" relies too heavily on CGI - there's just too much of it - and unfortunately, it's the sort of CGI that strives to show us everything in bold detail. It's feels like visual fast food, leaving nothing to the viewer's imagination. However, this is why we loved the book - once it was all in our minds.Despite good acting and some creepy scenes, I wasn't sold on ""IT Chapter Two""....",It Chapter Two
1943,anumshoaib,Worstt,1,6 September 2019,"This is totally crap movie,donot waste your money,the original movie was good,this chapter 2 is very bad",It Chapter Two
1944,littleb-40961,"A bland, boring assault on an iconic story.",1,9 September 2019,"It: Chapter Two is bad.As a fan of the book and first film, there were a few scenes I enjoyed and though there are one or two performances that hit right, they dropped the ball hard with this one.Starting with where the bad of this film begins, the writing is awful. It tried and failed to capture the parts of the book and Chapter One that intrigued so many people.Then, there's the acting. I expected so much more from such huge names, who I'm an active fan of because of their talent, and I think the biggest disappointment for me was Jessica Chastain's Beverly. Being the powerhouse of an actress she is, I expected her usual quality of performance but something was lacking. It could have to do with the writing, but I can't pinpoint it. Bill Hader and James Ransone have satisfactory performances. Isaiah didn't feel like Mike, though he is a good actor. Jay Ryan was alright, I guess? And while his performance as Bill was good, James McAvoy's American accent took me out of the story a lot and he, like everyone else, didn't feel like his character to me.To flip to a positive take though, the two actors I do think had the best performances are Andy Bean and Jaeden Martell. Andy Bean was the only adult Loser who felt like their character and delivered in his portrayal (though James Ransone also came super close) of his younger counterpart despite only being in a few minutes of the movie. He perfectly captured Stan better than any of the other adults did with their characters. And, then, Jaeden Martell gave such a quality performance as young Bill with only so little time, even stealing the screen from James McAvoy for a few moments. You can tell they both understand their characters deeply and it shines through in the end, with their performances being so natural that they seamlessly slip into the roles of their characters without fault.It was not a scary film, which is where it fails as a horror movie, and the only scary part was the hate crime that opened the film. (Or if you're like me, you'd agree that the changing of Eddie's last words was a horribly scary part). Every death was a for shock factor and it was a useless gore-fest that drones on. The wacky editing, shock-value deaths, and strange writing direction feels nothing like the tone of Chapter One. As a duo, this sequel fails to match the quality and tone of the first film. It lost its heart and scare-factor in the attempt to make a ""bigger and better"" blockbuster film.Another aspect that particularly bothers me is the glorification of obsessive behavior on Ben's part toward his love interest Beverly. In Chapter One, one of the only parts I disliked was the blatant romanticization of him kissing her while she was unconscious and the objectification of Beverly in the love triangle. A man obsesses over a woman he barely remembers/knows for 27 years, whom he once kissed while unconscious, and we're supposed to be happy that he ""gets the girl"". We're supposed to be okay with the fact that his entire character arc depends on her loving him so he can cure himself of his insecurity, which boils down to bad and misogynistic writing. Woman are not a tool for you to use to feel better about yourself and they're certainly not there for you to push yourself upon when they aren't able to consent. Do better, write a story about a plus size man being worthy of love and overcoming his own issues without it being at the expense of a girl/woman's autonomy. Stop romanticizing men who take advantage of women, especially when the one in question is already a victim of sexual abuse, as he so clearly did in Chapter One.When it comes down to it, it's a rushed attempt to recreate the magic they had in the book and while making It: Chapter One and it did not deliver. Just reinforcing how wonderful the book and first film are, Chapter Two is not scary, lacks the charm and charisma of the first film, and lacked good writing at its core. Rushed, low quality, and corny can all be used to describe this, as sad as it is to say. With only a few good performances and scenes, It: Chapter Two gets 1/10 for me.I'm incredibly disappointed in the movie that was put out and down to the core, it starts with how badly it was written and the ripple effects of that couldn't be outrun. A horrible movie, through and through. Forced jokes, bad writing, and overacting killed this film for me.While entertaining at surface value, it lacked everything that made you love the original story and Chapter One. And, more importantly, it didn't feel like It.",It Chapter Two

1948,codyshaffer,Better than the Original!!!,8,7 September 2019,"First and foremost, I had poor expectations when going to see the film just due to the fact that the first one didn't excite my palate. I thought Pennywise was lacking and the kids forced a little too much humor. But all of that said, this movie blew me right out of the water. It was very true to the novel and the adult cast was pristinely chosen to match the children in a way that completely ties the two movies together. As soon as I watched the first scene, I knew this movie would be great.The theme of the underdogs overcoming their sadistic and unforgiving competition is executed very well in a ridiculously satisfying kind of way. Everyone dogs on how it drives away from the horror aspect, but that isn't what the story is about. It's a story of self acceptance and overcoming past trauma with a can't be defeated attitude. It tugs at your heart strings, disgusts you, makes you laugh, and instills a certain sense of hope in a quite unanticipated way and for that I was thoroughly impressed.It's character development could most certainly use some tweaking, but how can you expect a motion picture to entirely nail an eleven hundred page novel's atmosphere? For what the movie did nail, it nailed precisely. So all in all it's a great watch and I would recommend the movie to anyone!!",It Chapter Two

The story differs so much to the original mini series.

Must admit, will definitely rewatch loads of times like I have done with chapter one! Although it was a 2 hour and 50 minute film, personally, it only felt like 1 hour 30 minutes- 2 hours(different with everyone though). Casting was superb! Looked like the kids actually would look like that when they are older(and obviously great actors as well).Ok, so this is where ppl are under rating it, so yes, I do agree that at SOME parts (not all) the CGI was a bit naff and I did think it could have spent a bit more time and money on it, however I also think that the monsters weren't supposed to look completely realistic?! Although it was very funny, I did think that some parts should have been a bit more serious, (this is kind of a spoiler but not really...) but whose trying to be funny after being stabbed in the face?.Overall, definitely worth watching and please ignore bad ratings!

Also, there were so many fan edits wanting Richie and Eddie to get together, so when it was revealed that Richie had feelings for him I just started crying. Also, when Bev and Ben finally kissed, I couldnt help but cry. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for her to realize that the post card was from him. But the saddest part was when they were reading the letter from Stanley. I truly started sobbing because it perfectly explains why they were friends and the good things about being a loser.

1953,valentinpolyakov,"Don't listen to the ""critics"" (or at least most of them)",8,7 September 2019,"A very solid, enjoyable movie. About as scary as the first one but definitely more brutal and violent. Acting was generally superb especially McAvoy, Chastain, Hader and Skarsgard. Cinematography was also very impressive. Definitely wasn't TOO long, although the ending did drag on a little bit at times. A bit too much CGI for my taste as it can detract from the realism of the moment making it less intense (even though the quality of the CGI was pretty high). Not a massive fan of the ending ;) but that's probably more a problem with the novel than with the movie. Would definitely see it in cinemas again (if I wasn't a somewhat broke student).",It Chapter Two

1955,nantoniou-98466,It too was worse than It,1,8 September 2019,"This was a total waste of time. A series of random jump scares with no meaning and fright factor.
Stephen King's opinion is very nicely and sincerely portrayed by the way Bill felt about the modifications and censorship imposed on his work by the producers. Since his orihinal work recieved such bad criticism because of its ending the connection between the writer and Bill is obvious. This work lacked originality. It was something that had turned into a easily digestable pulp.
It Chapter Two along with It were a mere disappointment, with an extreme length, compared to the original movie and a total mess compared to the book.

Why does the death of anyone of this movie not warrant any explanation to anyone else? Going to the cop shop, instead of having a bath at the quarry from Stranger Things would have made more sense.

1957,af0809,A waste of time,1,8 September 2019,"Being a huge fan of the first IT, I'm sad to say that IT Chapter Two is beyond painful. The script was messy and made me cringe countless times. An extensive amount of special effects were used to the point that there was no scares by the end. Not to mention how they completely stretched this movie out to a very lengthy 3 hour run-time. I'd say 3/4 of this movie was comprised of flashbacks which could've been shortened significantly. The one big thumbs up is towards the casting which honestly saved me from walking out of the theatre. The whole movie was a disappointment and a bit of a let down to the book. If you're in the mood for a comedy, there are a few good laughs, but I personally wouldn't recommend seeing this in theaters. Don't waste your money.",It Chapter Two
1958,escenescy,Ambitious sequel to a masterpiece,7,8 September 2019,"I was blown away by the first movie. Still have it as one of my favourite horrors.
Naturally I was excited for this one. Disappointed I was not, but it just doesn't peak like the first part. For a nearly 3 hour movie, it felt well paced, with the various transitions, and I didn't feel exhausted or bored from watching it. The transitions between the present and past is genius, especially with a cast that really resemble their younger selves. The character developments and arch's end up really satisfying, and they really get you connected to them all. The way the story is told, is mesmerising, engaging but... It won't keep you on the edge!I found the ambient and atmosphere of this one, feeling like a drama. Where the first movie was full of surprises, with a gloomy atmosphere and a constant intensity. This movie is more relaxed, and as mentioned, feels like an HBO drama at times. The comic relief is really good, but it is way too overdone. They spent a lot of minutes to build up scary and hard hitting scenes, to ruin it with a funny but unnecessary one liner. This is a huge thing, because it feels like the build-up is wasted on a clever remark, instead of a hard hitting sense of fear, anger or drama. Huge potential loss. Hereby it relies on predictable jump scares, instead of the dark and horrific atmosphere from the first movie.Overall, I found the movie good, but not great as expected after the first one. The connection to the first movie was good, there were great details and Easter eggs. Characters and the cast are amazing, the creatures are terrifying and the story telling is great. But I would call it a thriller, not a horror. Good movie nonetheless, but really tends to lean towards drama feel.",It Chapter Two

This movie had potential to be great however they went the complete wrong way with the film. There was some enjoyable scares in the movie which includes the old woman, the mirrors in the amusement park and the lumber jack statue part other than that the scenes that where meant to be scary just made me wince out of cringe.

1964,samuelwhittaker,Everything which mad It: Chapter One special and fun is missing from Chapter Two,2,9 September 2019,"It: Chapter One felt a lot like an adventure film; tonally it was closer to what you would expect from a Stranger Things movie than a typical Stephen King adaptation. This made the first film enjoyable for a wide audience, the jump scares and the horror was mixed in with childish banter and fun montage sequences (even when the losers club cleans Bev's blood-soaked bathroom the scene makes you feel good); it's a film which is ultimately about friendship and the potential for togetherness to overcome evil. It: Chapter Two fails to properly recognise that this is what made the first film standout.The performances of the adult cast in It: Chapter Two are very passive and the film feels more like a straight-to-DVD affair when they are taking up the screen time. There's no chemistry between the adult actors and the script isn't strong enough to overcome this problem; there are some entertaining lines here and there which help to distract the viewer from the lacking quality which the film offers, but they are few and far between. The child actors still do a reasonable job but again the script doesn't give them the same scope for excellence.The third aspect of the film which falls short is the plot itself; of course some of the problems here aren't necessarily the director/filmmakers fault as it is a project which is derivative, but with this said the pacing of the film and the way that the film is structured is extremely dull. As a viewer you're begging for the climax to the film, you know what to expect - Pennywise is going to scare the children and adults in various situations and this will lead the adults to finding their given artefacts through which they will eventually attempt a ritual to fight their foe; there's no fear. The adults and children will be fine, they have to be or the film can't continue along the structure mentioned.Finally, the scares which are present are spoiled by a trope in the horror genre which is almost always negative and frustrating - the overuse of effects and CGI. Scenes which are otherwise tense and interesting are spoiled by this problem and that is perhaps the biggest shame in terms of this particular film.Overall the film is underwhelming and it would have benefited greatly from a more subtle and careful approach in its direction. Audiences need to see these problems in order for the genre to move forwards, as if they do not then directors will continue along this path due to the attractive margins which are there to be sought within the horror genre; films like It Follows and The Babadook are one offs in the field and one can only hope that films like It: Chapter Two are critically assessed to improve future films of this ilk.",It Chapter Two

1973,Zsembi,Failed in the shadow of part 1,5,11 September 2019,"It part 1 was a pretty much lovable movie, even if it wasn't the horror it should have been. It mixed the 80's charm with modern elements. It has its own flaws, but overall succeeded to be kind of a complete experience.
With part 2, as the movie has everything done again bigger and louder, even the flaws are more articulated this time. Too long, unbalanced, incoherent, even though i liked almost all of the sketch-like parts of each character, it was nothing really what we haven't seen in the previous part.
Even the ending was very similar, only complicated a bit more, longer, and somehow less scary. It's okay that they decided to stay with the clown figure, but meanwhile they forget to make him scary. And this is the main flaw of the films, mostly this one. Not enough suspense, but loud jump scares, and shoved in the face violent moments. Sadly it slowly started to be an older teenager version of Scooby Doo.
I guess the problem is that they wanted it to appeal for the widest range of audience, and it definitely hurts the possibility to become something a bit more edgy, creepy, rough horror material.Overall, i enjoyed most of it, but i wanted it to be finished around the last half hour or more.",It Chapter Two

1976,barracute-38646,Superb Conclusion,9,12 September 2019,"It was a lot scarier and violent then I expected, right from the start with the homophobic attack which is as awful as you may have heard. Then the attack on the little girl at the baseball game, wow , even though you know its coming it still makes you jump when it happens. Which brings me to Bill S, yes he was even better this time around, the scene in which he appears initially without makeup is particularly chilling. He is definitely up there with Tim Curry (just don't ask me to choose between them!). So to the losers -well i loved all the adult cast totally believable as the grownup versions of the kids from part 1, I am glad the film included lots of flashbacks to the children mirroring the entire book which constantly switches back and forth, indeed some of my favourite parts were the seamless transitions, like in particular when adult Ben fell into the clubhouse and as he was dusting himself off the sound of someone coming down the stairs was heard, the camera panned to the stairs just in time to see a pair of feet come into frame at the top of the shot = Beverley--young Beverley, and then as the camera followed her down it panned back across to Ben -- young Ben! Ok not technically difficult to pull off but the effect was brilliant. There were several like that while in some it was simply switching the child/adult actor out of shot, the seamless switch between time periods was very effecting. Ok that's all the good stuff now time for some things I didn't like, the house on Neibolt street was one of the best set pieces in the book and one of the most scary this was neither (if you know the book you will understand). The ending didn't work as well for me as it should have, the final battle with IT where the losers physically pulled IT apart as IT shrunk, just wasn't convincing. Having said that the death of Eddie I did find very moving. As a big fan of the book I did miss Tom and Audra not being in Derry, the latter meaning the final scene of the book was omitted. One of things about the end that isn't in the book but which worked for me even as a diehard (and very pedantic) fan of the book were the letters from Stan that arrived after his death for his friends they were very touching.

Too long and drawn out. This movie could he half the length and still not derive from the story.
This movie tries to be too many things at once; horror, comedy, coming of age drama, and ultimately fails to be any. Too much going on with too many characters. The monsters look terrible and look more hilarious than scary, the jokes fall flat. Bill Hader's jokes suck. Some decent acting, particular by Jessica Chataine and James McAvoy.

Not saying the first one was a masterpiece, but it was definitely entertaining. I had the honor of watching both at an IT marathon, so believe me when I say it does not hold up to the original at all.Any tension the movie had was destroyed by an unnecessaryamount of comic relief, and it kept doing the same boring, copy-paste jumpscares for the entire second half of the movie. The last actually good scene was when the girl visited her old home and met Pennywise's daughter. It was funny, yet eerie and creepy - the true IT experience. They built up the tension really well - the woman smiling in the background, obscurred by the focus blur worked to a great effect, but then this naked giant cgi-grandma appears and the rest of the movie never recovered. The actors never seemed actually afraid either, unlike the original. Too busy cracking jokes I guess...
It was basically a parody of itself. A WAY too long parody.IT did actually make me laugh at a few occasions, so IT got that going for IT...

The scenes where homophobia is displayed and encouraged are far bigger then the opposite ones.

What normal message can a young gay person get out of this kind of movie? I'm extremely disappointed that Hollywood is producing such movies in 2019 which are doing no good to LGBT community what so ever.

1988,gregoryfrancis,"The CGI was bad, the character development was worse",3,15 September 2019,"This was a long movie. A really long movie. Despite being such a long movie, every bit of character development occurred in the opening scenes. Not only that, but the character development that did occur was literally just the director/author taking a couple minutes each to tell the audience that yes, in fact, these characters as adults have lives consistent with their characters as children. Girl with abusive dad has abusive husband. Funny boy is a comedian. Hypochondriac boy does risk assessment. Fat boy is a now a certified HUNK but we don't even get the slightest back story on that.Once this has all been established (as forcefully and mind-numbingly dull as possible), the characters no longer matter at all except for one-liners regarding their childhood traits. Sure, there are several scenes where the characters perform CGI-infested quests to retrieve ""artifacts"" related to their battle with It from childhood but, again, anything within these scenes that requires it to be that specific character is always done via reference than revelation.Bev has had dreams about how all the characters die but this is somehow pushed aside and forgotten as soon as its brought up (as is any aspect of her character relating to the abusive dad to abusive husband thing).If the movie was half the length it actually is, this would be somewhat forgivable but it isn't.This brings me to my problems with the plot. Pennywise is the cheapest villain in horror film history. He is a clown that murders kids! This is the sort of nightmare stuff that should write itself. Instead of watching a killer clown meticulously plan out murders or stalk and seduce his victims (OR EVER DO A SINGLE CLOWN THING!) we get this way over-complicated story of him being some thousands year old spirit or god knows whatever that I guarantee no one paid attention to because its so boring. Its a movie about a clown that kills kids! We don't need the Native American spirituality backstory! What is wrong with you, Stephen King? I get it, I'm not as smart as you!We get one scene of the clown killing the little girl, but it is entirely predictable and more or less a repeat of the scene with the little brother from the first movie.

1997,aryantahiri-42405,To the director I really mean it,3,22 September 2019,This movie should of been I really mean it more focused on where pennywise lived. Why he caused the problems for Derry and those children. The movie was more focused on daily lives of the children. It should of had more detail. Why we're Canadians complaining about the fun house scene? They didn't like it because the child got eaten in the end and bill could break through the glass. I also kinda didn't like that scene too..

I did, however, not only watch Chapter 1 in the theater, but felt it was as good, if not better, than the original. With much anticipation, I awaited the release of Chapter 2, where on more than one occasion I wanted to walk out of the theater. This movie did not speak to the audience or instill any sense of dread or fear, but rather used laughable, over-the-top visual effects that did nothing but turn the movie into a joke.

2003,gsolis-54533,Is IT Really That Scary?,10,3 October 2019,"The killer clown is back?!? Yes, IT is! As soon as I heard that a second movie of IT was going to come out I was extremely excited. The first movie, IT, was a great movie; it was full of horror, thrilling scenes, and a slight bit of action. When I first saw the trailer for IT Chapter 2, I was amazed at how much more action there was going to be this time around. I'm an action and horror movie fan, so what's better than having both genres in one movie?! Ever since a young age, I have always had a passion for horror movies. There were times where I was scared but I was always curious to watch was going to happen. Since then I always try my best to watch every horror movie that is released. If a movie isn't entertaining since the beginning, then I instantly stop watching it.
Anyway, I will be reviewing IT Chapter 2 since it is the most recent horror movie that I have watched. Since my little brother is still 13, I asked him if he wanted to go watch IT Chapter 2 with me, he said yes because he also loved the first movie. CAUTION: IT Chapter 2 is a Rated R movie so if you have siblings or family members who are under the age of 17, then I strongly recommend to be accompanied by an adult who is over 21 (e.g. A parent, uncle, aunt, guardian, etc.).
Several days ago, we decided to go to the Classic Cinemas North Riverside Luxury 6 Theatre at North Riverside Park Mall, and watch IT Chapter 2. However, the tickets had already been sold out, due to the great demand of this movie. We were pretty disappointed at first, but we were determined to go watch it. Therefore, two days later we went to the ShowPlace ICON Theatres at the Roosevelt Collection with ICON X, where we were finally able to watch it. We bought a small bag of popcorn, a small pizza, and two ICEEs. We were the happiest siblings alive. When we arrived at the theatre, there were like four other customers. At first I thought, is this movie really that scary? Or is this a joke? We watched several ads because we were 15 minutes early, but when the movie finally started, we were ready to watch what this movie was all about. The beginning was a bit frightening but as the movie went on, my brother and I realized it hadn't been what we thought it was about.
In order to give you an idea about what IT Chapter 2 is about, let me refresh your memory on what happened in the first movie, IT (released in 2017). The movie takes place in Derry, Maine in October 1988. It starts off with two brothers, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his little brother, Georgie Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott) making a paper boat. Georgie goes outside on a gloomy day and sails his new paper boat. Unfortunately, the boat goes down a sewer. As he gets closer to the sewer, he begins to see two bright intimidating yellow eyes. All of a sudden, the murderer, Pennywise the dancing clown (Bill Skarsgard) pops up, and after a quick conversation he bites Georgie's arm off in the most violent and grotesque manner and then drags him down with him. Bill and his friend Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff), who all form The Losers Club, decide to kill Pennywise since they now know he was responsible for Georgie's murder. One day, when Bill gets home, his father Zach (Geoffrey Pounsett) yells at him for designing a model with tubes of the sewer system in Derry, Maine because he still believes that Georgie, his brother, is only missing. Zach tells him to stop thinking about other outcomes because Georgie is dead, but Bill keeps trying until him and his friends finally defeat Pennywise.
SPOILER ALERT! At the end of IT, we see that Pennywise was killed by Bill and his friends aka. The Loser Club, but was he really killed? The answer is NO! Pennywise the dancing clown was not killed which is why there is now an IT Chapter 2 movie. The movie starts off with a gay couple being harassed by a homophobic group of teenagers. One of the teenagers pushes one of the men off of a bridge, landing straight into a lake. All of a sudden the man is pulled out by Pennywise and he is his first victim! The Losers Club is reunited at a restaurant and Pennywise leaves them several clues letting them know that he is still alive.
The movie starts off 27 years later since the Loser Club killed Pennywise, and they are reunited once again when Mike calls the rest of the club because innocent adults and children have been disappearing again. After experiencing the traumatic events from their past, they have to face their fears and defeat the deadly clown, who keeps traumatizing them and has become more powerful than ever.
For the most part, the movie was great. I honestly loved it! I loved the story line, and how well the actors and actresses acted it out. Even though I don't like comedy as much, there were still some scenes that were pretty funny, and I couldn't do anything but laugh. My little brother as serious as can be, also laughed. So if you're looking for a horror/thriller movie with a slight taste of comedy, then this is the movie for you!",It Chapter Two

The movie anchors it's entire entertainment value on CGI, the ignorance of children and the hopes that a rendition of the original would entice fans of the book. It's boring, unimaginative and frankly throws shortcoming after shortcoming to the real fans.I love the cast and crew... but honestly, movie making has gone from psychological horror thrilled rides to a money dump towards CGI and the hopes an old script can carry a truly bad rendition. Not just the new IT and IT part two but most recent horror films. I can nearly fall asleep to this if it didn't play funky sounds to *try* to get under your skin.

2013,joeoneilloneill,B0ring with a capital B (for bad back),3,11 October 2019,"Where to start..
This film features a great cast, and the production level is very Hollywood,
But in general it was a stuffy, unoriginal, jump scare ridden pile of smelly Hollywood trash.
I felt like I wanted to grab my girlfriend and run from the theatre after an hour and a half.
The fact that all the characters absolutely love each other, despite the fact that they haven't seen each other in 27 years is so damn cheesy,
And the theme of 'friendship is so important' is fairly child-like in its stylings.
I mean these people are pushing 40 and they just didn't seem like beleiveable fleshed our characters.
Also IT's background story Is a confusing mess that will most likely give u brain freeze and was plastered in weird cgi and half assedly presented to the audience like a serving of cold takeaway
spoiler alert: there is a fkn gigantic 30 minute battle scene which is brain meltingly boring and unoriginal it was like Stephen king meets marvel
I honestly wanted quite a few of the characters to die because of their unbelievably cheesy acting throughout this weird Hollywood epic.
I mean the film looks pretty good throughout I guess.
But be warned It not a movie that necessarily flies along at a brisk exciting pace i found it a hard slog to get through it and felt sick with all the Corniness :-(",It Chapter Two

I bet you can replace every singe scene with an equivalent in another movie and not miss any part of the story. ""It Chapter 2"" sells nostalgia, cheap jump scares, and CGI where you really don't need it. It takes hours to finish and you can't even fall asleep when the story conclusively disintegrates into a random bunch of unrelated episodes, because of aggressive flashing lights that the viewer should have probably been warned about.

2018,gioviferri,One of the most disappointing films,1,17 October 2019,"Personally, I expected to see a second chapter far better than I'd imagined. First of all, I was expecting a second chapter full of horror effects, which unfortunately I didn't get to see, from my point of view. Even the character of Pennywise, if we really want to talk about it, did not convey all this terror, that maybe I would have expected more from a character who should have instilled a lot of fear. In short, a second chapter that presents itself with endless facets, but that in the end, in my opinion, has only given the impression of a comic film compared to a real horror, by virtue of some ironic scenes, covering the real horror of this movie.",It Chapter Two

A couple of brutal scenes towards the beginning of the film were off-putting, with little or no resolution later in the film. It repeatedly switches between the present (characters as adults) and past (the same characters when they were children from the first film) and overuses coarse language. There are few scares and the CGI is perfunctory at times. Most of the adult characters are rather dull. The film needlessly revisits experiences for each character from the first film.

If you've read the book you know it's nearly impossible to make a good movie of the book. I think this one is good enough. It's stays loyal to the book to a certain extent, but indeed there are a couple of things that were changed to adapt it to the screen. I don't like that, but I honestly wouldn't know how to do it better to be honest.If you are thinking this is a movie that will scary, probably not. It's more about the story than actual jumps and scares. And I think it's ok like this. The book created a big tension using long stories and when the scary part was coming, it was so deep in your brain that scared the crap out of you. No way they can do that in the screen I honestly prefer that they didn't try.I do agree on the CGI stuff. When It is just by Itself with no CGI is so good...

The CGI is terrible and there are so many bad jump scares it's almost hilarious. Bowers' character is completely pointless. And wtf was up with the ritual of chud?

2040,juliaflattum,Unnecessary Closure,6,22 January 2020,"As one of the massive fans of the first IT movie in the now IT series, hearing that viewers would have the opportunity to re enter the town of Derry, Maine in an IT Chapter 2 directed again by Andres Muschietti was very exciting. Watching The Losers take on Pennywise on the big screen yet again was a sight and a good continuation of the first film, however aspects of the plot regarding the character development, the overly lengthy run time of the film and predictability were what left me wondering if the continuation was really necessary at all.
When people start going missing yet again in Derry Maine, the Losers Club who have long been separated living own lives as now adults reunite 27 years later in their home town to fulfill their pact and finally put an end to Pennywise and the terrorism that comes with him. Obstacles encountered along the way bring the group closer together and throughout the film many flashbacks of moments from their childhood appear as each character regains their memory of the events that took place all those years ago.
As a viewer, getting to know the characters as adults, many resemblances of their childhood come forward in the way each one of them is leading their new life. While I do acknowledge that the casting in this movie was phenomenal, capturing each character accurately from child to adult, the way in which the script was written left me wondering what exactly happened to some of the characters and their behavior from their past to now present self. Characters such as Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) and Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) were the two in who I believed differed most from their childhood nature due to the constant amount of flashbacks. Seeing the way both these characters interacted side by side with their childhood personas were what made me realize just how different their behavior became. While there is room for many different interpretations as to why they have changed, after seeing the first IT movie many times it seemed odd how the writers had Ben characterized as being almost entirely different from his childhood self and Beverly losing the inner strength she seemed to have as a child in her adulthood, the flashbacks are what assisted with the doubt and contributed to a bit of confusion when it came to the characters development.
While the amount of flashbacks throughout the film gives the viewer a good sense of nostalgia and also proves necessary with some aspects of the plot, it was a few scenes such as those along with other scenes from the present that created an unnecessarily long length of the film in which I believe could have been cut down shorter and still have been equally if not more successful. What I believe director Andres Muschietti failed to realize when creating this film is that many scenes that made the cut shouldn't have as many had little contribution to the main plot of the film. Scenes that proved essential also left me having a larger sense of predictability than I was expecting and left me knowing too often when things such as jump scares or key events in the storyline would occur.
IT Chapter 2 representing the second half of the famous Stephen King novel IT, proved to be an interesting take on what happens next for the Losers Club. As an IT fan I do have to say that I enjoyed the film as a sense of closure it gave to the first however there were many more parts of the film where I was left a bit disappointed in which I was not expecting. To fans of the IT series who have not yet seen the second chapter of the film I would recommend to go watch it as it did have incredible cinematography and a great cast. Many laughs came from the film as well as some tugged heartstrings and while it did have its flaws it was also a good wrap up to its first film.",It Chapter Two

I also liked the characters and, in particular, the flash backs to their younger selves despite the results of Finn Wolfhard's CGI make over having questionable results. I thought some of the CGI stuff was pretty cool although totally bonkers.

The way they treated Stanley and make him a noble sacrifice in this movie is disgust me and I know some people have been talking about it since the movie was released.I don't understand why the filmmakers bring this to the movie, I thought the novel and the miniseries done a better job on Stanley.

2064,julfeathers,"Hey, Y'all Are Forgetting A Whole Lot of History To Film",2,7 June 2020,"I haven't read every review here, but I agree if the whole crux of the movies rests on the Losers 27 years ago and in the present, it is like trying to make a meal out of a bag of potato chips--it is mostly air trapped in a big wind-bag of a few tasty morsels. I am an author so I always pay more attention to the book than the movie. Everybody is focusing on the Losers, then and now. But IT, in all its forms, is just as much of a character as Derry is because it has shaped the town for centuries to meet its needs.IT comes to feed every 27 years for roughly a one year period. Its cycle starts with a particularly gruesome killing, and ends its cycle with a bloodbath. In Stephen King's book, some of the bombshells that closed out IT's season was a lumberjack going mad and chopping men up inside of a barroom like he was in a trance; the shooting massacre in the main street of Derry, Bonny and Clyde style, of a minor gang in the 1920s who were just passing through when they had car trouble; an Easter egg hunt for all of the kids of the town held out by a factory that exploded during the festivities and killed tens of children and adults; and my favorite recounting, the burning of The Black Spot, a club the black enlisted men at the army base in Derry built with the approval of their superiors because they weren't allowed to go to the whites' only club on base, circa WWII. IT didn't just feed on children; IT also fed on the root of adult fears too.I think if the above had been included, IT could've been made into THREE movies that tied up all loose ends that are left hanging. Beverly's backstory could've been carried out to its conclusion with the death of her control freak husband. Bill finding and buying Silver would actually have a point instead of just being a throw-away cameo (which makes me wonder if Stephen King really has that accent since he has lived most of his life in Maine?) There's no reason to find Silver again except for the appearence of Bill's wife.The one thing I LOVED about the movie was how Ben and Beverly saved each other from their respective fears which were about to kill them. Ben knew Beverly thought Bill wrote the poem from an earlier conversation, and had it hidden in him that he would always be known as the fat kid who never got the girl. But he whipped out that poem that gave her the strength to beat the trap she was in, so that she could save him.The clown is sparingly used, as are the other incarnations used to scare the Losers. In the book, they aren't Mentally CGI'd on steroids. It is the simplest things in life that are the scariest. The rest is ridiculous.Anyway, my thoughts that are definitely different because I want more of what I think are the most interesting parts of the story.",It Chapter Two

Mr Spielberg is willing to work on his demons, most of us could find relief if we had the courage to do so too.

2071,Jurgonator,"A big letdown. Boring, generic, riddled with jump scares.",6,18 September 2019,"The first movie was okay, good even, thanks to the excellent cast.The second one not so much. Again, the cast is excellent and they do their absolute best to make the viewing experience somewhat bearable.The biggest problem for me was the pacing. While I loved the first part of the movie, where the old gang gets together again. The dynamic is very good and I felt real chemistry between the members. After that, it just gets stupid and downright boring and at times, painful to watch.The plot is silly. Which is a funny thing to say since this is a Stephen King fantasy. But still, some of the plot lines make zero sense. Obviously I'm not going to talk about them, since this is a spoiler free review. Lets just say that the middle part of the movie consists of a lot of rinse and repeat scenes with tons of unnecessary and boring jump scare scenes.Jump scares. I don't know what happened with the creators. The first movie was scarce with jump scares, which is fine. I think the best jump scare movies are the ones with no jump scares. Get it? Jump scaring audience is an extremely cheap way to get a reaction. The problem is, after a successful jump scare, you're adrenaline leaves your body and you become indifferent about what happens next. Granted, I could see every jump scare from mile away and wasn't surprised even once. It's just a cheap cheap way nowadays. I would even label it as lazy film making.The pacing. We're either going full throttle or standing still. There's rarely any build up. And the rare build ups usually end in a jump scare. The movie feels like it's almost 3 hours long and that's never a good thing. When your main characters are constantly in trouble but saved due to plot armor, you lose interest and never really feel the characters are in any real danger. That's a no no, especially with such an excellent cast.The plot is silly. Well it's obviously silly by default when you have a human eating clown in the mix. But none of the plot lines in this one made any sense. I'd love to talk about them in detail but that would mean spoilers and even longer rants when I'm attacking individual scenes.Overall, a big disappointment. I don't quite frankly know what this movie even is. Is it a horror? Not really. Is it a comedy? Not really. Is an action movie? Not really. It's just a hot mess.",It Chapter Two

2079,marinov-g,"Did not like it, have to read the book again to get rid of the bad feeling, here's why:",2,22 September 2019,"First of all, this is my first review here, and IT is the first movie that made me do the effort.There is a simple reason for this: I am 41 years old man that read the book back at the age of the main characters and was captivated. Thriller, horror - all was good enough, but the genuine story and developing relationship between the kids was what bought me in then and now, and this books remains my favorite one till present. I remember being much surprised about how the kids thought the same way I did back then, I could connect to their problems, longings, fears and hopes. I have read it multiple times (easy 50+ times) till now, also as an adult, just going back into the growing relationships and feelings, and love and hope, true friendship - this always makes me feel good, a little sad (at the ending), but still in a good way.This is why it was a must for me to see the adaptation of IT, and here I went to watch the first movie. It was bad enough (for the same reasons below), but I patiently waited for Chapter Two. However, where the first movie made wrong, the second movie progressed into disaster.Going back to the movie, all set and casting (as visual looks, though, as acting I did not like - but it was mainly because of the script, in my thought) was really promising. But, all else went downhill, and this is what I mean (ATTENTION: spoilers ahead):Where everything made sense in the book, including all efforts of IT to unsuccessfully kill all of the Losers, here nothing make sense in the movie. If you have not read the books, you simply cannot understand why IT does not kill them once and for all, but plays with them till eventually they kill IT. All IT's actions was ridiculous and meaningless, in most cases. Not even starting on SGI, enough said in other reviews (terribly overkill).No growing connection and relationship between the characters, neither as kids nor as adults. Ben built the clubhouse ALONE before getting along with the rest of the kids (what a club house is this, if it is not made in the club?), the dam scene is deleted entirely (and this was exactly the Losers bonded together as a club), the Smoke ritual was made only by Mike and as an adult, the meeting as adults was soulless and tasteless in many occasions. I do not think the Club ever did anything meaningful together in the movie (except for the rock fight, which feels rushed and illogical, in the absence of the rest). Even the last collisions with IT were done individually (except the ridiculous end, but for this a bit below).Henry Bowers (and the rest) role to drive the Losers together is completely missed, which made his participation into the movie completely unnecessary. In addition, while the book made it clear that killing Henry (which was much a victim of IT, as the rest of the kids anyway) was almost equally bad and helping IT, and though Henry did die in the book, no one of the Losers was actually aiming to kill him. This does not work in the movie - they split Henry's skull, and immediately continue to run jokes between themselves. Come on, guys, it does not make sense.In the book Bill was the natural leader of the Losers, both as kid and adult. His motivation as a kid for avenging his brother's death grew into an wider understanding of the numerous deaths of kids throughout the years, which kept him going and leading the Losers ahead of the collision with IT. There is nothing like this in the movie, they even made Mike the leader of the group as adults (come on, Hollywood, how politically correct you need to be? One Afro-American in the group, and we need to make him the Leader to keep all satisfied?)The letter from Stan Uris at the end was a lazy and stupid way to explain something, which should never need explanation. And beside this is completely not coherent with the book as far as Stan's motivation to kill himself. Pathetic.Beverley visions of the future - useless, meaningless, stupid, at best.The end collision with IT had some potential - and I would understand if they beat IT though love and some natural positive power, or whatever. But they did kill it through bullying IT - calling IT bad names, swearing at it... Come on, guys, I know it is very difficult to adapt the complicated ending in the book, but so same lame a try is too much.Finally, one thing which really upset me off, was adding a home-sexual thing between Richie and Eddie. Where this came from, I will always wonder, and the only reason I did not go out of the theater at this stage was that this came as a fact at the very end of the movie. Again trying to be politically correct or what, I simply do not understand.I can probably continue like this with a long list, but there is no need. As a resume, I do not think that anyone that enjoys the book (as I did) will ever like this adaptation, as it has very little (if any) of the book spirit and message into it.For the ones that have not read the books (thus, not being able to connect the abyss of missing dots), probably it will not make much sense, but if you are into a following set of jump scares and overkill-SGI monsters, it might be watchable.Finally, the mini-series of IT had their flaws, but they had a much better grasp of the book message and feeling, they had a heart and soul, and made me connect to the Losers, which is why I enjoyed watching them. Which is not something I can say for IT and IT Chapter Two.",It Chapter Two

In my opinion, this is senseless violence that was used for pure shock-value and has no relevance to the main plotline or characters involved. Later in the film, they try to pander to the gay audience with a hidden secret that is revealed about one of the main characters, but again they fail miserably and disrespect the LGBTQ community with a sloppy and unresolved character development. I waited for three hours hoping some form of justice would be carried out, all the while watching other characters be given their resolves, but ultimately left with a major sense of injustice and a sick feeling in my stomach.

You knew it was coming because there was no build up and they would do it again and again and again and again. It's not scary when you do the same thing repeatedly, you expect it to happen. Then there is a surprising amount of comedy in this movie. Frankly too much. It completely kills the tone of the scene when you are switching from horror to comedy in the same scene.

There are only few things that I didnt like and I am HUGE fan:
Pennywise true form - here instead of spider Pennywise looks more like crab with clown head...Pennywise the dancing crab ( maybe he did it as spider is also not a true form but who knows )There is time difference in filming 1 and 2 so when you see losers they are teenagers but in period of Chapter 1Thats all folks!",It Chapter Two

The one exception to this was the scene with the old woman, that was creepy, good job on that. The film was very long with not enough horror, and like I stated before a lot of the horror was lost through misplaced comedy. The first scene felt like it was there just to be politicaly correct, it had no relevance to the rest of the film.

I am honestly incredibly disappointed in this one. The acting was spot on, and the performances believable, but it just felt too disjointed, jumping from story to story, from present to the kids memories, and it also lost a lot of the things that made chapter 1 awesome. For example, a LOT more CGI in this one instead of practical effects which made for wonky looking monsters (especially the 'remembered' ones, like the Leper). Second, not enough Bill Skarsgaard doing what he did best, which are Pennywise' creepy movements and mannerisms; they changed it all to CGI-morphing into various sci-fi monsters :( And to be honest, none of the monsters even really scared me like last time. That's not to say it was ALLL bad though... I'd say it was somehow even funnier than the first, and as such, I'd classify it more as a decent sci-fi comedy than a 'horror'. There are some cool little Easter eggs to be found as well, like the Stephen King cameo, etc. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not what I was anxiously waiting for.",It Chapter Two

I liked, but I acknowledged it can be weird to digest.I think the actors did a good job on their roles. It took me a little to realize the adult characters are ""awkward"", like they have some issues, or are socially awkward.There is some stuff that was left unexplained (I don't want to say what to avoid spoilers), and the last part of the last fight didn't convinced me entirely, but still I didn't kill my enjoyment.As a scary movie, it gets tense, is visually strong, and a couple of scenes really made me nervous like no other movie, but I think is still good for casual horror viewers. The key here is you can see Pennywise a lot more on screen, so the movie is more ""honest"" about the horror, and there is just a couple of jump scares.",It Chapter Two

In the first installment the story was changed so that mike wasn't the researcher and Ben was which makes zero sense and took away much needed screen time from Mike. Also, Mike has good parents who experienced racism in Derry in the novel and unfortunately they were the victims of it again in this film, because they were killed in a crack house fire Because all Black people were smoking crack in the 80's. Not just one parent. BOTH. I'll have to tell my parents they missed that one. In this movie the research role is given back to Mike and he's a librarian although thanks to the changes in the first movie, there's no reason to support why he would Choose that profession.

Dude that scene was from the book and was an extremely important scene!!! This movie definitely has more to offer from the book than the first one did and I loved it.That being said there were some dumb parts and I will just start by saying that the guy playing eddie was absolutely horrible and his forced humor was cringe.Overall this was an amazing adaptation and a perfect way to end the series!",It Chapter Two

Not saying the first one was bad but it wasn't very scary to me at all and the tone was all over the place with a lot of moments that were a ""scary scene"" that would go right into a laughing fun scene. The second installment is pretty much the same but less scary, bad CGI monsters, and very predictable. All the characters go off on their own and you already know they are all going to have a penny wise encounter before all meeting up to go defeat him. Not only are these scenes repetitive, but also just not really scary at all. There are some side plots that add absolutely nothing like the return of Henry Bowers. I know it sounds like I'm just trashing this movie but it just could have been a lot better and they could have used Bill Skarsgard more who is a great penny wise and really created the stuff of nightmares instead of scenes that were almost laughable.",It Chapter Two

The opening scene is great, and Bill Hader is great, but nothing else in this film can be defined as the same.For as long as this movie is (nearly 3 hours) it feels as though Pennywise was not given as much screen time as It should have. That, coupled with a handful of jump scares, more unnecessary CGI, and a dragged out finale, makes for a fairly forgettable film.

The problem I find with many horror films these days is that they either lack character depth, the story line and plot isn't that gripping or the special effects are lacking. However I feel that 'It: Chapter 2' does not have those problems. Firstly it fills in many blanks left from the first film through the second chapter. It also has a more adult feel to it but still hold on to the child like horror and scares from the first film. Many modern day horrors leave the feeling of 'well it was ok but it was wasn't scary enough or was not realistic enough' however I believe this film quashes all those perceptions of other horror films.

Much like the recent It movie, this new series is reminiscent of Goonies, Stand by Me, and other classics featuring a team of kids on a dangerous mission.
It 2 does not feel like a 3-hour film, but maybe that's because I was dreading the length and then was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot to cover and it really packs a lot of story in there, so it's not 3 hours of cinematic show-offery, it's real, faceted, story-moving, character-building meat.
Some of the random zombie stuff and over the top gross-out junk was almost a nod to Dead Alive (1992) or Poltergeist (1982), which was good for a laugh I suppose, but just seemed sloppy to me for some reason.
I had a really good time this afternoon watching this film in a theater-as a matter of fact I saw it at (no joke) the Capital theater in my New England town, which looks a lot like Derry and the theater sign, marquee, and location are eerily similar, as well as the name being identical!

Lots of jumpscares, all so predictable, I was so bored, I thought: oh please, not another one. And why do they always feel the need to change the plot? For instance the one about Bill not being really sick? Why do filmmakers think they know it better than Stephen King? Or steal from other movies (the Thing) And the end, the end, that was the last straw for me. If you read the book you know what IT really looks like. I was sooo hoping for a fantastic monster (they used enough CGI, didn't they) maybe a little like the Queen in Alien?(the one in the miniseries made me laugh). But no, what a mess.

This movie is not for people who DID NOT READ THE BOOK.Many scenes in the film are a nod to King's Book. A book which runs on and on, at times making King's scenes feel pointless. That is the exact point of his writing. The boredom is to get you thinking, so those otherwise dull scenes that you random few may be bored by, clearly you didn't read the book.

But it made the movie longer than it should have been and took away the dark vibe. Its sad because the other attributes of the movie like losers club getting back to derry, IT's origin, the flashback scenes, the climax all were well made.

Second, creating the image of who the IT creature is and how it maintains its existence is even harder, and the director did both exceptionally well!The performance of the children and adults are flawless. All of the second act was very well elaborated by being faithful to the book with the flashbacks! The effects are great and effective and I thought they were necessary to build the most complex scenes. Pennywise is amazing and much more scary and violent. It has some very heavy scenes, some good scares and many chair-holding scenes.The film is also very funny and with this, relieves a little weight leaving the film more balanced. I understand that some complain about the time but for me, I did not see the time pass. The end manages to raise a lot of emotions and then the perfect climax.I am sure that Stephen King is very proud to see one of his best works honored this way! I thought it was as good as the first, and putting together both movies we got a masterpiece of horror!",It Chapter Two

Stupendous scenes, perfect casting (It was so easy to get attached and root for the characters. Bill Skarskard as Pennywise, big shoes to fill but oh man he did it justice!) and an ending that is worthy of that monstrous, magnificent book.

2175,ajaychemnitt,"First movie made money, Let's make a second one!!",5,27 September 2019,"I would have to say the casting director of this movie has done a great job of putting together actors that resemble the characters of their younger self not to mention the big chubby Ben has now become a hot daring Ben. But that's where the niceties of the movie ends.If the most scariest scene of the movie was a giant naked CGI generated grand ma, then the movie is seriously missing some of the natural free flowing expression of the first movie. It almost seems like the makers were trying too hard to make the movie more scarier than the last time but only to come up with a series of long and predictable jump scares from zombies in the beginning in order to reintroduce characters and a series of pointless chases from the clown in the end.I can only assume lack of creativity when the most important scene in which they perform the ritual to kill the clown turns out to be a damp squib. 'Turn the light into dark' they say a countless times until your earing apparatus become deaf only to see a balloon pop out, which is honestly more painful than getting a hit in your balls while playing baseball. And for the first time probably in the history of cinema, the villain is killed by calling him names.The tone of the scenes in the movie switches from inconsistent to confusing. The horror scenes are mixed with comical overtones, the emotional scenes are made worse by mundane dialogues - 'we must stay together', 'if you believe you will kill' or using the nostalgia card far too often, and the comical scenes are far and few between. In the end, everything is juxtaposed to leave you with neither horror nor something touching or comical and doesn't do justice to the famous and popular novel (according to Maria Serova who read the book)In short, Seeing the CGI zombies for 3 hours, yes 3 hours, and the letters at the end just tests your patience as much as your grandmother who was advising you to get your life together in your teenage years. If you miss your grandmother, It's a must watch otherwise a pint at your local bar is better worth the money.",It Chapter Two

2180,art-steventon,Almost perfect sequel,9,7 September 2019,"IT Chapter 2...
Picking up straight from the end of Chapter One, Ch.2 almost seamlessly continues the story - in one viewing, there won't be any noticeable difference in terms of the actor's ages for the child versions of the characters (which sometimes happens with sequels a few years apart). The casting of the adult version of the losers is flawless - Bill Hader's take on Richie Tozier and James Ransom's Eddie Kasparak being the stand out performances (in fact, the weakest is probably James McAvoy's Bill, but thats still a brilliant performance).
Where the film works best is in the mix of humour and horror - it retains an humanity that some modern horror loses in return for an almost sadistic voyerism of the gore rather than have us empathise with the victims / heroes (or even, turn the monster into an anti-hero). Here, the Losers are flawed, 'normal' people, driven to do and witness things no-one should.
If anything, the part of Henry Bowers feels almost unnecessary - a side story that's not given enough time to grow as such and to be honest, the movie wouldn't have suffered from him being left on the cutting room floor.
When the first movie came out, the comparison between the previous Pennywise - Tim Curry, and this version, Bill Skarsgaard was the topic of a lot of heated debate - with this concluding chapter, Bill has made the role 'his' forever - sad when it needs to be, horrific and monstrous otherwise, yet the viewer never feels sympathy for him, nor should they.

2182,swostos,Not even Pennywise can save this circus,5,7 September 2019,"I'll skip repeating what others here have already said about the plot being disjointed, characters cliched, dialogue awkward, tension weak, and scares predictable. Chapter One had similar issues (albeit in not so exaggerated a form that it dried up all patience and good will), but what it did have was Skarsgård and his Pennywise the Clown, who, as a debut movie monster, was surprisingly unique and mesmorizingly haunting.
Chapter Two does not have the benefit of being a debut; the audience already knows what Pennywise is about. In short, the magic is gone. IT in the first film was an out-of-this-world force of inconceivable breadth. IT in the sequel is a familiar monster up to the same old tricks (down to the very way he stalks and chomps his victims); and, in being so, loses much of his power.
""Pennywise has returned to Derry!"" is supposed to be the driving vehicle of tension for the film. But it feels like Pennywise never left. He's doing exactly what he's always done, like the uncle that asks you to pull his finger every Thanksgiving. Skarsgard is a talented actor. The filmmakers had no shortage of opportunities to rekindle the magic of the once-mysterious monster, who, having been humiliated by defeat, could have returned in Chapter Two with a vengeance, more cunning, more menacing, more malevolent. Every opportunity was squandered. And so the only bouy keeping the first film afloat, is no longer there to save the second from sinking.",It Chapter Two
2183,essiewyler,All over the place,4,8 September 2019,"The story line of where IT came from was all over the place. Aliens, Native Americans, a circus clown and his daughter. The actors did a great job but the ending made no sense at all",It Chapter Two
2184,epic_potato,Incredibly underrated,8,25 October 2020,"This movie is not perfect, not in the least bit. It does some things very wrong, such as the pharmacy scene, Stan's note, and not explaining what Pennywise really was to make the bully scene seem less stupid. But the actors were great, the story was good, and the effects were nowhere near as bad as everybody says.I had just finished the book and watched the 1990 miniseries before watching It 2017 and 2019 back to back. I enjoyed all of them, but of course the book is so much better than any adaptation. I think people are being unfair to this film. It's not a great film, no, but it's definitely fulfilling and worth watching. The end made sense to me since I had read the book and knew that Pennywise fears them because they don't fear him. He knows they can defeat him, it's all in their heads.I'd say give this a movie a chance if you haven't already, and if you hate it, then you hate it.

IT chapter two is a special movie it sits at the top of the table crowned the horror king. This is because it is neither the traumatic horror of Ari Asters Heredity or Robert Eggers the Witch nor is it the popular James Wan conjuring series instead ""IT"" is the horror film the non horror fans come out to see. It plays out like a ghost train at a fun fair with laughter and screams in equal measure.
If i was thirteen years old and sneaking into the cinema to see this movie I would leave believing it was the greatest movie ever made. Just as I had when I watched a VHS of a Nightmare on elm street dream child. (The loser club walk past a cinema showing a nightmare on elm street 5)
This a throw back to the horror movies of the past full of monsters, snot, sick and blood.
However unfortunately being now thirty years of ages it didn't scare me at all and at three hours long it felt it.
Bill Hader and James Ransone steal the show with hilarious banter and one liners with Bill Skarsgard performance of pennywise the dancing clown reaching Heath ledgers ""Joker"" levels of perfection that will live forever in cinema history.
Altogether a fun ride but drags in places.

The jump scares were alright but the CGI monsters just made the movie feel immature. Also....Pennywise is a flesh eating clown with hypnotic powers.....and they bullied him to death to defeat him. It was just such a corny scene watching pennywise shrink as they say mean things to him lmao,It Chapter Two
2191,tanya-padam711,Psychological horror and a masterpiece at that!,9,4 July 2020,"If you are looking for scary jumps that any classic horror film can offer you, this is NOT your movie.It's a pure *psychological* horror. By that I mean it amazingly depicts how our childhood experiences affect our life choices later on as we enter into adulthood. It focuses on the theme that we let our fears stop us from doing well in life.
The more we hold on to our fears, the stronger it gets along with added troubles. And it's all in our head. Some of us know how to conquer our fears, while the others who aren't able to cope up lose their paths and commit serious mistakes or take extremely wrong choices in life.Going into the details(spoiler alert)
Why does IT prey on small children ? Not all children! but the ones who have had some troubled experiences. Like the girl who has a face mark and says that her friends make fun of her, a boy who is gay and gets bullied by other children, a boy who stammers and is made fun off by others, a girl whose father is extremely abusive, a boy who is made fun of for his big size, a boy who was bullied about his parents for his skin color... and so on.
The story shows That a group of small children were able to fight IT in their childhood but somehow it appears again after 27 years ! Why 27 years ?
Now this is just my opinion or what I gained from the movie, that we usually make big decisions about life when we are in our late 20s. It's usually during that period of time when we make big choices about career, marriage, and so on. It's during this time that we develop a personality which is hugely dependent on our childhood and other life altering experiences.
The girl who was abused by her father in her childhood is shown married to a guy who abuses her(a choice she made in her adulthood). The guy who was bullied as a child for being fat worked out and shaped his body, excelled well in his career, the guy bullied for being gay isn't married and doesn't have a life partner yet.. and so on. What you make out of life is dependent on how well you have let go off the childhood traumas.some of us just repress our memories, which is exactly what they all had done when they left Dery to go on to live in our cities.
Now Once again they all have to go back to *Dery* in order to face their fears and stop IT's terror. They feel the need to stop bad things happening to other children.
They relive their childhood memories and face IT again after 27 years. This is the main theme of the movie.The movie leaves a mark and gives the audience something to think about.Especially the ending! Just before when IT is about to die (or go away) He takes the form of all the different bullies and in the end turns into a scared and small version of itself. The characters weren't able to kill him with a sword/knife or some kind of a spell(which happens in most of the horror films). Instead they killed him by conquering their fear. They say ""you are just a clown, you are so small, a bully, you mean nothing, we aren't scared of you"". This is how they conquer their fears. Thats when IT says that you all have become adults, you all have grown up and dies.All in all, what a wonderful way to spread a strong message across the audience.
This movie is Scary, funny, psychological and contains a meaningful message.It's a masterpiece. Just my opinion.",It Chapter Two

I don't think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture.There is no tension or character-investing in this movie, and the director manages to make the cast (who works with What they have been giving) look terrible in their acting. It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).If you like a horror movie, where you don't need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..

2214,greenfighter,It had its moments,7,25 September 2019,"Overall, this movie didn't really match up with its predecessor. I was never truly bored with this movie, but for me it was more of a comedy rather than a horror movie. Some moments worked really well with the scares, like Vicky's death under the bleachers (even though it was spoiled in the countless tv spots) and the dearth of Dean in the Hall of Mirrors.But most of the time, primarily the entire second act, the scares just got more and more redundant. They all had pretty much the exact same setup and pay off. They all included CGI monsters that tried to attack the adult losers, sometimes in flashbacks as kids as well, and then they ran off and cut to the next loser.The story could've been looked over just one more time before being sent off to the cast and crew for a table read. The first act felt a bit rushed to be honest, due to the fact that the losers' introductions are just rushed through to make time for the second act and reunion. The aforementioned second act was just super redundant, it had no purpose besides giving the kids more screen time, and it didn't really catch anyone in the audience for a scare. But rather the whole theater was roaring with laughter at most of the scares. And the third act was just all over the place. The way the ritual of chüd was done in the film was drastically different than the first one, and really served no purpose whatsoever. The way they defeat penny wise does make some sense, but it was not the smartest choice made by Andy Muschietti.I'm the end, this movie does have its moments where they catch you by surprise.

If you want jumpscares and cheap laughs, go and ride a damn ghost train because those elements do not make a film good.Utterly plotless, terrible CGI, awful attempts at 'humour', so very predictable from start to finish and one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a mainstream horror film (so bad that the filmmakers keep alluding to bad endings throughout).Let me reiterate. Having things jump out at you over and over again does not a horror film make. The amount of 10/10 reviews on here is embarrassing.",It Chapter Two

I felt the second part of the original took itself too seriously. Also, where are you supposed to take a story when you realize that the monster is only stronger if you're afraid of it..and you're using the same victims from the first movie that came to this realization? That's why there's usually only one or no survivors at the end of most horror movies...",It Chapter Two

There were holes in the story, I still have questions about things that happened: why was the old lady naked? why did the bully come back just to be killed? why was his friend driving, was he a zombie? where was heathers husband story line? Just to name a few.I could see some similarities in the original movie and this remake which is what I look for, it brings feelings of nostalgia to see favourite moments revisited. Pennywise is still creepy, and I wasn't bored, it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie.
I would still recommend, but just wait for it",It Chapter Two

The tone was dark. I love it. Chapter 2 was a bore. None of the adult actors carried over any resemblance to the children they were supposed to have been. I fell asleep three times during this nearly three hour movie, once snoring so loud the guy next to me had to wake me up. The CGI effects were awful and over used in my opinion. Practical effects would have been so much better. I'm going to go see it one more time to see if I slept through anything that would change my mind. I doubt it though. Overall, Chapter 1 was great.

Rinse/Repeat. Each vignette was formulaic and whilst clever from a technical effects standpoint, really stagnated the overblown narrative and offered nothing to character development.Without going into spoilers there was also a complete waste of the Bowers character which really wasnt necessary or of any impact.If Cary Fukunaga was allowed to make these films I believe he would have shown less of this formula and more character psychology particularly with his proven use of flashbacks from TD Season 1.Anyhoo if Chapter 1 ""floated"" your boat you will probably enjoy this installment as well.",It Chapter Two
2233,mamajey,Hilarious!,4,9 September 2019,This was a super funny movie! But other than a few jumpy parts (that you knew were coming) it was very disappointing as a horror flick.

The director took a whole lot of liberties with this film. About 20 minutes into it this movie jumped off the rails and began swinging wild. However the actors done an amazing job with the script. As the book fan I am highly dissatisfied with the movie. I will not post any spoilers but when *that* storyline showed up there was a collective groan in the theater. If you have not read the book I am thinking you will enjoy the movie. Be prepared though it's almost 3hrs long. There's a lot of scenes that could have been cut out and still leave plenty in the movie. There are a few Jump scares, not to bad though. There are also funny parts too. (Those little scenes were cute and funny. There were laughs in the theater) At the end of the day though go watch the movie and decide for yourself if you think it's good or bad or boring. I rated it a 5 simply because I couldn't get past the extreme differences the movie and book have. The actors were awesome and the film had a nice ""color"" so to speak to it.",It Chapter Two

2237,hazeltamara-76051,The comedy aspect spoils It.,5,6 September 2019,"I was very excited going to see It Chapter 2 especially as I thought Chapter 1 was great. However all I can say is that I was hugely disappointed.It's hard to believe they were both directed by the same person. Chapter 2 has far too much comedy thrown in, for what's meant to be a scary movie. The cinema audience were laughing out loud and unfortunately some of those laughs were at the parts that were meant to be scary.
I didn't jump once, like I did with the first one and I felt Pennywise as the clown could have been in it more than he was.In my opinion Chapter 1 was better than the original and Chapter 2 is definitely not. The next time I want to watch It, l'll watch the original mini series.",It Chapter Two

The scene with the gays and the little girl seemed to me too much. I'm not the type to write a negative review, if I don't like it I don't look but now I've been to the cinema and I really felt the need three times to go, besides, it seemed boring to me and instead of fear, I felt rather nauseated. .

In the beginning the movie was alright but near the 2 hours mark i just wanted the story to wrap up, there's a reason most horror movies are 1.5-2 hours long, only so much jump scares and ugly s**t growling/running around you can take before it gets repetitive/predictable. I got bored with all the IT casing them around endlessly.

If you go into this story having only ever seen the movies, then it will be enjoyable to the casual viewer, sure. Maybe even boring since you want to be even more creeped out by IT or see some cool effects.
However if you read and UNDERSTAND the book, then chapter 2 (along with ch 1) is a masterpiece. I can sit here and try and explain all day, but it's best if you just take the time and read the book, so much more is explained in there and you'll understand why 2 movies was not enough.",It Chapter Two

Constant action, and a never-ending climax kept me engaged throughout. I truly cared for the characters, a rare thing in this genre. Each of their individual storylines fit nicely and had continuity which was refreshing. I'm reading a lot of criticism for excessive CGI, but I ask these critics, is that not the point of the film? Each monster is the manifestation of the characters' worst fears. Highly recommend. Go in with an open mind.",It Chapter Two

It's almost as if a child wrote the movie and did the graphics. They have giant grandmas running around topless, zombie-like monsters sticking their tongue in a character's mouth, and Pennywise's head on a giant spider creature. Not to mention they kill him with insults.

2299,diegovivasscire,IT really hurts to put that score...,6,10 September 2019,"The first chapter was awesome, a fun horror/fantasty/adventure story that had a great vibe to it, with likeable characters and nice performances. IT was the perfect commercial horror film. The lack of some depth to some characters was the problem. However this next chapter was so disappointing. I entered having in mind that this part was going to be different, and it was they just didn't do it good. We can agree that one thing that we all wanted was to be scared again and the lack of surprise and ""class"" completely that part of the movie, I mean at some point it felt like a Marvel flick. They are fun and good but the bad ones is because of how they mix the humor with the important stuff of the movie. Don't get me wrong I love that IT has humor but i don't want to see those ruining scary scenes. Also it's unnecessarily long, it has to many flashbacks and things that we already know and some that are not necessary. For instance, the first scene in 2016 was okay but the scary part ruin it... it would have been so much better to put in the beginning the girl in the baseball field at first and just extend that scene. Now, good things, the actors and their characters are great without a doubt but the lack of Stanley in the first one, made his suicide less impactful. Bill Hader/Richie was the stand out with James Ransone/Eddie, butthe crush between them wasn't very developed. The decision wasn't bad I wish it had more meaning...
Pennywise, agggghhhh, is hard for me to say it, ir really hurts, but left me with wanting something better of him, especially because they killed him by ROASTING (insulting, etc) him that was a shame. To many ineffective CGI that didn't help the horror like it did with the first.

2305,selkjo,Had higher expectations,4,16 September 2019,"The first movie was all right, but this was a let down even for the already pretty low expectations I had. In essence, the sequel (and to a lesser extent the first movie) was carried mostly by the acting and some few interesting scenes. However, the ending was really bad and had some really blatant and somewhat obnoxious symbolism and moral. Also, the ""scary"" parts of the movie weren't actually that scary, which is the thing a horror movie is supposed to do best. I believe the CGI was supposed to look scary and give a creepy vibe, but in a significant number of scenes it just looked goofy instead, and I found myself laughing when I should have been scared or at least felt tension.Now, for one of the major aspects of film making: sound (mixing, track, sounding, etc.), editing and cinematography. I know too little about these aspects of film making to form a valuable or well justified opinion, sorry 'bout that. One thing I will note is that the sound mixing was pretty sub par with the audio being too loud or low in certain areas.My largest issue with this movie is the cheap scaring tactics. The over-usage of cheap jump-scares and stupid tension building methods is especially frustrating when the movie shows small glimpses of brilliance when it comes to tone and atmosphere. Some of the aspects are very well done, but they get overshadowed by the same garbage everyone's seen a million times before.",It Chapter Two

2318,tyjchurchill,I expected more after the first movie ....,6,9 September 2019,"It's been a while since I've read the book or seen the first movie; so I apologize if I get some things wrong.TLDR; The film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares. This means little character interaction (which is part of what the first movie had going for it). By the time you get to the final confrontation with Pennywise, you're just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you're not really rooting for the losers. And if you are, it's mostly because of what was established in the first film.Pros:
The film starts off great. Somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first.Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise and is creepy as hell.Stan's speech in Richie's second flashback is great and actually funny.Casting is, for the most part, really good. I think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they've matured over time. Adult Richie is too kid-like while Bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable.Cons:
Bowers is half-assed. Literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else. Either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in Derry.The final form of Pennywise is unsatisfying. It's literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body. They needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book. I think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though.Stan's letter at the end cheapens his death. Instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of IT, his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others.There's next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters. I blame this mostly on the middle 90 minutes where they all split up. It's totally different from the first film where they are actually a team.Speaking of which, this part where they all go their separate ways to find their ""tokens"" is so contrived. The story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long.All of the monster scenes except the ones with Pennywise have terrible CGI. They might be gross and/or startling but you can see them coming and they don't contribute much.About 1/3 to 1/2 of the jokes just kinda fell flat.The constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch. It was just a constant cycle of ""pan to character, give a little backstory, jump scare, repeat"".",It Chapter Two

2320,satyastephenson,Some pros and some cons...,7,11 December 2019,"There really is a lot of Spoilers for both the movie and the book here so be warned.Let me start off by saying that I have read the book and had some issues with the book as well (even though for the most part I love Stephen King books) so despite the fact that there were many changes from the story line of the book I knew going in to this movie that I was not opposed to having some elements be changed.Pros: 1. The actor that plays Pennywise is amazing, as he was in the first movie. Really, he is mesmerizing when he is on screen. 2. Thank GOD they gave some build up to having Ben and Bev end up together (this alone brought my rating up a few starts, honestly). It made me nuts in the book where it was more of an afterthought after everyone had left Derry ""oh yeah I think she left with Ben"" after she had slept with Bill and showed no real inclination to poor Ben. 3. The casting was great and the actors did a marvelous job with their parts. 4. No weird child sex thing at the end (pretty obvious they were going to omit that but still)Cons: The absolute biggest con (and really it is a big con) is the CGI monsters. They reminded me of an early 2000's line of Golum's cousins . Honestly, if we could replace all of these CGI monsters with...really anything else...scenes that started out as scary would have stayed scary instead of becoming laughable. The whole movie would have been much more successful in my opinion and I think they should do a reboot where they keep the rest of the movie but ditch the CGI monsters and re-release it. For instance, when they had the old woman running nude in the background when Bev is at her ""old house"", it would have been much more scary if they stayed with that idea (sort of like the old woman in the bathtub in the Shining) instead of having her run out of the dark as a giant monster. 2. I still didn't like the way they killed Pennywise but did find it funny they kept referring to Bills bad endings (even Stephen King made a jab at it!) as if making a commentary on the IT ending itself. 3. I wasn't a big fan of the direction they took with the ""chud"" ritual and Mikes role in it--it ended up making Mikes almost sole role in the film a walking spout of information about how to use the ritual to kill IT and then having him be wrong about it anyway.There is more but this is from the top of my head after watching it a few moments ago.",It Chapter Two

I immediately found myself irritated and honestly offended by the completely inappropriate and cheap opening scene. It felt more like the movie was sympathetic to this disgusting hate crime than it was trying to draw attention to harsh realities. The perpetrator's did not get the comeuppance in any way and the It literally ate and dismembered the victims. It was shocking certainly, and completely unnecessary. The themes of the movie never ever call back to this in any way, it was like it was in a different movie. Everything else was worse, this perfect casting is completely wasted on this awful script, the jokes are awful and I flat out hated some of the adult versions of the characters (who still act like children in some cases). The scares didn't make any sense when compared to the first and we really only cheap thrills. Way too long, pacing really drags for most of the film. The cg on the kids wasn't noticeable to me like it seems to be for others but it was far from the most distracting thing about the movie. 27 years later these dumb characters STILL don't bring any weapons with them to fight It.

.. It is longer to show more emotion and nostalgic references due to their past at Derry.People complain that it is TOO LONG.. what if I were to tell you that it was 1hr40 mins.. your say it's too short.. I've been reading the book.. I watched IT 2017 before I was a teenager and trust me , it gave me the biggest fkin heart attack of my life.

2329,medeeam,Could have been better,7,6 September 2019,"Disclaimer: I haven't read the book, so I'm only speaking from the perspective of someone who saw It: Chapter One in 2017 and really loved it.I might have set my expectations too high, but with a movie as outstanding as the first one, I couldn't help but do so. And, unfortunately, that led me to some sort of disappointment. The cinematography isn't as great (although we still get to see some beautiful shots, don't get me wrong), and the storyline isn't very consistent. For most part of the movie, we follow them trying to remember what happened 27 years ago (or just trying to find their artifacts maybe?), but that's mostly a pretext for us to see the many forms Pennywise can take to scare them. The narrative with the ritual that Mike tells them about felt to me like a cheap excuse to justify defeating IT (and thank god, that's not what actually worked). It's just we spend so much time on an idea that isn't grand, nor original. The last half hour of the movie is when stuff finally starts to go down, and it was definitely the most exciting part of the film.
There's also lots of good elements, though. The acting is top notch, the cast itself is fantastic. We get a couple of brilliant scenes from Bill Skarsgard, like that scene with the little girl at the baseball game. I only wish we got to see him act more (as in the first movie, they rely more on cgi and jump scares to creep the audience out). I also enjoyed the dialogue and the character arcs we got to see.
There is a lot of effort put into this movie. It's definitely worth watching if you loved the first one. However, it doesn't hit the potential it had. Judging by how they nailed the first movie, I personally think they could've done Chapter Two better.",It Chapter Two

2344,sheik_aboudi,Meh is the best descriptor,5,13 September 2019,"It failed to capture the most effective part of the first movie: the chemistry of the ensemble. A large portion of that may be due to the film spending a large amount of its time keeping the characters separated, for no real reason other than them choosing to not be together. I suppose it also wanted to show each individual character's torment, but it is certainly possible to do that while also having them interacting (and growing) with the others.Another downside is that during these individual (drawn out) moments, there's a heavy focus on revisiting the character's past, which attempts to flesh out each one more, but is more of just rehashing what we learnt in the first film. Ultimately the effect is sacrificing the development of the characters, which never really happens except for a couple throw away moments in the epilogue section, in favor of giving a drop more depth to what has already been established about the character.When the cast finally comes together as a full ensemble in the last third of the movie, it still feels more like individual performances happening simultaneously, rather than a group naturally interacting. However, the film is still too afraid to have them stick together for too long. This is mostly to tie up the loose ends of various character relationships, though is fails to really make the most of those moments and use them to their fullest advantage, both from a character arc perspective, but also from a build suspense/horror perspective. Instead, it is more interested in spectacle. I do have to admit that the CGI does look incredible.",It Chapter Two

2347,xrccatastrophe,Identity Crisis,2,7 September 2019,"This movie is extremely chaotic in the worst of ways. It struggles to find an identity throughout the entirety of the movie. There are brief subplots of romance and numerous comedic scenes that completely detract from the horror film experience. None of the comedy is good enough to classify the movie as comedy, and the romantic subplots are never fully fleshed out, leaving horror as the only moderately consistent characteristic of the movie. Despite this, the horror is superficial, relying on occasional jump scares and scary effects to evoke fear. This stands in stark contrast to It (2017) which has an underlying sense of dread throughout the movie, in addition to the standard horror scares. It (2017) develops a mysterious lore surrounding the events of the film that keeps audience members invested while evoking suspense. It Chapter Two attempts to provide resolution to the events of the first movie in an extremely convoluted way, with ridiculous details that remove any sense of immersion in the film. It Chapter Two is far too reliant on the events of the first movie, leading to a convoluted mess that attempts to achieve the feeling of the first movie, with the end result being something that feels like a satirical knock off of the first movie. The only reason this movie gets 2 stars as opposed to 1 is the fact that some of the effects were cool looking.",It Chapter Two
2348,audisnickm,Worst inconsistency,3,6 September 2019,"We were told in first place that IT appears every 100ys.....in the second part every 27ys.
And many other doesn't match.
High expectations especially with these actors.

2349,pollypeach,Jump scare overkill,5,13 September 2019,"I grew up on Stephen Kings books, his stories frightened me, just the words on the page, no need for jump scares! I was fairly disappointed with the 2nd chapter, although the casting was absolutely spot on and I LOVED the cameo with the great Mr King himself I feel like they kind of destroyed the movie. Comparing it to Chapter 1, it was a big let down for me",It Chapter Two
2350,Ivan9908,IT continues... to an end.,7,6 September 2019,"This movie picks up right where Chapter One ended. Knowing some important plot points in the book, I'm satisfied to see some of the scenes in the movie. There are some changes made for this adaptation but nothing too far fetched. I'll admit, it can be a little boring but I'm just here to watch these characters fulfill their journey as they explore the presence of Pennywise and how to defeat IT.Yes, while Chapter One has all the scares, expect this film for the lore. It does have its humor and intense sequences just like the first film but it doesn't rely too much of the scares. Also, all the adult Losers are really good with their performances. I'm also glad to see the kid Losers play their part as well, as you'll also see some of the encounters with Pennywise you haven't seen before.One nitpick I have is how goofy Pennywise can look when he's trying to scare the audience. I think he's a little more intimidating in the kid part from Chapter One but not much for this one.Overall, I do enjoy this film. I went to the early premiere at my local theater at 5:00 pm and had a great night with my mom. If you enjoyed the first movie and are invested with the Losers, then don't hesitate to watch this film.",It Chapter Two
2351,constancebrown-10478,Great movie,8,6 September 2019,The first one was better but this was a good movie.,It Chapter Two
2352,andrewreyespatriot,Thought it was a comedy honestly,2,6 September 2019,"Predictable and lazy jump scares, randomly making one of the characters gay for no reason that wasn't in the book, and an overall unenthusiastic film. The fact that King greenlit this film goes to show that he got money hungry probably because he ran out of cocaine to snort. The only save was Bill Hader and James Ransone by adding some good comedy to the film.",It Chapter Two
2353,tammymcbain,Disappointing,6,14 September 2019,"Honestly expected much more from the movie. I was really disappointed, was bored majority of the time in the cinema. Very few scares, don't think I got scared once while watching the movie. Although there were some strong points such as the comedic lines by Bill Hader, and the actors really portrayed true friendship through out the movie. But unfortunately I left the cinema wanting more.",It Chapter Two
2354,benjames-71364,'It' was good!!,8,9 September 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film personally. The CGI was a little unrealistic at times and the film was probably 30/45mins too long but apart from that its difficult to fault too much. The casting was brilliant; probably one of the best I've ever seen. The kids from IT: chapter 1 are all grown up, and look how i imagined they would.It is not the scariest horror film i have ever experienced, but there are plenty of jump scares which worked well. The comedy from the first film carried over to this one, with one liners from Eddie which had me in stitches.Overall i would ignore the bad reviews and experience the film for yourself. It is definitely worth a watch!",It Chapter Two
2355,jeterfans-67743,Losers stick together,8,7 September 2019,"Personally, I liked the first chapter better. There's something about a group of kids with a coming of age story that really is magical. But I will say that I was satisfied with how the movie played out.
Pros: Great acting. Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård own this movie. The casting is amazing and they aren't shy about it. The story is relatively simple compared to IT: Chapter One, but it doesn't really lessen the movie. It's actually much more emotional then scary, at least that's what I think.
Cons: The beginning was great but it starts to slow down towards the middle, not boring but it feels drawn out. There are some high stakes moments where a joke is definitely not needed, but it's there. Also make sure not to eat and drink a lot while at the theatre. IT is a LONG movie.
There are some changes I was thrown off by but I didn't mind, since I'm so used to the original book's story. I know people are divided on this but I say IT Chapter Two had a beautiful, yet surprising ending. Definitely give it a watch if you liked IT: Chapter One",It Chapter Two
2356,abontemps,Don't go for pure horror !,9,20 September 2019,"As said in the title, you won't enjoy this movie if you're just here for the horror. Because this movie felt comedic to me (not in a bad way mind you), mostly thanks to Richie & Eddie, but also with how Pennywise mocks them during the movie. That's actually probably why I loved it so much, because I was often smiling during it.
Of course, if you're there to have nightmares, you'll probably be disappointed.
I'm usually mad when the story of the book is changed, but I like them both a lot.(Spoilers below)+++
child and adult Stanley look so alike it made me uncomfortableas I said before, it was funny at pointsI liked the idea of battling their fears more than the real ritual of Chüd in the book (which is a bit too trippy imo), it makes sense to meR&Esome scenes were tense even though you could see it comingRichie losing it at the end is better than being calm and acceptingthe first scene is awesome (fun fair), I was getting chillsPennywise mocking themthe hall of mirrors was a fine addition- -not enough Bowerswish Derry would have been destroyed like in the book, would have been really cool to watchthe clown spider was a bit strange, I guess they just wanted to keep Skarsgård till the endthe final killing seemed a bit too easyin the Vicky scene, Pennywise tries to make her not afraid, which is very contradictory since he feeds on feardon't know why they didn't break Eddie's arm again (stabbed in the face instead)I would have gone for 8/10 but I went to see it twice at the cinema and that never happened to me, so one more star for that !",It Chapter Two
2357,thepopedpopcorn,Great but disappointing,8,9 September 2019,"Up until the climax this was the best horror movie i've ever seen, as a reader and fan of the book I thought it was really good and the casting choice was just brilliant, but then the climax happened and the ritual of chüd in the movie was disappointing and the way they finished off penny wise was also a disappointment. But there were some moments that were funny and even moments that made me tear up. If the ending stayed true to the book and the movie didn't drag on forever then I would've given it a 10/10.",It Chapter Two
