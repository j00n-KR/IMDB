0,SnoopyStyle,"more Dieter, less zombies",6,4 November 2021,This is a prequel to Army of the Dead (2021). Sebastian (Matthias Schweighöfer) is a mild-mannered bank teller by day and a YouTube expert on safes by night. His clip has one view. It's master thief Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) and she recruits him into her gang. They're planning to breaking into three legendary safes.This is an origin story but nobody was asking for one. It's fine. The whole point of the original is zombies. This one kept the zombies by putting them into nightmares. It's not the same thing. It's fine. Korina has some minor fun. Sebastian and Gwen are good. It's a lot of fine.,Army of Thieves
1,Prismark10,Army of Thieves,5,6 November 2021,A prequel to Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead that has less zombies and more Wagner.Featuring the character of Sebastian (Matthias Schweighöfer) who appeared in Army of the Dead.He is a mild mannered bank teller with his own YouTube channel detailing the best safes in the world to crack. He only gets one viewer.Unwittingly Sebastian takes part in a competition to find the best safe cracker. He is then recruited by a gang of thieves led by Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) to break into three legendary safes based on Wagner's ring cycle.Schweighöfer directs as well as starring in it. It is basically a decent if predictable Euro heist movie. The first job goes like clockwork but you just sense that the next one will go wrong. You just know that the gang members will bicker and eventually split up.Interpol is the tail of the crooks led by a mean tempered zealous policeman who was shot in the rear by one of them previously.It is all very low key like a second rate Fast & Furious film with a few zombie nightmares but with less car action.,Army of Thieves
2,paul_haakonsen,Essentially just a super boring heist movie...,3,30 October 2021,"Wow, the prequel that you never knew would happen and you never really wanted. Now, the 2021 movie ""Army of the Dead"" was somewhat of a swing and a miss, and then comes the follow-up, which actually is a sequel about the character that was one of the least interesting. So this definitely has the ingredients for a smash hit. Right?Wrong.I didn't even know that they were making a prequel before I stumbled upon it by random chance on Netflix. And seeing that it was about Dieter (played by Matthias Schweighöfer), then I wasn't really particularly stoked. But still, I opted to give ""Army of Thieves"" a chance. So I watched it.And felt like I had just effectively wasted a little more than two hours of my life. Wow, this movie was even worse than ""Army of the Dead"". At least ""Army of the Dead"" had zombies in it. ""Army of Thieves"" was just a boring and pointless heist movie. Nothing more, nothing less. And heist movies doesn't really get me worked up.So yeah, the storyline written by Shay Hatten and directed by lead actor Matthias Schweighöfer himself, just didn't bring much entertainment or enjoyment to the table for me. And while I did manage to sit through the entire ordeal, I can honestly say that this is not a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time, nor is it a movie I would recommend you wasting your time or effort on.Sure, they had a good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list here, but it didn't really matter much as the storyline itself fell short of providing me with an entertaining viewing.My rating of ""Army of Thieves"" lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",Army of Thieves
3,Calicodreamin,Meh,5,1 November 2021,"Not bad but not great either, very meh. The safecracking is repetitive and the police chasing was lazy. The movie tried to be self aware but it didn't work. The team lacked chemistry and acting was only okay. Only good thing going is stunning visuals.",Army of Thieves
4,ops-52535,too smooth...,5,1 November 2021,"The plot far too plantastic, or made of plastic, its made for the one who have the ability to switch of every rational thinking, or just for, what plain people call breadheads, cause this is far too superfantastic fiction that even worse than mission impossible. If you like the guts of an old safes lockmechanism, or just admire beautiful safe doors, then see it, for the rest its just a head over heels plot of utopian crime, and all the reasons for me to say so is a 355 list of remarks why much of this is inevitablly impossible. The list can be obtained if you send me a thumbs up.No this was daft, average acted amphetaminethriller on steroids. It has some speed of development and tension, but the cool stuff is blown away on stupid jokes and elementary scriptglitches. Also a evaluation of the cast could be a good idea if they sequelize it further on to salvage the safe that where dumped on the sea in the start of the film...productionwise its not a bad flick, and cams and editing do raise a bit of caracter of craftmanshipi may be grumpy and old, but this was like being profoundly in love with a pandoras box to view, its macho made but with a boyscout cubs outcome.",Army of Thieves
5,kwenchow,"Another worst action film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Not recommended!",1,2 November 2021,"This film start with a man ""Dieter"" doing video log, and he telling a story scene! As turnout, this film is about a safecracker ""Dieter"" need to team up with a famous thief ""Gwendoline"" to crack, and rob three vaults! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the yelling scene, overuse of the cracking safe scene, overuse of the chasing scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the narration scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, and overuse of the flashbacks scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have blood, and thing broken at certain point, but overall quite shaky, messy, and occur in too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Dieter recruit by Scott after escape from the police help by Gwendoline! That's it! Another disappointed film!",Army of Thieves
6,Pairic,Zombie Lite Bank Caper,7,1 November 2021,"Army of Thieves: Zombie Lite prequel to Army of the Dead. Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) the ace safe-cracker in AOTD is a mild mannered bank clerk who has a fascination with safes. He's recruited by bank robber/jewel thief (Gwendoline Starr) to crack 3 famous safes, one of which is in Las Vegas. This is set at the start of the Zombie Apocalypse, we see Zombies going wild on TV News including devouring a reporter live on air but it's very much in the background of this heist caper. Some good action sequences during the robberies and chases, a touch of romance with betrayals thrown in. Jonathan Cohen is good as Delacroix, an Interpol agent who comes across as a more demented and violent Inspector Clouseau. Nothing really original but good fun. Might have been a better film if the running time had been cut by 15 minutes. Directed by Matthias Schweighöfe, Written by Shay Hatten and Zack Snyder. On Netflix. 7/10.",Army of Thieves
7,andrewchristianjr,MUCH MORE FUN.,8,2 November 2021,"This was much more fun. Doesn't take itself too (at all) seriously, and takes us all on a very entertaining ride. The imagery of the out and insides of the safes, and location sets were excellent. But the entire film was nothing spectacular or we haven't already seen in a heist film. The directing, cinematography and casting & performances were great, but it was the infantile cheesy writing that just didn't do it for me. The entire love/jealousy dynamics was predictable and too overbearing for a heist film.",Army of Thieves
8,arungeorge13,"No big surprises here - it's a heist film, minus the zombies! [+52%]",5,29 October 2021,"With a fairly predictable plot and one-dimensional characters, Army of Thieves (Army, it definitely isn't!) proves to be an easy heist flick to watch; one that feels 20-25 minutes too long. The Ludwig Dieter origin story is everything you'd expect it to be: this works both in favor of and against the film. The cast, barring the lead duo of Matthias Schweighöfer and Nathalie Emmanuel, is a disappointing blend of misses (than hits). Also, the essential part of a heist film is the tension it manages to raise during the heist scenes - here, it's all a piece of cake - no scenes that make you go OMG! To add some more time to the process, Dieter (or Sebastian, his original name) keeps explaining stories about a locksmith that really has zero payoffs in the plot. Or at least, the film makes you feel that way!The safe-cracking scenes with all their sophisticated bolts and fulcrums get increasingly tiresome to sit through as they serve nothing more than one more ""yaay!"" moment. There are no zombies (the outbreak has just begun in the U. S, but the film's set in Europe) that foil anyone's plans - except in repetitive nightmare sequences. Yet, I wouldn't say that the film is unwatchable. It falls within the okayish but ultimately forgettable Netflix filmography. The film does look good and is a decent effort as a straightforward heist flick (the laughs are terribly lacking) with a tinge of romance, but it is little else. Dieter, as a character, was fun in Army of the Dead, though a spin-off wasn't all that necessary.",Army of Thieves
9,Xstal,A Troupe of Unsafe Crackers & Misfits...,6,28 October 2021,"A prequel but no equal, though it certainly had potential, but the second half sets off the alarm, as the clock counts down without precision or charm - 'bloody doors not blown off', as they should be in all good heist capers.",Army of Thieves
10,gianmarcoronconi,Beautiful,10,6 November 2021,"This film is a marvel, it's simple and beautiful, and manages to entertain the most from start to finish. This film proves that with a little sympathy and a good plot it is not difficult to make a good film. It really manages to make you anxious and curious about how the story can proceed.",Army of Thieves
11,IonicBreezeMachine,"Anchored by strong direction and performance from Matthias Schweighöfer, Army of Thieves is a playfully fun heist thriller that uses its parts to good effect.",7,7 November 2021,"Sebastian Schlencht-Wöhnert (Matthias Schweighöfer) is a quiet introverted bank teller with a lonely mundane life who in his spare time practices safecracking and making YouTube vdeos about it that no one ever watches. After making a video discussing four legendary safes made by tragic safe designer Hans Wagner, Sebastian is recruited by Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel), a master pickpocket, to showcase his safecracking skills in an underground tournament that Sebastian effortlessly wins. Gwendoline introduces Sebastian to her team of thieves consisting of hacker Korina (Ruby O. Fee), get away driver Rolph (Guz Khan), and team leader Brad Cage (Stuart Martin) who inform him they know the locations of three of the Hans Wagner safes and need Sebastian's skills to crack them while the distraction of the emerging zombie apocalypse provides their window of opportunity. Sebastian jumps at the chance to tackle these legendary ""puzzles"" and the group sets off to find them. Meanwhile INTEPROL agent Delacroix (Jonathan Cohen) is hot on the teams trail and plans to take them down.Prior to the release of Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead it was announced that supporting character Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) would be the center of a prequel/spin-off to be produced by Snyder and directed by Schweighöfer. Filmed during the final months of 2020, the movie was meant to expand Army of the Dead to a franchise along with anime spin-off Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas and the forthcoming Army of the Dead sequel (tentatively titled Planet of the Dead at this point). Schweighöfer has a history of directing himself in local German productions with the comedy films What a Man (2011), Joy of Fatherhood (2014), and The Manny (2015) and has even ventured into TV with the thriller series You Are Wanted. Army of Thieves marks Schweighöfer's first foray into large scale productions and shows a promising chance at crossing over to international appeal with his humor and likability as a lead and his surehandedness behind the camera.The movie hits all the expected beats familiar to the heist film with your plannings, flashforwards, betrayals, misdirections, and etc., but Schweighöfer's direction and Shay Hatten's script play with the tropes by using the familiarity of the premise for humor in contrast to Schweighöfer's performance. The scenes where Sebastian is cracking the safes while playing Richard Wagner's music is really well done with nice intercutting of the tumblers inside the safe as well as crosscutting to the other team members buying their time in a manner that makes the sequences thrilling but also playful and fun. In a way I was reminded of the 1964 film Topkapi where like Army of Thieves, the heist elements were played fairly straight while Peter Ustinov's Arthur Simon Simpson (for which Ustinov won an Oscar) served as a sort of comic chaos agent in the mix. Matthias Schweighöfer takes an approach similar to that of Ustinov's Arthur Simon Simpson and it's a really strong performance that works well as both an underdog we can root for as well as a comic presence with some terrific moments such as a bicycle chase in Prague that is a fantastic sequence.Army of Thieves doesn't reinvent the heist film formula, but thanks to some engaging banter, tight direction, and some legitimately funny moments, Army of Thieves not only makes for fun entertainment but also serves as a showcase for the mainstream appeal of Matthias Schweighöfer as a director and leading man.",Army of Thieves
12,MadamWarden,THEFT OF MY TIME!,4,8 November 2021,"Honestly, I wanted to enjoy this but the acting, script and plot were wholly pedestrian. Not mildly amusing nor exciting.A largely unappetizing hour and a bit of my life gone.",Army of Thieves
13,thekarmicnomad,A dose of messy fun,7,8 November 2021,"This has an interesting idea for a story with a good cast and some quirky characters.This film has some really good set pieces and a fair amount of action and drama but is quite often very silly.It is good fun but when you think back to what happened a lot of it is quite dumb - overall though I think the level of production, acting and writing elevates it beyond what it is.Real life safe-cracking is undoubtedly as boring as real life computer-hacking so lots of CGI gears and springs help build up the visual spectacle of the main character at work. This is mixed in with the mythology of the safes.The actual heists are interesting in parts but just plain stupid in other parts. One of the heists they basically just ring up and ask the bank to let them in -and they do.The characters are good fun leaning heavily on stereotypes. I especially found the overly driven, angry police guy pretty funny.In all this is a good fun film that is well acted and executed - but by the end I felt like I had had my fill of these guys.",Army of Thieves
14,Holt344,"Army of Thieves is a flawed yet very entertaining heist film, a great prequel - My Ultimate Review",7,30 October 2021,"Zack Snyder serves as a producer and co-writer for the prequel to his Army of the Dead which is titled Army of Thieves, but the screenplay is written by Shay Hatten who was behind John Wick 3 and its sequels but of course serving as a co-writer for Army of the Dead. But Snyder leaves the director duties to Matthias Schweighöfer who was a stand out star in the original who also who reprises his role as Ludwig Dieter, alongside a supporting cast that includes Nathalie Emmanuel and a couple of lesser known actors like Ruby O. Fee, Stuart Martin, Guz Khan and Jonathan Cohen.Deborah Snyder described the film perfectly as similar to The Italian Job in a world where zombies exist, while explaining that the film is standalone in nature. The producer classified the genre as a romantic comedy heist film that canonically depicts the early stages of the zombie pandemic portrayed in the previous film; stating: "" it takes place in a world where these zombies exist in America and it's causing instability in the banking institutions. They're moving money around, so it's the perfect opportunity for a heist."" The film focuses on German safecracker Ludwig Dieter leading a group of aspiring thieves on a top secret heist during the early stages of the zombie apocalypse, and showing how he learned to crack safes with previous heist teams.Army of Thieves is a good addition to the heist genre, though a very entertaining movie the problem I think many are having is how the film isn't taking itself very seriously and that means some of the logic takes a backseat. The director knows it and thus he could make an entertaining film that will make you happy. Matthias Schweighöfer's direction is absolutely fantastic, showing he's a promising upcoming director. His performance as Ludwig Dieter is also terrific, fleshing out the character and making him even better than he was in Army of the Dead. Matthias Schweighöfer is truly the reason why this movie works so well. The editing and pacing is perfect, making each scene entertaining. Something on the negative side is of course parts of the screenplay isn't that great and most of the characters are cliched. Some of Shay Hatten's writing is flawed. Though the musical score is great, the sound editing isn't quite on the same level. About the acting, both Matthias Schweighöfer and Nathalie Emmanuel are great in this film is great. The rest are either underused or just bad, Stuart Martin and Jonathan Cohen's performances were flawed regarding their over-acting.I also want to add that Matthias Schweighöfer is the best thing that Army of Thieves has to offer, his direction is aligned with Zack Snyder's vision and own style which shows how much he learned of him. But he brings his own touch on the direction and dare I say, it's brilliant. Army of Thieves is a nice addition to the Army franchise, but it has its flaws. But overall an entertaining heist film.",Army of Thieves
15,bob-the-movie-man,A surprising quirky rom-com heist movie,8,2 November 2021,"I have Covid-19, and am confined to quarters. So with the big screen out of reach, time to catch up on some streaming films. New on Netflix is ""Army of Thieves"", a quirky prequel, of sorts, to Zac Snyder's ""Army of the Dead"".Positives:
I really wasn't expecting much from this offering. For me, the character of Dieter in ""Army of the Dead"" was an annoyingly quirky comedy character in a zombie-actioner that you just wanted to punch in the face.... repeatedly. But in contrast, this Dieter-centric film is deliberately quirky throughout and it just all worked for me. Under his own direction, Schweighöfer's Sebastian/Dieter becomes a genuinely quirky, lovelorn and loveable loser that you want to root for.The look and feel of the film is utterly glorious. The wonderful cinematography by Bernhard Jasper makes the introduction to the European locations feel Bond-like and the combination of Production Design and Special Effects make the safe-cracking scenes tense, dynamic and beautiful to watch. It's all nicely rounded off by a quirky Steve Mazzaro / Hans Zimmer score.Shay Hatten's script delivers a nice balance of action and exposition. It actually - shock horror - takes time to flesh out some character behind the generic heist-movie stereotypes. Setting the movie in the same timeline as the emerging Nevada zombie-apocalypse as ""Army of the Dead"" is neat: (although those expecting extensive zombie-action will feel short-changed). And having the Las Vegas safe as the mythical Götterdämmerung is a nice touch. Above all - ""SURPRISE!!!"" - the script surpassed the essential six-laughs test.The acting is above par, with Schweighöfer putting in a fabulous turn and the stunningly beautiful Nathalie Emmanuel (best known for being Ramsey in the Fast and Furious series) gets to be a lot more than mere window-dressing here. Stuart Martin is notable here for looking astonishingly like Hugh Jackman.... I mean, really, they could be twins.Negatives:
I mean, honestly, there are more holes in this story than a St Moritz swiss-cheese. Why would all of the safes, owned by different private institutions, be being ""decommissioned"" due to a Zombie outbreak on the other side of the world? Can the Interpol team really be that incompetent? And however clever he is, I don't buy that you can open safes like that!Although I liked the balance of the script overall, the story is pretty simplistic and linear.Summary Thoughts on ""Army of Thieves"": Sometimes a little movie appears that surprises and delights you, and this was one of those for me. It's not big and it's not clever. But it is very nicely made, thoroughly entertained me and was - for me - way better than its source movie. A recommended watch on Netflix.(For the full graphical review, check out the #onemannsmovies written/video reviews online. Thanks.)",Army of Thieves
16,HabibieHakim123,A Prequel That More Exciting And Better Than The Original,10,30 October 2021,"It's pretty rare for me as of right now for a prequel to be more exciting and way much better than the original, director and actor Matthias Schweighöfer is surprisingly can not only managed the acting (so do the other) and the direction but the visual, the cinematography, it's fantastic, it's superb, Army Of Thieves is a fun ride, it's a pleasant surprise and it's worth to watch, overall, Army Of Thieves is one of the most entertaining movie in 2021.",Army of Thieves
17,kuarinofu,I don't know what's happening,3,30 October 2021,"Ok, let me get deep into this.In this movie, the world works very differently, so it's almost impossible to understand why something happened the way it did.The same problem is reflected in the motivation of the characters. I could never understand why they do the things they do. Even though almost all of the details in the film were served up in long, boring monologues, many things still remained unclear. A group of supposed ""misfits"" who dress like Fortnite characters play roles from Deadpool while taking it way too seriously. If the main character was more or less comprehensible, and by the end of the movie even somewhat matured, got stronger and changed, all the others were not really characters at all.The main character, having no prior practice, easily opens all locks without the use of additional tools in a limited time. His motivation is supposedly loneliness and an attempt to find friends who are just as weird as he is, that's ok.His crush is a rich, beautiful and successful woman who had her heart broken and she realized that she enjoys stealing other people's things, okay, that makes more or less sense too.The hacker teen is a computer genius, and yet she dresses and acts like she just learned how to use Instagram. 90% of her motivation is money, but at the very end her brother, for whom she is supposedly doing all this, jumps out of nowhere. And it seems like everybody besides the viewer knows this.The Cage man is a satirized version of a man-baby with serious issues accumulated through his childhood. His motivation is his manliness and money, but the last one again vanishes in the end.As for the driver-guy, eating is his only identity.And here comes the weirdest part. With that kind of implausible capability and talent set, I'm not sure they need the whole safe-cracking thing at all. They could make money in other ways, and it's not like they have a bad life at all. If they were all motivated by the crush, what did she offer them? Why did they become a team so easily, why do they even need a team if they're doing so well as it is? I have no idea.There was never a team dynamic between them as well. I don't know how many times I thought about the Oceans series while watching this. Just imagining how cool it would be if they would actually interact if they were connected in any way.So at this point, I cannot buy the existence of these characters and the things they do in such a comedic world.Then comes the dialogue. It was either boring or annoying explanations. Many times the characters politely ask each other to explain things bluntly because this is how people work.The acting in this film hurt me mentally. Sebastian's (Ludwig's) awkwardness and screaming got old very fast. The GoT girl who played the crush acted like she had zero interest in what was going on. With the manliest man being always angry, everyone else didn't do a great job either.I intentionally avoided the Interpol guy because I'm trying to block off the memories about his scenes. The Interpol woman had her nametag shown but she wasn't involved in the story at all. I wanted to mention that Interpol doesn't work like they've shown it in the film, but in a world, they've created - everything is possible. The funniest part about this guy was that he suddenly got very serious in the end.On the producing side of the film, it's way too long, for one thing, follows a very basic structure of heist scene - long talks and nonsensical decisions - heist scene - ... And since all the safe-cracking scenes are the same, it does get boring quite fast.The overall look of the production and the involvement of Hans Zimmer were the only two redeeming qualities since the film did look and sound beautiful. Even the weak dramatic scenes triggered half an emotion inside me because of the score. The absence of Zack Snyder as a DoP saved my eyes from bleeding bokeh though.The comedic element of the film made me feel like I am lying dead in my grave. Although I chuckled once at the end when Ludwig tried to hit the manliest man.To sum it up, I thought Army of the Dead wasn't great. Ludwig's character was the best part of it because he worked within the group. As for the Army of Thieves, I don't know why it was made. It's so random, unfunny, long, and tedious. It tires to be Deadpool, Ocean's Eleven, Shaun of the Dead, but ends up just a random mess of well-produced things. As I think about it, even the title doesn't make sense.",Army of Thieves
18,Movi3DO,No one wants this,5,30 October 2021,"Who cares about zombies, it's time to crack some safes.A prequel that I'm not sure who asked for. The story of Ludwig Dieter and his journey to crack three of the most famous safes in the world.Army of the Dead was an alright film but at least the zombies and actions were pretty cool. Army of Thieves didn't have a lot of that, but its strong point was the look of the safes. When Ludwig opened the safes, the sequences of the machinery in the safes were clean. The heist was super straightforward, and at one point the characters made fun of a common trope in many heist movies. It's funny but also ironic because this movie is exactly that: just a bunch of common tropes.The weakest point of the movie was the characters. Ludwig was kinda fun at times, but he became annoying whenever he tried to explain the mythologies behind the safes' designs. Man I just could not care less about anything he said. It's mostly yada yada yada and then rotate some locks. All three safes were pretty much the same, and *a little bit spoiler* opening them felt like doing chores for our safecrackers. Those sequence had almost zero tension.The other characters were also boring. None of them were special and I didn't buy their relationship at all.Overall, this was less fun than Army of the Dead. Apparently there will be a sequel to Army of the Dead. Great. 5/10.",Army of Thieves
19,Neptune165,I really don't like prequels like this,4,8 November 2021,"I had a wierd feeling watching this. As a stand alone movie this would be much better i think, mby then they could make a second movie, but now, they can't because we know what happened to the main character. It just didn't go together with zombie movie. Mby im wrong... It's just hard to watch it knowing what happened to him and how important role he had in the second movie. Full of unnecessary storylines and mindblowingly lame things. Like THERE IS A LOVESTORY BETWEEN 2 ZOMBIES AND THEY EVEN HAVE A BABY! Do zombies have to do with anything. Throw something random in that has nothing to do with the story. What cop would let go a bank robber just cause another bank robber says so??! This movie was incredibly boring and the ""heists"" amount to nothing more than ""sneak down to the vault room and open the vaults by listening to clicks"" while cutting to CGI vault internal shots as seemingly no one guards the bank. The characters have a few nice moments but as a heist movie it is dreadful.",Army of Thieves
20,bshaef,Army is an entertaining movie,9,3 November 2021,From beginning to end. Characters are awesome and the pace of the story is exactly right. Everyone associated with this effort deserves an A+. Won't win any Academy Awards but it sure held my attention. Thank you Netflix and the Germans who made the movie.,Army of Thieves
21,Stanlee107,Heist to meet you or Nicholas Pitt?!,5,30 October 2021,"For a prequel to a famous film, I did not know what to expect. It is a fun film that lacks the action packed and zombie driven storyline of the first one. It has moments of comedy but it is just another heist movie that promises more than it could deliver. The heist could be a golden catch but inevitably it fails in the final steps of the great escape...The zombie element is a new addition but threatens to emerge from the ground or backdrop. It may peak out in the back ground but it sadly does not surface.",Army of Thieves
22,danielmanson,Better than Army of the Dead,7,30 October 2021,"I'll be honest I was not a fan of Army of the Dead at all. So I had absolutely no expectations watching this and I have to say it is much better than I thought it would be. They also picked one of the better characters to do a prequel on also.It has some problems don't get me wrong. I thought it was quite predictable at times and the plot never really went out of its way to surprise you. I was also a little surprised by the amount of action involved, what I mean by this is that there wasn't much. However the film did really keep my interest and the suspense was built well.The characters i thought on the whole were very good. I think they missed a trick on a couple of them. The driver in particular. He had a good sense of humour and was likeable, but he just wasn't really in the film enough to make any sort of impact. But overall they did a good job of making these heist people really likeable and making you root for them.The ending was much better also. I thought the ending of Army of the Dead was absolutely awful, but this rounded up significantly better. In terms of prequels the ending was spot on.But yeah, overall I'll give it a 7/10. I ultimately enjoyed watching it, the characters were fun and I was intrigued the entire time. Sure it's absolutely not going to blow your socks off, but it's entertaining and much MUCH better than Army of the Dead. Feel like they learnt from the mistakes a bit.",Army of Thieves

24,theknownames,"Cast, vibe, setting",8,5 November 2021,"Wonderful cast , the whole production is quite engaging , it's a decent story and the visuals are 'dope' .. Now that Hollywood is going for apocalyptic, this demonstrates what's possible . Sure it all that lacks the grit and emotion of what we are used to but anyway , this is fresh for what it is and doesn't need grit Most certainly it's the why , Why do a prequel why care about these characters; the why leaves space for what's possible these days in this genre (s)
This is as sort of heist meets prolog meets character development and stands alone without the next film .... I get it . I like it , we are just not quite there yet ... however this quite a feat . It's intriguing as to why this director ( who I believe is established and credible ) decided to make these films . There is certainly no lack of entertainment or production value . It just has a lot to stand next to in terms of these type of movies. Maybe making the genre more accessible .",Army of Thieves

26,DLochner,Boring heist movie with boring dialogues,6,8 November 2021,"You get the feeling that an artificial intelligence has evaluated the best dialogues in film history and tried to bring them together in this film. The story seems artificial and not very believable. You tried to be funny or not to take yourself seriously, but unfortunately that didn't work.

Not sure if it's just me but their was absolute no onscreen chemistry between none of the cast. The lead German actor came off forced with no authenticity to his character at all, GOT Missandei was great eye candy but seem out of place for her role, and the rest of the heist team and supporting cast just didn't seem to fit and story was senseless.

28,vjnambu,An unnecessary prequel,7,2 November 2021,"After watching army of thieves(after also watching army of the dead), you will wonder what's the purpose of this film. Nor its plot contributes anything to the franchise nor any character is hinted to appear in future. Ludwig was not such a great character to get a standalone film.The characters are flat, narration is straightforward and the heist sequences don't have any tension. The safecracking scenes were good to watch.On the whole, army of thieves is the tokyo drift of the zombie franchise.",Army of Thieves
29,W011y4m5,Give it a chance...,8,7 November 2021,"Considering I really didn't like the amateurish ""Army of The Dead"" (which is by far Zack Snyder's worst ever film to date), it's fair to say I went in to this prequel with fairly low expectations, wondering as to how / why Netflix would ever wish to expand upon such a weak story I found thoroughly disappointing / irritatingly lacklustre the first time... Thus, bearing in mind the total lack of enthusiasm I had prior to seeing it for myself, I'm shocked to say that despite my grievances with the prior installment in this growing franchise (which left a bitter taste in my mouth, admittedly), ""Army of Thieves"" is extremely brilliant & a very pleasant stand-alone surprise, surpassing those aforementioned expectations I had by an absolute mile.The movie's genuinely fun throughout, timed meticulously in the edit by Alexander Berner, has an outstanding musical score from Hans Zimmer & Steve Mazzaro, is visually cohesive & inventive, lensed by the incredibly talented cinematographer Bernhard Jasper (who easily proves how depriving ""Army of The Dead"" of a professional director of photography was an unforgivable creative decision - the difference in aesthetic quality is brazen here); all teams involved in the production bring their absolute A-game in their respective fields of expertise, resulting in a feature which (though not a faultless masterpiece) satisfyingly just *works* competently.In particular, there are some excellently choreographed & shot set pieces & it boasts an endearingly quirky sense of humour - which had me physically belly laughing on numerous occasions (similar in style to the entertaining awkwardness of Phoebe Waller Bridge's ""Fleabag"") - all whilst retaining a real sense of heart, grounding the story firmly in its characters, who are well developed & realised, each one with their own individual arcs / progressions which draw to a natural conclusion by the time we reach the end credits sequence.It's a solid outing in the ""Armyverse"" & a much needed answer as to why it's required. Hopefully this marks the beginning of something more promising. My hopes are now higher.",Army of Thieves

After watching it, I felt like I had effectively wasted more than two hours of my life. A prequel to Army of the Dead that has less zombies and more Wagner.The film follows Sebastian (Matthias Schweighöfer), a mild mannered bank teller with his own YouTube channel detailing the best safes in the world to crack.

38,robawalker-77417,Good prequel,7,1 November 2021,This movie actually served as a pretty neat prequel to Army of The Dead with his own story.

I actually thought it was a good movie.,Army of Thieves
39,royhectorkabanlit,Shallow and Mediocre,4,3 November 2021,"I found it to be Cliched, Shallow and full of Gimmicks. The Movie basically relied on Cliches and Gimmicks one after the other to make itself ""endearing"". It tries so hard that it shows, and in a bad way.It is also quite Shallow, relying almost entirely on Plot Armor just to get thing thru. For example, why was Sebastian so good at breaking Safes despite the fact that he only does it only as a Hobby, to the point that he breaks the greatest Safes in the World on more or less his first try?This was never explained satisfactorily in the Movie, it just was so. We just see him go out and listens to the Safes while turning the Wheels, and that was it. As I said, SHALLOW.About the only good thing I liked about it were the Settings as the Movie goes around to various Countries in Europe. Quite a Mediocre Movie, not for me.",Army of Thieves
40,Spartan_1_1_7,"Oddly enough, this was a much better experience than Army of the Dead.",6,1 November 2021,"Army of Thieves (2021) is an unexpected but welcome surprise. It's a prequel to Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead and focuses on the character of Ludwig Dieter, the genius safecracker, who is recruited by a group of thieves for his expertise on several high-level heists.Now, I did not like Army of the Dead so it's weird that the main actor i.e Matthias Schweighöfer himself directed this movie and it's a lot more competently made and enjoyable than what Zack Snyder did with a Vegas zombie movie...Anyway, the group of thieves is a cliched but entertaining lot as is a lot of elements in the movie. There is a good level of self-awareness that pokes fun at the heist genre and at itself while doing the said things it is poking fun at. Sure it's not consistent throughout nor is it well-executed all the time but it does work for a lot of the movie and that made it enjoyable.Ludwig Dieter was one of the few ""characters"" from Army of the Dead that I did like so getting to know A LOT more of him was genuinely interesting. Matthias Schweighöfer gave a fun and endearing performance that makes you care for him and while I'm not a genius nor am I socially awkward of that level, he was still oddly relatable.The mythology surrounding and involving the safes that were to be targeted and the appreciation for the craftmanship by Dieter was another thing that I quite enjoyed in the movie. Gave it an extra edge over typical heist movies as well as the fact that there are three instead of the usual one. The sacrifice had to be made for less meat on individual heists, though.The cinematography was dynamic and pretty good. The soundtrack was pleasing and had some great tracks that fitted the material of the movie well.Yeah, there are flaws and some stupid stuff, particularly in the third act but compared to Army of the Dead, it's nowhere near as bad that it ruins the movie.Overall, it was a fun time, much better than expected since I was going in with Army of the Dead level of expectations. The main character is engaging and the group is fun enough. Also, the Interpol side of things was stupid and hilarious and I loved it. Whether you liked Army of the Dead or not, I'd recommend giving this a watch, it's certainly better. Not an amazing movie by any means but gets the job done. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6.5/10.",Army of Thieves
41,isaacochoterena,Very implausible,4,29 October 2021,"This movie is full of cliches and doesn't have a lot of action.This prequel fails to want to give an appropriate introduction to a character from the main film, there is no development of why he is good at what he does and why he does it, the story of this film is full of cliches and predictable things, there is no good character development, the romance between two characters is not well developed, there are many conveniences, incongruities and it is very implausible, the action scenes are not convincing, there is no concrete motivation of secondary characters to do what they are doing, the performances are not convincing and the essence of the protagonist that he has in the original film is not reflected in this one. The highlights are the scenes where the inside of the safe is seen, the tension that exists when they are about to be caught and the motivation of the main character to do that is clear.The film does not manage to define its genre or what it wants to imply, if it is an introductory film to a character or a story to be exploited more in the future, it can become entertaining and sometimes funny but only because of the implausible and non-logical situations that the characters go through.",Army of Thieves

While it definitely had its corny and cheesy moments, I was pleasantly surprised by how fun, entertaining, and unique it was.Unfortunately, this prequel is everything I expected Army of the Dead to be. The dialogue is eye-rolling bad (""Did you just say 'gulp'?""). Where Dieter's strange genius complimented other strong and entertaining characters in a comedic and interesting way, he becomes just annoying and uncharismatic as the lead. Not even Emmanuel's and Fee's strong performances could carry this script.

The zombie part is again totally unnecessary and has no relation to the story that should be cut, why does every movie has to put zombies in it? It's just tediously boring and unconvincing, as they were solely added to connect the second part of the movie army of dead which was a terrible movie. Also as most of the movies wrongly depict, the Interpol does not operate and pursue criminals with guns blazing, they do not have the jurisdiction they only provide intel at the back. The ending is as well kind of disappointing as it was made to connect the sequel.",Army of Thieves
48,BijeshNagesh,A Deceptively Good Thrill,7,1 November 2021,"It's been a while since a 'heist' movie began with a genuinely human storyline, particularly the flashback involving Wagner and his ingenious safes, and how he created one that ended up serving as his tomb.The safes in ""Army of Thieves"" Netflix were Das Rheingold, Die Walküre (The Valkyrie), and The Siegfried. The film starred and directed Matthias Schweighöfer, which I found surprising and admirable. He played Sebastian Schlencht-Wöhnert - whose self-created fictional comic-book character Ludwig Dieter later inspired a name-change. Sebastian was casually funny, and was great fun to watch. He did an outstanding job directing this title.Musical scoring also took me by mild surprise. In addition to Steve Mazzaro, Hans Zimmer was part of this team. Bernhard Jasper's cinematography was good - he captured some interesting shots. Christian Eisele's production design complemented Martin Vackár's art direction, and both their efforts highlighted the simple-subtle costume design choices by Stephanie Portnoy Porter. The entire VFX team made the movie work in more ways than one. The stunt department also took to the project with vim and vigour.A secret safe-cracking contest led Sebastian to a group of robbery specialists. The film deceptively redefined the adage 'there is no honour among thieves'. Other performers too played their roles to authentic effect. The core team Ruby O. Fee as Korina (the hacker with a penchant for DJ'ing), Nathalie Emmanuel as Gwendoline (the recruiter and leader), Stuart Martin as Alexis ""Brad Cage"" (the muscle and distraction), Guz Khan as Rolph (the getaway driver with expert drifter skills), all delivered.The safes they're about to crack were owned by Bly Tanaka (played by Hiroyuki Sanada) who featured in ""Army of the Dead"". Then there's the incompetent detective tasked with capturing the thieves Delacroix (played by Jonathan Cohen). One of his team members was Beatrix (played by Noémie Nakai).Zack Snyder created the characters in this film. Scripting kudos for the story goes to him and Shay Hatten. The latter handled the screenplay. The plot turned out wonderful, neat, elegant, and adventurous in Zack and Shay's hands.They marginally connected the plotline to Snyder's ""Army of the Dead"". You don't need to watch both to appreciate either, but fans are certain to get a kick out of the link. Netflix's ""Army of Thieves"" laid the foundation for how and why Sebastian even became part of the ""Army of the Dead"" script - the final safe, the Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods), featured in ""Dead"". Also, Sebastian's zombie nightmares in ""Thieves"" were fun, almost a foreshadowing of things to come in ""Dead"".I admit the movie flowed 'easy' with no true conflict in it. Sebastian's theoretical mastery with safe-cracking was the major highlight as he applied his skills with nerdy passion during each 'crack'. Also, visuals of what went on inside the safes as wheels, cylinders, and cogs tumbled into place were given more prominence than any 'edge of your seat' mistakes and escapes, of which there were few. Regardless...""Army of Thieves"" was a great movie to watch, all two hours of it. I liked that the purpose of each heist was prioritized around the fact they could actually pull it off rather than just get rich off doing so. The movie contained plenty of thrills and deceptions, as well as a good share of action, comedy, attraction, and friendship angles. They tackled not just one but three global bank heists, adding to the sheer excitement value. This Netflix movie makes for a great weekend watch-party.",Army of Thieves

I enjoyed the story, the build up and the execution, I was so into the inside of the safe cgi moments they felt hypnotic.The cast were great, thought gus was a fun addition, only boring character was cage, who was just a dull cliched alpha male type who was nothing special.If you didn't like the first, try this, it's so much better and just a really good film that's a few genres rather than a specific one, not enough action to be action, nor comedy to be a comedy and nowhere enough drama.Only two downsides were the girl turning on the crew that quickly, felt out of character and although using the family threat I just felt it was lazy, also the way the police located seb on YouTube, anyone who knows anything about that platform knows a video with 1 view ain't showing up without a lot of searching, that again was lazy.My one major shock was Natalie Emmanuel, who I think is a really overrated actress, in hollyoaks she was poor, average in GOT and has landed huge movies whilst never impressing at all, bar being pretty and mixed race I didn't get why. In this film she was brilliant, funny, tough and owned the lead role, was her best performance in anything I've seen her do!",Army of Thieves

There wasn't anything super unique happening here and the fact that some random guy was able to crack the most intricate safes in the world without any tools whatsoever seemed more than a little far fetched. The main issue I had with this movie was the zombies, they acted at times like they weren't part of this film but then threw them in at random moments almost as if to say ""we are aware this is why we have an audience so here is what you want"".

So my humble opinion is that no mater how u consider the positioning of this movie, it is a successful one.If I come to my senses n really need'a be picky, I'd erase the little romance of the story coz it makes the plot line off-track a little bit. But for what it's worth, that's kinda super minor and that a little romance isn't a real drawback of the whole story. It just isn't that big deal n it mustn't become the core of the movie theme.The sense of humour isn't the cup of tea for everyone, granted. However, the German sense of humour is by all means an expected component of a weirdo safecracker. Dig it.The ending isn't perfect. Personally I think we need Army of Thieves ""TWO"" to fill the gap. You know, AOT and AOD are not so well linked. Lots of missing links there.I definitely wound recommend my friends to watch it. Frankly, the theme is rare n intriguing and the pace is tense.

Which also makes this so much more of a head scratcher as to why they decided to do a prequel to Army of the Dead and focus on a sub-character, the safecracker. Why focus on him? Even the importance of the safe they hit in Army of the Dead isn't really touched on compared to Army of Thieves.There's too much missing from the story as a whole to fully appreciate what Zack Synder as created.

I was going to skip Army of Thieves despite knowing its not another zombie movie, I reconsidered after watching a few early reviews. I'm glad I gave Army of Thieves a shot, its way better than Army of the Dead!The acting is good, I don't think anyone is bad. Matthias Schweighofer is the lead and director which is impressive. I'm a huge movie fan so someone headlining and directing a film is noteworthy like Sylvester Stallone. The characters are nicely developed but maybe some people feel they're bland.The film is lighthearted so some people will call it a caper. The humor works in fact I laughed out loud a few times. One aspect is Dieter being nerdy. I'm really shy so I guess I'm nerdy too.The film has heist film tropes like planning and flashbacks but they're done well. I guess you can say the film only uses the essential tropes. The story has a few turns so its not extremely predictable.

72,hifiman-62270,Fun movie,7,30 October 2021,Slick. Fun. Well acted enjoyed this heist movie. Nice backstory leading into army of the dead...not a zombie movie at all........more a fun heist movie. Worth a watch.,Army of Thieves
73,lumieretrain,Army of Thieves by Matthias Schweighöfer,7,30 October 2021,"Developing a prequel of a story, is one of the most interesting concepts to be made; especially to see how everything started, before the events of the main story have occurred, by even exploring in a much detailed way about some of the main characters from the main story and how their motives have pushed to arrive where they got. Even it can be intriguing to develop a prequel, it can be also a great risk to use the elements from the main story needed for the prequel, as the authors have to make sure to not use those elements in a disappointing way; especially by making sure to not distort the story arc, or even with the events to not connect with each other. But it can become also a great success, when the essential elements of the story will be used in a proper way, to have created a surprising story filled with unexpected plot twists to be workable. During the production of the movie Army of the Dead by Zack Snyder, there was also in development in a quick way the prequel of the movie. Usually it would take some time on developing a prequel of a movie, especially to see how the story is going to be different from the main one, by always maintaining the essential elements told from the main story. But it seems the filmmakers knew immediately what kind of story they wanted to tell, without having any issues of delay in the production. This time Zack Snyder remains as co-producer and co-writer of the story, by letting Matthias Schweighöfer to be the director besides the main character of the story, which also marks his directorial debut. In 2021 came out Army of Thieves by Matthias Schweighöfer with Matthias Schweighöfer, Nathalie Emmanuel, Ruby O. Fee, Guz Khan, Stuart Martin, Jonathan Cohen and Noémi Nakai. The movie's plot: Years before the events of Army of the Dead, the German safecracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) is in his early days of safecracking; as he publishes unpopular YouTube videos about safecracking, while he works as a bank teller which makes him feel lonely. His life will change when the mysterious Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) gives him the opportunity, to take part of a group of thieves to commit top secret heist, while the zombie apocalypse starts to slowly outbreak. Since the announcement of the movie and how it will be different from Army of the Dead, it has been left the audience, the fans of the filmmaker Zack Snyder and the critics full of curiosity on how the result will come out. Especially by announcing the movie being more a heist story, while it maintains the zombie references which brings to the movie Army of the Dead. Indeed the movie entertains the audience, with thrilling moments filled with humor, action and adventure, by including romantic moments which are essential for the story. The production designer Christian Eisele has created settings which make clear the movie's atmospheres, which balance the humorous and the dynamism of the story; at the same time the settings change to show how the main character is evolving internally, since his involvement with the heist. The costume designer Stephanie Portnoy Porter has created the costumes which fit with the shape and the colors of the characters, which also connect with the emotions of the characters and how they will move on when they will face some of the most dangerous moments of the story. The editor Alexander Berner has elaborated the narration's rhythm which makes clear how the story will be told from the beginning to the end; by letting the humor work with the rhythm which will let the audience laugh, at the same time the editing has been elaborated with a rhythm which will elevate the tension to the audience, in some of the most thrilling moments of the story. The visual effects have been elaborated to let the audience see on the screen some of the specific details, when the main character proceeds with safecracking and to see how all the mechanics work to be opened. The score by Hans Zimmer & Steve Mazzaro has been elaborated to maintain the humor of the story, at the same time some tracks of the score change to be much dramatic, to see the way the main character changes; by even creating some tracks of the score, which will become thrilling filled with rhythmic instruments and electronic sounds, to let the audience feel the dynamism of the story, in some of the most thrilling moments of the story. Matthias Schweighöfer did an excellent performance as Ludwig Dieter, the safecracker who has been dreaming a long time to accomplish something big in his life; since he has been involved with the secret heist with the thieves group, it will become a big change of his life. Nathalie Emmanuel did an excellent performance as Gwendoline, the mysterious thief who will give Ludwig Dieter the opportunity to take part of the thieves group; since he takes part of the thieves group, the relationship between Ludwig and Gwendoline will become later on very special. Ruby O. Fee did a well done performance as Korina Dominguez, the hacker of the thieves group who will do anything to whatever is necessary to accomplish the heist; as later on she will be very supportive to Ludwig, especially when something unexpected will happen. Guz Khan did a well done performance as Rolph, a getaway driver of the thieves group who is ready to run with the group as fast as possible whenever they have accomplished a heist; since Ludwig has been take part of the thieves group, Rolph starts to have empathy on him. Stuart Martin did a well done performance as Brad Cage, the gunman of the thieves group who wants to show to be a great character, like some of his favorite action heroes; until something will unexpectedly change him. Jonathan Cohen did a well done as Delacroix, a Interpol agent who will do anything to capture the thieves group, especially for a specific reason which some of the members of the group have done to him. Noémi Nakai did a well done performance as Beatrix, an Interpol agent who will follow wherever Delacroix goes, even she will expect how the group will find a way to runaway from the sight of the Interpol agents. Army of Thieves is an entertaining prequel of Army of the Dead, filled with humor, action and adventure, which also include some romantic moments needed for the story.",Army of Thieves
74,DjfunkmasterG,Not just a prequel but more story of the Timeloop and other trinkets,7,29 October 2021,"Army of Thieves, the prequel to Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead, tells the back story of one of the best characters in Army of the Dead, Ludwig Deiter.Deiter, which isn't even his real name, is a lonely bank teller with a mundane life who makes YouTube videos about the Safe Cracking world and gives the entire backstory of the safe's, including the Safe cracked in Army of the Dead.This bit of information also ties to the famous German fairytale of Siegfried and Brunhilde.The backstory explains a lot of what may have been confusing in Army of the Dead but it also expands on the time loop theory hinted by Vanderohe in Army of the Dead.The cast is generally likable and each heist portrayed in the film has a great amount of suspense to keep you glued, especially with more of the back story being told of each safe being cracked.The action moments, while not overdone are just the right amount of blood pumping stuff needed at the right time.Directed by the Mathias, the man who played Deiter, Army of Thieves helps explain a lot of what was lost in Army of the Dead and brings Army of the Dead into a whole new perspective.Ok, I hear ya, hey man, what about the zombies. Well Thieves takes place during the initial events of Army of the Dead, so the world is learning of the Zombie Apocalypse during Thieves and has become enamored by those vents which is taking the focus of other things in day to day life.This causes Deiter to have his own concerns, and deals with his own stress based on the barrage of news reports about Vegas under Seige.Thieves also explains who Deiter went from Europe to Vegas and how he is found by Scott and Maria in Army.The writing here is much better than the writing contained in Army of the Dead, and yes it is a different genre altogether, but shows That Zack Snyder and company can write a decent script when they put effort into it.After completing the 2 hours and 9 minute run time I walked away from Thieves feeling satisfied, and Mathias didn't disappoint returning as Deiter.Not too mention having deeper insight into some things just skimmed during Army of the Dead helped elevate my opinion of Army of the Dead a bit more but still it was the shoulders of Dead to carry a lot of this weight not push it off onto a prequel, but still the prequel works and IMHO lived up to the hype surrounding the trailers.All in all, if you like Dead, you'll like Thieves, if you were on the fence about Dead, Thieves will give you further insight and may have you revisit with all new eyes. If you hated Dead, you most likely won't bother with Thieves so no point in saying anything else.",Army of Thieves
75,abhibnlcs,More enjoyable than it's sequel movie!,8,2 November 2021,"This is actually much more enjoyable and worth watching than the movie it's derived from.

76,briscouver,Good prequel,7,3 November 2021,"I liked it. If your expecting a masterpiece your in the wrong place. But if you want entertainment with a quirky, funny and likeable lead character with a a good story then you'll like this. I like the first one a lot and this was good. Worth a watch.",Army of Thieves
77,alandeza,It was alright,6,3 November 2021,"Nothing about this film really stood out, but if you want a by the numbers heist film I'd still recommend it. The only standout for me was Nathalie Emmanuel as Gwendoline. She stole every scene she was in and hopefully is in the third film, or is cast in more roles.",Army of Thieves
78,frank-liesenborgs,"A very positive surprise, craving for more.",7,30 October 2021,"What makes this movie different is that it excels in the filming of the details. Every time they crack a safe and the film zooms in on the details, it is just marvellous. And then there is the superb acting of mainly Nathalie Emmanuel (Gwendoline) and Matthias Schweighöfer (Dieter). The plot and storyline are predictable but this does not prevent to put a quality label on this movie. Just watch the credits at the end, then you realize what an amount of work has been put into this movie. Now I am waiting for a sequel where they go for the fourth and final Wagner vault! This is not a zombie movie but a thoroughbred heist movie. Heist movies tend of course to be similar and predictable, and ""Army of Thieves"" is not different. You've got all the usual stuff from the assembly of the team of experts with highly specialized skills to the double-crossing. I was also happy to see a Nixon mask during a heist. The last time I saw this was in 1991 (Point Break)
""Army of Thieves,"" is a prequel starring and directed by the ""Army of the Dead"" ensemble player Matthias Schweighöfer and takes place in the very early days of the zombie apocalypse. With the undead safely confined to the United States, the Europe-set ""Thieves"" is free to focus entirely on pulling of the biggest heist in history.Straightforward review, just watch this movie. It's just over 2 hours but is over in a jiffy.",Army of Thieves
79,wwiiboomer,Fun Entertainment...,9,4 November 2021,It's annoying to see such poor reviews from known(?) critics of their less than appreciation for a movie that holds to a sound foundation of an honest to goodness satire. One that tilts towards a comedy/romance. It was fun to watch. Intriguing cinematography that draws your attention with dire consequences -- such thrill! Great entertainment that lores you into what will come next!!!,Army of Thieves
80,bbevis-47954,"Fun, Simple Movie",6,31 October 2021,"I enjoyed watching Army of Thieves. AOT doesn't break any new ground, it's not particularly thrilling, needs more action and a better antagonist. That being said I still had a good time despite my gripes and the reason I enjoyed it is because of some of the cast. Dieter is charming, pitiful and a joy to watch. A few other personalities are fun to watch but many characters are after thoughts. AOT is a hard movie to rate. It's not a perfect movie but I think if you have the right expectations you may find yourself entertained. The production is slick, the directing is more inspired than you would predict and there is heart to the overall story being told. The connections to Army of the Dead are superfluous at best but it did make me want to watch that movie again after learning more about Dieter. Problem is I would have to watch Kate's terrible decisions again...sigh. At the end of the film I'm interested to see what the next movie will be like in the AOT movieverse.",Army of Thieves
81,jannikpeveling,"Average heist movie but better than ""Army of the Dead""",6,2 November 2021,"""Army of Thieves"" is the prequel movie of Ludwig Dieter and explains how and why he has come a part in ""Army of the Dead"".As a german I know Matthias Schweighöfer very well as he is very popular in Germany. But not necessarily for his breathtaking good movies. And I can assure that ""Army of Thieves"" is definitely one of his better movies.Basically it's just an average heist movie, not spectecular good but not really bad either. Nice and entertaining to watch with a very interesting plot (the whole Hans Wagner topic) in my opinion. The acting is okay, the visuals during the safecracking are very good but the safecracking itself is the same procedure everytime and gets boring after the first one.Furthermore I really like to see more germans in Hollywood so I really support this movie even though it's just an average heist movie. So go and watch it ;)",Army of Thieves
82,roondogbb,A prequel that actually improves upon the original.,8,1 November 2021,"Many people out there will not like the type of film that Army of Thieves is. Yet many people like myself love it. So, much like the previous film, scores will will either be very low or quite high.... A super serious drama Army of Thieves is not. What it is however is 2 hours, of light drama laced with comedy that is very enjoyable. It tells a prequel story of how the master safe cracker Sebastian, comes to be involved in the world of crime. Joining with a crew that include Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) as the master thief, Brad Cage (Stuart Martin) as the muscle, Beatrix (Noémie Nakai) as the hacker and finally Rolph (Guz Khan) as the Driver. All the actors and actresses were very good. Its not the type of script/film that one of them could show a 10/10 performance, however they brought to life the good script at handOne of the criticisms I imagine is that this movie will be called cliched due to its ""cliche"" moments. However, this movie isn't trying to be super serious and accidently putting in cliches while trying to make a 10/10 film. This film does it in a self aware funny manner. Another nice little feature of this movie was learning about classic music and german mythology via ""cliche"" exposition. But I enjoyed the movie all the more for it. I loved this movie being all breaking into safes and Interpol being in pursuit. Rather than Zombies. But only by a little. So 8 out of 10. If you liked the original movie watch this one and if you haven't watched either. Watch the original movie first, then this one if possible.",Army of Thieves
83,swadwolf1,People scoring this 1 didn't watch what I did,10,29 October 2021,This film is a great prequel and one of my fav characters from army of the dead dieter gets his own movie what's not to like? You see how he started out and cracking the 1st 3 safes on the way to the ultimate safe which is the one in army of the dead it keeps you hooked from the opening minute excitement of bank robberies and comedy moments it's got everything a good movie needs really hope there's a sequel to army of the dead alas no dieter but these movies are awesome.,Army of Thieves

85,postolachivalentin,"Nothing special, nothing new",2,29 October 2021,"Just from the title alone you can understand why this movie was made in the first place, milking on the ""success"" of Army of the Dead, by making a spinoff with the worst character of the first movie.Starting from the premise of the plot, it absolutely doesn't make any sense.The camera in certain scenes is continuously moving for no reason, making me dizzy.The actors.. let's just say they are trying with what they got for the plot.And I could go on and on with how many things are just wrong with this movie.Recap: skip it at all cost.",Army of Thieves

87,yooniverse,Better than Army of the Dead,7,4 November 2021,"Despite the proximity of the two movies, this was the more enjoyable movie to watch. The major differences I think are 1) a likable story; and 2) Nathalie Emmanuel--she really does a nice job. Acting is decent, though it's really just Emmanuel and Matthias Schweighöfer. The others mostly fade into the background, but not because they were bad. As a side-arc prequel to the Army of the Dead to serve as the origin story of Ludwig Dieter, the safecracker, you only hear about the zombie apocalypse unfolding in the US through news reports on TV. This is not Oceans Eleven or Money Heist--it's a rather simple story told in a campy, lighthearted way that's easy to watch. It really can stand alone without watching Army of the Dead, which is an inferior mess with gratuitous zombie violence.",Army of Thieves
88,cary_howe,One of the stupiest scripts ever!,1,8 November 2021,"They actually managed to make a ""comedy"", at least I think it's a comedy, that is unintentionally not funny. Nothing makes any sense. I don't like any of the characters and other than name dropping zombies it has nothing to do with Army of the Dead. Here's a thought Netflix HIRE A WRITER FOR ONCE!!! All their original content is pure crap. I keep canceling my Netflix but it never gets any better. Now they are focusing on Foreign language content so there's no point to even having Netflix.",Army of Thieves
89,TMAuthor,So Much Promise-So Much Disappointment,5,5 November 2021,"The lead actor does a very good job. The safe cracking effects are cool. The cinematography is pretty good.And that's about it.The plot, other than the weird fall apart ending which I won't give away, is a total by-the-numbers grind it out Hollywood formula. The zombie apocalypse, referred to in newscasts played in the background throughout, is essentially nonexistent other than a bland comment here and there. So if you're thinking this could be a cool prequel to Zack Snyder's Army Of The Dead, you'd be wrong-except for a five minute piece at the very end of the film. Which isn't worth all that much, so just skip to that if that's what you're tuning in for.Having said aaaalllllll that-the cool safe cracking graphics get boring by the fourth time, and none, and I mean NONE, of the supporting actors are good. The female lead, while striking, is as one note performer and as hollow as I've seen in a movie. The secondary female supporting actress is a scene stealer (Florence Pugh in Black Widow anyone?) but sadly is wading through a role destined for a dead end.When you're watching a heist movie you should be on pins and needles as the main heist is taking place. But with multiple heists with the same mechanical safe lock graphics being repeated in a progressively difficult order they're oddly less intense or thrilling.Bummer. I do not recommend.",Army of Thieves
90,ReliableReview,Safe cracking with romance drama,5,8 November 2021,"I'm a sucker for zombie movies and liked Army of Dead so thought there were zombies in this movie but this is not a zombie movie at all. There's only passing mentions of zombies. It's about a team of safe crackers who enjoy the thrill of cracking safes and they bond over thrill seeking, romance and irrelevant banter. It's watchable for the drama more than the safe cracking but I was hoping for some zombie fights.",Army of Thieves
91,shirlone,prequel?,3,31 October 2021,I could tell by the preview of this that I wasn't going to like it. It looked boring and predictable. I don't see how some people can give this movie a 10 star rating when it is horrible. Watch something else.,Army of Thieves
92,NotAFilmCritic101001,Absolutely nothing to see here.,4,31 October 2021,"You've seen it all before... And done better, here's a breakdown of what they are.The protagonist lives a boring life that lacks challenge and intrigue.The protagonist gets a literal call to adventure when he is contacted by an unknown person interested in his skills.The protagonist answers the call to adventure and proves his skills to be invaluable.Against his better judgment he joins a rag-tag-team of misfits trying to play by their own rules.After joining the team, the protagonist goes along with the rag-tag-team on adventures, and someone in the team (usually a suitor) sees them for who they are.The protagonist forms connections with the team, EXCEPT FOR ONE, and that one, seeks the protagonist's downfall.The protagonist is shunned, sent away/ripped away by unforeseen circumstances and attempts to go back to their normal way of life.The team, now realising they need the protagonist, heads back to him to do that ONE BIG MISSION.Blah blah blah... You've heard it before, you've seen it before, and they literally do nothing to change/make this formula any better. It's incredibly dull, incredibly trite and just doesn't have any single characteristic that would make it different/unique enough to warrant a watch. Which is actually a bit of a shocker. I thought some of the safe cracking stuff might be cool, but alas, even that was mediocre.The jokes... OMG the jokes. Here's an example of how bad it is, it's not exact, but if you find this funny you may like the movie.Person 1
""I almost had them, but they got away""Person 2
""How did they manage to escape you""Person 1
""They shot me""Other Person In The Distance
""in the ass""If you find this funny and you are not a child, seek help. You may be an idiot. This kind of humour is so lazy, I don't even know if it can be considered humour at all. It's all throughout the film, lazy, schlocky writing that simply shouldn't have made it to film.(TLDR) Put simply, the film wasn't good or bad... It just kinda exists. I guess if you have a Netflix account you can leave it on in the background while you do something you actually enjoy, heck! It's so uninspired you won't need to pause it when you go to the loo. TBH it's just more mediocrity from Netflix... Not much to see here.",Army of Thieves
93,Yvie81,"Beautiful visuals and sceneries, but apart from that a badly written Ocean's Eleven wannabe",4,6 November 2021,"Ok so indeed the prequel no one asked for but since it's on Netflix everyone still watches it....just like me I'll admit.Plus points: it's shot in Europe. As a European I'm always delighted when that happens. The scenery shots are beautiful and they put a lot of care and detail into the vaults. Also it's great to see Nathalie Emmanuel again. I loved her in GoT, although I still have a bit of a hard time shaking off her character Missandei.Negative points: the amount of detail that went into the visuals obviously was not spent on writing a solid storyline. As I read before: this movie has more plot holes than an average Swiss cheese! Especially the ending made no sense whatsoever. First of all: why on earth would Interpol let him go? Secondly, why on earth would you voluntarily go to the US, of all places you can go to, when all you heard on the news recently is that there's a zombie apocalypse going on over there??? I almost had the feeling they wanted to make this story just so they could tell the story of Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen. The film feels like a badly written wannabe Oceans Eleven (or Five in this case) to me.. And...as I said in the previous film: why use a German for the comic relief character? (As a Dutchie I feel I'm allowed to say that lol) I'm sorry but it just doesn't work.",Army of Thieves

Exploring Dieter's past and his more about his character was fun and what lead him to become a safecracking mastermind in the first place. Nathalie Emmanuel IS A STANDOUT and the rest of a cast does a good job. The safecracking visuals were AMAZING, but also hesitating to watch. The storyline was good. Director And Zack Snyder did such a fantastic job on the film. If your hoping for a zombie movie mixed in her, your definitely going to be kinda disappointed. A prequel film that we definitely didn't need, but such a joy to watch. Obviously setting up Army of the Dead- which we already got. But a High Recommend On Netflix.",Army of Thieves
97,nIGHTmAYOR,A spin off than rather a prequal,9,1 November 2021,"Basically I skipped Army of the Dead as I am not a big fan of zombie movies but after watching this one it had me research the whole franchise only to come across the following findings :Basically Zack Snyder wanted to do a black comedy about people getting so much accustomed to the idea of the Apocalypse that they'd even use it to orchestrate a money heist non or less .The idea totally flew everybody's head but yet it was hard to miss how cute the character Dieter played by Matthias Schweighöfer which posed like purity in a ruined world , which without it might have lead to an utter failure for that movie and most probably Zack Snyder's career .This kind of risen the idea to re-use that character in a spin-off to try and give the whole story some sense , giving it purpose and replay-ability by focusing on the cute character Deter .The new author to this spin off script did an amazing job of turning a tuna sandwich into a birthday cake , somehow now with this addition everything starts to make sense .In sense of gratitude from Zack Snyder towards Matthias Schweighöfer he was handed the movie to direct and to everybody's surprise this thing came out as a master piece compared to the original Army of the Dead .So basically I am even more keen to await a sequel for this movie than to the Army of the Dead .Well done Matthias Schweighöfer and hope Hollywood remains kind to you a little bit more in this franchise or any .",Army of Thieves
98,veritybingo,Yeah.. nah.,5,4 November 2021,"I really wanted to like this movie.It started out perfectly charmingly, with a rather unique feel, and with a very likeable, goofy nervous lead character with surprising levels of genius.Then...
the other characters were introduced, complete with title sequences seen in many films over the years (Kill Bill, Feast, Polar....add 57 other movies here) all with gimmicky personality traits.Then the script... littered with unbearable volumes of lame humour (mispeaking, awkward stumbling over each other's dialogue, saying random stuff like it's clever or something).Apart from all that it has some impressive technical & visual moments.BTW..
In an ever worsening zombie apocalypse (which is barely even referred to), wouldn't society devolve into a bartering / exchange system, making any monetary wealth redundant?",Army of Thieves

102,Darvener,Movie which had potential to be a good movie but it was ruined by poor writing,1,29 October 2021,"After a few months after release 'Army of the Dead' was released movie called 'Army of Thieves' which is prequel to the 'Army of the Dead' movie. Army of Thieves follows a story of how Gwendoline recruited Dieter to open and rob four most prestigious safes in the world because no one had gotten into them before.Director of this movie is the actor who has the role of Dieter Matthias Schweighöfer who is most known as the actor for 'The Red Baron', 'What a Man', 'Der Nanny' and 'Army of the Dead'. In his directing cinematography he has made five movies including 'Army of Thieves' and one series called 'You are Wanted'. It seems that he has some experience with directing and he obviously used his experience when he was making this movie but in some scenes it doesn't look like that. In some scenes there are problems with the director because he wasn't paying attention to the small details which ruined the feeling of the movie in some parts. In one scene where Dieter he poured coffee on himself and in the second scene after this scene he has a clean and dry shirt without any stains from the coffee. When Dieter was home he was doing something on his Dell notebook and when was shot on the screen of the notebook it was clearly visible that he has inside the Dell notebook MacOS or something like that from Apple. How he could have an OS from Apple inside a notebook which is for Windows. Maybe I'm wrong so this detail doesn't affect the final result of the rating. When Dieter was going on the tournament of safe cracking they had chosen the location for the metro station, which should be in the middle of Berlin, metro station which is in the middle of Prague. These problems which have been visible in the movie are a little percent of all problems which have appeared in this movie. Directing style is not any good or bad. It is on a very good average without any special style of directing which could be memorable. The director needs a lot of time to improve himself if he wants to be an director. If someone wants to make a realistic movie with a feeling of a fantasy or sci-fi movie he must be a very good actor which masks the shortcomings in the scenario well or he wouldn't accept the scenario and you must have feeling for it and talent obviously.Screenplay was written by Shay Hatten who is most known as the writer for 'Army of the Dead', 'John Wick 3', 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Army of Thieves'. From his writer cinematography it is clearly visible that he has not much experience with writing but at least he has some good experience through the last one year of writing. He started his writing for 'John Wick 3' movie which is very positively rated by critics and users on IMDb, so it is clearly visible that he started his career very well but from the moment he started writing 'Army of the Dead' it is very visible that his skills are going up and down. For Army of Thieves he has written a very illogical screenplay with sometimes bad dialogues and the whole movie feels very poorly written. Most of the problems which are very visible in this movie are caused by Shay Hatten not by the director or actors. When Dieter came on the safe cracking tournament he was confused because he didn't know what he must do when it was clearly visible what a person must do when he has a safe before him. When Gwen met Dieter in the café he poured illogical coffee on himself, when the vessel in which the coffee was was perfectly closed by the cap but even so the cap somehow came loose and he poured on himself a coffee, because he was afraid of her. For Dieter Gwen to believe she has stolen some things from customers of the coffee shop within ten minutes without anyone noticing and this is a very illogical scene which could be in this movie because how can someone stole from a single one customer one thing without noticing when they weren't in any action. When they were in the action the possibility of noticing will be minimal because they probably wouldn't feel it as if someone is stealing something from them. The writer didn't realize one thing when he wrote this script. The one thing is the banks obviously have in a room, where it is safe, CCTV and this is not obviously written in the screenplay because when they were safe cracking the safe in the Paris bank, no one noticed that there was someone in the vault. There are many problems with the screenplay but there are many of them that this review will be only about the problems. The last problem which I will write here is that this movie works with so many cliché. Is okay to work with cliché in these ages because it is hard to come up with something new which is interesting and new in this field but the clichés could be written in a more clever way because when the writer writes the clichés cleverly the viewer and critic may not notice. This screenplay could be in the development phase for more time and it could be polished to perfection because this theme of a movie is very unordinary and very interesting.Most of the actors are quite well chosen because they fit the roles which they have chosen but there are some problems too. One of the main problems is that they have chosen the extra actors very badly because they have chosen for the guards in the Czech Republic very unknown people in Czech Republic which are not maybe actors at all and it is quite visible because they brought with them to this movie very bad and strongly below average performances. The rest of the actors are quite well chosen and the main actors Nathalie Emmanuel who has the role of Gwendoline and Matthias Schweighöfer who has the role of Dieter are chosen very well too because they fit together and this is a very good move from the casting directors. The main actors have come to this movie with good energy but Matthias Schweighöfer sometimes was overacting especially when he woke up from a bad dream or spilled coffee on himself. The rest of the actors have good performances too but not as good as the main actors.Director of photography Bernhard Jasper who is most known as director of photography for 'Frei parken', 'You Are Wanted', 'Open Water 2: Adrift' and 'Meine verrückte türkische Hochzeit'. Is visible that he has brought with him to this project very good experience with cinematography and style of shooting scenes because the camera was very good and there are no doubts that the camera was bad or average. The camera has a very special style for this movie and this one element saved this movie from being a forgettable classic Netflix movie.Music which is made by a couple of composers Steve Mazzaro and Hans Zimmer is good but there is one problem with the music. The problem depends on a single one viewer because everyone has a different point of view on this problem. The problem is when Dieter has any dream about zombies there was a music that was in some passages childish and this doesn't fit the movie very well but the rest of the music was very good.The conclusion is that this movie is very bad, mostly from the side of screenwriter Shay Hatten who ruined this whole movie because of his illogical decisions and poor writing. This is a very good example of a movie which had potential to be a good movie but it was ruined by poor writing of Shay Hatten.8%",Army of Thieves

111,nlsteven-attheMovies,It's a Steal,6,1 November 2021,"Army of Thieves is a superior prequel to Zack Snyder's original zombie fest ""Army Of The Dead"". Set in Europe, Army of Thieves is a starring vehicle for German director/writer Matthias Schweighöfer, who shines in the lead role as the nerdy and silly safecracker and in giving a European angle to the film's directing. Overall, this is a predictable Netflix production with enough action, twists, shallow dialogue and romance for an evening of entertaining viewing. Hans Zimmer's music score gets a thumbs up, and so does Bernhard Jasper's cinematography work.",Army of Thieves
112,drgreenthumb1001,Dull as dishwater. Another bad Netflix film,2,8 November 2021,"This is one of the worst ""Heist"" films I have ever seen.It starts off promising with the safecracker from Army of the Dead loading a Youtube video, then beating his table lock in 8 seconds, however, with this scene, youve pretty much seen the ENTIRE movie...The suitor is then invited to what I can only describe as a safecracking version of a cockfight, where people bet on who finishes first and their are 3 rounds of safecracking, so of course our protagonist opens safes/vault doors 3 times, so thats is him sticking his ear against metal door and spinning a dial back and forth 3 times, all this before hes even been introduced to the ""gang"". By the time you have seen the first vault opened, even with the CGI of the inside mechanism changing, youve seen them all. The first vault, has 2 locks, the 2nd vault 3, and the 3rd vault 7.There are stories behind the vaults, including about their creator, which is repeated more than once, but they are meaningless in moving the plot forward. None of the stories solve a mystery that makes the safes easier or more interesting to crack.Our wet-behind the ears protagonist can stick his magic ears to the metal doors and break these locks, with their trillions of combinations and shut-out safety systems, with ease and in just mere minutes.I havent even discussed how this somewhat interesting and off-beat side character from the weak Army of the Dead film cant carry this film and goes from funny to annoying real quick, neither can the rest of the heist crew carry this film. The INTERPOL agents are useless (Beatrix) and annoying (Guy shot in *ss) and the background Zombie apocalypse adds ZERO to the plot, no one seemed to care or were even worried about it.The romance interest of the protagonist hates her rich parents and it's why she made the morally questionable choice to become a criminal. She goes out and steals from common people, including a ladies wedding ring, a mans gold watch, and she also thinks she should decide if an elderly man can carry a piece to protect himself. Meanwhile, this same hypocrite plans to rob vaults with tens of millions of ""Euros"" to the final vault having hundreds of millions, but dont worry folks, they just do it mostly for the ""challenge"", as they walk out of each dangerous heist with just 2, count it 2 bags of money per heist!!! First vault has 40 million in it, 2 bags. The last vault has 100 million, they have even taken the vault out to the middle of nowhere, yet still, just 2 bags.I know what Im about to say may get this post deleted, but I read through the other reviews, and was dismayed at the number of 8, 9 and 10's this film received. Those kinds of ratings should be reserved for the best of the best; A Saving Private Ryan, Trials at Nuremburg, True Grit, or a Citizen Cane.They should not be sullied with the same ratings as this Army of the Dead spin-off/rip-off. I weep for the past when IMDB reviews were intelligent and nuanced, and not inundated with Social Media obsessed narcissists who think Corporate Netflix with their Million dollar production budgets, their B-movie scripts and their C level directors, (this movie was NOT directed NOR written by Z. Snyder) produces GOOD films.",Army of Thieves
113,MoviesforRelaxation,Mixed Bag But You'll Fall in Love With the Main Character,7,5 November 2021,"This movie is a mixed bag and I wonder why the writer decided to go this way. It bounces back and forth between serious to comedic to monotonous to action packed. On top of that you have a bank heist/apocalypse/love story. I don't really understand it. I was a bit disappointed at first because I like the true grit and seriousness of heist movies but the main character Sebastian just pulled me in and I couldn't stop watching. I just love how eccentric and random he is.All actors played their roles very well and so this was cast well. The camera work was nice. The plot, while interesting was pretty solid and consistent throughout and the characters were all well developed. I kind of wished the writer stuck with one theme and one genre because it seems like they had so many ideas and instead of breaking them up in putting them into different films they threw everything into one. But then again if the writer went about it differently we wouldn't have Sebastian so I'm conflicted.I'm getting ready to watch the next one Army of the Dead and I'll be back to rate that one.",Army of Thieves

The director/star has decided to give ALL of the screen time to himself, a bold move as portraying a Tilda Swinton / Sheldon from BBT knockoff in what is basically trying to be an action movie is not a good idea at all. In fact, some would venture to say it is downright stupid with the source material being what it is . The director should have taken a clue from what I believe ""schweig"" in his surname means and toned down the cult of himself a bit as his character did nothing to save the movie.Much like the star of the movie, the rest is just a boring collection of events told with mostly uninteresting characters trying to give some credence to a very light and terminally cliched plot.

The editing was brilliantly executed, using character intros for example to represent the heist crew was a perfect decision. The soundtrack, which I normally do not focus on, stood out for me and brought great value to the movie. Known co-stars Nathalie Emmanuel and Ruby O. Fee, played their roles worthy in addition to the rest of the heist crew. In terms of the plot, many scenes were not as intense as they could have been, simply because this was a prequel and I knew what to expect.

So even though this is a prequel it stands alone on its own and I thought it was very entertaining. The lead is fantastic and I thought the production values were excellent, it was funny in parts, and the pace was great. I think people are being too harsh on this movie. Granted it is a heist movie but an entertaining one at that.",Army of Thieves
125,babraham-26811,Now THIS is a BACKSTORY,9,2 November 2021,"Army of Thieves is a movie that I would've never imagined to be as entertaining as it was.It seemed as if everything was clicking in the right places; From the cinematography to the musical score, integration of history and mythology into the storytelling, the different opinions of each character pushing the plot along in just over 2 hours, the core morals of the main cast, & many more that makes this HEIST film, not so much seem as an action film for those who enjoy The Italian Job, but feel as remarkable as Logan Lucky, as smooth as ""Ocean's Eleven"", & as memorable as it's OWN FILM.However, when there is a film that connects to ANOTHER film franchise in regards to characters, things can get a little more complicated.I can still tell that BACKGROUND individual character behaviors haven't really improved coming off of Zack Snyder's Army Of The Dead, for those who have seen the film, as screenplay doesn't seem to be original in the slightest bit. I mean, it makes the appearance of these background characters almost comical! Clichés are common enough as is, whether in TV shows or movies; ironically enough, even Netflix has a show itself called ""Battle of the Hollywood Clichés"", going into detail of it's own title. Therefore, it slightly deteriorates the film's serious tone.However, Matthias Schweighöfer, the star of his directorial debut, really showed what he's capable of in front of the camera AS WELL as behind it. I mean, you really have to see this prequel spin-off for yourself in order to unlock the idea of this becoming a ""hidden gem"" among Netflix's original movies! Not only did he improve the cinematography to a more accurate/less blurry approach, but he also truly brought his character out onto the screen to go against the grain of where the story would go.Overall, this is a worthwhile watch, regardless if it's a Netflix Original or not. People may compare it to another heist movie and, as a result, may overestimate the value that this movie has in terms of how well built together this motion picture was as a whole. Thus, although, even if it lacks in areas and may not seem as perfect as a heist thriller should, I think Army Of Thieves doesn't fail to disappoint in providing an experience that will never make you feel like you're wasting your time.",Army of Thieves

Was it that you couldn't really connect with the characters, and that they had awkward dialogue? If that was it, then this film's the opposite of that.That said, the film starts off rough, with plot holes and questions unanswered. It also stays a little bit of a rough ride throughout.But the pacing was good enough, the characters were likeable enough, and it had enough entertaining moments to not become a bore at any point, other than for a bit at the beginning.So if you need something to fill the time with, this film's a good way to do it.P. S. Why do they put random sounds when they're not really there, nor needed? The YouTube upload sound, the screen flickers and makes a sound, there're mechanical clicking and spring sounds even though nothing's happening in the safe. Are they trying to make it seem like a video game, or casino game, or something? It's always odd when films do that.",Army of Thieves

132,jcsallows,A different kind of heist movie,7,8 November 2021,"This isn't a zombie movie, it's a movie with zombies in it, sometimes. There's maybe about 2-minutes worth of zombie footage. I would also argue that this is barely a heist movie; although, it probably has enough action to put it into that category.So, if I had to put it in a genre, it's a safecracking movie with multiple love stories. That may sound odd or boring, but it was much more entertaining than I originally thought. Sebastian (or Deter) is a great character and carries this film. He's intelligent, odd, obsessed, funny and has an odd way of speaking. It kind of reminds me of listening to Yoda in Star Wars for the first time.The movie really leans into the art of opening complex safes. A suprising amount of CGI is dedicated to looking inside each safe while it's being cracked open. There are heist elements of setting up the team, the exposition of getting into the banks and casinos, and the various twists throughout. I have to say though, it feels like all of those tropes play into the background and I think the screenplay and director knew that. It makes more sense to put more focus on safecracking and the main character (Sebastian) then explore a genre that most of us have seen several times at this point.If you were looking for something like Point Break, Ocean's 11, The Italian Job or any number of bank-robbing movies, you'll be dissapointed. If you wanted a Zombie Apocalypse pre-quel to Army of the Dead, you'll similarly be dissapointed. If you want a movie about Deter, the safecracker in Army of the Dead, you'll probably enjoy this film. Does this mean other characters from Army of the Dead could get their own dedicated Netflix movies?If you know what you're getting into, you may enjoy this film. I can understand why this may not be for everyone though.",Army of Thieves

141,MoviePeek,Heist Movie the Movie,6,9 November 2021,"As we all know zombie outbreaks are boring, the violence, the sense of hopelessness, the unfathomable horror. How dull. What's more interesting is seeing the events beforehand, the build, and the initial reactions to the unthinkable. Even more interesting is a story taking place in the initial outbreak that does not actually feature any zombies and for all intents and purposes, the catastrophic events may as well not be taking place.That is a pretty accurate description of Netflix's Army of the Dead prequel, Army of Thieves. The film features safecracker extortioner Sebastian Schlencht-Wohnert aka Ludwig Dieter, drawn into a ragtag crime family with the sole mission of using their combined skillsets to rob three legendary uncrackable safes. In the process becoming rich and take their place in history. The good news is, Army of Thieves is a decent heist movie that's the greatest strength is its motley crew and its brisk pace.Ludwig Dieter begins the film as Mr. Ordinary. With a dull daily routine, sluggish 9-5, and a YouTube channel that is going nowhere fast. But he does, however, possess extraordinary safecracking abilities and a penchant for German opera. He's the fish out of water of the story, a friendly albeit sheltered guy who quickly finds himself surrounded by morality ambiguous criminals who he seemingly has nothing in common with, or so he thinks. Dieter works well as the comic relief of the group and his naivete and goofiness are a welcome contrast to the jaded cynicism present in the rest of the team. Much like the team, I initially found him irritating but warmed to him by the time the credits rolled.The crew in question is headed up by Gwendoline Starr, expert thief, and all-around criminal mastermind. She is the antithesis of Dieter; she's been on the run for most of her adult life and lives a difficult life outside the bounds of the law. She may be a criminal but she's not necessarily a bad person and is easy to emphasize with. Brad Cage provides the muscle a cartoonish 90s throwback to action heroes of old. He lacks the depth of the other crew members, but that's kind of the point. To get through the mainframes and security and that other technical mumbo-jumbo requires the expertise of hacker supreme Korina Dominguez. Korina was a welcome addition to the team and in addition to her considerable skillset, she also made the team feel more like a dysfunctional family. No crew is complete without a getaway driver, Rolph has all the necessary skills to get them in and out as fast as possible. He's a wiz behind the wheel and a fun guy to hang with, he provided plenty of laughs throughout the film and may just be my favourite character.Army of Thieves is all too aware of the tropes featured in Heist movies, it's derivative and takes plenty of opportunities to point of how this would go in a film or how the thing they are about to do has been done in a film. These self-aware moments can be amusing, but they can all get a little grating. They're by no means awful and your mileage may vary, but for me, they wore out their welcome.The elephant in the room is decomposing and shambling towards you ready to plunge its teeth into your flesh, what I mean is; why does no one care that there are freaking zombies out there? Yes, the outbreak is in America, and the film is not set there, but even so, this is kind of big news. When Dieter sees the news report of the outbreak, he doesn't break a sweat, or panic, in fact, he does not react. It's as though he's just seen a report about the death of an obscure athlete from the 1970s. To add insult to injury the situation is only mentioned a handful of times throughout the entire film.I understand that this is not a film about zombies, that's fine and it shouldn't be, but it should portray the realities of the situation. The issue is ignored completely throughout the entire film. It's a baffling decision that as far as I'm concerned makes no sense. Given that the film features a character that is stuck in a boring routine and not living his life to the fullest, wouldn't this revelation spur him to change?Army of Thieves is a derivative albeit decent heist movie that embraces the tropes of the genre with a level of self-awareness that may not be to everyone's taste. The rag-tag cast of characters are each entertaining and fleshed-out, with everyone getting something to do and believable motivations. The flash and style of the film doesn't always work, with an overbearing soundtrack and gordy title cards. The film may not soar to the height of Oceans 11, but it manages to carve out its only place among other films of its genre somewhere in the middle of the pack.",Army of Thieves

155,Desrio,This army doesn't quite crack it.,6,31 October 2021,"I don't think I'm really part of Zack Snyder's target audience, but that isn't to say that I don't from time to time enjoy the kind of films that he makes. So, a few months back I settled down to watch 'Army of The Dead'. The film was a hoot - it was slick, stylish and funny, but dramatic in all the right places (I particularly liked the look of the film, enjoying Snyder's work as his own cinematographer). But there was one character who stood out for me and that was Matthias Schweighöfer's, Dieter. Dieter was at once venal and innocent, somewhat geeky, rather out of his depth at times and, in that sense, something of an Everyman. So, it was with interest that I learned that Dieter was to be the star in his own prequel.In Army of thieves (written by Army of the Dead co-writer, Shay Hatten and directed by Schweighöfer) Dieter - or Sebastian, as he is known when the story takes place - finds himself in an entirely different world. Set six years before Army of the Dead, 'Thieves' is a far more traditional heist film in which a band of people come together, each with a different skill set. This heist-movie trope is not lost on Dieter, which he points out, making a meta-joke of the film's time-honoured conventions. Their quest is to crack a series of supposedly impenetrable safes, each named after one of the operas in Wagner's Ring Cycle.What follows is a rather formulaic movie which concentrates on the heist aspect and refers to the coming zombie apocalypse only as something that is troubling a far off country - not entirely differently to how the West saw Covid when it was still confined to China. This means that anyone new to the tale can dive right in, though the zombie references, which only tangentially impinge on the main story, may be mildly puzzling.As with the plot, there is nothing new with the characters. Nathalie Emmanuel is engaging, if slightly implausible, as Gwendoline, the mastermind of the scheme. Ruby O. Fee is the computer nerd (but who is really quite cool beneath it all), the muscle come in the form of Brad, played by Hugh Jackman-alike, Stuart Martin, and Guz Khan's Rolf brings the driving skills and the comic focus in the gang.As with its time-line sequel, Army of Thieves looks the part with plenty of European locations, and some slick CGI that allows us into the mechanics of the safes as they're being cracked and, by extension, the workings of Sebastian's mind. Where the two differ is in pacing and dynamics. Unfortunately, I found myself at one point looking to see how much of the film I had watched and how much was left - never a great sign. The hour and twenty minutes that had elapsed seemed longer, and I have to confess to feeling slightly dismayed that I still had about fifty minutes to go.As a sub-plot, there is a burgeoning romance developing between Sebastian and Gwendoline, much to the annoyance of Brad, with whom Gwendoline is already in a relationship, and this threatens to divide the gang.Hans Zimmer's score demonstrates why his services are so in demand in Hollywood, and a few rather obvious green-screen scenes notwithstanding, Bernhard Jasper's cinematography is crisp and cool.Overlong but engaging, the film ends on a whimsical note, but one with added poignancy for anyone who has seen Army Of The Dead.I wanted to give this movie 6.5 stars, but as I can't, I'm afraid to say it just gets a 6 from me.",Army of Thieves
156,raptorclock,An interesting spin-off,8,4 November 2021,"One of the Army Of Dead characters became the protagonist of this strange robbery-themed spin-off.This film is curious because it differs a lot in themes and setting from the zombie film from which it is related.Here there are no zombies or too violent scenes but not even the exaggerated and surreal scenes that characterized Army or Dead.Despite the opinion of other users, I was not bored, on the contrary, I found it fun and enjoyable.The protagonists are interesting, as are the settings and certain directorial choices.Maybe I would have liked to see some zombies, and I think the film is penalized for its proximity to a film of a completely different genre. Ultimately, I find this movie better than Army of Dead, and I'm no longer sure which of the two is the spin-off of the other.",Army of Thieves

162,fruktoosi,Why did this movie even happen,3,8 November 2021,"The connection to the movie ""Army of the Dead"" seems to be the only thing keeping this thing afloat. The reality of it is that it is very far fetched and the idea behind this one seems to be one straight out of a coffee table conversation more than an original movie idea.""Army of Thieves"" was a complete waste of time, with hardly any fun or interesting scenes nor good characters. Dialogue was very poorly written which felt like a headache. Screenplay was the only thing that was good about this movie, some scenes were quite nicely stitched together to represent a movie in which someone spent some money on.Maybe someone thought this could make a few extra bucks on the box office but this is just another continuation (prequel in this case) to a good movie, which should have never been done.",Army of Thieves

164,getphysicallyfit,Lets take what we know and focus on Part 3,9,2 November 2021,"So, what do we know? This is way lighter than Army of the dead but fits in perfectly with it. Dieters real name is Sebastian. But now we know why he was in Vegas, went by Dieter in Army of the Dead, and why he was the one to crack the Götterdämmerung. Brilliant as the story unfolds. I would suggest watching Army of Thieves before Army of the Dead. Hey, it is the prequel, right 😊. Now what is before us is this and my theory/prediction for part 3:Gwendoline will be back because SHE is the daughter of Bly Tanaka. Why do I say that? Gwendoline knew where all the safes were, and they pretty much gave that connection of who her father was away in her flashback. She knows where the 5th one is. With Sebastian being the only one to crack the four safes, they will find a way to bring him back as well. With Schweighöfer being the director and a great addition to the cast of both movies bringing levity to the plight, they will find a way. Expect his return. Vanderohe will be back as the new Zeus as well. Mark my words.Why do I think the 3rd one will revolve around the 5th safe. They eluded at the start that the first three safes were rumored to still be in circulation, and ""no one knows what became of""' the Götterdämmerung. Wagner's unnamed safe must now contain something as vital as the 4th safe. I speculate since Tanaka owned the hotel the 4th one was in, the 3rd was held under the same circumstances (upscale casino/hotel) he has the 5th one. The 5th contains the second half of information regarding the Apocalypse and those responsible for it. Vanderohe found something in the Götterdämmerung that wasn't taken out and now is in a race with his Army of Dead towards it... or with him being more evolved, maybe recruiting Dieter who seeks out Gwen to get the location to the safe to cure himself possibly. Let your imagination run wild.This is all just my wish list for the third one, but I'm willing to wager it might go loosely in that direction. All in All, both were great to watch and not your ordinary Zombie movie. I'm looking forward to the animated series spin-off.",Army of Thieves

I do love Army of the Dead as I love zombie movies, but found this one to be really entertaining and fun. Dieter is an awesome character, and I was excited to see more of him.

I really hoped it to be but it wasn't.That Movie tried to be Zombie , action , heist , drama flick. But it pretty much failed at every aspect.Army of Thieves on the other hand.. Was a Heist movie. It wasn't overhyped and had one great key aspect from the Zack Snyders movie...It had Matthias Schweighöfers character Dieter as a main protagonist. Really funny , over the top , European - safe cracker.Army of Thieves had good potential. I didn't expect much from this movie and was surprised. Directed by the man him self Matthias Schweighöfer .It is a cliche heist film , but in a good way. It doesn't take it self too serious. Funny jokes here and there plus interesting locations with great visuals. And the safe cracking scenes were absolutely impressing.Plus the Soundtrack was great!Had fun watching this movie.

174,colbj-49411,Better than Army of the Dead.,7,1 November 2021,"***Mild spoilers***Why is this film better? IMO, Army of the Dead suffers from many moments where characters in the film do unbelievably stupid things, there are gaping plot holes and the performances are mixed, to say the least.This film is far more grounded. The performances are far more even, the characters likable. I may need to watch it again, but there are no gaping plot holes.It's basically a bank heist film, with a bit of romance thrown in and some comedic elements. A team of skilled individuals (a thief, a hacker and an action man) approach a hobbyist safecracker to join their team to break into banks containing famous safes (all based on The Ring by Wagner) while the world is distracted by a zombie infestation.Gripes:
The fight scenes for the character Gwendoline, played by Nathalie Emmanuel. She's a master thief, cunning, smart and not physically intimidating. She doesn't need to be, the job of brainless muscle ball is filled by team member Brad Cage.In two separate scenes she beats down 4 guys with her bare hands and it looks ridiculous. It would have been much more in keeping with her characters established personality to get her to evade outwit and Taser the guards, inject them with sedative and then tie them up. Instead we get a violent and protracted fight scene where she seriously injures people doing their job. Meanwhile, in a parallel scene, Brad quickly disables a slew of guards with knock darts without causing as much as a bruise.Would I recommend it? Yes, it's an enjoyable romp, well worth a look.",Army of Thieves

It's how forgettable the main actor and the sequel was.It was pretty cool at first but pretty quickly started going downhill when the writers struggled to move the story along and whipped up some utter nonsense. In order to build up tension, they brought back the part of the crew for the last safe cracking who apparently wanted revenge but based on what was told to us earlier, they had 0 motivation to do that. Noone screwed them over and they kept all the money from last heists. Some way they are able to track the gps of their crew members and a hacker girl who is supposed to be a computer genius, couldn't hack their phone but rather tries to sneak up on their car and ends up being caught by interpol. Why? Why did she even go there? What was the plan? Without those illogical series of events they would have escaped without any issues and that's that.

Second heist, Matthias had to go through so many security gates which required hacking but Nathalie just went through from one elevator and met him inside. If she could go, so could he, and it would avoid the whole security alert. So stupid screenplay!",Army of Thieves
194,slamdunkk,Childish and predictable,5,31 October 2021,Unfortunately this is a very uninteresting affair. The biggest reward is Matthias who has a innocent and endearing demeanor as lead character. He delivers his role strongly and truly.But the story is predictable and drags on for too long. So unfortunately the movie is a let-down.,Army of Thieves

I'm glad I gave it a shot because I greatly enjoyed it, even more so that Army of the Dead. This is more of a romantic heist picture. The guy who played the safe cracker in Army of the Dead is the lead actor here, and just as in AOTD he steals the show. The story is solid, beautiful cinematography and some great light moment. I would definitely recommend it.",Army of Thieves

Granted I have no context from the previous films, perhaps this is why I found this film enjoyable. It should be noted that this film requires no pre-requisite viewing. It can be viewed as a stand alone film, which is how I watched it. It's simply a popcorn film with a quirky safe cracker, a likable love interest and an engaging plot.

I wasn't excepting much from this movie but I loved Army of the Dead, so I thought that this movie could be fun too. I even loved Dieter's character in the film but in Army of Thieves, he just annoys me and I just want to punch him in the face.Despite an annoying character, the movie is hella slow for no reason, boring, filled with useless and not-necessary-long scenes and ridiculous slow motion coming straight from a 8th grade's project for Spanish class. Too many useless discussions, interactions and too lame jokes like when Dieter rides a bike in stairs. I just think now that this movie was a huge mistake made by Netflix, worse than 6 Undergroud (too badd for Matthis and his long-a** name).I even forgot that scene that's supposed to take place in France but they can't even hire real french actors. They all got this corny accent and sentences that no one in France would say in this scene. But glad to see Jonathan Cohen in it even if he has a lame role.Anyway, don't waste your time. This movie just ruins the Army of the Dead's franchise.",Army of Thieves

208,Horror_Girl17,Yeah......plot holes.,5,30 October 2021,"Idk the light hearted was of the main character was adorable and his scream is hilarious. But otherwise this movie just doesn't make any sense tbh. It had its charming moments.But the plot holes I mean MY GOD. Now keep in mind this is coming from someone who actually really enjoyed army of the dead despite its flaws. But this could have been so great and it just felt so unrealistic and frankly, dumb.Now here come some reasons why:
-They decide to rob banks even though two of the five main characters come from rich families.(WHY?!)
-When robbing these banks instead of like one big heist(like in most heist movies) and take like 50 bags full of cash.-They rob 3(or 4? Idk I lost track) and only take TWO BACKPACKS FULL OF MONEY FROM EACH ONE?!?!?!?!?!?!? Why?!?! For the thrill?!? SMH.....
-The script was complete crap. Like no thought was put into how cliche some of these lines/characters are.-The acting wasn't great either.(though when they have a script like that I can't even blame them)
-The underground safe breaking game at the beginning?!?! I thought for sure they would at least kill the people that didn't crack the safes in time.(BUT THEY DIDNT) where is the thrill here?!?!?!-At the end the cop just lets him go?!?! He actually made a deal with her on that?!? No cop would ever do that. It would have even been better if they had just killed her and he got away some how. But even that they made awkward and SO rated G. Ugh...In conclusion, I feel this movie was rushed to suckle off the minor success teet of Army of the dead. If they had worked on this story and waited a couple years and it made actual sense this could have been good.(this is also changing a lot, like everything I just mentioned)
Because personally I loved the German guy in AOTD. He and Tig were absolutely my fav two characters. Oh and I almost forgot, what a huge bummer we see this whole movie and get the background of his safe cracking, and we already know that he dies. Pointless.",Army of Thieves
209,chrislw77,Rather good but silly,8,1 November 2021,"You have to be in the mood and expect it to be a little far out of reality, but it was rather enjoyable. Good action and suspense.

210,MathiasWatts,"Been there, done that (but has been done better).",3,9 November 2021,"There is nothing special about this movie. Even if it were a stand-alone, it wouldn't have 2 legs to stand on. Heist movies are made all the time. This is not a good one. I've seen plenty of heist movies whether they have a serious tone or comedic tone done way better than this money grabbing part of a franchise yawn of a movie. Bottom line is people need to quit bandwagoning these directors. Not everything they make is golden. All of my favorite directors have a few duds under their belts. Zack Snyder is no exception.",Army of Thieves

213,rebeccacaldwell-56088,A fun and sleek film with Dieter screams!!,8,6 November 2021,This film actually makes Army Of The Dead wayyy better!!! Sébastien (Dieter) is beyond adorable and the film was not centered around zombies but rather plays in the background. It also has badass female characters that don't feel forced down our throats! Brad Cage is definitely going to be cast as the Wolverine eventually as he is Hugh Jackmans younger doppelganger. It was sort of like a National Treasure film that had a baby with the Point Break movie who sorta resembles The Hitmans Bodyguard.,Army of Thieves

216,mickeymazor,Netflix movies factory,4,3 November 2021,"This is exactly what happens when a movies studio is in need to produce a lot of movies in a short period of time, quantity over quality, and even though there are a lot of movies to choose as an example, this one is the perfect one to use.This fact has a cost, and essentially what happens is you take a mediocre script that is not fully baked which consists of half reasonable scenes, storyline and characters, and try to wrap it up in a 90m movie that supposed to provide the viewer with enough interest to be able to keep watching it, and not ditch it halfway, a thing that happened to me more than once.What you might experience when watching movies such as this one, is that the movie does have a very big potential of being a good one, and you will unconsciously wait for the things you think should happen to reveal themselves , but eventually they do not, leaving you somewhat frustrated and sometimes puzzled.The most common things you might see are scenes that does not make any sense, ease of flow,usually predictable outcome of events, bad acting, suspense that is not building up properly and is cut halfway, irrelevant back stories and saddly, a lot more, but these are the main ones.For example, does it really make any sense that this cute safe cracker can crack non-crackble safes the way we see in this movie? Are we really to believe that when a bat like hearing is needed as he is not using any device which should help him amplify the sound of metal latches clicking silently inside the safe, he is playing music on his cellphone? How about the fact that the safe contains piles and piles of money, and they are ending up walking away with only 3 bags? Or the times when there is a confrontation between the criminal and the law enforcement, no one shoots? And, what the hell zombies are related to this specific movie? The fact they there is a safe is located where they are? If so, make a small note of it and don't keep showing me useless zombie scenes, this movie has zero relevance to zombies.To conclude, I have mixed love/hate feelings for this movie, because despite all the negative stuff, something does work, but is a half climax is something you want to experience?",Army of Thieves

218,kevinthruxton,Maybe it was made with the European market mostly in mind?,3,2 November 2021,"I'll confess I didn't finish the movie, so if it redeemed itself in the final act then my bad. But to get to that 3rd act you have to sit through seemingly endless scene after scene of what is a light hearted heist caper with a overly dramatic, weighty backstory that frankly both makes no sense and is goofy as heck. This means you're never sure about the tone of the film, and it gets tiresome fast.It's not great revelation that European cinematic sensibilities are very different to ours and films that are praised in France or Germany, for example, can seem trivial, trite or just flat out confusing because character motivation appears to be all over the road to North American understanding. So I can only assume/hope that this movie hits home in Germany or whatever. But to your average NA viewer it's just a confusing little inconsequential mess that skips along seemingly without any real reason behind it.",Army of Thieves

It presents an interesting plot which makes you want to invest time on the movi, even considering that the first act is kinda slow, but after all the presentation and setting the plot, you go down full speed to the end. Never felt rushed, you can see and feel the team as a team. They have that chemistry even tho they are quite different from each other.The best of the movie was Dieter by far. It will make you see it with different eyes and understand the character better when you watch Army of The Dead again.Army of Thieves is a great prequel but watch it after Army of The Dead. It will make you appreciate more both movies.",Army of Thieves

226,darnbradley,Mind-bogglingly bad,1,29 October 2021,The writing is a serious insult to the intelligence of the viewer. It feels like it was written by a 12 year old on Prozac and high on coca cola. It's disturbing to think that an adult male spent time and energy composing this nonsense and then set about to get it on film.If it was meant for kids under 12 it would be forgivable but it isn't.

This is such a random movie; I never seen any ads for it. I loved Ludwig Dieter and his mind in Army of the Dead and I didn't expect them to give him a backstory movie.It is a hilarious movie. Such a light and chill vibe movie. I laughed and giggled. The story about the safe and Hans Wagner was really interesting too. I'm a sucker for anything mythology (esp Greek, but in this movie it's Norse).Matthias is perfect as Sebastian. Good acting! Nathalie is such a good actress (hi, Missandei!) and very VERY gorgeous.

However, the trailer for this movie sparked my interest and I'm a big Zack Snyder fan, so I gave it a shot. One main difference is this is a prequel and takes place when the zombie apocalypse is just starting in Vegas, so there is barely any zombies in this movie. However, the story is still interesting and ties into the movie nicely. All of the characters are super likeable, the settings were beautiful, and it had lots of funny bits. I docked 2 stars because as some of the others mentioned (though I think people are being way too harsh on their ratings), it went a little TOO smoothly, so it felt unrealistic at times. It would have been interesting if more things went wrong or at least some struggle and then overcoming that. But overall, it's still a fun and enjoyable movie.",Army of Thieves

241,deepfield67,A prequel that should have been a sequel...,6,1 November 2021,"So, many of the problems with this film I think arise as a result of it being a prequel to AOTD, rather than AOTD being a sequel to this. It's basically just a heist movie, and after that episode of Rick and Morty heist movies have become basically unwatchable. But for what it is, it's fairly entertaining. By the end, which could have come half an hour earlier, it begins taking itself way too seriously. The characters are pretty generic, but I do like Deiter and the hacker girl, they're adorable. If this movie had come out first, then I would have watched it without much expectation. Then, knowing there is a zombie apocalypse on the rise, I might have said, ""they should make a sequel to that where they have to go do a heist *during* the zombie apocalypse!"" And AOTD might have been way better. I did enjoy them both, just don't expect anything too spectacular or original.",Army of Thieves

But Matthias truly steals the show in every scene he is in, complimented beautifully by Nathalie Emmanuel who is a powerhouse herself.This movie follows a pretty stereotypical trope of heist films, but Matthias exudes the beauty of craftsmanship that comes in the form of locksmithing vaults. Nathalie compliments his bizarre yet fun antics with a sense of levelheadedness that the audience finds themselves thinking right before she says what we all feel. Its a perfect duo that carries this film complimented with a hefty studio budget and a decent side of co-stars.I believe this is the film that births Matthias into Hollywood and we see a lot more of him very soon.",Army of Thieves

But the zombie news coverage at the start did give it something extra. It reminded me of the genre hopping within Rodriguez/Tarantino's 'From Dusk till Dawn', which started as a typical gangster flick until the surprise twist. Only now you were expecting this to be a zombie movie from start to finish but it turned out pretty quickly as a very decent and straight up heist movie instead. It was refreshing and I really loved all the tidbits of information about Wagners opera, the beautiful scenery and the humor. If the franchise or universe started out with this movie as the first installment, I would be very excited to watch what's coming next. And be let down by Army of the Dead, tbh.",Army of Thieves

With very stupid choices, not likeable characters, that everything is so predictable and full of clichés. I'm done with the typical girl has a boyfriend new stupid guy comes and they fall in love like that, other guy get easily dumped(for no reason) or jealous and turned their back on the group and they fight each other to make the cliché to go on and on.

It's not just a prequel but an origin story that we needed! If you love Army Of Dead you will love this movie even more. Like Army Of The Dead this movie is full of awesome action, and hilarious comedy but here they have more story to tell in this movie and we get to know the cahracter we know and love from the last movie. Even if they only tease us and show us glimpse of the Zombie Apocalypse this movie manages to shine on its own.I had a lot of fun watching this movie because not only it's not a zombie movie, but it's a fun, yet thrilling Heist movie.*SPOILERS*Now because of the ending they better find ways to bring Ludwig Deither on the sequel of Army Of The Dead and he is better be alive as well!",Army of Thieves

But here it is - more than 2 hours of uninspired, unlogical, unfunny and clichéd waste of time. I was so stunned that I accidentally canceled my Netflix subscription, and I saw pretty much every that they 'produced'.Really, I liked 'Army of the Dead' for what it was and for taking itself not to serious, but 'Army of Thieves' made everything wrong what Zack Snyder made right.Germany definetly has a few good Filmmakers and a lot of great actors, but in this Movie, none of them was involved.The Movie does not deserve one of the 4 Stars I gave it - that's just me having a good Heart.",Army of Thieves

I would have given this movie a 6/10 if there weren't so many issues with the bank heist aspect, as in, there are far too many errors and illogical things that happen during the robberies.Very good special effects during the safe breaking scenes give this movie some ""woah"" moments and help you grasp how complicated a safe can be internally.All in all, fun movie to watch if you don't overly analyse it, definitely worth the time, although I found the whole zombie aspect completely and utterly useless.",Army of Thieves

314,compassionatewolf-943-694148,A Brilliant Experience!,8,7 November 2021,"Motion pictures chronicling epic heists have been a staple of cinema since the advent of the art form. It is a viable and crowd-pleasing sub-genre that continues to the present of which the latest and surely one of the most entertaining and endearing is the second entry in the new connected zombie-centric universe that started with Zack Snyder's ""Army of The Dead"" called ""Army of Thieves."" The set-up is basically the attempt by a group of specialists led by Gwendoline Starr(brilliantly played by Nathalie Emmanuel) to rob multiple specialized bank safes that were designed by an eccentric inventor called Hans Wagner.As I stated above the film's milieu takes place in director Zack Snyder's new universe that will eventually be overrun by zombies that may or may not have been spawned by activities in Area 51. That being stated this film is not a film about zombies and is surprisingly enough more about longing and what you may gain if you act upon your true calling with all of the consequences that will visit you. ""Army of Thieves"" is also basically an origin tale in the best tradition of comic books where we meet the breakout character from ""Army of the Dead"" called Ludwig Dieter who is recruited by the aforementioned Gwendoline Starr after inviting him to a safe-cracking competition. There is a touching spark of attraction that also transforms the film into that of a romantic comedy that adds to the ultimate theme of the film of which is cracking not only supposed impregnable environments but how does one discovers the true nature of what is in a human heart as well.It is of particular note that this film was magnificently directed by its star, Matthias Schweighöfer who is quite well known in his native country of Germany but I am confident that his efforts in his film will grant him carte blanche in the United States as well. The pacing of the film is at once relaxed as well as frenetic which is a difficult task for any director, let alone a director who is also the star of his motion picture. The fact that Matthias Schweighöfer had decided to take a big bite with multiple themes in ""Army of Thieves"" is a gift to viewers who enjoy action films with well-developed characters and ideas that challenge even if one decides to partake in multiple viewings.The film is riddled with stand-out performances from even the most minor of character moments in the flick. Above all, it is the performances of Matthias Schweighöfer as Ludwig Dieter and Nathalie Emmanuel as Gwendoline Starr that elevate this film beyond the typical and overdone action cliché laden characters that one has to suffer through in many films of this genre. Dieter and Starr have undeniable chemistry throughout the film's sequences and despite their dubious personality flaws, one cannot help but hope for a happy ending after their joyous flirtations. The greatest safe that needs to be cracked after all is that of the human heart! Don't miss ""Army of Thieves"" now playing on Netflix!",Army of Thieves

320,berokoko7,So disappointing,2,6 November 2021,It's very boring with shallow not convincing story. The safecracking scenes are repetitive and not convincing at all the police chasing are lazy and childish. The main character is boring overacting.,Army of Thieves
321,sachithpremaratne,Good movie! Hopefully this will turn out to be a series of movies!,9,28 October 2021,"Nice movie, and nicely connected to the sequel. Has a fun vibe to it as well. The start is really capturing, and Nathalie Emmanuals addition is great.",Army of Thieves
322,brocktune,Matthias Schweighöfer hits a home run,10,31 October 2021,"Army of Thieves is a prequel building on Zack Snyder's fun but ultimately somewhat underwhelming Army of the Dead. Even though Netflix quickly announced the AOD universe would be expanded upon following strong viewer consumption rates, AOT takes things a big step forward and puts some flesh on the bones versus stripping it away. Matthias Schweighöfer stole the show in AOD and in AOT he delivers on both sides of the camera in what was a better acted and directed film in all aspects. The gripes and negative reviews are from those who were expecting more zombies. Watch this and enjoy it for what it is - a great heist movie with the zombie outbreak an ocean away taking a backseat to what's happening in Europe. Let's hope that Dieter managed to make it through the ending of AOD, and if not, well... let's hope that Schweighöfer gets to spend more time behind the camera in the overall AOD universe! TLDR: You'll be much more invested in the characters of AOD after watching this and will come away looking forward to the eventual sequel that we know is coming.",Army of Thieves
323,jerardturner,Easy watch,8,1 November 2021,Film was okay.. easy to watch.

325,shifanmatrix,Waiting for the next chapter,7,4 November 2021,A wonderful movie.very entertaining and suspenseful. Don't believe negative reviews. Its one of the best movies in recent times.Thriller action comedy all included.,Army of Thieves
326,mc-12637,Well if you have nothing better to do...otherwise insult to intellectuals...,4,7 November 2021,"The movie was quite a failure...possible spoiler alert!The main character is somehow unbelievable, someone with that kind of knowledge would have a little more balls, all the other thugs are pretty cliche, i like to believe that this is a heist movie, but it is insult to human inventions and intellect...cracking safes by sound and feel...joke...seriously my house is more guarded that that vaults - joke...the pro drifter returns a car with bent wheel and says he is the best driver a few seconds later - joke :Dshooting scenes are a joke, everybody keeps missing in distance of 5m literally, and wtf ? The tranquilizer guns that works instantly does not even exist...All in all i had to take a nap after 75% trough the movie adn i think i will never even look it to the end.",Army of Thieves

actingstory placementshotsenjoyablehumourBad:
maybe a little bit too longpredictable storysome plot laziness.It's a good movie, with a decent story. Not a masterpiece for sure but it is definitely far from being a bad movie.Just an okay fun on lazy Friday's evening.Acting seemed very good to me - especially the main couple - though I see a lot of comments that would suggest people didn't like them. Not sure why.One actor look like a cheaper copy of Hugh Jackman but this I actually find really funny and I wasn't seeing it as bad thing.I like the idea of making a completely normal heist movie, without any zombies in a zombie universum. Very unusual and interesting but I must say, I knew, there will be no zombies.So lack of them wasn't disappointing for me as I knew what to expect.Maybe people were expecting zombies and that's where the bad reviews comes from. Not sure.I agree, the story was bit predictable and there were few plot sillinesses but it was enjoyable.",Army of Thieves

If a guy is a macho, introduce him doing push ups3. The nerd essentially falls in love with the smartest woman that messes up the whole heist plan4. You're effing rich by looting 2 bags of cash from the biggest vault5. Show this all in a super boring mannerWelcome to Army of Thieves!!",Army of Thieves

thanks all of them.Best actors . I love sebastine role and other actors.",Army of Thieves
331,rkappb,Blah,3,1 November 2021,Slow paced dragged out heist film filled with plot holes and a shrieking male lead. Awful honestly I had to pause it with 50 minutes left because I couldn't stand to watch another second. After collecting myself for about an hour I watched the rest of the movie and the lackluster ending proved that this was not worth the watch even in the slightest.,Army of Thieves
