0,SnoopyStyle,This is a lot,7,3 June 2021,"Estella (Emma Stone) was born with usual black and white hair. Her mother keeps warning her against turning to the evil side known as Cruella. The rebellious young girl lost her mother in a Dalmatian attack. She finds a fashion mentor in The Baroness (Emma Thompson) who turns into her rival and then her oppressor.Disney reworking their villains come with some issues. The obvious one for this character is dogs. It does come up with an interesting solution. Now I don't remember Cruella having dogs herself and that threw me off. Killing off her mother with Dalmatians seems to be overkill. At that point, I was going to murder this movie if it made the Dalmatians into villains and excuses. Quite frankly, non of that is necessary as the solution is very simple and very effective. I would have liked The Baroness to pitch the idea of 101 Dalmatians to Walt Disney but that may be going too far.In the end, this is a very good reworking but it is a lot of road to cover. I was so intrigued with little Estella that she would have been plenty enough for a whole movie herself. It would be an interesting battle between Estella and Cruella. It could have been a Carrie revenge story against her school tormentors. A young Cruella movie may have been a better option.",Cruella
1,Prismark10,Cruella,6,3 June 2021,"Cruella de Vil is in the rogues gallery of the Disney Parks hall of shame.The crackling villainess usually exchanges barbs with Captain Hook to entertain and frighten the parkgoer's.She is bad because of her love for fur coats made from dalmations.So this prequel has had to retool the character of Cruella de Vil to make the audience root for her.To me this was a Disnified version of a Harley Quinn movie. Dark edged and twisted but family friendly with a lot of mainly 1960s pop music.Young Estella (Emma Stone) has always felt guilty as she thought that she was responsible for the death of her mother when being chased by dalmations.When orphaned, she hooked up with Horace and Jasper and lived a life of petty crime.Estella always yearned to be a fashion designer, she ends up working with The Baroness (Emma Thompson) a haute couture designer who is casually cruel.When Estella learns the truth about The Baroness, Estella's rebellious streak gets the better of her. Donning the guise of Cruella, she taunts and sabotages The Baroness fashion shows.Cruella has to be seen in its own right and you need to forget about the Dalmation films. It is offbeat and entertaining but also rather bloated.Stone and Thompson decked out in ever outlandish costumes give delicious performances. Other characters are two dimensional who seem to be retreads from other Disney live action movies.",Cruella
2,nogodnomasters,It is pronounced De Vil.,10,13 June 2021,"This is the back story to a Disney villain. Like Maleficent they create a complex character that is not all evil and certainly didn't start that way. Estella lived as a street orphan at an early age and wanted to be a designer. She becomes employed by the Baroness only to discover they have a history she did not know about.I am a fan of Emma Stone and didn't think she was right for the part. She proved me wrong. It was a great story and a great supporting cast. What I loved most was the soundtrack, even though it was sometimes anachronistic. At the (possible plot spoiler) supposed death of Cruella, they play ""Come Together"" a song about Paul being dead when actually still very much alive. Now if you are looking for the subliminal evil, the license plate number JOH1930 could be read as John 19:30. This has some darker moments to it and I did not see it as a child's film.I could watch it again just for the soundtrack.",Cruella
3,kosmasp,The Deville wears Prada (and other costumes),7,16 September 2021,"Ah the name puns. You gotta have them, right? The answer is obviously yes. So a bad or rather evil character as we know her ... or knew her? - is now back with an origin story. I have to admit, I have some issues with the movie overall or rather the morality is serves. Not to mention the kind of making away of what she becomes ... or making it ok, because of what happened to her.If you are able to leave those thoughts to the side and not be clouded by them, you may be able to enjoy this more. The story is quite straightforward - you have the evil Emma and the good Emma - which will become Evil. Sorry I can't just put this to the side. Obvious name choices to the side (and convenient happenings/accidents too), the actors do a fantastic job. The movie is quite dark for a family entertainment entry, but so was the 101 Dalmatians ... to a point.If you love those involved, you will get more out of it too. If you love dresses, you will have the time of your life - no pun intended.",Cruella
4,Sleepin_Dragon,What a surprise.,8,30 May 2021,"I went in to the cinema expecting to be disappointed, or to nod off, but I have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's dark, it's funny, it's utterly entertaining. It just goes to show that when film makers are given an imaginative script, the magic can still happen.Emma Stone, she gets lots of parts, and you can see why, she's so good, she's excellent in this, and really does inject some vigour into the character.How nice it was to be back in a cinema!This exceeded my expectations, 8/10.",Cruella
5,jboothmillard,Cruella,7,10 June 2021,"One Hundred and One Dalmatians is a classic of the Disney animated movies, and the 1996 live-action remake starring Glenn Close (producing this movie) was reasonable entertainment. I was perhaps sceptical about seeing this prequel story, which serves as an origin story for the well-known villain, but I gave it a chance, directed by Craig Gillespie (Mr. Woodcock, Fright Night; I, Tonya). Basically, 5-year-old Estella Miller (Billie Gadsdon) is a creative child with an interest in fashion but has a cruel streak, leading her mother Catherine (Emily Beecham) to nickname her ""Cruella"". Due to Estella's rebellious nature, Catherine pulls her 12-year-old daughter (Tipper Seifert-Cleveland) from school and plans to move to London. On the way there, Catherine stops at a party hosted by the wealthy Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson) to ask for financial assistance. Estella sneaks into the party and is fascinated to see the elaborate dresses on display. Then she witnesses her mother being pushed off a cliff to her death by the Baroness' ferocious Dalmatians. Orphaned, Estella makes her way to London and befriends two street urchins named Jasper (Yesterday's Joel Fry) and Horace (Richard Jewell's Paul Walter Hauser). To go unnoticed, she dyes her black-and-white hair red. Ten years later, Estella (Emma Stone), Jasper and Horace are making ends meet alongside, while Estella hones her fashion skills by designing their disguises. For her birthday, Jasper and Horace get her a job as a cleaner at the Liberty department store. A drunken Estella remakes one of the displays in the store window, impressing a presentative of the Baroness is impressed and landing a job. The Baroness is a renowned but authoritarian haute couture designer, but Estella gains her confidence. Things change though when Estella notices the Baroness wearing a necklace that once belonged to Catherine. The Baroness claims the necklace was stolen by an employee, and Estella wants Jasper and Horace to steal it. Under the guise of Cruella, with her natural hair colour, she crashes the party, while Jasper and Horace steal the necklace. During their interaction, Estella sees the Baroness uses a whistle to command her Dalmatians, and she realises they were called to murder Catherine. Seeking revenge for her mother's death, Estella taunts the Baroness by appearing at her gatherings and upstaging her as Cruella in flamboyant outfits, designed with the help of a vintage clothing store owner named Artie (John McCrea). Her antics gain media attention, including publicity from her childhood friend Anita ""Tattletale"" Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a gossip columnist. Cruella's contemptuous and arrogant behaviour increasingly upsets Jasper and Horace, as well as the Baroness, who fires her lawyer Roger (Kayvan Novak) for failing to stop Cruella. Estella next kidnaps the Baroness' Dalmatians after one of them accidentally swallows her mother's necklace. Estella sabotages the Baroness' spring collection show and stages her own show in Regent's Park. Having deduced that Cruella is Estella, the Baroness has Jasper and Horace arrested and ties her up, leaving her for dead in a fire. Estella is rescued by the Baroness' valet John (Mark Strong), who reveals the necklace is a key to a box containing Estella's birth records. It is revealed that the Baroness is Estella's biological mother and ordered John to have the infant Estella killed so she could focus solely on her career. John instead gave the baby to Catherine, one of the Baroness' maids, who raised Estella in secret. Estella is angered by Catherine's deception but eventually makes peace with the truth to complete her vengeance, adopting the name Cruella for good. Cruella breaks Jasper and Horace out of jail, recruiting them and Artie for her final scheme. They sneak into the Baroness' charity gala, where Cruella, dressed as Estella, confronts her. The party guests are told that the Baroness wants them to gather outside, while Cruella reveals to the Baroness that she is her abandoned daughter. The Baroness pretends to show remorse for her actions and asks to hug her before pushing her over a cliff, unaware the guests are watching. Cruella survives the fall using a parachute built into her clothing and discards her Estella disguise before returning to witness the Baroness being arrested. Having adopted the last name de Vil, inspired by the stolen Panther De Ville car, Cruella inherits Hellman Hall, shortening the name to Hell Hall, as its rightful biological heir. Before the end, two Dalmatian puppies named Pongo and Perdita are delivered to Roger and Anita respectively. Now working as a songwriter, Roger begins composing the song ""Cruella de Vil"". Also starring Jamie Demetriou as Gerald and Tom Turner as The Baron. Stone is terrific as the anti-hero, turning from innocent fashionista to animated limelight stealing icon, and Thompson proves more than a match as the vicious aristocratic fashion guru who is the true villain. The film reminded of the TV show Ugly Betty, with its stylish, satirical and spiteful approach to the fashion industry, it has a snappy script, an interesting take on 70s punk-era Britain, it is a little dark at times, but it still amusing family entertainment at heart, I was pleasantly surprised, a fun crime comedy. Very good!",Cruella
6,paul_haakonsen,Surprisingly good actually...,6,28 May 2021,"I must admit that I wasn't really expecting much of anything grand when I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Cruella"". I mean, a movie based on the backstory of a Disney villain. Well, it was hardly stuff that had my knickers in a bunch.But still, it was a movie that I hadn't already seen and I had to opportunity to watch it, so of course I did. And I must say that writers Dana Fox, Tony McNamara,
Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel and Steve Zissis actually managed to churn out a storyline that proved to be interesting enough.Sure, while ""Cruella"" was a watchable movie, it hardly had the contents to it to become a classic. Now, I am not saying that director Craig Gillespie's movie was bad or anything, not at all. But it just didn't have what it took to become a masterpiece and an instant classic.The storyline was good, and there were some nice aspects to the storyline, along with some curveballs thrown here and there to throw off the audience. And that worked well enough in favor of the movie.But it was the interesting and well cast ensemble of actors and actresses that made ""Cruella"" work. Initially I thought that Emma Stone wasn't up to the part of portraying this villainous character. But she definitely was and she made the character very much her own and carried the movie quite well. Needless to say that Emma Stone was easily rivaled by co-star Emma Thompson in this movie. And together they made the movie work quite well.Visually then I was a bit astounded to see a Disney movie actually carry this kind of dark tone. But hey, it was right up there alongside the ""Maleficent"" movies, so why not?I found myself to be entertained by ""Cruella"", though I doubt it a movie that I will actually ever return to watch a second time.My rating of ""Cruella"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Cruella
7,BandSAboutMovies,Why?,5,3 June 2021,"Patton Oswalt once famously yelled of the Star Wars prequels, ""I DON'T GIVE A **** WHERE THE STUFF I LOVE COMES FROM! I JUST LOVE THE STUFF I LOVE!"" This was in a time before movies like Joker took the villains from our favorite old films and made them someone that we could care about and perhaps even come to love.To wit: the only thing I know about Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmations is that she's fixated on murdering, well, a hundred and one little dalmatians just so she can get a new coat. That really doesn't sound like someone I want to know more about, but here we are with a movie with a MAC cosmetics tie-in and an anti-heroine that can pretty be Arthur Fleck for the Hot Topic set.Craig Gillespie comes from advertising into directing and it shows, as he's great at breaking this movie into set pieces that have very unique looks. His films are hit and miss with me. I was fine with I, Tonya but his Fright Night is an abomination. Here, he's making a decent movie, albeit one that is two hours and fourteen minutes, which seems about twice as long as this movie needs ot be. Imagine if I had the attention span of a child! Oh wait, I do!Did you ever wonder how Cruella met her henchmen Jasper and Horace? Were you lying awake at night wondering who her mother was and just why she hated dalmatians so much?Probably you were, if you watched this. This film was enjoyed in our home because there was a dog named Wink who was a chihuahua and we all know how much those tiny yet feisty beasts are beloved in the B&S About Movies HQ.I guess if you have kids and you want to introduce them to popular music, this is a decent movie to do so. I'm still failing to see any reason for why it exists, but I could say that about so many of the sequels and remakes and reimaginings that I find myself watching.",Cruella
8,studioAT,Cruella,6,17 October 2021,"Disney takes elements of 'Devil Wears Prada', 'Ocean's 11' and oh, a little bit of '101 Dalmations' to create 'Cruella'.Emma Stone sparkles, and visually this film is stunning, but it doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a prequel to the Glenn Close fronted live action films or a film that just happens to have Cruella as the lead character.For the most part this is good fun, though overly long and repetitious. I'm not sure Emma Thompson was the best casting either.I don't often say it, but this is a film that needs a sequel, if only to give the creative people behind the camera another chance to work out what the heck this intended to be.",Cruella
9,CinemaSerf,An Emma-nitely good watch....,7,9 June 2021,"I was a bit apprehensive about this film - I was a fan of the Glenn Close (who exec produced this) characterisation of the eponymous archetypal Disney baddie. It's good, though - once it gets started and we have some of the backstory of the young woman (Emma Stone) determined to make it in the fashion world. She goes a bit mental one night with a shop window display at the famous Liberty of London department store where she is employed as a cleaner, and this is spotted by fashion guru ""The Baroness"" (Dame Emma Thompson) and she is offered a job as her personal assistant. We quickly discover that the new mentor has some history with the young woman's deceased mother and so together with her pals ""Jasper"" (Joel Fry) and ""Horace"" (Paul Hauser) they come up with a cunning plan to exact their own spectacular brand of revenge... It's quite clear that both stars here are having good fun. Thompson looks like she's been watching ""The Devil Wears Prada"" from 2006 as her performance does remind of Meryl Streep with all her superiority complex and snideness, and Stone is on cracking form as her character develops nicely. The principal acting is good, the writing pithy even if the humour is a touch over-cooked at times, and the support efforts are adequate - no more really - save for a few quirky scenes from free-dressing ""Artie"" (John McCrea) and from Ziggy Gardner as the young, and very dapper ""Jasper"". Sadly, though, it's devoid of any sort of menace - even comedic - and there is an inevitability about the conclusion that somehow fell a bit flat for me. Still, all good fun and well worth a watch - I am guessing the sequel is already on the storyboard.",Cruella
10,Calicodreamin,Kind of amazing,8,6 June 2021,"Okay so cruella was actually kind of amazing. The cinematography and costuming were breathtakingly beautiful. The storyline took a few weird turns, but for the most part really worked. The characters were well cast and well acted. The Emma's slayed being maniacally deranged.",Cruella
11,view_and_review,Origin Stories Are Where It's At,7,8 June 2021,"Origin stories are where it's at. I don't know who started doing origin stories, but certainly Marvel has to get credit for popularizing it. As for Disney, they have rolled out a few origin stories with Cruella being the latest.I really enjoyed this movie. I think I may have enjoyed it even more than my eleven-year-old daughter who liked it as well. The movie was definitely made with parents in mind as the plot is a bit much for a child to keep up with.Cruella (Emma Stone) was born Estella. When her mom was killed by three vicious dalmatians Estella was left an orphan. She quickly hooked up with a couple of young thieves named Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser). The three of them grew up together grifting on the streets of London and all was good. Estella began to make a slow transformation into Cruella after working for The Baroness (Emma Thompson) who was as cold as ice. The Baroness was the top fashion designer in England (or maybe the world) and the cruelest woman you ever did see. She reminded me of a meaner Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) from ""The Devil Wears Prada.""""Cruella"" was well thought out and brilliantly put together. There weren't many laughs though the movie stayed light most of the time. There were a few moments where the movie was a bit dark and heavy, far darker and heavier than any rendition of ""101 Dalmatians"" ever was. Still, the movie stayed out of really serious and somber waters. A testament for me that the movie was good was that I enjoyed it even with Emma Stone playing the lead; an actress who I have yet to like in any movie. But I have to give credit where credit is due; she was down right good in ""Cruella.""",Cruella
12,deloudelouvain,Entertaing and well made.,8,30 August 2021,"To be honest I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie. For some reason I thought it would be a kid movie but the truth is that Cruella is for all ages and very entertaining. The two Emma's (Stone and Thompson) are the major reason for that. They're both skilled actresses and they did a very good job playing their characters. The cinematography is of high quality which was also a thing that made this movie stand out from the rest. And even though the main characters are not very likable persons the story is entertaining from beginning till the end. The dog characters added something cute to the story. Hats off for this movie, much better than I thought it would be.",Cruella
13,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Cruella (2021) 6.8/10,7,22 June 2021,"""Tamely, the filmmakers aren't doing anything seismic relative to the usual Disney aesthetics, the plot has an effervescent, overly simplified arc to set the story in motion, thankfully, the cast is game enough to leave audience hooked (though maybe not for its entire 134 minutes). And Stone is as good as one could expect in such a cartoonish confection, there is ballast in her moxie and gumption, and her incarnation accentuates Estella/Cruella's unconventionality but doesn't make her an out-and-out freak, like Glenn Close's prior dramatization did. Humanity is undimmed here, you can see the clear emotional trajectory of Estella's psychopathology, she could be a bad seed from extraction and fed on an insalubrious soil, but a familial bond with Jasper and Horace (they are not her henchmen, but true friends) functions as the bedrock of her wellbeing, and that makes the whole difference between her and the Baroness. From the point of view of a message movie, CRUELLA passes muster.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",Cruella
14,thesar-2,The de Vil Wears Prada,9,29 August 2021,"I was wrong. And I was fashionably late to the party.I refuse to watch the cash-grab, shot-by-shot Disney remakes, no matter how much I love the originals. I won't watch Beauty & the Beast (2017,) Aladdin (2019) or The Lion King (2019.) If you're just going to do the exact same thing, I won't expect different results.And then there's the great, 2014's Maleficent. A reimagining. Even 2016's The Jungle Book - a somewhat new retelling. But, now, Disney's latest (almost masterpiece) 2021's Cruella. And I was wrong to prejudge.I never thought you could replace the cartoon version or Glenn Close's stunning live action take on the evil dog-snatcher. But Emma Stone, you've done it. You're the Disney's Heath Ledger they needed.Don't get me wrong (as I was.) I LOVE Emma Stone. In everything she's done that I've seen. Hell, even thought La La Land was just okay, but I still loved her in it. She's one of my all-time favorites since I discovered her in Easy A. And this all said...I thought she just couldn't pull off this role.She did. She made me believe again. In Disney.I was shocked at first on how LONG this movie was. Plus, it dragged a bit in the beginning. But then a death occurred and not to be morbid, I was then onboard. But, then the boring, clichéd and overused soundtrack brought me back out of the picture. Luckily, that was planned, it seems.Once the movie hit its stride and when I began truly loving this experience, the soundtrack improved. Tenfold. And then, I was 100% onboard through to the end.I love this take on such a somewhat simple story and its many new layers. Little orphan Estella gets taken in by Timon & Pumbaa (no really, awesome characters from the cartoon: Jasper & Horace) and they help her rise to her potential. But, the more she ascends, the more she learns of her past, her place and her talent. And once that happens, watch out.The cast is spot on, the setting/time is perfect for how everyone got away with their individual schemes and the movie was shot brilliantly. I mentioned this movie was overlong, and it probably could've been trimmed a bit, but like I said: once this movie got going, it was a roller coaster I didn't want to disembark. I don't buy many movies these days, especially with the (TOO MANY) streaming services I'm subscribed to, but I wouldn't mind purchasing this GEM.Shout out to both Emmas for their Oscar®-caliber performances. Hell, I'd throw supporting roles to Joel Fry, Paul Walter Hauser and John McCrea. While we're at it: let the Screenplay Writer, Director, Costume Designer and Cinematographer all be nominated. This was a brilliant, fun, deep and nearly perfect film.Needlessly, and deliciously, I say: See it.***Final Thoughts: Side-note, I almost allowed myself to see 2017's smash-hit, Beauty & the Beast, just to see why it made billion plus dollars. BUT, then Pandora introduced me to Emma Watson's version of ""Belle,"" which just happens to be my favorite Disney song. Well, she butchered it. BADLY. So, that was the final nail. Now, I will never see the Disney remakes. (Even the upcoming The Little Mermaid one, which happens to be my favorite animated Disney feature. UNLESS, they convince me it's mostly different than the 1989 hit.)But, boy, I do hope they keep up with the reimagining efforts. They haven't failed us yet.",Cruella
15,cherold,"Not great, but there are moments",6,2 October 2021,"I was underwhelmed by the trailer for Cruella, which looked dumb, and didn't hear much good about it, but I love Emma Stone so I thought I'd give it a chance. But while Stone is good, it's the Emma I didn't realize was in this that supplies the best moments.Stone plays Stella in a Cruella Deville backstory film. Recasting villains has become a cottage industry, so perhaps it was inevitable that someone would attempt to turn Cruella into a heroine. But it's a heavy lift. Cruella is a cartoonishly villainess psychopath, and nothing in the movie resolved these two Disney Cruellas.At it's best, it's quite good. There are fabulous moments, like the young Stella's swing escape and a long tracking shot moving from a department stores glamour to its grimy bowels. And throughout the movie has stunning, insane clothes and a fun pop-song soundtrack.Then there is the other Emma, Thompson, who is utterly hilarious as a diva fashion designer. With Stone required to create a softer Cruella, Thompson gets to play the actual villainess role.The movie is pretty solid through most of the first half, but as the big plot movements occur it loses energy. And that fun soundtrack eventually becomes lazy overkill; I swear, there is a pop song playing through at least 70% of the movie - every big scene, ever exciting moment, let's play a song.As for Emma Stone, the reason I watched this, she is both great and perhaps not the right choice. At her most mischievous she has a smart-Harley-Quinn flare, but her ability to create pathos creates moments where her genuine pain and despair clash with the goofy henchmen and her ludicrous orphan story. The movie might have worked better if Cruella's vengefulness came more from anger than childhood trauma.There are good moments, there are dull patches. There are great performances and forgettable ones. Above all there's a heroine the movie can't wrestle with, trying to create a cuddly psychopath who's not *that* bad.I wouldn't recommend it, particularly, but there's enough that if you're a fan of the Emmas you might want to take a look.",Cruella
16,FeastMode,not really for me,3,2 June 2021,"I repeatedly go back to these disney live action movies because i love maleficent so much. But they keep failing me. To be fair, a movie centered around female fashion is likely to have a low success rate in my book. But this movie didn't really do much for me. And there were a bunch of stupid parts. I had trouble getting through it.The best parts of this movie were emma stone and paul walter hauser. He is always likeable and continues to impress me (1 viewing, 6/1/2021)",Cruella
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The De Vil wears Dalmatian print.,6,6 September 2021,"'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10.",Cruella
18,ThomasDrufke,Pleasant Surprise,8,6 July 2021,"A surprise for the ages. Cruella is stylish, fun and full of life - a sentence I surely didn't expect I'd be saying this year at all for yet another Disney re-imagining. Containing twists and turns, along with a fantastic few lead performances, it's hard to not fall in love with many aspects to Cruella. As far as I'm concerned, this is up there with Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast and Jungle Book as the best live-action adaptations.8.0/10.",Cruella
19,cricketbat,"It has a very interesting look, but it's not my style",4,27 May 2021,"Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look, but it's not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of ""show, don't tell,"" by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence, as the soundtrack distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great, but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I don't mean to be cruel, but this unnecessary prequel is an overly long series of disjointed scenes.",Cruella
20,westsideschl,Creative in Many Ways,8,3 October 2021,"Kudos for some creative (not done before repeatedly) storytelling although the petty theft ""poor stealing from the rich"" angle is old. I question the premise in storylines that it's acceptable (as well as getting away with it) in either direction (poor from rich, or rich from poor) to steal. The Sia look goes all the way back to ""The One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", and ""101 Dalmatians"".

24,briancham1994,Fantastically theatrical,8,30 October 2021,"This film is as theatrical as the titular Cruella. Every frame is punctuated with deep colours, a warm historical setting and flamboyant costumes. The acting of Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are the highlight, as they both play hilariously self-absorbed individuals obsessed with power and publicity. This film more than surpassed my expectations with many fast-paced and entertaining sequences that add some comedic relief. I do have a few concerns with plot holes(1), overly cartoonish action scenes(2) and shoddy special effects(3), but overall it was a fine addition to Disney's catalogue.(1) How does this relate to the Cruella of 101 Dalmatians? Why does Estella have a birth certificate? Why did the Baroness keep the birth certificate at all? How can the Baroness not recognise Cruella's face and voice immediately? How does Estella inherit the mansion if she's legally dead?(2) The death of Cruella's mother

25,Thanos_Alfie,Enjoyable...,6,8 June 2021,"""Cruella"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we follow the story of a teenaged girl, Estella who had the dream of becoming a fashion designer. Her life changes and we watch how this young girl becomes the famous Cruella de Vil.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot, consisted of some plot twists that I did not expect. I also enjoyed the direction which was made by Craig Gillespie and how he presented his main character and how she evolved through the duration of the movie. The only thing that I would change it would be the duration of it because I think it was a bit too long. The interpretations of both Emma Thompson who played as The Baroness and Emma Stone who played as Estella / Cruella de Vil were simply amazing and the combination of them worked very well. All in all, I have to say that ""Cruella"" is a nice and enjoyable movie to spend your time with but be prepared for more than a two hour movie.",Cruella

One of disneys villain characters to 101 Dalmations. Which is an interesting spin on the character. Seeing her perspective on what makes her the way she is. Being caught in a dark fashion designing world.What worked? It is a decent story on Cruella. Showing her younger years on being outcast in school. And being on her own after an incident with her mother. She meets her two side kick friends. Then, she and her friends bounce around from stealing and her getting a job in a fashion design company lead by Emma Thompson. Which she is more evil than Cruella herself.Emma Stone delivered playing Cruella. She had fun with her role. Playing a character that changes throughout as she becomes a antihero character. Emma Thompson did a good job playing a villain character as well. While the rest of the cast did okay as well.It is a fun and dark twisted direction which the film had fun with. Plus the soundtrack was great.What did not work?The film is overlong. It dragged on parts. And felt slow in most scenes. Which could have been trimmed down.And the plot is a decent origin story but also a very forgettable and dull with its script. That does make this one forgettable origin villain story.There is a fun mid credit scene that is worth seeing. But it is a fair film that may satisfy some audiences while others may get bored with its slow direction.",Cruella
27,eddie_baggins,A middle of the road film we didn't need,5,3 June 2021,"While I'm not convinced the world was crying out for an origin story of one of Disney's most iconic villains Cruella de Vil, Disney in all their might and wisdom decided we do and after all, the world conquering house of the mouse appears to be on a hot streak of late so who am I disagree with their decision?Going for the Covid-19 impacted hybrid release that see's this high profile film available to rent at home for a premium price or showing in cinemas for those willing to plunge into the outside world once more, Cruella finds its way in viewing lounges and cinema complexes around the world in what is an experience that can only be described as a Joker-lite attempt at providing context to a dog killing fashionista and how she came to be.Directed by indie-darling Craig Gillespie, who's last high profile affair was the darkly comedic I, Tonya (of which this film also feels related too in tone and style), Cruella is a devious mix of of black comedy, straight up drama and crime caper as Emma Stone's Estella/Cruella begins to uncover truths about her troubled past that has lead to a life of crime and potential salvation/damnation under the employment of Emma Thompson's cold-hearted socialite and fashion icon The Baroness.It's a fairly light story, there's not a lot of meat on the bones of this particular offering and Gillespie's incessant use of almost every famous song you can recall hearing and inventive camera movements and editing can only take the film so far, with a real feeling throughout that there's no real point too any of this other than Disney going for easy wins, even if the work of Stone and Thompson showcases two talented performers that appear too be having more fun than we do with the material at hand.Taking a back seat to her career since her Oscar moment with La La Land in 2016/17, Stone has lost none of her energetic charm and sassy smarts in the years she's been more dormant than you've come to expect and her Arthur Fleck like Cruella makes for an intriguing central character even if overall she's relatively by the numbers when it comes to villains with purpose while Thompson goes for full scene chewing as the detestable Baroness who appears to not have a single redeeming feature in her being.At a smidgen over two hours, Cruella outstays its welcome by a good 30 or so minutes as the story of Cruella's quest for vengeance on past wrongdoings and determination to make her mark on the world gets bogged down in some rather repetitive and not overly exciting set pieces and while the films strong production values (that call to mind a late 80's early 90's Tim Burton film), committed performances and stunning costume designs provide eye candy and superficial joys, Cruella can't make its mark where it counts and becomes an exercise in nothingness with the 101 Dalmatian franchise and the lore around Cruella herself not feeling like they gained much from this particular escapade.Final Say -Well made and featuring a scattering of inventive and memorable moments, Cruella is arguably more enjoyable than it had a right to be but as a whole its still a forgettable and unnecessary addition to the Disney cannon of beloved staples.2 1/2 street concerts out of 5.",Cruella
28,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,7,1 June 2021,"Cruella is quite an enjoyable ride. The main character is the center of the film and, as it turns out, is the only thing that keeps things going, adding fresh notes here and there. Emma Stone does a great job and she does what she does best, spits out line after line with a force that is irresistable. Her character's sassiness almost brings back memories of Jack Sparrow.So, yes, this time Disney did it right, and this was not like Maleficent, whose evil presence was overshadowed by the glossy graphics. But, even though this one does not have the previous films CGI, it does have interesting stylistic and hearstyle choices, along with a beautifully gothic background.Still, the story needed a bit more to be more memorable, even rewatchable. Other than the main character and the punk rock influances, the main story is pretty basic and predictable.",Cruella
29,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Disney delivers a spicy, crunchy and nasty live-action adaption to villainous heroism of Cruella.",6,29 May 2021,"Cruella (2021) :
Movie Review -With so many popular animated Flicks in 20th century Disney became number 1 boss in the field. But then in mid 90s Pixar came and is still ruling the field with one-sided Dominance and then there are other production houses too, like DreamWorks who are doing good with their content. Thrown out of competition, Disney decided to do live-action remakes to deliver standalone success and they did well with 'Beauty and The Beast' and 'The Lion King' but none is considered as classy as the original version. Now, with Cruella, Disney has got something sort of original because it concerns as prequel to blockbuster '101 Dalmatians' which provides them enough space to give a nice start to the new journey of popular character 'Cruell De Ville'. If we can say so then it's Disney's attempt to entert into villain zone, something what DC did recently with 'Joker'. However, the presentation is not that dark and not that intense, rather it is funny, wild and crazy.Set in London during the punk rock movement of the 1970s, the film revolves around Estella, an aspiring fashion designer, explores the path that will lead her to become a notorious up and coming fashion designer known as Cruella de Vil. You see, Cruella doesn't have any intelligent theories, it's just a mad mad revenge which prefers to remain dumb intentionally. It gets into something suddenly without clarifying details, then suddenly changes the course of narrative but that's because it has some really interesting twists. Those should have looked tragic but don't know why, somehow, it just don't look tragic at all. However, it successfully proves the point according to situations and don't really fall down illogically.Emma Stone as Estella is underwhelming but as Cruella she is overwhelming. The tone of voice, accent and attitude she carries in the latter version is brilliant. Emma Thompson as Baroness is simply unbeatable. From the first scene to the last, she just don't go out of the zone and the impact is truly impressive. In supporting roles Joel Fry is good and Paul Hauser is damn funny. Cruella has engaging screenplay but drags a little in the second half where all the things become too predictable. Even the climax has an outdated twist but thankfully we enjoy it as it was never about showing a positive side of the character.The Visual effects are decent, music and background score is amazing and dialogues are crunchy. Craig Gillespie is yet to make a solid film till date, maybe because he lacked fantastic scripts and his longing continues with Cruella. He makes a good film no doubts, but it could have been really better with more proper set-ups and execution. His storytelling may look interesting because all this female villain stuff is not common, but that doesn't mean he has outclassed other directors. Overall, Cruella is indeed a fun watch if the expectations are not that high.RATING - 6.5/10*",Cruella

32,southdavid,The de Vil wears Prada.,8,6 June 2021,"With relatively low expectations I went to see ""Cruella"" having been underwhelmed by live action ""101 Dalmatians"" films and the more recent ""Maleficent"" movies. So, I was pleasantly surprised by how clever and funny I found the film to be.An orphan on the streets of 60's London, Estella (Emma Stone) works her way into a fashion house of The Baroness (Emma Thompson). As she joins the inner circle, she comes to realise that she has more reasons to hate her boss than just her abusive personality and decides to create an alter ego to take everything she has. With her friends Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) 'Cruella' takes the fashion world by storm with her guerrilla tactics and enfant terrible identity. But as revelations about Estella's origins come to light, so she retreats more and more into the extreme personality.What impresses me most about ""Cruella"" is the effort that's gone into it. I can see where the initially instinct might have been to maximise profit for minimum effort and churn out a basic kids film but that not what they've done. There are five credited writers, not including Dodie Smith, but including Tony McNamara, whose series ""The Great"" I'm enjoying a lot too. Together they've crafted an interesting story that weaves in clever precursor moments to the animated films. It's generally quite amusing too, only resorting to slapstick nonsense a couple of times.I really liked the setting and the score. Last 60's, Early 70's London looks cool, and fitting it around the androgyny of the fashion and so much of the music of the time was an excellent choice. Emma Stone is excellent, as too are Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser as her two lackies Jasper and Horace - it's as much an origin story for them as it is for Cruella. The cast includes British comedy mainstays Kayvan Novak and Jamie Demetriou, both of who maximise their small roles.I suppose, having relatively recently watched all four ""101 Dalmatians"" films, as part of my complete Disney Plus watchthrough and feeling very much played out by the series the best resolution I can say about this film is that I'd happily watch this incarnation of the characters do another one.",Cruella

Directed by Craig Gillespie the film is about the origins of Cruella(Emma Stone) an inspiring fashion designer who's birth mother was killed by the cunning Baroness(played by the always brilliant Emma Thompson)when Cruella was a kid(the film shows us her as a black and white girl being bullied for her hair).So Cruella now seeks revenge with the baroness by working for her company as her alter ego Estella(which was her birth name before she changed it). But is the Baroness really as she seems?.Overall I enjoyed this film as it wasn't a shot for shot like 101 Dalmations and Emma Stone wasn't trying to be Glenn Close(who serves as a producer for this film btw). Stone's Cruella was more like Harley Quinn from Sucide Squad with the voice-over and the mannerisms. It's even the longest Disney remake that Disney made and its the second orign story after Maleficent.This film is aimed for an older audience as its not a kids film.",Cruella

Below 13 or so years old probably wouldn't be appropriate-it's rated PG_13. It kind of reminded me of the Joker origin story where they tell you what helped shape their lives and here's a fun fact; If you look at Cruella de Vil's name and put de Vil together, what's that spell? Emma S plays Estella-later to become Cruella-a young girl that wants to be a fashion designer. Emma T plays the current top designer in London during the 1970's that Emma S gets a job with. Joel & Paul are Emma S's friends that were also thieves that taught her how to survive on the streets after 12 year old Emma S became an orphan. As adults, Joel & Paul became Emma S's henchmen. Mark plays Emma T's assistant. Cruella is a persona that Emma S assumes-sort of like a secret identity-when she starts her designer career to keep it a secret from Emma T. I enjoyed the music a lot, since they played quite a few songs I liked. I remember hearing Supertramp, ELO, Queen, and even some Black Sabbath-there were plenty others too including a Beatles cover of Come Together. There is a scene just as the end credits start but nothing at the very end.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes.I and my wife-she is a big Disney fan-really enjoyed it and I would buy it on DVD.",Cruella

When she gets her opportunity from the most famous fashion designer on the planet she knocks her socks off and has a chance for stardom; unfortunately, a secret about her mother's death arises and Cruella will have to decide between following her career aspirations to riches and fame OR beginning a rampage of revenge.... This movie is directed by Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) and stars Emma Stone (The Help), Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibly), Joel Fry (Game of Thrones), Mark Strong (1917) and John McCrea (Dracula). The storyline for this picture is very uneven. The beginning was just okay until she lands in her field...then the movie is awesome...till the very end where it gets very Disney and too far fetched.

39,alindsay-al,An Above Average Fun Film,6,1 June 2021,"After what feels like forever, I finally went back to the cinema today to watch Cruella and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young woman try to get into the fashion world and become the woman that will become Cruella De Vil.Main Character
Emma Stone plays Cruella in the film and I thought she was fantastic, she just seems to be having so much fun in this role and it seems to be a role that was ready made for her and that she was born to play. Some will argue that she isn't exactly the character we know from the previous stories and did we really need a film that tries to make her a sympathetic figure, but Stone really excels at it and rises this film above where it really should be.Supporting Characters
Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser play her friends in the film and they are a nice trio to watch on screen with Hauser in particular providing some memorable scenes and laughs which was needed. It is funny that Emma Thompson plays a more typical Cruella De Vil as an antagonist and she is also really good and clearly having a blast as the bad guy and the two Emma's are easily the best part of the film for me. Though, there are a few issues here. Mark Strong is in this film and he does very little, it is kind of like why did they bother getting Strong if they weren't going to give him a more meaty and interesting role. Also Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Anita feels like a part of the film that feels out of place and it isn't really her fault but the character is incredibly bland and it feels she was in this film to try and humanize Cruella and it just doesn't work.Story
The story is fine, Cruella has a decent backstory and it is represented really well on screen. The relationship between Emma Stone and Emma Thompson is really well done and is really entertaining to watch the two of them work together and go head to head on screen. But the film thinks it is really clever with the twists and turns but it comes across as forced and are elements that you can see them coming from a million miles away. No spoilers, but the ending also feels really forced and not earned which is a disappointment when you consider that this is a pretty long film.Script
The script is similar to the plot, in that is is okay but won't be remembered. There are some fun exchanges that goes on between the characters but it feels like that is mainly down to the performers and not the strength of the writing. Also, it is a really predictable film and it is hard to avoid the feeling that you knew what was going to happen in every scene.Style
The film looks really good, for a film that focuses so much on fashion design it was important for the costumes to be well realised and they are fantastic. It is overblown and exciting with an exciting sense of energy to it, which is hurt by one thing and that is the fact that it is way too long. The film is over 2 hours and it feels like this would be a much better film if they cut 10 minutes at least off of it and tightened up the plot.Overall
Overall, Cruella is an above average film. Some really good performances mixed with a fun style makes this an entreating watch that is let down by just having too much going on and a film that is just too long. If you like the look of the trailers then go watch Cruella and support your local cinema as they re-open.",Cruella

Not being an English major, I do not really know how to type out phonetically the now two possible pronunciations for this common dish.

But CRUELLA suggests in its final discussion of the title character's limousine license plate that the devil's ""e"" can be said as a ""long"" vowel, making those eggs-of-the-future seem very English indeed.

Many times, it reminded me of Tim Burton works, almost without his signature dark atmosphere though.The VFX is very well-done and I, truly cannot say for sure, were the superbly smart dogs real or not?! (They seemed real :)) Loved all the sequences with them, being the smallest (~10 pounds!) cute one, the middle ultra-intelligent and ""polite"" one, up to the beautiful Dalmatians, either feeling (constantly) guilty, so cute, or growling and showing some teeth.It's a tale about cold revenge, beautifully told, loosely based on and a sort of prequel to the book ""101 Dalmatians"", showing us the definition of a young to-be Cruella, the value of friendship and the real treasures that good friends are. It depicts the journey that Estella embarks on to avenge her mother! And in the process becoming Cruella...Loved the first half much much more, up to the fire. It was very well-made with an amazing flow. The second part seemed to me mild and a little rushed, maybe badly cut and edited, almost without that (first part) brilliancy, its superb fashion styling and a much more engaging flow.

With great support by Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser and in the origins of what made Cruella a villain but also one that was a needy person and you wonder why she turned out the say she did.Set in the 1970's there and how that she was kind of like a female Clark Kent, mild mannered Estella her real name and of course, Cruella the title character.As she seeks revenge against the person she thinks is responsible for killing her mother as there is a twist in the end there.

49,AudioFileZ,Bloody Brilliant,8,1 June 2021,"I have no idea who planted the seed that became this movie but a phrase comes to mind: ""bloody brilliant"". First, there's a character that is wonderfully eccentric and hasn't been given the deserved due - truly ripe for unencumbered exploration. What follows is by any standard a creative stroke of genius.From the start this movie grabs ones senses. The spectacular cinematography from the red Disney logo explodes in chromatic blends of moody monochromes and dazzling colors. Hazy UK scapes (and that 2-tone hair) with illuminated colors. It's fitting eye-candy for a wild story to be sure. Then there's some tasty iconic music for ""hooks"" at proper intervals exploring more of one's senses to be sure.Emma Stone as Cruella is more than a spot-on live-action Disney adaptation. It's like the old brand found gold in taking one of it's great animated characters into an awakening for the studio. A deliciously insidious story that snaps with a fantastic side of Emma Thompson you never imagined as the evil ""Barroness"" completes a true tour de force of ""The Emmas""!.This is a heaping of pure entertainment with unleashed creativity. A real gem that promises more to come. Has Disney reinvented itself spectacularly?",Cruella
50,masonsaul,Surprisingly really good,7,1 June 2021,"Despite its overly long run time, some poor CG and weak child actors at the beginning, Cruella is still surprisingly really good and definitely one of the better Disney live action remainings that's funny, stylish and gleefully over the top.

Craig Gillespie's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and visually stunning. The soundtrack is amazing.",Cruella
51,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Prequel,8,6 November 2021,"Another one Jaime and I watched on our honeymoon. We wanted to see this in the theater but we were busy and couldn't make it work. It's wild to take a villain like Cruella de Vil and make her sympathetic by having the Baroness, our villain here, be worse. Cruella in 101 Dalmatians is a puppy killer. Baroness is a murderer. In movies, killing people is less heinous than killing dogs but I'll digress.Emma Stone kills it in this role. I love seeing the backstory to her being the character she is. Emma Thompson is great as the Baroness. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are great as the henchmen we'll know later. Seeing their beginnings as thieves and their connection is fun. It also humanizes them. John McCrea is also great as Artie.There is a bit to be desired for the CGI. The soundtrack is amazing though. I had a lot of fun with this movie despite its longer runtime.",Cruella
52,jadepietro,Spot On,8,30 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Wonderful over-the-top costumes and deft comic performances make this movie lots of fun.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Every legendary villain (or villainess) needs an origin story to justify their fame and notoriety. It's a Hollywood tradition. One need only see their cinematic backstories in many films that honor the likes of Hannibal Lecter, Darth Vader, Norman Bates, Nurse Ratched, or the Joker to rectify the issue. Disney is always keen on resurrecting their baddies with updated versions of Maleficent and the Queen of Hearts to keep up the tradition alive. Hence it comes to reason that Cruella de Vil must get her fitting entitlement...and she does in this very entertaining family fare.So let me begin by saying I loved, loved, loved the outlandish costumes in Cruella, the real star of the movie, and that is, in no way, a put-down of the movie! Send the Oscar directly to Jenny Beavan...STAT! Her artistry is dazzling. Each outfit has its own special theatricality and seems to evoke many designers from that era...as if they had gone stark raving mad. (I particularly loved the garbage ensemble with its lavishly long train and her large-scale head-to-limo evening gown.) Ms. Beaven's ability to exaggerate her kitschy outfits and make them haute couture chic, plus her mix of fabric patterns, immediately establishes the characters' traits and puts the whole film wonderfully off the rail, as it should. (Brava to the hair and make-up design by Nadia Stacey too.)That said, this film itself is a joyous romp, a raucous comedy made more for adults than kids. The movie follows a young precocious and fashion-minded Estella as she grows in adulthood to embody that infamous evil mastermind, complete with her own set of Dalmatians. However, the story takes a tad too long to get to that destination. Script-wise, the plot gets too convoluted and makes the misstep of earnestly trying to soften the vileness of the title character by providing some vulnerability and a rationale for her bi-polar behavior instead of embracing Cruella's pure evil.Now Cruella de Vil has always been the epitome of avarice. She is the perfect frenzied quintessence whom one grew up loving to hate. Yet the screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara wants us to cast that image aside and sympathize with her plight rather than revel in her meanness. She has been morphed into a talented and ambitious lower class fashionista who has been bullied and victimized all her life by an unjust society and is only seeking to avenge her misbegotten existence. Her hard edges have been buffed clean. (There is also a third act reveal that seemed more like a contrived plot device than a well-earned twist.) A few more rewrites and some concise editing would have been warranted to streamline the storytelling, even though the writers do create vivid characters and their dialog has many good one-liners and sight gags.Yes, there is a great deal to admire beside the grandoise top-notch production design and comic moments on display, especially whenever the two divas take centerstage. As, Cruella, Emma Stone is marvelous. Using her saucer-shaped eyes to her best advantage, she expresses the character's frustration and creative jags which mimic her avatar to maximum effect. However, the real villain in this reboot is Emma Thompson as Cruella's true nemesis, Baroness von Hellman. She out-Cruellas Cruella in her disdain and insensitivity to others. The actress steals the spotlight with her narcissistic snobbery and snide asides, delivering the film's ultimate comic performance. She, and surprisingly not Cruella, is the Queen of Mean and more than worthy foe. (Hopefully Dame Thompson will add another Oscar nomination to her resume.)But there are many acting joys to experience beside the two unrestrained leads: As Jasper and Horace, Cruella's bumbling henchmen, Joey Fry and a superb Paul Walter Hauser are absolutely wonderful foils. John McCrea is Artie, an openly gay dress designer who brings the necessary pastiche to his/her role. (Uncle Walt might be tossing to and fro in his grave with the movie's pro-gay stance and unflinching outrageousness. Too bad.) Director Craig Gillespie gives his film the perfect 60's mod vs. Punk vibe and builds his characters' interrelationships with much style and glee. Everyone is a walking live-action cartoon who come to life as delightful incarnations of the Disney 1961 animated source.Cruella is a wicked delight. (GRADE: B)",Cruella

A little long and boring
The Stupidity Syndrome Of The Characters
The CGI work needs some buffing

The Origin story rewrite is confusing for the character.The VerdictCruella surprised me with how much it chose to do as compared to what it promised in the trailers. The movie handles the characters well, integrating many pieces into a game of chess and using them throughout the movie in meaningful manners be it comedy or story purposes. A fantastic attention to the visual elements, primarily the fashion, lives well in the image of Cruella and brings with it a modern edge that though out of place in the time period, is fun to watch alongside the fitting music. Thanks to stunning performances from an excellent cast, alongside some better story planning, Cruella's origin story really does have a lot more going for it than many of the live action moments. However, I agree with many fans that the visual style is not for everyone, and the CGI obsession is a little too much given many of the stunts could have had live dogs. Throw in some story inconsistencies, glorifying being just a vengeful and angry person, the competence limitations of some characters, and a lot of mimicking of other movies though, and I get this movie is not the most impressive display they have put out. Overall though, it's worthy of a trip and finally made a live action film again that did not destroy the fun of the original film, or completely shame it.Scores:Comedy/Crime: 8.0

55,valadas,Seducing and attractive,7,9 June 2021,Emma Stone (Estella/Cruella) and Emma Thompson (The Baroness) are indeed two brilliant performers. And the movie is very attractive in visual terms (the sceneries and the charaters' attire and make-up). The sound track has wonderful music including a few well known old songs. The story is very well displayed and acted. It is the rivalry between a famous fashion designer (the Baroness) and a petty thief (Estella / Cruella) who begins to profit of her designing talent to attract the attention of the Baroness as her minor employee while she disguises herself as Cruella becoming also very famous. This movie is good enough to rivet your attention pleasantly till the end.,Cruella
56,Abdulxoxo,Artemis fowl 2.0,5,3 June 2021,"This is pretty much just another overblown, over-budgeted Disney entry that looks good on the outside but is hollow and boring on the inside. The movie was long to begin with. There's nothing in there to keep it running for 2hr. Emma Stone is good and she played the character well but there's something misfitting about the her and the character. At one point she developed an alter ego, where calls herself ""cruella"". Well, if you're cruella, then do something cruel at least. Emma Thompson was better albeit her character was pointlessly pathetic. Overall, the characters are predicable in their personalities. I think the direction and the script are to be blame. The script is mediocre and so is the direction. Lots of superfluous, corny, illogical scenes could have been cut out and would have made the film 20 min less longer and ultimately less boring. The highlight which is the rivalry between Cruella and Baroness, was interesting and entertaining to watch but it took forever to began. The production value and costumes were very good-looking, I'll give them that but that is to be expected considering the film's budget. Soundtrack is good, and individually the songs are some of my favorites but there were too many of them here, misused and too literal for some of the scenes. Overall, this is a one-time watch for me. Good looking and well-performed but the script fell short.",Cruella
57,arungeorge13,A performance showcase for both Emmas! [+63%],6,29 May 2021,"There's a manic energy to the proceedings in Cruella, featuring a couple of rock-solid performances from both Emmas (Stone & Thompson). Writers Dana Fox and Tony McNamara attempt to humanize a future dog murderer(?) by adding a tragic family backstory; it allows the character of Estella to evolve with sufficient breathing space. Obvious comparisons to The Devil Wears Prada (and Joker) aside, the film makes stupendous use of its resources - be it in its ravishing costumes & make-up, killer production design, a fantastic soundtrack, or the depiction of Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) as believably funny sidekicks. A special shoutout goes to Wink, the adorable chihuahua, whose presence really lights (and lightens) up the film.Cruella, in 2021, makes you forget that she's the vicious antagonist from a 1956 novel and a 1996 movie. Director Craig Gillespie plants her in a particularly intriguing universe where the character's ultimate goal is to avenge her mother and become London's next fashion icon. What turns her into the supervillain from 101 Dalmatians is only hinted at and never explicitly put across. Plotwise, this may not sync well with the original's continuity, but the good thing is, Cruella works fine as a standalone. Emma Stone's slow-yet-nasty turn as Cruella is certainly something to behold while Emma Thompson's narcissistic showcase as The Baroness is the perfect foil. It's girl-boss-power all the way!The heists, however outlandish they seem, are presented with remarkable visual flair. The CGI dogs are a bit of a bother, but director Gillespie ensures those obvious graphical hiccups aren't over-exposed. What if this film was just about a woman wanting to exact revenge, set in the world of fashion, and not necessarily Cruella's? That thought struck me more than once during and after the film. In that sense, this origin story thematically has more in common with Wicked than Joker in its reimagining of a notorious antagonist. The big difference here is that the character of Joker has had multiple appearances and interpretations, both in comic books and films. The source material for Cruella is a children's novel and a half-decent movie, both portraying the character as a straightforward baddie obsessed with fur coats.",Cruella
58,martimusross,Some Brilliant Frocks & Endearing Dogs!,7,26 June 2021,"CruellaI would say this is not a movie to be missed!Overall I enjoyed the movie and luckily found my inner child, this film was made for a very young audience and kept many of the elements that made the original cartoon so memorable were repeated here. It was more problematic for an adult audience as the confrontational scenes of menace and ego were repeated throughout with little variety.If the truth be known it was Cruella's side-kicks, Horace and Jasper, played by Fry and Hauser, that raised this movie up, and Winks, the dog, should get the pet Oscar. There were many brilliant cameos and you could see the luvvies were in their element!I get the choosing of a fashion designer as the progenitor for Cruella but ultimately she was an evil dog-murderer master criminal, they dumbed down this evilness and replaced it with posture. Emma Thompson was really good but she was not meant to be the main focus and Emma Stone overworked the same three faces, sullen, nasty or coquettish.I'm giving this a weak 7 out of 10, inventive, entertaining and memorable for the frocks, it would have been an 8 but it was overly long and several scenes dragged, it needed better editing!",Cruella

60,Pumpkin_Man,One of the Best Movies of the Year!!!,10,30 May 2021,"I was really surprised by just how much I enjoyed this live-action retelling of Cruella De Vil's origin story. I saw this along with A Quiet Place Part II, and I honestly liked Cruella much more. It was fun, edgy, dark, quirky, and had a great soundtrack. Emma Stone was phenomenal as Cruella. It was fun watching her go from repressed nerdy girl to the infamous villain we all know and...hate. First off, she isn't really trying to kill any dogs in this movie, so if you were worried about that, you can sigh of relief now.At a young age, Estella has a flair for fashion and talent, but she has a cruel streak, leading her mom to call her 'Cruella' One night at a party for the wealthy Baroness von Hellman, her mom is pushed off a cliff to her death by Hellman's Dalmatians.Years later, Estella is a grifter and works with Jasper and Horace. For her Birthday, they get her a job at the Liberty Department Store. After being tossed aside by her boss, she gets drunk and makes an offbeat window display. This causes the Baroness to take an interest in her and show her the ropes of fasion designing. Estella soon realizes that the Baroness is wearing her necklace that her mother gave her at a young age, so she plans to steal it back. This starts her on her journey to becoming Cruella and tries to one up the Baroness at every turn.This movie was like The Devil Wears Prada crossed with Joker and I really enjoyed it. I would happily buy it again and hope to see a sequel someday. If you love the 101 Dalmatians movie, you'll love to witness the birth of...CRUELLA!!!",Cruella

Cruella belongs to same genre but with different style and attitude.Based on The Hundred and One Dalmatians by Dodie Smith, Cruella is the live-action adaptation in the 101 Dalmatians franchise which is prequel and tells how Estella (played by Emma Stone) becomes Cruella De Vil after she gets the chance to land in her dream job at an atelier run by the Baroness Von Hellman (played by Emma Thompson).As the movie begins , you are introduced to the 1960's era in England with fantastic introduction of each character. The film captures some of best moments when Estella begins her journey of lifetime to find her identity. The fantasy world , unbelievable characters and funny comic scenes puts icing on the cake. Hats off to Craig Gillespie (I,Tonya, Million Dollar Arm and The Finest Hour) for doing his job brilliantly. The screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara works as you will be engaged in the cold war between Cruella and the Baroness. CGI is outstanding adding colors to the brilliant visual effects. The eye-catching cinematography , gorgeous sets , amazing art -direction and superb visual effects make the film worth watching more than once.Emma Stone gives yet another stupendous performance. The actress of Zombieland (2009) , Easy A (2010) , Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the drama The Help (2011). Is growing stronger day by day. Veteran actress Emma Stone is perfect for the role of cunning and selfish Baroness von Hellman. She brings out the spark every time she appears on screen. Kudos to other actors who keep the movie entertained with lovely performances.Overall, Cruella is clever and stylish reboot to the classic Walt Disney's 101 Dalmatians with sterling performances.

The Emmas are just fantastic as usual, and the rest of the cast is doing their best to keep up! All in all, a fun family movie I recommend!",Cruella
65,blott2319-1,Not every villain needs to be adapted to a hero,6,9 October 2021,"I was in the minority (at least among cinema buffs) in that I actually found some enjoyment from the way Maleficent reinvented the Disney villain, presenting her story from a different perspective that allowed us to see her as a protagonist rather than an antagonist. But not every Disney villain needs this same kind of treatment. I was extremely leery of Cruella before even sitting down to watch it, and it turns out my skepticism was warranted. This is not a very good film, and follows some highly predictable beats. It is clearly copying a number of films that came before, and frankly I'm not a big fan of those movies either. I do not care one bit about the fashion industry and a petty rivalry between a couple of designers, whether it is in The Devil Wears Prada or Cruella. I was OK with some of the family drama, and I like the humor brought in by Horace and Jasper, but the plot as a whole was a miss for me.I also think the fact that this movie is titled ""Cruella"" and has any attachment to 101 Dalmatians adds nothing to the story. They shoehorn in dogs simply to connect the dots, but those aspects of this movie have zero impact. The filmmakers even make a point of casting Cruella as the superior dog lover just to completely undermine the movies of their past. If they stripped this entire movie of all 101 Dalmatian references, I could see it being a decent script in its own right, but they just can't resist cashing in on nostalgia. Perhaps the most frustrating thing of all is that they created a movie which sanitizes one of their most despicable and pure evil villains, and they do it by adding Emma Thompson as an utterly despicable and pure evil villain. I guess all the young people can just wait another 60 years and go see the ""Baroness"" movie which will redeem her character and make it clear she was not that bad.",Cruella
66,reddiemurf81,"Anyway, must dash. Much to avenge, revenge, and destroy.",6,9 October 2021,"Emma Stone and Emma Thompson, I love you!!! You were both epic in this.Now,, let me first say that there was a lot about this that I really liked. Also,, a bit I didn't. Lot of the Devil wears Prada in this.Cruella witnesses her mother die in a horrible accident as a young girl, and grows up on the streets with two friends who teach her how to become a theif. They spend 10 yrs working angle after angle,, until Cruella begins a real job working as a fashion designer,, which leads her to meeting the Baroness (Thompson), a fashion mogul.In the Baroness Cruella finds a cold, heartless woman that has no regard for anyone but herself,, yet Cruella goes to work for her and strives to please her. The closer Cruella works with her new boss, the more she discovers about the night her mother was killed,, which leads Cruella on a mission to exact revenge.Now,, I loved Emma Stone (in everything!!) playing the role of Cruella. She was perfect. Emma Thompson is always amazing, and no less so as the Baroness. The supporting cast is very good as well (especially Mark Strong). The sets, costumes, direction, photography, and pace were also very good.I didn't like the inclusion of a cross-dressing character (Artie). Disney doing this,, ugh. I also didn't care for the use of the Stones song Sympathy for the Devil close to the end. I get why,, just thought it was not the best choice (for ending Interview with a Vampire,, absolutely!!

67,thekarmicnomad,Destined to chase its own tail,5,14 June 2021,"This film wasn't designed for me - my girlfriend liked it more than I did.The performance are predictably great and there is quite a lot of fun to have here.There is action and some good story and lots of outfits and stuff going on. I think a younger audience will really get into this.The main issue I have with this film is contrivance.The aim of the film is to get Cruella from child to the point where she tries to kill and skin a hundred puppies in the original cartoon.To have any chance of doing that a lot of stupid stuff has to happen. We have to repaint Dalmatians as awful creatures that deserve to be made into clothes, we need Cruella to be good so we root for her but at the same time be a psychotic narcissist - sometimes in the same scene.Now, we can cut this film a bit of slack as it is a kids film as long as we get Cruella to where she needs to go.But wait, no we haven't.Cartoon-Cruella was written as an evil, bungling, psychopath with little redeeming qualities designed to give kids nightmares.When we leave Cruella in the 2021 film she is literally gifting people thank-you-puppies.So it fails on both points.This really should have been a film detached from 101 Dalmatians - there really is very little connecting the two apart from some character names.A couple of characters stood out as blatant diversity tokens. Which I didn't have an issue with but did stick out a bit. I think this practice will become so commonplace that soon it will just be the norm.A fun but pointless movie that would have been so much better if Disney had the spine to just write something new.",Cruella

Even if sometimes the ""homage"" of ""Devil Wears Prada"" seems almost a rip off, there is enough from ""Joker"" to make it different. The big problem is that Disney PG-13 limitations forced a shallower version of the later, and the ""Joker"" type stuff a darker and less funny version of ""Devil"", making it kind of a mess.In the end, it's a fine movie that is good enough if you forgive the fact that the relationships and drama are superficial and the character is too chaotic and doesn't evolve, it just shuffles between ""evil and not that evil to evil but also kind of good"" and ends up being presented as ""fully turned evil"" but then they sugarcoat this with not really evil actions in a way the film Joker doesn't, which fails the character, the most important part of the movie.

70,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An adequate villain backstory with some incredible costuming.,7,30 October 2021,"It seems the latest trend in the last few years is to take well-known villains and make them relatable through tragic backstories. While Maleficent (2014) seems to have started this string of villain-centric movies, Cruella (2021) does an adequate job of showing this villain's transformation while also making you want to root for her. However, the problem with idolizing someone like Cruella De Vil (Emma Stone) is that her eventual crime against the 101 Dalmatians (1961) is the desire to kill every single one of them in the name of fashion.While the plot pulls elements from Oliver Twist and All About Eve (1950), there are enough twists at the end of this film that make it worth the watch. Even if one of these moments had me laughing at how ridiculous it was, it all paid off because of Emma Stone's excellent acting throughout. Of course, it also helped that the flamboyant fashion Cruella designed was a legitimate shake-up of the industry of the time. I would be surprised if this film doesn't get a costuming nod at the next Academy Awards.Even though Cruella does a good job of making the audience sympathize with a known villain, there's nothing new here. A lot of the tropes seemed overused or forced. Trying to tie her traumatic upbringing to a hatred of dogs (particularly dalmatians) felt more like a knowing wink than an actual plot device. After all, it wasn't that the villain from the 1961 film hated the dogs; it was more that she needed their fur for her fashion statements. This disconnect to the source material felt off to me, even if the rest of the film showed how Cruella would do whatever was needed to get what she wanted.An adequate villain backstory with some incredible costuming, I give Cruella 3.5 stars out of 5.",Cruella

Stone is very good in this role - almost a perfect fit. However, it looks to me that she is having a much better time playing the evil ""R"" rated version of Cruella rather then the comic-bookish ""G"" rated version, so her performance is, at times, brilliant and at other times, not as brillaint.Emma Thompson steals just about every scene she is in as Cruella's nemesis ""The Baroness"". It's good to see this terrific actress getting a role that she can really sink her teeth in. I hope this leads to other, strong important roles for this actress ""of a certain age"".The supporting players are strong...or should I say...Mark Strong (hehehehe). He brings his usual gravitas to the role of The Baroness' right-hand man. But the players who impressed me the most were Joel Fry (YESTERDAY) and Paul Walter Hauser (RICHARD JEWELL) as Cruella's 2 best friends/henchmen. They both were able to flesh out these characters (who are usually portrayed as bumbling buffoons) and both were able to find the line between ""G"" and ""R"" very well - and stay on it the entire film.Director Craig Gillespie (I, TONYA) finds the correct tone for this film more often than not, but it is in the ""not"" portion of this that he fails this movie. The shifts in tone (often on a dime) are often jarring and the blame for this would have to be put right at the Director's feet, though the look of this film (sort of a 1960's Austin Powers meets SteamPunk look) succeeds VERY well and is as much a character in this film as the performers.One final thing, the soundtrack used in CRUELLA is an interesting touch. Gillespie and Composer Nicholas Britell eschews (for the most part) a conventional score and highlights most of the scenes with a Pop song - though here Gillespie whips us around tonally as well. For, since the film is set in 1960's London, a good many of the tunes used are '60 (and early '70's) rock hits. But....every now and then...he will drop in a '80's number.But...as I sit and write this review, I am finding myself falling more and more on the side of ""I Liked It"", so...set aside the tonal shifts...and you will be entertained by CRUELLA much more than you would expect.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Cruella
73,bob-the-movie-man,An astonishing attack on the senses as Disney goes to the dark side.,9,11 June 2021,"Positives:
The battle of the Emmas! It's really difficult to say who wins, since both Emma Thompson and Emma Stone give such fabulous performances here. You might think that Thompson steals a scene at one minute, only for Stone to come surfing in on a garbage truck and outdo her! I think it would be a surprise if both were not nominated for Actress and Supporting Actress Oscars for this. .The supporting cast is also very strong. Paul Walter Hauser picks up the 'comedy villain' role as Horace Badun, and is so entertaining I could just about forgive his 'gor-blimey-guvnor' cockney accent: one that gives Dick Van Dyke a run for his money. Joel Fry - most recognisable to me as the useless roadie from ""Yesterday"" - plays the straight man in the duo, and does it very well. Mark Strong, cast against type as an evil henchman (#humour) is as good as always. And Kirby Howell-Baptiste and John McCrea round off the strong ensemble cast. But a particular shout-out I think should go to young Tipper Seifert-Cleveland who plays the young Estrella: she's way down the cast list, but I thought she gave a knock-out performance to ground the dramatic opening scenes of the movie.Technically, the film is marvellous and surely in line for a slew of technical Oscars next awards season. In fact, I think - even at this early point in the year - you would be a VERY brave person to bet against Cruella picking up the awards for Hair and Makeup (Nadia Stacey), Costume (Jenny Beavan and Tom Davies) and Production Design (Fiona Crombie). It's a stunning technical achievement - a real attack on the senses.The cinematography (Nicholas Karakatsanis) is also spectacular. A 'single-take' fly-through of the Liberty store from top to bottom is a tour-de-force, worthy of ""1917""-style applause.And we should also add to this list a truly banging soundtrack from Nicholas Britell. Many of the tracks chosen - although regular visitors to cinema screen - catch the mood of the movie brilliantly and add to what is a joy-ride of a flick.The script is deliciously dark in places for a Disney film. Definitely NOT one for young children. Perhaps - given that it went down some of the roads it did, it could have been made EVEN BLACKER in places. (Did we REALLY need to see the Dalmatians again!) But some of the twists are delightful, especially 'mothageddon' which made me howl with laughter (even though I rather saw a variation of it coming).Negatives:
At 134 minutes, I felt the movie was a bit too long. There's a point (at about 100 minutes, where Emma Stone does her ""I am Cruella"" speech) which felt to me like the perfect end to a (first) film. I was delighted, happy and very content with the movie, thank-you very much. But then we dived back into the third reel. And, don't get me wrong, the ending was really entertaining. But, given that I suspect Disney KNEW that this was likely to be a big hit, I think a shorter film teasing for the sequel would have worked better.Additional Notes:
It's 12A certificate for a reason. Although a Disney, this is the dark-side of Disney and is not suitable for younger children.Yes, this one has a mid-credit scene - and for once its worth staying for: an introduction to two of the stars of the original cartoon that we haven't met yet, and for a rendition of a well-known tune (a TERRIBLE ear-worm that I've been quietly humming to myself ever since!).Summary Thoughts on ""Cruella"": The cinema summer's still young, but it's already had some tricks up its sleeve. First ""Nobody"" came out of nowhere to delight me. And now, what a surprise! ""Cruella"" is a blisteringly funny, gloriously colourful and hugely entertaining blockbuster.You'll know - if you follow my blog - that I'm not a fan of these Disney live-action re-imaginings of classic cartoons (although of course this one has previously had the Glenn Close treatment in two previous films in 1996 and 2000). But this is an origin story I really thought I didn't want... but now feel that I was wrong.I've seen it described as ""Devil Wears Prada meets Joker"". The Prada analogy is well-deserved. But I'm not sure I agree with the Joker analogy. In Joker, our anti-hero was an everyman (albeit a disturbed one) driven to madness and anarchy by others. In Cruella, it's all inbred and that makes it perhaps even more deliciously dark. The fact that Disney released this - forewarned by a distinctly sombre and stormy castle logo at the start - is a minor miracle, and hopefully signs of more spice and adventure to come.If you haven't caught it yet, it's highly recommended. As well as being in cinemas, its also available to buy on Disney+ streaming.(Please check out the full graphical review at One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

But this one went far beyond my expectations, it was actually good. I wasn't too sure how dark Disney was going to go since 101 Dalmatians is about Cruella skinning dogs for their fur, but I really enjoyed how tasteful this film was. The movie was dark, but not R rated dark. I love that this was an untold story. I think the film would have really tanked if it was scene for scene with the original cartoon. But instead I got to see a new story about the origins of Cruella. Emma Stone was fantastic in this film as you saw her change from one character to the next, she played the part of Cruella perfectly. The only thing I did not enjoy about the movie and I found really irritating was the poor CGI of the Dalmatian dogs. You could 100% tell that they were not real. And at times the other two dogs were computerized as well. I think with all the amazing money and technology that Disney has, compared to other CGI movies they definitely could have given us better.",Cruella

After traumatic events that see her alone and defenceless in London Estella is befriended by a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief and individuality. Joel Fry as Jasper and Paul Walter Hauser as Horace have some of the best comedic moments in Cruella as two street wise ruffians who like nothing more than to ""Pick a Pocket or two. They form a trio with young Cruella assisting her with her quest to be a fashion designer by devious means in gaining her employment at the famous ""Liberty"" Department Store.Estella's flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by 2-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson. Emma Thompson has never looked so chic her sense of comedy timing with sarcastically cruel one liners is superb .The Baroness and her best new fashion designer Estella's relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable, and revenge-bent Cruella.Other standout performances in this ensemble are John McCrea as Artie ,Estella's Camp fashion ally and Mark Strong as the valet to the Baroness.The Soundtrack to Cruella is fun and enjoyable with retro pop hits plus a fun Score by Nicholas Britell to set the action along at a cracking pace.Walt Disney Pictures announced the film's development in 2013, with Andrew Gunn as producer . Emma Stone was cast in 2016 and also serves as an executive producer on the film alongside Glenn Close, who previously portrayed Cruella in the previous live-action adaptations.Cruella had a huge estimated budget of $200million so it needs to be a big hit movie for Disney and I hope this film succeeds .It must be seen on a Cinema Screen don't wait for it to stream it's such a beautiful production and it's creativity needs to be seen as intended on a giant screen.Based on the book 101 Dalmations by Dodie Smith the 5 screenplay writers Steve Zisses, Kelly Marcel, Aline Brosch McKenna, Tony McNamarra, and Dana Fox have done a wonderful job at melding the prequel to Cruella DeVil to the classic 101 Dalmstions and possible sequels .",Cruella

Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stone's Cruella's defining character traits, which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material, as if times and culture didn't change from decade to decade.Since the start of Disney's live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste version of the same story, while others desire a completely different take on the well-known narrative. However, the best experience - and the primary goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isn't a remake but an origin(al) story based on a classic villain... And it's undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen this year until this day! I didn't expect to write an extensive review, but with so much to address, I know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article.Let me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into ""deep analysis mode"". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually, but it's how it differentiates Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone wears, the viewers can easily decipher what character she's playing. The differences between the glamorous, rich people that the Baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty, poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated through their wardrobes.The extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy costumes, but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britell's score carries little references to the music of the other installments, as does the film itself. Craig Gillespie doesn't hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the runtime, of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically, it's as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio, but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen, the CGI backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake of The Lion King.CGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime, which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However, the VFX don't look good enough, causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this, a specific outdoor location that's quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark, fake background that just feels way too off. Finally, the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the more ""logic-driven"" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this a nitpick, especially since it's not a film without silliness.In fact, Cruella's success partially rests on Gillespie's tone balance. Jasper and Horace become the comic-relief characters, starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from. Now, some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun. However, Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's screenplay carries undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker. Estella's life story is far from being a happy tale, and Cruella's rise even less. Overall, the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic, depressing, traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled, but there are a few moments where Gillespie lets it too loose, especially in the over-Disney-ish last fifteen minutes.So, let's address the two protagonists: Estella and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenix's take on Arthur Fleck / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation, Emma Stone's character follows a similar arc, but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered, self-indulgent Baroness, which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business. The Baroness' despicable treatment of Estella brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life, eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures.An unexpected, clever twist pretty much completes the protagonist's transformation, which genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didn't have high hopes for this origin story. Nevertheless, the well-written screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain, offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations. While it's true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous Baroness, Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, but I don't think there's room for another film that wouldn't hurt the one we just got. So, there's just one more aspect to delve into: the cast's performances.Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling connection to Estella, one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They become a family, living and stealing throughout their lives, but when Estella starts giving Cruella some screentime, a few issues arise within the trio. These problems are indeed approached and solved, but in a less dramatic manner than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent, rational Jasper, but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance is rarely affected by the characters' comedic banter, which is something the actors also deserve credit for.Emma Thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography, interpreting the Baroness von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her role, and the only reason why she doesn't steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene, making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating.Nevertheless, Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that she's one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood, Stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities. Without looking at the screen, any viewer will be able to know if she's talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character, but the mannerisms alter as well. It would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar nomination, so her chances are obviously thin. However, if there was an award for Best Monologue, Stone would be a strong contender.I don't recall how many minutes it really is, but I can't forget that long, uncut take with Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella in the span of milliseconds, her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt, character-defining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one but two impressive, attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for.Cruella is not only one of 2021's biggest surprises, but it's also one of the best movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative, Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin(al) story about one of Disney's classic villains. Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella transformation, giving her non-dog-killing, emotionally compelling motivations, a traumatic, depressing past, and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever, Emma Stone delivers an award-worthy display, interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion, stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations. Technically, the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen don't overcome the predictably Oscar-winning, stunning costume design, as well as the gorgeous makeup & hair, wonderful production design, and sweet score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this one of Disney's best live-action films in the last couple of decades.Rating: A-",Cruella

87,MrDHWong,"An enjoyable tale of deception, spitefulness, and a high-end display of fashion that cannot be ignored",7,10 June 2021,"""Cruella"" is a prequel to the 1956 novel ""The Hundred and One Dalmatians"" by Dodie Smith based on the antagonist Cruella de Vil. Starring Emma Stone in the title role and directed by Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya), it is an enjoyable tale of deception, spitefulness, and a high-end display of fashion that cannot be ignored.In the 1970s, young Estella Miller (Emma Stone) aspires to be a fashion designer but her mean-spirited actions towards other students earn her the nickname ""Cruella"" and cause her mother Catherine (Emily Beecham) to pull her from school. After Catherine's untimely death, Estella finds herself homeless in the city of London until she befriends street thieves Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser), who help her survive in exchange for creating clothes for their disguises. On Estella's eighteenth birthday, Jasper and Horace sneakily land her a job as a cleaner at a renowned department store where her rearranging of a window display attracts the attention of prestigious fashion CEO Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson). The Baroness soon offers her an opportunity to work for her company and Estella soon realises that her dreams of becoming famous are now well within her grasp.Origin stories in film seem all the rave these days, with the popular superhero genre churning out movie after movie that show how ordinary people are able to acquire their special powers. But it's not just the heroes that are the focus of these type of stories, there's the villains too. Movies like ""Venom"", which centred around one of Spider-Man's most dangerous enemies, and 2019's ""Joker"", which depicted Batman's arch nemesis in a more receptive light, paint a different picture of what we've come to expect of these fearsome foes and allow us to better understand their motives. Here in ""Cruella"", we are provided an often intriguing look into one of the most loathsome antagonists to ever grace both screen and literature - the fashion-obsessed, dog kidnapping Cruella de Vil. Although the very idea of giving a character like Cruella a sympathetic backstory seemed totally unnecessary to me at first, as the film went on, I found myself quite invested in what made her tick. Rather than just another hero turned to the dark side, Cruella is instead portrayed as someone who is only doing what she can to survive in this world. She is fully aware of her nature from the beginning and while she does somewhat grow and learn from her mistakes, they are merely as a means to help reach her goals as quickly as possible. This is a refreshing change from the usual soulless cash-grab nostalgia trip we've seen from Disney lately and it shows promise that there is still some creative spark of original storytelling left in them.I also really admired this film's production values. While I'm not someone who is properly into the artsy world of fashion, I thought the costume design was incredibly well done. From a striking red frock that immediately grabs your attention to a black and white frilly dress that shows Cruella's dual personality, this film has an outfit to suit any particular scene regardless of the mood. There were even times where it felt as though the film was letting the items of clothing do the talking for its characters instead of through typical expository dialogue. This is clearly a film that has had a lot of thought put into the stylistic vision its director Craig Gillespie must have had during pre-production and it shows on nearly every frame. Additionally, I liked the film's choices in music that set the tone for both the era and our eponymous character's mindset. Songs like Blondie's ""One Way or Another"", The Clash's ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" and the not-so-subtle ""Sympathy for the Devil"" by The Rolling Stones (get it? Devil/de Vil?) cleverly reflect Cruella's one track obsession with achieving success in the fashion industry, using her meanstreak to her advantage. Where the film does suffer though is in the focus of its story. Despite the inclusion of all these great audio and visual cues, not all of them were enough to make up for the uneven pacing and choppy editing during the film's second act. Perhaps this was done to prevent things from becoming boring for any children watching, as this is still technically a film for the whole family, but it causes problems in the way it moves the overall plot along. With a runtime of 134 minutes, you do tend to feel the film's length whenever issues like this are present.In a role I never knew I wanted to see her play, Emma Stone seamlessly brings this young version of Cruella de Vil to life for today's modern audiences. Stone is clearly having a great time exuding the character's cartoonish mannerisms and exaggerated wickedness, but never so much that it feels like she is mocking the original novel. This is helped by her interactions with the rest of the cast, who all did a fine job playing off her eccentricities. It was also nice to see how Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser as Jasper and Horace respectively were given a decent amount development in the story and weren't simply one-dimensional minions of our main character. These two are shown to be loyal friends of hers and despite initial reluctance to go along with some of her more outlandish schemes, manage to find ways to make them work. However, Emma Thompson's scene-stealing role as the Baroness proves that Stone isn't the only Emma capable of playing a memorable villain. I loved watching how these two Emmas acted off one another, often coming to verbal blows with their differing views of fashion and the self expression. I wouldn't mind seeing them act in another movie together, as there is some solid chemistry between them both.In this ever-growing world of reviving old franchises for the sake of making a quick buck, ""Cruella"" has a surprising edge over most of them thanks to its willingness to try new and interesting things with the source material. Though many films before it have done a better job of making us empathise with its villains, this one still offers some surprises that may catch even the most seasoned of moviegoer off-guard. And if that isn't enough to convince you, then the impressive production values and performances should instead.I rate it 7/10.",Cruella
88,meydiana-65242,Cruella de vil,10,2 June 2021,"I Just watched this movie and it is by far the best movie I have ever seen in 2021. The story, the writing, the actors were 10's across the board. The fashion, The acting, The Attitude and The music is also 10/10. If you are ever in the mood to feel like a bad b**ch, this movie fully embodies it. Emma stone was meant to play cruella and she embodied her perfectly.Watching the movie, the background story on cruella explains a lot on how her behavior is currently. Can't deny as well that cruella embodies everyone who is hungry for power and fame. Its also very funny. The directors make sure not to make in every scene funny but funny at the correct moments.Another thing I love was the high fashion. The choice to play the movie cruella during 1970's/80's london was a very good choice, not to mention the fact that during that time fashion was really high couture. (compared to now, but has its moments).Now if there are any negatives. To be honest, i found not much negatives. Tho i did feel the ending was missing something but that could just be me. Another thing is of course the dead parent. But considering the fact that cruella joins other orphans and becomes a band of thieves makes you forget that her mom died. Of course with her mentioning her a few times but it doesn't take over the whole movieOverall, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Again, if your feeling like a bad b**ch? Watch this movie. If you're a fashion lover? Watch this movie. If your a disney fan and want something other than singing people and crying and depression and seeing something opposite? Watch this movie. Or if your in the mood of watching two iconic actresses (Emma Stone and Emma Thompson) and watch them lock horns and have a fashion cat fight? Watch this movie.My rating? Out of 10? 11/10.",Cruella
89,TheTruthofItIs,"Cruella, c'est bella!",8,9 June 2021,"""Cruella"" was a surprisingly decent origin story for Cruella de Vil, though this film alternated among Devil, DeVil, and de Vil. The 2+ hour treatment takes us from her childhood at Estella to YA as Cruella, more in a psychotic/schitz' manner than a charade, though. Emma Thompson as the Baroness played a worthy villain, albeit much like Meryl Streep's ""Miranda"" in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Emma Stone played young-ish Cruella pretty well, though she doesn't have the stature that parallels the animated treatments. Maybe they'll get a taller actress to play Cruella in her older years, Bea Arthur would've been great, but is no more. Hey, Wendy Malick would be excellent. Supporting cast was strong too, with Mark Strong (easily mistaken for Stanley Tucci) and John McCrea as ""Artie"" the flamboyant costumer. Relatively inexperienced director Craig Gillespie did a good job overall with the Big Moments and pacing, which is really important for a movie with this long a run time. The soundtrack features many of your favorites from the 70s, so that was fun.",Cruella
90,chunkylefunga,Should have been darker,4,31 May 2021,Shame Disney decided to turn a great villain into basically a rebel with a cause.Would have been nice for Disney to think out the clean and safe Disney box and actually just have a villain that's a villain.,Cruella

92,ronakkotian,Falters in its story and treatment of the titular character,5,29 July 2021,"I had no hopes for this film as I'm getting really tired of Disney constantly making live-action films on their characters. Cruella wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be but it wasn't good either.Cruella follows Estella, an aspiring fashion designer, who goes down a path that leads her to become the wicked Cruella de Vil.Cruella de Vil is a Disney villain that I'm fascinated by and find fun to watch but the backstory Disney has created for this character goes down plot points that we've seen many times before. When I found out this film has five writers, I knew it was going to cause a mixture of several ideas into one and that's what Cruella feels like. It's a mix between The Devil Wears Prada and Joker with elements of a heist movie. Meshing these films and all these ideas doesn't make the story feel personal to the titular character. The character of Cruella was made to look so unoriginal as well since we see her picking up her traits from stuff she sees in her life rather than her creating it herself. There were certain attributes of her character that the film unnecessarily explained with some being told in such a cheesy manner. What also annoyed me was the overwhelming soundtrack. It's as if they took every popular pop song from the 1960-70's and added it to the film. They sounded great but there was simply too much of it. The CGI used during one scene towards the end looked terrible and the dogs didn't look very convincing either.What I did like were the two lead performances. Emma Stone looked like she was having a lot of fun with the role and was very enjoyable to watch. Emma Thompson was also great as The Baroness. Even though she reminded me of Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, I thought she nailed the characteristics of The Baroness. For a film about fashion, I expected it to have great costumes and it's definitely one of the film's biggest strengths. The production design is also terrific and the film is shot considerably well.Overall, there are aspects to like in Cruella but where it falters is in its story and treatment of its main character which is disappointing considering how much I love Cruella de Vil as a character.",Cruella
93,trinaboice,Wildly entertaining with some parental warnings,10,30 May 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Disney's origin story of anti-hero Cruella De Vil is directed by Craig Gillespie, who is known for making artistic films that are edgy with dark humor like I, Tonya. The time period is set in London during the 1970s ""punk rock"" revolution. The movie itself is stunning to look at, although I have very mixed feelings about the moral messages Disney is trying to say in this live-action telling of how an age-old villain is simply misunderstood.THINGS I LIKED:
Disney's casting of the two Oscar-winning Emmas is brilliant. Emma Stone is fantastic and mesmerizing in every film she's in. She's also one of the executive producers of the movie. There's a moment when she's driving a car that she looked just like the cartoon character. This take on her character gives her the flair of a comic book villain. I also adore Emma Thompson and watch any movie she's in just because I think she's so talented and awesome. She has never looked more stunning than she does as a fashion icon in this movie. There's a little bit of The Devil Wears Prada flair in this film both in fashion and working for a terribly self-obsessed boss. Cruella also takes lessons from the insane, rebellious Harly Quinn in Birds Of Prey And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn.The film is gorgeous to look at. It's stylish, colorful, and so different from what you probably anticipated from Disney.Tipper Seifert-Cleveland plays the young Estella and does a terrific job. I expect to see a lot more of her in the future.Some delicious slow-motion scenes. I always love those.Beautiful images of England with impressive production design.Fun camera angles and cinematography. There are some no-cut scenes, a style that requires impressive coordination.The great soundtrack features popular songs from the 1970s and can be purchased by clicking here: Cruella (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack).There are a few nods to the original cartoon. For example, Horace mentions that he notices how dogs often look like their masters, referring to the opening sequence in the animated movie. In another scene, you get to watch Jasper and Horace watching TV with some Dalmations, just like in the animation. Joel Fry and Paul Watler Hauser do a great job bringing those goofy and loyal sidekicks to life.The movie trailer does a good job hiding some big twists.I love that Glenn Close, who played the first live-action Cruella in 101 Dalmatians (Live-Action) is an executive producer for this movie.When the first trailer aired, film critics instantly compared it to the Joaquin Phoenix version of Joker, which gave us an origin story for a misunderstood movie villain. Let us not forget all of the terrible things he has done or that Cruella kills puppies and uses their skins in her fashion designs.Speaking of fashion, fashion lovers will enjoy all of the beautiful clothes created by the wonderful costume design team. There's a certain dress that reminded me of the magical gown in the movie The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1
I was kind of surprised to see villainous action star Mark Strong cast as a lowly butler, but he added a nice, elegant touch to the role.Fun fact #1: The sound of the horn on the truck that Cruella drives to the jail is the exact same sound as her car horn in the original cartoon.Fun fact #2: Despite the fact that Cruella de Vil is British, she has never been played by a British actress!Keep watching the stylish rolling credits at the end of the film for another quick scene.There is already a plan underway for a sequel. Are you ready?THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's pretty dark and edgy for a Disney movie.You don't get to see that famous Cruella de Vil car very much. There's also a car chase scene that isn't shot very well.What is Disney really trying to say...that there really isn't evil in the world, just misunderstood people? Children may fall in love with the rebellious style of Cruella and think it's okay because she had a rough childhood. Does that give people permission to do evil things, then? What do YOU think? Recently, one of my classmates from high school shot and killed 9 people in San Jose, California. I was horrified and saddened to see who and what he had become. People who hurt often end up hurting people. Let that be a reminder to all of us to be more kind to those around us.Requiring viewers to purchase Disney+ AND then also pay for the movie seems a bit greedy, don't you think?TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Dishonesty, crime, stealing
Someone dies
While Disney has hinted for years that some of its characters are LGBT+, Artie is very much a rainbow-flying man played by John McCrea.The ""killer instinct"" is considered desirable.Child abandonment
Talk of murder, portrayal of murders
Animal cruelty
The movie is probably a little too long for young kids who may start to get bored.Some violence
Property damage
Name-calling and insults
We see a man wrapped in a towel just out of the shower
Bullying
A woman gets drunk and we see other people drinking alcoholYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Cruella

95,lareval,Probably best Disney's live action yet,9,18 September 2021,"An excellent surprise.

The soundtrack is great and the script hits many golden notes. A pleasent watch!",Cruella
96,sweidman-28016,Amazing Surprise,8,5 June 2021,"""But a new day brings new opportunities. And I was ready to make a statement.""Set in 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, a young grifter named Estella is determined to make a name for herself with her designs. One day, Estella's flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute. But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella. I had been curious about what would happen with the team they had. Craig Gillespie directed I, Tonya and Lars and the Real Girl which got me excited. And Tony McNamara wrote The Favourite and the hit TV show The Great. As you might be able to tell, it's a nice collaboration. Cruella is one of those rare live-action Disney remakes that works. With the source material having a lot of leeway, there's plenty of time for exploration. It's not like they're trying to lead up to the classic animated Disney movie or anything like that. The movie is it's own thing. What works in its favor is the silly sort of story. It's not meant to be taken seriously. Word of advice: if you can get past the one scene in the beginning, you're golden. It's fun and witty and just the right amount of fun. Really, it's some of the most fun I've had in the theater all year. Constantly, they have 70s music, either well known jams or punk rock. The soundtrack is on par with The Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack in my opinion. And Nicholas Britell's score is good as always. It blends in with the other soundtrack which is pretty cool. Just to continue in the technicals, the cinematography isn't have bad either.Emma Stone. What a performance. This ranks with some of the best work she's done. I can't really compare with Glenn Close since I never took a liking to those movies. Whenever I think of Cruella de Vil now, I will always think of her over anyone other performance. There's a monologue that she has at one point that is just extraordinary. You wouldn't expect such greatness from a movie like this, but it's just so good. Co-starring with her is Emma Thompson. She's basically playing a Miranda Priestly. The Devil Wears Prada is a good comparison with this movie. Anyway, Emma Thompson does such a brilliant job and a big highlight of the movie. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser plays such great side kicks. I love seeing Joel Fry making it bigger and bigger. And Paul Walter Hauser is amazing in every role he gets. Overall, a great ensemble.The costumes deserve their own paragraph. They are some of the best costumes I've ever since in a movie. Jenny Beavan made some of the most visually appealing and creative outfits. I have to mention it, but one has a cape literally so long I have no idea how they did it. If you can't appreciate anything else in the movie, the costumes will for sure make an impression. I should probably bunch another thing in here as well, and that would be the production design. It's also great to look at and builds almost a whole new world even though it's just the 70s in Paris. Having it set in the punk rock era adds the flare needed.I can't complain about much. Yes, it's not the most amazing movie ever and it is a little longer than it needs to be. But it's such a blast from start to finish. Cruella will become a beloved movie by many in the future and even now. I'm happy with the decision to go a little deeper into intensity and gaining the PG-13 rating. It's not trying to play it safe, rather just be what it needs to be.",Cruella
97,theknownames,Darker Disney,9,22 June 2021,"It's very dark for Disney, they took risks and I am kind of shocked actually .I was not looking forward to seeing this but 15 minutes in I was still pleasantly surprised!There is a lot of movie packed init its running time and at no point are there stressors or does it loose it's momentum.Great soundtrack , gorgeous styling (of course )
The actors were exceptional in this ; they were all seemingly born to play their parts!They fell short around the the indecisive nature of who Cruella is / is to become .The story was actually great but quite a stretch for laying down cannon and it's not yet clear to me if the direction they chose is appropriate , particularly in the long run... which I won't mention because of spoilers.This will make for an excellent all around satisfying watch for all ages and tastes at a gathering even with it's darkness , it's a crown pleaser.",Cruella

This movie was original so trying to compare it to anything or anyone else, and then downing this movie for that was just funny. I have kids so I have seen all every version (Even cartoon) of 101 Dalmatians.It was hard to top Cruella dying in a tar pit, but this one in now my favorite. I made the mistake of watching it alone, thinking it would not be worth my time. I wish I had watched in with my mother and my son.Not as much as my son would have loved it like me, my mother would have though. This was more geared to women watchers but had a bit of everything for everyone. I was surprised when they ended by splitting the two SIBLING pups apart. As I recall Pongo and Perdita had the 101 Dalmatians and the way they ended this they (The siblings) will have puppies.Not unheard of when breeder want to isolate a certain genetic dog trait, just caught me off guard was all. I never knew they were brother and sister, good twist. It was very hard to feel sorry for the main character, having seen all the rest of the movies and knowing what happens.I think they took a old story and put a new twist on it, I hope when they come out with pt. 2 the new Cruella does not let me down.

This was a beautiful movie, full of scenes of tension to build you up as it goes on. Emma Stone is Phenomenal in this, she really did a great job becoming the evil Cruela.I think this is the type of movie where you see the trailer, love it and love the film even more. I was entertained watching the whole of this i couldn't help but keep my eyes locked to the screen, when a movie can keep you intrigued like this its always a perfect experience.I always enjoyed the tale of 101 Dalmatians so its really iconic to give Cruela her own movie, two sides to every story heres the much darker, twisted side is what we're experiencing here. This was such an amazing adaption, so imaginative it was such a excellent watch, by far one of my favourite Disney movies, without ruining anything I just want to say I loved the violence, highly charged and suspenseful, I loved it.If you're thinking of watching this film then do it, its such a powerful experience, nostalgia doesn't even come close to the feeling you'll get watching this amazing movie.",Cruella
103,LloydBayer,"Devilishly fun and visually gorgeous, Cruella will reignite the thrill of being back at the movies.",7,4 June 2021,"Behind the fairy tale façade and contrary to popular belief, Walt Disney productions have always had a dark side to their stories. Look no further than the vicious murder scene in The Lion King or that heart-breaking sequence that emotionally scarred every child who watched Bambi. Based on the 1961 Disney animation - One Hundred and One Dalmatians - followed by the 1996 live action film of the same name, Cruella is Disney in delicious dark mode. And that's just the cream on top.While the film works as a prequel to 101 Dalmatians, the real reason you are drawn in is the origins story of the titular character. I'm talking about villainous but also anti-hero type characters last seen in films like Joker or Disney's own Maleficient. If you're reading this and thinking 'supervillain' then we may be on to something and why this film is sensationally menacing, stylishly chaotic and visually gorgeous.Set in 1970s London, the story begins with the birth of Estella, followed by a childhood stained with tragic events that make her a boisterous delinquent. But redeemed by the kindness of two pickpockets, the trio makes a living for themselves as petty thieves. Eventually, Estella lands a job in an upmarket fashion store but works as a janitor until she grabs the attention of the owner, known as Baroness. As the utterly fabulous queen of the London fashion scene, but also a narcissistic and spiteful boss who snatches credit from everyone else, Baroness becomes the catalytic spark that turns Estella into Cruella de Vil - a mysterious fashion terrorist hell bent on sabotaging and toppling the Baroness.Up until this point, you could be mistaken into wondering who the real villain is. That is a divisive question that can split the audience into rooting for the Baroness or Cruella. Not a fair choice given both characters are immensely and impressively watchable. Emma Thompson as the Baroness is superbly sinister and icier than a similar role played by Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada. Emma Stone as Cruella is refreshingly kinetic, with eye catching splendour armed with supervillain haute couture, and on par with the energy exuded by Cate Blanchett in Thor: Ragnarok. Their screen presence, the costumes and gowns they spite each other with, and the set design is amped up with an arsenal of no less than 37 rousing tracks that are period inspired from the 60s to the late 70s.On the flip side, Cruella never delivers on the darkness it conveys. In this regard, and for the sake of pun placement, there is more bark than bite. That's because the Cruella we meet here has never harmed a dog and has no intention to. The Dalmatian fur coat scene? It does happen and it's a killer! So why Cruel-la? Because of her murderous instinct arising from a plot device that is better seen as a revelation rather than a twist. Either way you look at it, the last half-hour feels fluffy, with bits of slapstick moments that fit snug in a Johnny English film. But as a follow-up from the fiercely entertaining I, Tonya, director Craig Gillespie has a wild card with Cruella. Just don't set your expectations too high and you're in for a wildly entertaining, over-the-top high fashion, high mayhem drama that at the very least, should reignite the absolute thrill of being back at the movies again.",Cruella

107,maxglen,A surprisingly enjoyable film with a nonsensical ending,6,31 May 2021,"Me and my partner had heard good things about Cruella and decided to watch it, although we had our reservations, we both enjoyed the film film thoroughly up until it's rather bizarre ending and implications. I'll get to my complaints about the film's climax later though and start with the things I liked. First, Emma Stone and Emma Thompson; absolutely marvellous, the both of them. Their performers aren't a far cry from what I would call career defining. The rest of the actors all do a fairly decent job too but it's the two Emmas that steal the show. The story itself leading up to the climax is also very enjoyable although the plot twist does feel a little cliché and derivative. The film has a collection of fantastic songs building up it's soundtrack, ""Sympathy for the Devil"" being the most apt. The film also has a great sense is style and is very competently made in technical aspects, the costume design is pretty stellar as you would hope from a film cantering mostly around the fashion scene. After all that though, the film ends with Cruella giving away two dogs to Roger and Anita, the same dogs that would become the parents of the classic 101 puppies; this raises an absurd amount of questions as it seems that Disney may have forgotten that Cruella tried to buy and skin these dogs in the original film and live-action remake. Unless there is a Cruella 2 where they explain that the Baroness escapes prison and tries to frame Cruella, Horace and Jasper for dognapping and animal cruelty/murder, I just don't see Stone's Cruella doing the things done in that original film, especially with where they leave her character by the end. Perhaps we're in some strange alternate timeline but for now, it vexes me. That being said? 90% of this film is pretty enjoyable and definitely worth at least one viewing. I'm going to give it a strong 6 to a light 7/10. Thank you for reading my review and have a lovely day or night wherever you may be :)",Cruella

109,Mike_Devine,Stone brings a classic Disney villain's origin story to life,6,1 July 2021,"Disney's latest entry from its vault of animated classics-turned-live adaptations comes in the form of a prequel. The origin story of everyone's favorite puppy snatcher (or aspiring fashion designer?) is not something that many asked for, but now that it exists, it's certainly piqued the interest of Disney fans and general audiences alike.Emma Stone's portrayal of the infamous Cruella de Vil is one that has drawn comparisons to that of the late Heath Ledger's Joker thanks to her antics, mannerisms and general eccentricity. And while the similarities are pretty striking, Stone brings her own flair to the orphaned swindler who grows up to be one of London's most influential designers - before she finds a new hobby, of course.What 'Cruella' does well is it designs a film around one individual. It certainly rests on the shoulders of the titular character and Stone's performance, yet it doesn't feel like a vanity project. Sure, it's campy and feels unseriously serious at times, but overall, it's a mildly fun ride.",Cruella

113,daisukereds,Pleasantly surprised!,7,30 May 2021,"It reminded me of a Guy Ritchie movie, with a very well paced script, good dialogue and an interesting story. Beautifully shot, locations, colors, etc. Many of the supporting roles in the movie are the stand outs. It also does a good job at a homage of animated movies of old with villains and some over the top moments (and human-like animals) that don't detract from the story. Some CGI moments here and there, but the production and execution of everything else, with a good foundation.As my brother so aptly stated, this feels like a mix between ""The Devil Wears Prada"" & the duality/speech pattern from the character Catwoman (in Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns""). Unlike with ""Joker"" (2019), they did a wonderful job at creating a script for the actual character. This movie is too artistic and exceptionally well written to feel like a Disney-produced-film as of late. It's very enjoyable!! Was expecting to be disappointed again.It's so well made, I feel like the Disney-property was slapped on someone else's story. One that was crafted with love and care.

115,DeBBss,Pleasantly Surprised,7,27 July 2021,"Disney has gained a reputation for reusing old source material with their new terrible remakes. So naturally I thought Cruella would be like all the other Disney remakes, but I'm glad to say that they finally did something right this time. This film is fun to watch and that's exactly what a Disney movie should be. It's lighthearted, well acted, and easy to follow.I'd say what really sold this movie was Emma Stone's acting. Her Cruella personality was not only well acted, but it was fun to watch on screen. She's entertaining and unpredictable, which is exactly why I like this character so much. The supporting characters are also pretty likable; they're criminals and thieves yet we still support these characters because they are that likable.A big part about this film is fashion, and it delivers on that. The costume designs were creative and well made, so I'm expecting at least one Oscar out of this movie. The technical parts of this movie, like the directing, cinematography, and editing were also pretty good.This film gets a lot of things right. It offers a fun story with fun characters. I'm glad that this movie surprised me because Disney was on such a cold streak. If you want to watch this movie but don't want to pay extra, then I'd say wait for this to be free on Disney+, but if you're really into it, then go right ahead because this movie is good enough to pay the extra money.",Cruella

Before she became Cruella De vil, teenaged Estella (Emma Stone) has a dream to become a fashion designer, after she promises to go on the right path and be successful the proper way to her recently passed mother. She finds herself face to face with the Baroness, a series of events and revelations causes Estella to embrace her wicked side to become the raucous, Fashionable and revenge bent Cruella.Despite hearing some mixed opinions on this movie, I absolutely loved it! For me, it's in my top 3 Disney live actions. The set up for development and Estella/Cruella's relationship with Jasper and Horace was excellent. I loved the voiceover. The cinematography and costume design was absolutely incredible and definitely an Oscar contender for costume design. The movie was very funny, the cast had fantastic chemistry. Especially Emma Thompson and Emma Stone who both absolutely made this movie and worked incredibly well together, their performances for me were brilliant, Emma Stone was perfect casting. The set pieces and soundtrack was amazing. The character development was fantastic, the set up for Cruella turning more evil was well done. The montage scene was just incredible, you will know what I mean if you have seen it. I loved the movies tone, it was over the top and very playful and punky which I loved. I think the film balanced sympathy for Cruella but also kept her evil. I loved the LGBTQ+ representation. The script was great, I loved the blending of genres with the heists. I liked that they included characters and nods to the original animated movie. I loved the development to the plot and plot twists that I didn't see coming. I loved the contrast between Cruella and Estella's personalities. And the final act was great, setting up future projects excellently with a fantastic tease in the end credit scene.My only slight nitpicks was that the opening was slightly corny and rushed, and that some characters like Anita were underused.But overall, for me Cruella is one of Disney's strongest live action films. It was delightfully over the top, bold, and visually thrilling. And it was entertaining from start to finish. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson did an incredible job at making this film connect with me, I would 100% recommend seeing this at the cinema.",Cruella
117,flicklover,A nice surprise.,8,13 June 2021,"When I saw the trailer for this film I had no real desire to watch it. I am not really a fan of Disney's live versions of most of their classic animated films. Because there is such a small amount of films out now to see in theaters it was the only family oriented films to see at the time. Also, 101 Dalmatians is not one of my favorite animated Disney films so I'm not particularly a Cruella de Vil fan. Well I have to say that with such low expectations, this film was a nice surprise.It is really an origin story of the title character. We meet Estella/Cruella as a precocious child living with her mother Catherine Miller. Catherine puts her daughter in a private school and she is immediately getting into trouble. She gets expelled and goes to London with her mother. Her mother stops to ask for financial assistance from the Baroness von Hellman. A wealthy fashion designer. Estella witnesses her mother being pushed off a cliff to her death by the Baroness' ferocious Dalmatians. Then the film moves to Estella as a young woman played by Emma Stone. She is a petty their that has befriended and lives with two fellow thief Jasper and Horace. She is an aspiring fashion designer and is able to get a job in a department store but as a maid. One night she gets drunk and designs a window display and impresses the Baroness von Hellman played now by Emma Thompson. She sees some talent in Estella and offers her a job in her fashion design company. The Baroness is horrible to her employees but she takes a liking to Estella. Estella notices tge Baroness wearing a necklace that belonged to her mother and swears to get it back. All of this is done in a very darkly funny tone. Emma Stone is really good as Estella/ Cruella. She has fun with the character which is learning to be a diva herself while planning to steal the necklace. Emma Thompson is even better as the Barroness. She is gleefully self centered and cruel as tge fashion mogul. Taking any opportunity to insult and diminish anyone around her. This performance by Thompson is very much like Meryl Streep's performance as Miranda Priestly in Devil Wears Prada but even more over the top evil. Estella finally reveals herself as Cruella and sets out to compete with the Baroness as a designer to take the spotlight from her. These scenes are done with alot of visual flair and some great 70's music. Emma Stone also has a great time hamming it up as Cruella. She is so likeable as an actress that it's fun to see her as a diva. The production is predictablely first class and the supporting cast is good but this film is all about the two Emmas.It's their show.Grade: B.",Cruella
118,MogwaiMovieReviews,Evil Is Empowerment,1,25 June 2021,"There have been a lot of parallels drawn between this film and the similarly overrated Joker, and there's something to the comparison: both are good-looking films with no plausible character development or coherent story, that cannot fit into the larger fictional universe they come from in any way.The difference between them is Joker was a shallow and hamfisted attempt at making a deep and serious movie, and although it failed in its attempt to sympathetically depict the causes behind crime and mental illness, it at least made for a powerful cinematic experience. Cruella, on the other hand, is simply a bizarrely lighthearted attempt to rewrite a long-established embodiment of evil as a plucky heroine, entirely for political reasons.It seems obvious they were early on going for an Addams Family-type vibe, but the great difference is that the character of Wednesday Addams does not have a 60 year history of murdering puppies as an adult, and our connection with her is as a comical depiction of a cute child doing humorously callous things. Whereas our association with the character of Cruella DeVille is of someone singlemindedly trying to hurt and kill the characters we care about, so there's nothing funny about the filmmakers trying to insist she is a hero, and the film can never get past that hurdle, no matter how manipulatively it tries, and the more it tries, the more unpleasant the results.Before the first three minutes are up, we've already seen the young Cruella be bullied by boys (white boys - please don't think that was coincidental) and ground down by 'The Patriarchy' at school while she befriends and defends a black girl, thus setting up the facsimile of moral structure we've become so used to in recent years: If you have a minority on your arm and hate men, you're in the right, no matter how objectively greedy, violent and malicious your actions actually are.And that's the crux of the problem with this and so many other recent films: its message to little girls is ""whatever you want to do, and whoever you want to hurt, you're still in the right because you're a girl!"". Telling little 21st century girls that they are an aggrieved and oppressed underclass is a terrible thing to do to them and to the society that will have to put up with them in a few years: What kind of women are we creating by continually doing this?Heroes and villains are important: they teach us what beneficial actions to aspire to and what harmful actions to avoid: WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO WANT TO BE LIKE CRUELLA DEVILLE. When even the most clearly drawn and irredeemable psychopathic monster can be rehabilitated in this way, entirely for political reasons, it becomes impossible to depict ANY female characters as villains, and so little girls no longer have anything to navigate by, since they are being told that every terrible thing they can do is 'good'.As with previous feminist revisionist works such as Wicked and Maleficent, the biggest and most unscalable flaw is that the rewritten characters seem utterly unrecognizable from the characters we are so familiar with: there is no way of linking THIS Cruella up with the Cruella we know from the books and movies the past 60 years. She's a completely different (if equally reprehensible) character who just happens to share the same hair colour.So this Cruella is a genuinely toxic and harmful statement to be putting out into the world and impressionable minds: a morally-bankrupt vision of the world in which bad is good and white is black (quite literally, at points: central and long-established characters are race-swapped, again only for political reasons) and it even tries to make the dalmations into the bad guys. Imagine that.By rehabilitating yet another classic Disney villain in this way, Cruella teaches little girls only that selfishness is good, violence is an acceptable way to get what you want, and evil is empowerment. This is a truly abhorrent film that we all should avoid.",Cruella
119,Brooklynsmagicmike,Honestly was shocked by how great this was.,9,4 July 2021,"I had really low expectations for this film. You can't blame me, alot of recent films that were redone have been terrible. This film however does not fall into that category by any means.The movie was excellent in so many different ways. First the acting was superb from all parties. Especially Emma Stone she was perfection in her role. The visuals were stunning throughout and the fashion design was out of this world. Also without giving to much away the movie had alot fun scenes whether it was chases, action, or robberies.The only reason I did not give this film a 10 out of 10 had to do with the long run time. It got a bit tedious at times. But outside that I had zero complaints. I would recommend this movie to all age demographics outside of young children. I think it'll be too difficult for them to follow along with and there isnt much here to peak there interest. But as far as teenagers to adults theres enough fun and enjoyment to be had.",Cruella
120,jakethesnake-42007,A big surprise I love love loved this film,8,5 June 2021,I'm surprised how much I loved this film. First off the soundtrack is amazing. The acting is top notch Emma Thompson deserves an Oscar nomination. The only flaw with the film and it's a big flaw is it doesn't know if it's for kids or adults. It's def not a kids movie and more for adults but it's a Disney film and with that it will hurt in the box office. I loved the plot and everything about this film.,Cruella
121,Thrashman88,Fun But Nothing New,5,1 August 2021,"It's nice when we're given a background story of a despicable villain such as Cruella De Vil. It's as if Disney wants us to ""love"" a previously established nasty. The movie is well made and entertaining but it's NOT a kid's movie. Not that there's anything kids shouldn't see, but it is a slow paced movie.Some of its twists come directly from Star Wars book of twists (The Empire Strikes Back anyone?).The acting is spot on by both Emmas but I don't believe Cruella will have the lasting impact of its source material.",Cruella
122,bangel3322,Much bettee than I expected,9,16 June 2021,"I wasn't sure how this film would pan out when I first heard about it, with Emma Stone playing the titular character. I really wasn't sure she would be able to pull it off. However after having just watched it, I thought it a great film with Emma Thompson and Emma Stone doing a fabulous job in their roles. It was a great storyline, great soundtrack, great acting, fabulous fashion...I really couldn't find fault with it at all really. It's quite dark for a Disney film, however it would have a perfect 10 had it been just a tad darker.",Cruella
123,movieman6-413-929510,Emma Stone shows the appearance of Cruella while Emma Thompson conveys more of the personality.,5,10 June 2021,"Cruella is a live-action film based on the character's origin story from the 101 Dalmatians animation and previous live-action film and book. The film is directed by Craig Gillespie, the director of I, Tonya and The Finest Hour.The film is about Estella (Emma Stone) a poor girl, who mainly goes through life as a thief. When it is seen that Estella has a good taste for fashion, she is hired by a Baroness (Emma Thompson) at her fashion company. Here she manages to impress the Baroness thanks to her rebellious fashion, but thanks to her behavior she also risks losing her job if she is not careful. In order to be able to compete with the Baroness, she starts her own fashion company with an alter ego like Cruella. In the battle between the two fashion companies, Cruella learns secrets that change her life.With this live-action movie, Disney tries to bring out a Disney villain in a different way just like they did with Maleficent. This may take some getting used to for the audience who know Cruella as a villain, because the character is given a modern look and plays more of an antihero than a real villain. For example, in this film Cruella has a good relationship with most dogs. This may seem a bit strange to people who know her from the classic animation or the earlier live-action movie of 101 Dalmatians. She ends up almost more like a Disney princess than a Disney villain.The story also comes across as a bit long-winded, because several storylines seem to have merged into one film. Five people also worked on the script, which is reflected in the messiness of certain aspects of the story. They could have shortened the film a bit by, for example, omitting the part of Cruella's childhood from the film. Apart from a single plot twist, the film is also a bit on the predictable side.The core of the film is more about the fashion battle between the two fashion companies. For example, the film comes across as the film The Devil Wears Prada, where a novice tries to compete in fashion with the fashion expert above her. Thus, the film is especially entertaining for people who love fashion or the fashion world. Some of the best aspects of the film are the costume designs and the hair and makeup styles of the characters.The film sets are also nicely used. The sets are believable as if they are really in the 70s. Furthermore, the sets are also well used for the fashion shows of both fashion companies.The soundtrack of the film is a bit simple, because instead of a real soundtrack they make more use of appropriate 70's punk and funk music. Despite the music being so familiar and entertaining, it is also an excuse to simply deal with the film's soundtrack.The acting is well done by the film cast. The only problem is that the main character is brought forward from a different angle in the film. Emma Stone has more of Cruella's looks, but still lacks the personality the character is known for. The well-known Cruella personality is actually better brought out by Emma Thompson. For example, Emma Thompson manages to steal the film more than Emma Stone. The rest of the movie cast plays more of the characters that have appeared in other versions of movies that include the Cruella character and serve more as supporting or comedic roles.",Cruella

It is quite long at over two hours but to be honest they flew by.It works for adults as well as kids with the main character somewhere between hero and villain.Disney have done another brilliant back storey to a classic, which is a path I wasn't sure about before, but now I think was stroke of genius.",Cruella
127,patriciogl10,What an insufferable performance!,3,1 June 2021,"Cruella begins with the character's very origin, showing a key moment in her childhood that sets up for the rest of the film; and while it has a promising start, the minute Emma Stone appears on scene, it all goes south. Her being the title character means she has to carry the film on her shoulders but it seems as though the weight has crashed her down completely, leading to a cartoonish, laughable and downright appalling performance. She lacks the charisma and acting chops to pull off such a rich character properly, or at least decently. Big eyes are not sufficient to display emotion when actions and reactions come off in such a cringeworthy fashion that is embarrassing to watch.Another aspect I found to be unbelievably inconsistent was Stone's atrocious attempt at a British accent; on her small voiceover parts she did a somewhat decent job, whereas when she had to act, the accent came and went, absolutely all over the place. It was one of THE worst performances in recent times that I can recall.I've been ruminating on how on Earth do the folks at Disney thought it would be wise to release a cut of over TWO hours of running time. By the hour mark I was anxious for it to be over; so unnecesary and exaggeratedly long, which in turn makes the viewing experience tedious and insufferable.The only remarkable aspects of the film rely on costume design, which is thoroughly impressive, Emma Thompson's effortless performance and the soundtrack (which was a bit too much at times, if I'm being honest). I sincerely can't understand the praise this film has been getting, perhaps the worst of the year so far. Watch it if you will, but hey, I warned you.",Cruella

It can be seen that the film has a big budget and that it all looks nice, but that can't make up for the lack of charm and atmosphere.The costume design is good, the cinematography is not bad, the actors did their best, but the script is not good enough and although there are some good moments in the film, there is simply nothing particularly interesting in it.Another in a series of mediocre films that in the end proved to be a waste of time.",Cruella
129,thenolanfan,Review - Cruella,7,25 June 2021,"I didn't expect to say this: ""Cruella is a good film"". Of course, it has his problem related to the screenplay, and it falls a bit in the shadow of films like Joker.However, I found myself appreciating the punk/rebel aesthetic, and the excursion in Gillespie's ruthless world of fashion, where it is ""free-for-all"". After, Cruella, I, Tonya, and the newly announced Iron Mike, it is to wonder if he doesn't take a certain pleasure at exploring the darker side of success, and passions become dreams.With that in mind, I believe, I thought of Jenny Beavan, an oscar-winning costume designer, his costumes, as an integral part of the conflict and the narrative rather than as accessories highlighting Cruella's personality.It is a shame that Cruella was marketed as it was because I don't see it as a villain's genesis. At least, with those bland secondary characters and those predictable plot twists, it was definitely the worst part of the film.On the contrary, as I implied earlier what you should be looking for is fashion and rivalry. For example, the fashion show, newspaper appearing in midair, the Hellman Hall parties. These are the shining moments of the film. Nevertheless, I believe less exigent children can still appreciate the Disney-esque touch.",Cruella

131,zac-04879,De-Vilish,7,12 June 2021,"Disney just portrayed a mastered backstory of villain Cruella de Vil. Alongside a wickedly wild performance by Emma Stone, Cruella's fashion approaches from the well-selected music and use of expressive soundtrack. The darkness of this crime prequel will even appeal to adults, but parents keep aware, the gloomy elements are not best for the viewing of younger children.No need for childish Disney magic in this feature film; the devilish performances will do the trick. Both Emma Stone and Emma Thompson perform as fierce as fire, but the astonishing soundtrack is frequently effective. Seriously, you'll never fail to forget Cruella's presentation.What is most surprising about the film, is Disney stories like 101 Dalmatians are family-friendly, but the story of Cruella is darkly phenomenal. Even to those who were let down by live-action Disney remakes like Mulan and The Lion King, will surely feel an attachment to the energy and power of the characters. Cruella is an outstanding piece of storytelling, although it really seems to kick in fairly obtusely.In the end, watch Cruella for the wicked performances and perfectly matching soundtrack. There's plenty of style, and the story flawlessly links up to the tale of 101 Dalmatians. Other than the incredible elements used throughout, Cruella de Vil's fictional crime life makes a very entertaining and watchable feature film that will not disappoint you.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Cruella
132,darkreignn,Fantastical escapism,7,30 May 2021,"""Cruella,"" the latest live-action film from Disney, is a prequel to the animated film ""101 Dalmatians."" At least, that's what they want you to think. To gain the maximum amount of enjoyment from ""Cruella,"" first and foremost it's important to realize that this is a reimagining of everyone's favorite animated villain - here, and as is to be expected, the character of Cruella is neutered. There is no puppy skinning, though you will find out why she dislikes Dalmatians; you will not see her physically abuse her partners in crime, but you will witness some squabbles that, naturally, get worked out; and, of course, Cruella is pitted up against someone far more cruel. For all intents and purposes, ""Cruella"" is an antihero origin story - that's not necessarily a bad thing.""Cruella"" has a certain charm about it that can become infectious if you go with the flow and take this movie as its own, separate, story. Starring Emma Stone and directed by Craig Gillespie, there is an undeniable style about this movie that makes it constantly entertaining. There's a very high-energy feel at play here, from everything to the often free-flowing camera, beautiful set and costume design, and high-octane editing - everything this movie throws at you has one goal in mind: to entertain its audience. And that it does. ""Cruella"" gives you little time to breathe, as it is almost constantly moving forward. And perhaps, this is to a fault.As much fun as this movie is, it's goal to be pure popcorn entertainment is overshadowed by its distractingly overbearing soundtrack - not since ""Suicide Squad"" has there been this many songs in a mainstream film. From scene to scene to scene to scene, you will be hearing a barrage of classic punk hits - ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" ""Should I Stay or Should I Go,"" and ""One Way or Another"" are just a few of the songs you'll be hearing over the two hour and 14 minute runtime. While quite the catchy, crowd pleasing soundtrack, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. Because practically every scene features a well-known song, it's easy to find yourself paying more attention to the music than the goings on onscreen. Most of the songs don't incorporate well, either, or flow, or match what's occurring - it's obvious the music choices were to crowd please and add to the film's energy instead of to fit the nature of specific scenes. In short, the soundtrack is distracting, but it is by no means movie ruining.""Cruella"" is consistently entertaining, thanks to the very energetic direction and the fun performance by Emma Stone - Emma is relishing her role here, and it's evident that she's having a good time; because of that, you will too. It's fun to watch her scheme, plot, and be evil (in a likeable way, of course). Her Cruella persona is easy to get behind, and it helps that she has an enemy in the form of one Emma Thompson. Thompson plays a fashion-designer known as the Baroness, a heartless, cold woman who is focused on being the best at female fashion. She's the clear villain of the film, and is one that the audience wants to see defeated as much as Cruella does. And her and Cruella's feud is very watchable.Taking place in the otherworldly dimension that is high fashion, Cruella and the Baroness face off in head-to-battles of style; while the Baroness seeks to design clothing that strikes awe into her admirers, Cruella seeks to upstage the Baroness at all costs - you'll be treated to many entertaining scenes of Cruella doing just that. It's all creative, and it's all fun to watch - I only wish the music wasn't so in your face during these sequences. There's true competence and care at play here, competence and care that is overshadowed by the overreliance on the music. That said, the soundtrack isn't nearly as out of place as it was in ""Suicide Squad,"" and it won't completely destroy your entertainment value, like the music did in the previously mentioned film.At a ripe PG-13 rating, ""Cruella"" does have some slightly dark elements, but it's nothing kids can't handle. At worst, I fear ""Cruella"" may be too boring for children, as I doubt many of them care about or have the attention span to watch a movie that is primarily about fashion. That said, if you at all enjoy the fashion industry, or just want to watch a fun revenge story, you could do a lot worse - Emma Stone's dedicated performance and Craig's energetic direction elevates this movie. If you're looking for fantastical escapism, give ""Cruella"" a shot.",Cruella
133,chubarova,Fashionable,8,30 June 2021,"When Disney makes sequels, prequels or re-make, I don't expect something good. I can't say the same about this film. Firstly, the plot is really good, it shows the way of one of the awesome villian. It has a lot of twists, so it can't be boring. Secondly, the cast is amazing, two Emma made one of the greatest rivalry on the screen. But maybe the best part of film is music of 70s and costumes.

135,Jerique,Great performances all around!,8,16 June 2021,"In a film that flips the switch on a villainous character, Emma Stone and Emma Thompson both put forth a performance of a lifetime. Emma Stone has come a long way from when I first saw her in Superbad in 2007. Emma Thompson has always dazzled audiences with her portrayal of any character.It's an odd film because here is a villain. You are meant to hate Cruella in the film 101 Dalmations, but here we are presented with a sob story and given the idea to cheer for Cruella as she journeys her way through defeat, triumph, grief, crime, friendship, and lonliness. Cruella gives details to the original film, and the story is full of mystery while sprinkling in comedy as well. Emma Stone is perfect as Estella and Cruella, and like a light switch can personify each character any moment.Mark Strong pulls off a worthy performance and is so skilled that he almost blends into the movie unnoticed. To round out the amazing performances, John McCrea as Artie and Jamie Demetriou as Gerald (the scene stealer) are great in their supporting roles. Not to mention, memorable role players Joel Fry and Paul Hauser add the finishing touches to Cruella's entourage and likability. Ultimately, I found myself happy with how the film turned out in the end.Cruella seems on paper, that you wouldn't want to see it. After all, it's about a woman villain who wants to make a coat out of dogs, right? But the double Emma stars makes you do a double take on the film's premise. It almost goes beyond just a live-action Disney villain. Like Malificent with Angelina Jolie, this film makes a new legacy for a character previously brushed off.",Cruella

This is a true Disney live-action movie that we needed to bring back the whole entire fans and audience to the big screen.

139,TheVictoriousV,"Surprised this one didn't make it to the ""Good for Her"" archives",4,4 June 2021,"Looking at Cruella, you might think that Disney has somehow managed to run out of old media to regurgitate and so now they're making live-action remakes of films they've already made live-action remakes of, but they're not THAT unoriginal. This movie isn't just a remake of a remake. No, no! That wouldn't nearly be dumb enough for present-day Disney. Instead, they essentially went:""We have indeed already remade One Hundred and One Dalmatians but we haven't given Cruella de Vil the Maleficent treatment and asked 'What if this icon of villainy was really just abused and misunderstood the whole time?' We haven't done Misunderstood-ella de Nice yet!"" Indeed, much like how Maleficent is no longer just a gloriously vile fairy, Disney now reveals that De Vil became the villainess she is because, among other things, dalmatians killed her mother.The movie - I sincerely sh-t you not - actually says this.I know this reads like something I would put in jokingly for the review (if jokes about Hollywood can even be distinguished from reality anymore) but this is truly, honestly how stupid movies have gotten. I concede that the film already wasn't meant to be taken too seriously, but at no other point does Cruella seem this parodical of the very idea of itself. If it doesn't scare you, no evil thing will.Is there any good news? Yes. The first bit of good news is Emma Stone. The second is that they did make the titular character deliciously diabolical - like she should be - even as we learn more about the tragedies that molded her. The third is Emma Stone.But even then, the film does have sort of a feminist angle (or pretends it does) - like we're meant to think of this puppy-flaying criminal as a girlboss icon standing up to her oppressors; to believe it's the patriarchy's fault she became the murderous fashion designer from the 1961 film. This is the first time I've seen the feminists in my Twitter feed react negatively to this sort of thing, and also make Joker comparisons.Promising Young Woman, The Invisible Man, and various other ""Good for her"" titles got a pass; those movies didn't ""glorify"" anything, nor did they make harmful implications about women, nor were they simply weird. Cruella was. I don't know that any of these films really ""glorified"" violence (if they did, it wasn't the point), though I appreciate the consistency that was sorely missing when these people derided Joker for it but praised PYW.Comparisons have also been made to films that very much predate the Disney remake craze, most strikingly Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Indeed, more than a few viewers in the 70s likely missed the point, idolizing the figure of Alex DeLarge like later generations of edgelord would do with Tyler Durden and Rick Sanchez. Perhaps something similar will happen to the edge-ladies who watch Cruella, hence quasi-justifying the critics' fears of glorification? I can't be sure; the most genuine excitement I saw for the trailer involved thirstiness over Stone's ""murderous goth gf"" spiel, which I cannot altogether criticize.I also can't fault the film's physical appearance - its production design is reminiscent of Tim Burton (further ensuring that at least one Millennial edge-lady will adore this nonsense, on top of the Disney Villain brand and Harley Quinn vibes) and its color schemes and lighting choices occasionally recall those of the aforementioned Joker. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson do look extravagant in their costumes.And yes, as a Twitter user who goes by Roseberry comfortingly told us all, we can always take this with us from Disney: ""Between 'there was no plan for the Star Wars sequel trilogy' and 'Cruella's tragic backstory is that dalmatians killed her mom' I hope every indie creator who has ever experienced self-doubt over their storytelling skills and/or professional competency is feeling very reassured"".",Cruella

142,namob-43673,Surprisingly good and Disney's best live-action movie,8,31 May 2021,"I thought this would suck, I thought this would be another crappy live adaption and yet another ""Oh she is not so evil..."" rewrite filled with political nonsense.But No! This is not that, and it is surprisingly good movie, even great for the most part. The acting is amazing.Music score is fantastic, sets and costumes brilliant, and both Emma's are so amazingly great that I smell Oscar. The rest of the cast are also great actors. The pacing is spot on and every scene has a purpose.With all that greatness out of the way I also need to point out the negatives.Although the overarching story is pretty great, the script still leave a lot to be desired. This is not badly written, and the dialogue is great, but the feeling I had all throughout is that the film lack that little extra. The ""villain"", or rather antagonist, lack a lot of motivation or at least we are not told enough. Some of the other background stories are also a bit thin.Another thing to mention is that although the pacing is great, the script, as mentioned above, do not tell a 100% story so there is a feeling that some scenes are superfluous, and yet I also feel like minutes are missing here and there. And finally there is a bit too much of coincidences/contrivances throughout - again I think it is about the script mainly - but it gets a bit too much at times, which take away from the overall enjoyment.Cruella honestly surprised me, and I enjoyed this movie. Probably Disney's best live-action movie, and I definitely recommend seeing this. I give it a 8/10, and it is a pretty solid strong 8. Please go see, well worth it.",Cruella

Both the leads, Emma Thompson and Emma Stone have carried this film on their shoulders. What phenomenal performances by them both.

156,hunter-friesen,Dull Disney Product,5,7 September 2021,"Not that anyone totally expected this, but Disney's ""Cruella"" doesn't have an original bone in it's body.At what point does a movie no longer have a soundtrack and instead just become a visual album, because ""Cruella"" uses music more liberally than a film by Beyoncé.Craig Gillespie's film also has the problem in that every song incessantly needle dropped has been used to better effect by several films before, whether it be ""Time of the Season"" in ""All the Money in the World"" or ""Livin' Thing"" in ""Boogie Nights."" It's never a good sign when your corporate product movie constantly makes me compare it to films filled with talent and authorial voices.But what really irked me in ""Cruella"" was the writing, which takes all the groan-worthy tropes from other Disney properties and contains none of their charm. There's a specific twist in the third act that genuinely shocked me because it was so dumb and obvious that I didn't think they would actually do it. It goes to show that I haven't learned my lesson in how shallow Disney can go.Also, can we stop writing ""genius"" characters the exact same way? Just because someone is smart, doesn't mean they have to talk really fast and constantly say witty remarks that go over other character's heads.I blame Aaron Sorkin for inspiring others to think that they can emulate his style. Hell, Sorkin can't even do it some of the time. ""The Favourite"" is the only non-Sorkin movie that has successfully adopted the style, and that had Yorgos Lanthimos to steer the ship. For as much Gillespie has fun here, he isn't able to rights the wrongs of everyone else.The two Emmas of Stone and Thompson sink their teeth into the material, and Paul Walter Hauser continues to be a comedic genius that does more than just the ""fat idiot"" routine.""Cruella"" is another Disney product that had no right to exist on paper, and fails to justify its existence on the screen. It's not a complete waste of time for the audience, but it is a waste of time for those involved, as I'm sure they would have been a part of something much better.",Cruella

158,arabnikita,Didn't know Disney can make enjoyable live action,7,3 June 2021,"Cruella (2021)Like many of you out there, I thought that yet another unnecessary Disney live action movie would end up being an utter mess. In this one, the protagonist is Cruella, that woman who wanted to make a coat out of 101 dalmatians, and you might ask yourself why should you even bother with this movie. Frankly, you wont miss out if you don't see it but you won't be disappointed if you do. The only selling point here is Emma Stone and she was absolutely electric in her performance. When you couple that with good music and indulgent costumes, it all results in a surprisingly entertaining product.The narrative follows a young Estella who has spent her life dreaming of becoming a fashion designer but was forced to live the life of a petty thief along with her two childhood friends. When a big opportunity finally presented itself, it revealed a terrible truth that forced Estella to embrace her dark alter ego - Cruella. This results in a protagonist who is actually interesting to watch. Essentially, the film is a fashion rivalry but it is not as silly as it sounds. There are well executed heists, decent amount of Disney humor an upbeat theme that makes it all enjoyable to watch.Naturally, beeing a modern day Disney movie, it has a number of ridiculously annoying moments, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience. Emma Stone has a maddening glint in her eyes and is enjoyable to watch in every scene. She owns the character and as a result, gives one of her best performances as a crazy fashionista. I was extremely impressed by the costumes which were genuinely original and could easily win the Oscar. I thought this film will be the next fiasco in Disney's resume but instead it turned out to be quite a pleasant spectacle.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",Cruella

There are some really cool throw backs to late 70s punk rock era of London. Some great music and costumes choices.

Rather than have a scene-by-scene reimagination of an animated classic, this film creates and explores what made the infamous villainess so cruel.The story was unique, the costume design was exciting, and Emma Stone was captivating in her Jekyll & Hyde performance of Estella/Cruella. In order to create this extensive narrative, Disney left nothing on the cutting room floor. On one hand this allowed for in-depth character development, while on the other it made the film draw close to listless on a few occasions.

3) The scenes with Cruella at the fountain talking to the memory of her mother were really emotional and well done
4) The score and soundtrack were both great, although they do lead me onto my negatives....NEGATIVES:1) A lot of the film feels very lacking in substance because of the massive overuse of the pop soundtrack; the film's tone is very all over the place because emotional moments are immediately followed by upbeat pop songs
2) Emma Thompson's villain became a bit irritating for me; if they hadn't made her so over the top it would've been better and more engaging

It's not the actually decent script and execution of a concept without an audience.It's the painfully obvious shilling of reviews and ratings on IMDB, as Disney realize that a few thousand bucks paid to Cheech and Chong can buy what a hundred million in production and marketing can't produce: the impression that audiences actually enjoyed this trite, fleering, superficial femwank in our faces.Dig beyond that to the reviews by unpaid humans who actually watched this, and you'll find the fact that it's an unwelcome movie that starts and ends with nothing, and goes nowhere.Emma Stone does her very, very best with the material she's given, and that's the kindest thing you can truthfully say about it.",Cruella

But quickly picks up and becomes ocean 11 like with their genius ploys to be in the spotlight. Cruella has a interesting backstory with a really cool plot twist in the end that is somewhat obvious but still great.

165,PotassiumMan,Captivating transformation journey from innocent to wicked,10,6 June 2021,"This superior and bold Disney film tells the backstory of Estella Miller/Cruella de Vil. The film's underlying strength is its strong performances. Emma Stone is viscerally devilish as the aspiring fashion designer-turned-villain in this explosive film. Stone perfectly conveys Cruella's steep character arc from stumbling innocence into conniving wickedness. Emma Thompson complements her nicely as Baroness von Hellman, the supreme fashion queen whom Cruella idolizes in the beginning. Joel Fry and Peter Walter Hauser give solid supporting turns as Jasper and Horace, two pretty thieves who become her adopted family early on.The film boasts lush, dramatic set designs that perfectly give us the feel of 1970s London, along with flamboyant camera work and an ebullient soundtrack to keep the flow going throughout. But Stone is the heart of the film and the film's mood rises and sinks and rises again with her psyche and transformation.This movie perfectly introduces also the beloved characters Anita and Roger, and gives them new backstories, without putting them into the center of attention.An entertaining and gripping story of an innocent female genius trying to find a place where she fits in while following her dreams.

171,hoernkeem,"(06/05) Cruella (2021, Craig Gillespie) A glorious origin for one of Disney's most notorious villains... no Dalmations were hurt during the making of this.... i think.....",8,26 June 2021,"'Cruella' is another of Disney's live action adaptations and is one of the first major films to hit theaters in the almost post pandemic phase of Hollywood. This is telling a story based on the events in '101 Dalmations' focusing, like 'Maleficent' before it on the misunderstood villain of the enterprise. 'Cruella' is helmed by Craig Gillespie who is more of an art house choice than your run of the mill, in house Disney director. Gillespie is most notable for such films as 'Lars and the Real Girl' and 'I, Tonya' among others so you can tell he has an indie art house flair. Emma Stone is glorious in the lead role as is her costar Emma Thompson. The supporting cast is good but those two really shine in their eye catching roles. This film is the origin story of one of Disney's most notorious villains, Cruella de Vil. They actually take someone who will go on to attempt to make a coat out of 101 puppies and turn her, successfully I might add, into a sympathetic figure. I am not well versed in '101 Dalmations' although it seems like this film leads right up to the beginning of the animated classic. I am not sure they can tell that story if they mean to keep Cruella ostensibly a protagonist, although a sequel is in development, but this origin story is quite good. Surprisingly good! The trailers made the film look pretty interesting and fun but I kept expectations reasonable, and this film surpassed just about every one of them from the acting to the humor to the writing to the production design. Everything worked well to create one of the better films of this early 2021 summer.This is a true origin story going back to Cruella as a young girl named Estella Miller. Her mother raises her as a single parent, and gives the young girl the nickname of Cruella due to her impetuous nature as well as a tad of a cruel streak. One night young Estella witnesses her mother's death as she is pushed off a cliff by a pair of vicious Dalmations. Estella makes her way to London and takes up with a pair of street urchin hustlers named Jasper and Horace. We flash forward as they trio stays together and is now grown and continuing to excel at the petty theft while Estella works on her love of fashion design. Estella is eventually invited to work under the famous fashion designer known as The Baroness. This leads to some key reveals where Estella determines that The Baroness is her enemy (amongst other things) and creates an alter ego, Cruella de Vil, to battle her in the fashion world which leads to some truly memorable and exciting scenes which allow Cruella to learn more about who she is as well as gain key insights into her mother's death. All this leads to a grand showdown between The Baroness and Cruella which sees Cruella not only merge triumphant, but also Cruella becoming the dominant persona vice Estella setting up the future Cruella we all know and hate? Perhaps. Either which way this film definitely runs smack dab into '101 Dalmations' as a mid credit scene shows Pongo and Perdita being delivered to their homes which I believe is how the Disney animated film commences, and we even get a snippet of the song 'Cruella de Vil' being written by Roger who gets Pongo.I am not surprised that I enjoyed this movie, but I am surprised how much I enjoyed it. The writing and acting were very good and quite a lot of ground is covered. The film clocks in excess of 2 hours but it never felt like it was bloated or that it lagged at all. I can't say enough about how well Emma Stone does in this role. She did an excellent job of making Estella/Cruella sympathetic yet still showing an undercurrent of her villainous streak. It was a brilliant choice to set this in the 70's. It allowed for a superb production design as well as superlative use of 1970's rock and punk throughout. It was cutting edge music at the time that reflected the cutting edge nature of Cruella who was amazing in her fashion one-upmanship of The Baroness. This is really the lane in which these Disney live action films can shine. Rather than make straight copies such as 'The Lion King' find a way to use what exists to tell a story at once familiar yet wholly original and 'Cruella' does that perfectly.Eric's Grade: B+",Cruella

Emma Stone totally emulates her character and gives a stunning performance. I would be shocked if she does not win an Oscar for her portrayal of this iconic character.I really loved the numerous montage sequences. It made the film even better. After the numerous fashion montages in the film, I low-key wanted to work in the fashion industry. The editing, Emma Stone's acting and how it intertwines with the soundtrack is phenomenal.I found it quite surprising when it was revealed that Estella aka Cruella is the daughter of the Baroness. The Baroness wanted her loyal servant (aka Cruella's Alonzo) to kill her and to make it look like an accident. The film makes it quite clear that the Baroness is the villain of the story. It paints her as narcissistic, egotistical and quite obnoxious. Emma Thompson further proved her versatility as an actress and may very well get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.The moment where Estella faked her own death felt comical. I thought it did not have any shock value and was weirdly edited. Perhaps it was just me, but I laughed out loud when Estella deployed a parachute in mid-air.Kudos to the costume designers who crafted the various outfits. Those looked extremely exquisite. The colour palette of the entire film is so exuberant, yet dark and frightening at the same time.The ending showcases Anita Darling and Roger both receiving dalmatian puppies from Cruella. Those puppies are named Pongo and Perdita. This makes the story come full circle.This might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't really see how this movie resembles the 2019 thriller ""Joker."" Its messaging, overall tone and lead characters are completely different. Cruella stands on its own and is an original movie.To conclude, the 2021 film ""Cruella"" benefits from its high production value, exuberant mise-en-scene, perfect soundtrack, amazing editing techniques and pitch perfect casting of the lead character. As a 21-year-old male I thoroughly enjoyed this modern adaptation of the Cruella DeVil character. I grew up watching the 101 Dalmatians cartoon and the two consecutive movies starring Glenn Close. To be frank, after watching the movie I prefer Emma Stone over Glenn Close's live action portrayal of the character. One cannot deny the film's authenticity and creativity. It does a perfect job at giving the audience a fresh new look of this character. The film is oddly memorable, likable and fun, despite its rather serious subject matter and its main antiheroine/villain. It definitely leaves you wanting more.Side note: Horace, Jasper and Estella aka Cruella are the ultimate trio. I loved their chemistry together.Final verdict: 8.8/10.",Cruella
179,theredsky,Cruella Review,5,4 June 2021,"A film that I was surprised that I enjoyed. Disney Live Action remakes have never been my thing as you all know but there was something just very entertaining about this one. Whether it was ironic or unironic enjoyment, I enjoyed it just the same. The film does have a lot that is good about it particularly Emma Stone's performance. While it's far from her best, she still did a good job. The film rides on her performance and she did a great job capturing the essence of Cruella. However, there is an issue with sympathy. Most of us know that Cruella goes on to try and skin dogs and the film does try and make us empathize with here. While it isn't a big issue, it's a little awkward at points. If this was a new character, then this issue wouldn't be there. Paul Walter Hauser brought a nice sense of levity to the film and his comedic timing and the jokes I made I found to be pretty hilarious compared to everyone else. Most of the other humor feel really flat for me. All of the other performances are fine. Emma Thompson's performance felt pretty flat in a lot of areas especially where she is supposed to react. The script has a ton of issues with plot holes especially toward the end along with some pretty awkward dialogue. There were some laugh out loud moments in the film that I don't think intended to be like that at all. I noticed that there were a lot of similarities to Joker (2019) in here which took me off guard in relation to mental illness and even down to a song choice from the trailer of Joker. At that point, it felt very on the nose about its other source of inspiration. The soundtrack was good but there were points where I wished that they hadn't used music and the cinematography was pretty nice at points but bland overall. Some of the CGI was really bad at times but fine for the most part and I really enjoyed the costume design. The costume design is the one aspect this film can pride itself in. This films begs the question, ""Was it necessary"". The answer? Not really but it was fun anyway. If you want a good Emma Stone performance or enjoy these remakes then you'll probably like this but if you don't like these remakes then pass on this.",Cruella

Watching in 4k was a special treat....sets, costumes, and the two Emma's (not to mention a great soundtrack) make for a high watermark in pure entertainment, and that is very rare these days.

If you want to know about people and motives and what allows a person to change, this is NOT your movie. Read the diary of Charles Panzram if you want to know about genuine twisted characters and their ability to change and adapt to their surroundings.The truth is that a good story has relatable characters. Relatable means ""realistic"" or ""grounded in reality"". Even Superman is relatable in some ways. Cruella is not even remotely realistic in this film.

I was pleasantly shocked and surprised about how much I enjoyed this movie. It's not a perfect film, but it is a lot of fun and entertaining. I wouldn't say it's for the little one's, at all, but despite its focus on fashion, most men would still enjoy the plot, story, and action! Think of it like, the Devil Wear's Prada crossed with Ocean's 8.It is one of the better Disney live action remake films, and certainly one worth watching if you're on the fence.",Cruella
183,SofiaHedge,"A Bold, Exciting Sensation",10,29 May 2021,"Warning: There are spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read this review.I watched Cruella last night and I must say, it was truly worthwhile.The movie gives a tragic backstory to Cruella De Vil, one of Disney's most famous villains. Cruella(initially called Estella) is a bright young girl whose mother gets killed by dalmatians. It really makes you feel sympathy for Estella and understand why she hates dalmatians. But in a shocking turn of events, The Baroness, a famed fashion designer and the movie's antagonist, turns out to be Cruella's real mother who wanted to get rid of her own daughter when she was born. It was a good twist that I never saw coming.The film's sets and costumes are very gorgeously detailed. Cruella takes place in 1970s London, and it feels very authentic. The music choice was also amazing and very catchy.Emma Stone does a phenomenal job of playing the iconic Cruella. Her version of the character is very feminist and rebellious. Cruella isn't afraid to think outside the box, and that's what made me actually root for her. ""I was born brilliant, born bad, and a little mad"" will always be one of my favorite Disney quotes ever. The other actors did a great job in the movie, too. Emma Thompson played The Baroness flawlessly.So all in all, Cruella is an intriguing, unique masterpiece that I highly recommend.",Cruella
184,timeblank,Unexpectedly Great,9,10 June 2021,"I have a cruel mindset that I thought Cruella would be about dogs would be turning into coats. I never expected a tragic turn of events. I mean the story, acting, and the way Cruella and Baroness fought each other through media and fashion designs. This movie blew my mind.Emma Stone and Emma Thompson were both brilliant. Who cares if their devilish things going on. It's villain vs villain. I cared about the story and the acting. I have never expected this movie to be great. Good job Disney!",Cruella

186,tkarlmann,"I usually watch Action Films, but I REALLY like this film!",10,2 June 2021,"For me, I usually go for Gerard Butler-type Action Films --- But this film is just so different that I thoroughly enjoyed it.It's part Oliver Twist; part Cinderella; part poofy-fashion flick; and part just-darn-good-story!The acting was superb; the plot was unique and intriguing; and the poofy English 'Gentry' did not get in the way.And -- as an added bonus, I remembered those old 1970's songs well enough, that I sang along to a few of them!!A really good romp into film-dom -- well done all!!!",Cruella
187,LiveLoveLead,flawed but creative...,7,25 October 2021,"Although entirely too long, Cruella was more enjoyable than expected. The story is narrated by Estella/Cruella from her birth to adulthood. Born with half black and half white hair (think Sia) and an angel/devil personality to match, her single mom tried to teach her unusual, intelligent, precocious daughter Estella to keep her feisty, impulsive, intolerant ""Cruella"" personality in check. As Estella's life takes a turn and she struggles through tough circumstances with cunning, unprincipled persistence she finds herself clawing her way up, to try and land her dream job in the fashion industry to work for icy fashion icon, The Baroness...think Devil Wears Prada. The movie is dark with some shocking scenes that might be a bit much for the very young, and plays more for pre-teen to adults, and Cruella is no role model. There are definite flaws in the film but the acting is on point by all, with each actor fitting their role perfectly. Costumes are amazing. The soundtrack is filled with favorites from the 60's 70's 80's. There are some plot holes that won't jive with the Cruella from Disney's 1961 animated classic, 101 Dalmatians film (or the Glenn Close's 2000 version), but there is a scene in the closing credits that ties this prequel into that film, albeit a racially diverse version. Cruella is a decent origin story, that should have shed 30 minutes, but worth the watch IMHO. FYImom 2021.",Cruella

I even cant tell myself that which character of this movie I loved the most,every single one was just perfect. What a great theft planning with the mixture of comedy and revenge. Believe me I haven't seen this kind of planning even in other theft and action movies. Yeah I was dissapinted at first because I started to watch this movie as a super villian film,because of its trailer. But there was no super natural powers in Cruella. But the movie didn't let me get boored even for a single sec. And yeah the combination ESTELLA and CRUELLA was really awsome.",Cruella

There's some stuff around mental health I am pretty sure isn't handled well, and a lot is hand waved when she's making her ""splash"".What makes it a pleasure is some of the design and the acting is great; actually pulling off some pretty vapid dialogue that could easily have given it a B movie vibe. It's also quite pretty, especially in 4K HDR. I'm unclear as to if this supposes that it negates the 101 Dalmatians movie for its own timeline or is a prequel to it, because if it doesn't, I don't think it really manages to make her sympathetic or negate the fact that she's like... going to kill some dogs in the future. So... pretty weird.Not terrible though, as expected from the trailers and the cliff scene that's made it's way around the Internet the day of release, which makes it look impossible stupid.",Cruella

I liked the performances and the effort that has been made, that's why it's Disney's best remake of a classical tale. It is also original as well, the humour could be a lot better, but I did have a few chuckles here and there. The costume designers did a fantastic job, it's like a trying on party. Yea sure the character of Cruella has "" changed "" but I feel like it adds that extra few details for not only the character herself, but because Cruella was played buy a different actor with different strengths in terms of acting style and skills.

194,kevvportela,She would have to have killed the dalmatians at least to leave the mark of Cruella,5,30 May 2021,"The long-awaited film that focuses on the life of Cruella, one of Disney's most iconic villains that comes out of ""101 Dalmatians"". Directed by Craig Gillespie, played by Emma Stone and supported by Emma Thompson.Beyond the expectations of what was previously sold, putting them aside it is an enjoyable and fresh movie.Being objective and valuing the work done, I feel that if Disney had not made its mark, I think that something deeper would have been reached. I know this has nothing to do with ""Joker"" but to put it as a vague example, this villain could have left more than just superficially emotional and empowering scenes with distinctive outfits. I miss a Cruella taken by that confusion and madness, really passionate about design and ambitious for the desire for success on it. Not that I wanted to see something dark, but they raised some idea that it was going to be like this. There are even scenes where the film becomes dark and interesting like the one with the house fire or the talks to herself of the main one taken by some emotion, but then they were ruined by action scenes or sentimental scenes that were not necessary. It ended up being one more film of a sentimental and literal justification of why it is a villain instead of showing something more interesting and passionate than the character proposed. And yes, really if she had at least interested in killing dogs for their skins or at least for her revenge, there would have been a more coherent quote for the character of Cruella.Emma Stone is very well, clear in her alter egos beyond that her interpretation could have been a FIRE accompanied by a darker adaptation for my taste. Emma Thompson really does see herself as a real antagonist displaying a specific personality and reason that always kept her with a presence as only she could have. Paul Walter Hauster and his dog were among the best of the cast, he generated grace and closeness with his character so affectionate and crazy at the same time. I highlight the production in general, the costume designs that were used accompanied by the sets and shots that made that particular style shine even more.",Cruella

Despite keeping all the ""Disney vibe"", it plays along with the main character's personality, giving it a darkest tone than we usually see.About the story line, it starts a little too slow, makes the viewers ask where's Cruella.

198,Harry_Gleeson,Pleasantly surprised!,9,4 July 2021,"Overall, Cruella was a film that took me by surprise in many ways. It was a film I wasn't that interested in seeing, especially as I haven't really loved any films that Disney has released specifically over the past couple years, Pixar on the other hand have really been killing it. (Soul, Toy Story 4 etc)But Cruella was a really enjoyable film. The performance from Emma Stone was superb and adds to her classy CV as an Oscar Winning actress. She really gave Cruella that new personality and made it her own, adding the gothic nature to the character which made it extremely appealing.The costume design as many will guess is a big standout here, which I'm sure will earn recognition come awards season and rightfully so, there are some amazing pieces on show throughout the film. It's a film where fashion is a main aspect so it kinda should have good costumes hahaCraig Gillespie, the director, deserves a lot of credit too for adding an original style and tone to the film and with the mix of Emma Stone and there's no surprise why the film shines.The only downside of the film is the script, I don't necessarily think it deters the film but it was obvious that the script lacked in many parts that could've made the film flow better with better writing.But there's a lot to like about Cruella, and the fact that a sequel has already been announced gives off the impression that fans loved this and I can't wait to see the next stepsQuote - 'I'm just getting started darling' - CruellaRating - 4/5.",Cruella

200,jeannefrancoise,I can see the bright future of Disney movie from here.,9,11 September 2021,"The 'Cruella de Vil' name is coming with the very meanest feeling, dark side, iconic-eccentric fashion of a bad lady, that put up 'something bad plan' really punch you to the ground, yet about the 101 Dalmatians thing. So this movie seems fair to give some credits to the original story of the figure of Cruella, who once was called Estella. The plot is coming from the ordinary idea about loneliness and bullying, bad parents, bad memories, then it becomes problematic and dramatic since Estella knows the truth. Well for me this movie is really fun enough, it has deep meaning about narcissistic and egoism, it is also tailored with beautiful scenery images of London, and of course the unpredictable ending. The appearance of Barroness, acted by Emma Thompson is really delightful, so audience can be fully loaded again and again in different way of feeling in every scene, sometimes you can feel your heart full, sometimes full of angriness. Then, Emma Stone's acting here is quite intriguing, really different of what she has delivered on La La Land or Birdman. She is really fabulous here. I can say this movie is more than children movie. This is also action-packed with the dogs are also well-behaved to take part as main actors there. This movie is funny, dramatic, fashionable, delightful, and the most promising of Disney live action movie so far. I can see the bright future of Disney movie from here.",Cruella

203,garethvk,Cruella Is A Wickedly Delicious New Look At The Classic Character,8,26 May 2021,"Back in 1961; Disney adapted the 1056 Novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians and in doing so; crafted a beloved animated classic and introduced the world at large to Cruella De Vil. The film has not only endured but has spawned television series, a direct to video sequel, merchandise, and two live-action versions.Despite being delayed due to the Pandemic; Disney has scheduled the much-anticipated ""Cruella"" for release and I am happy to announce that the film is a Wickedly Delicious new entry into the series.The story follows young Estella as she and her mom plan to start a new life in London in the 1960s. When tragedy strikes, the young girl finds herself on the streets and working a life of crime and grift with fellow street kids Jasper and Horace.Flash forward to the 1970s and Estella (Emma Stone) toils away in a store cleaning while hoping for her shot in the world of fashion. When fate arrives and places Estella in the path of vain, self-centered, and vicious fashion magnate The Baroness (Emma Thompson); who hires Estella to begin her career in fashion.The savage way The Baroness treats those around her intimidates Estella but her friends Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser); see this as an opportunity to rob from The Baroness and this places them at odds with Estella as her designs start to gain traction.When situations clarify and things begin to evolve into a mission of revenge; Estella transforms into Cruella which had long been the name associated with the darker side of her personality.Cruella takes the fashion world by storm for her innovative looks, bold designs, and theatrical events which upstage the Baroness at major fashion events.With her sales and reputation in decline, The Baroness declares war on Cruella which sets a dark and sinister series of events into motion which drives the film into darker content then one may expect from a Disney film.The cast is very strong as Stone and Thompson are amazing as they are both wicked and captivating without ever going to far over the top or extreme with their characters. The supporting cast is great as well as Fry who was hysterical in the series Plebs brings a depth to Jasper which takes him above just being a stumbling sidekick.Mark Strong also does great work and elevated all the scenes in which he was in with his strong presence. While at first I wondered if we really needed to have this part of Cruella's life told; the story is engaging and the cast is fantastic which makes this movie dark and delightful.While elements of it may not be ideal for younger viewers; the story was captivating and the performances were amazingly engaging.The film ran about two hours and 10 minutes and seemed a bit long in one segment but the film does regroup brings the story home. There is a mid-credit scene audiences will want to stay for as it was an unexpected and very charming nod to what is to come and is not to be missed.It will be interesting to see if the film is the hit that I expect it to be if Disney will consider more films in the series as it would be amazing to see this cast return for further wickedly dark adventures.4 stars out of 5.",Cruella

Enter young Cruella, played by Emma Stone. Similar to Joker, this movies takes a well known villain and paints a backstory to give the character credence as a lovable protagonist. The various outfits and clothing extravaganza is once again very reminiscent of Devil Wears Prada and enjoyable.Cruella plays homage to the original animated film in the most subtlest of ways, and only if you are looking for it. The few callbacks it does have will put a small smile on your face. Its certainly an interesting and unexpected twist on the origins of the villain.I particularly was not looking forward to Stone's accent as a Londoner, and if you allow yourself, you might be able to give it a pass. Apart from this one downfall of an American with a not so very passable accent playing a Londoner, the movie is quite enjoyable and certainly entertaining, but really nothing to write home about.

The story on how she got all the little things that shaped her character is really dumb.

211,christophershobris,Emma vs. Emma,7,16 July 2021,"The battle of the two Emmas is at full swing. Both delivered topnotch performances as their characters. I liked both for different reasons. Emma Stone plays Cruella and Estella very well, coming off as playing two distinct characters. Estella, the struggling amateur when it comes to fashion despite having the talent, and tries to make things happen the nice way without success. Cruella, the powerful, fearless, but over-the-top eccentric personality that gets her way any way she can. Emma Thompson plays the Baroness, who on the surface is very much one note, only cares about herself, and envies herself, no one else matters, not even Estella. Despite the Baroness being one note, Emma Thompson still brings her always suave, and attitude to the role, making the Baroness more realized. As a result, you get this chess match between the two actresses. It's fun to see them try to one-up each other. The two Emmas are the main reason I was intrigued to watch this film. But they weren't the only things I found likable. Joel Fry while overshadowed by Stone, and Thompson, does a good job of holding his own. Gives Jasper this sympathetic personality, who clearly cares about Cruella and does everything to help her. He plays Jasper as a smart, thoughtful individual despite being a thief, but shows there is much more to him than that. Paul Walter Hauser does a serviceable job as Horace, but certainly isn't the standout performance. I didn't like the ending, as it felt a lot more cliched and rushed. Another chance for the villain to redeem herself in the end, but instead goes the typical route and now she is like pretty much every Disney villain, with nothing unique in her story arc. I'm talking about the Baroness of course. I think if the writing was better for the Baroness, combining it with a massive talent like Emma Thompson, it could have been much more interesting. Instead, she's one note, but a one note character Thompson plays well. In the end, this is certainly better than the last attempt at an origin story with Maleficent. One that I think nicely fits in with the occurs in the animated film 101 Dalmatians, as this is meant to be a prequel to that movie. Worth checking out? Not dire, but if you have nothing to do on a particular evening and you want to just blow off a couple of hours, this is just good enough for that. And if you do, watch the acting duel between Emma Stone and Emma Thompson, and you might get some sort of satisfaction. 7.4/10.",Cruella

The soundtrack is top, the fashion is top, performances awesome, the story is surprisingly good - I thought they are gonna ruin a favourite childhood tale and they definitely changed the story but I was very much surprised in a nice way. Costume design, makeup and cinematography absolutely gorgeous. After the awe full backlash from previous Disney craps I expected this to be a lot worse and I was more than super pleasantly surprised. There is really not anything bad to say about the movie besides Emma Stones accent as Cruella but I guess that works well showing her madness. Very dark edgy and rock chic - a love everything about it, plus the two Emma's acting is awesome.",Cruella
214,GavWaskett,Cruella De Vil If she doesn't scare you No evil thing will,8,26 October 2021,"Cruella (2021) - Action, Comedy, Crime - Disney +
I went into this with exceedingly low expectations, I mean how can you make a film about Cruella de Vil and get the audience to actually invest in the character. We're talking about one of the, if no the most dislikeable characters ever to hit film. As a child, she gave me nightmares - then again, as a child King Rollo gave me nightmares! This is a woman whose main role in film is to hunt down Dalmatians and puppy Dalmatians at that and kidnap them so that she can kill and skin them, maybe in that order! Who treats the human heroes with distaste and scorn and bullies her employees into committing these dastardly deeds.Fair play to Disney, they did it. They turned Cruella into a multidimensional character, a woman with a history that helps you understand, if not how she became a puppy murderer but how this persona develops. A woman wronged from birth. A woman who slowly turns from the heroine to the villain back to a character you are rooting for. I hated myself at this moment!You can see how her relationship with Jasper and Horace turns from friendship to fear to something else. And how and why they all care for each other.Emma Stone is perfect casting as the young Cruella, she is a likeable actress but can also give you the edge you need and by edge, I mean psychopathic tendencies creeping through! Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser bring Jasper and Horace into the hero category, I want to see how them and their relationship deteriorate so much, but you are rooting for these lads during this film. Joel Fry is especially good. Mark Strong remains a stalwart, an actor you can always rely on and Emma Thompson channels her inner Meryl Streep to full effect.This is a back story with huge character development but in the opposite way, normally you get a story of someone doing the right thing and redeeming themselves, this flips it up and turns it backwards but also twists it both ways. Well worth a watch.",Cruella
215,tbenson97,Loved It!!,10,13 July 2021,"Emma Stone did a phenomenal job! I loved the connections they made with the OG movies like the deville car, she was posted up the same way the cartoon version was lmfao and that credits scene made me tear up. It brought me back to my childhood when I'd watch the cartoon version of the movies. Good times..",Cruella
216,fdbjr,Another Live Action Fiasco,3,30 May 2021,"This utterly joyless, laughless, lifeless, consistently mean-spirited movie continues the disastrous run Disney has had with its attempt to convert the classic animated movies into live action vehicles.I could say it's the worst, except that 'Dumbo' exists. The best that can be said for this epochal failure is that it isn't that bad. But that is pretty faint praise.",Cruella
217,yellowmarlin,Utterly brilliant,9,29 May 2021,"So much better than it has any right to be, Cruella raises the bar for Disney live-action movies to a whole new level. The sets: amazing. The wardrobe: stunning. The soundtrack: perfect. The cast: oh, the cast. There are no words that can do justice to the two Emma's in their roles as psychotic alpha females going to war with each other. The supporting cast of male characters are all excellent, particularly Mark Strong who makes it look effortless. Highly recommended.",Cruella
218,agentsofsword,Cruella did not blame the dogs,9,31 May 2021,"Before you watch this there's a lot of twitter hate saying that Cruella blamed the dogs for killing his mum. That's a lieThis is a great dark fun movie! The Devil Wears Prada meets Joker slightly. The makeup and costume department deserves an oscars for this. The cgi is choppy at the third act but the movie itself is great.If you have family this is worth the 30 dollars and if you're alone this is worth the big screen experience!!Despite the hate a lot of people enjoyed and loved this movie
The people that hate it didn't even watch the movie.",Cruella
219,arod_85,Surprisingly one of the best live action films!,7,21 September 2021,"101 Dalmatians has never resonated with me like other Disney films (Aladdin, Beu&Beast, and the Lion King) so I was less than enthused when a remake was announced. Then when I heard Emma Stone would play Cruella, I thought that was going to be more of a reason not to watch. I actually love Emma Stone, but couldn't see her and CruDev. I thought her casting was just another one of Disney's attempts at casting a big name that just wouldn't work as the character (umm hmmm... Beyoncé). A friend told me it was a good movie, so out of boredom, I watched it. Surprisingly, I enjoyed Emma's interpretation of CruDev more than any other in 101 Dalmatian history. It also happened to be one of the stronger Disney live action remakes, if not the strongest. The story was interesting, and the fashion and soundtrack were awesome. Be warned that I don't think it would hold a younger child's attention too well and there are some adult themes. I actually think the movie would appeal more to fans of films like ""The Devil Wears Prada"" opposed to the traditional family friendly films of classic Disney. Emma is now Cruella DeVil. Everyone else was amazing as well from the adults, kids, and dogs. Worth a watch.",Cruella
220,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,The two Emmas make it an entertaining one-time watch,7,21 June 2021,"Cruella is corporate pop art at its finest. With top-notch production values and a hip jukebox soundtrack, this origin story is eager to please, never offends, and takes its sweet time checking all the correct boxes as approved by market research. The two lead performances by Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are the beating heart of the piece and together the Emmas elevate the entire piece, of which the latter steals the show.There are passing moments in Cruella that evoke other successful movies, whether it is the master-apprentice dynamic from A Devil Wears Prada, Cruella's descent into madness that resembles Joaquin Phoenix in Joker, or Cruella riding a motorcycle with a black cape flapping in the wind looking like Christopher Nolan's Batman. This film felt like it was made by the marketing department.Emma Stone commits to the lead part, fleshing out every shade of what makes her Cruella tick. She tackles the role as if this was Shakespeare and it is her passion and earnestness that kept me watching. It's one thing for us to think Cruella de Vil is an uninteresting role but a completely different case when an actress tries so hard to prove us wrong. I leaned in and managed to ignore its commercial artifice.Cruella de Vill's becoming, the thing we came to see, is unfortunately presented in a jarring fashion. It was similar to how Maleficent's arc was handled in the Angelina Jolie movie. The villain begins as a decent person but the moment they turn evil, the movie snaps its fingers and they just become the villain we know them to be. The lack of transition is a script issue and not the actress' fault.Emma Thompson plays The Baroness, the Cruella De Vil to Cruella De Vil, in full-fledged scenery-chewing fashion, deliciously delighting into the character's villainy. She is a new Disney villain that kids can also safely enjoy without getting nightmares later that evening. It does hit familiar territory to Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada. All in all, both Emmas make the film worth seeing.Will Cruella satisfy fans of the original 101 Dalmatians? I don't think so. Nobody thought there was a necessary gap to fill in. I honestly prefer the character as pure evil with no explanation required. Is it entertaining? Yes, it was satisfying as a one-time watch for the performances.There's a more honest story somewhere in all this.",Cruella
221,alexscott-35299,A pleasant surprise,7,30 May 2021,"This film really did surprise me as I really wasn't expecting much but I was wrong to judge. The story was a nice refreshing surprise as I was expecting a straight rip from 101 Dalmatians but no it was an original story that had a lot of references to the original character. Emma stone is brilliant in this role and she clearly was very passionate about the character and that shows on screen, Emma Thompson is also amazing and a great counterpart in the film to Emma stones Cruella. If you love fashion this film is definitely for you and if you just generally love the original 101 Dalmatians this is also the one for you. My main criticism with this film is that it is just abit too long, when it feels like it finally wrapping up it just goes on for longer and I was starting to lose interest. Also the effects were really bad and I don't understand why because it's just simple effects that could have been done practically, the dogs at times are also cgi which I don't understand fully but they are terribly done. Some of the child acting at the start wasn't great either and at the start of the film I was really worried that this film wasn't going to be great but it did pull it back as it started to kick in. Overall a great surprise and a must watch for Disney fans.",Cruella

The story and how it transitioned through out the movie was perfect. The acting was spot on especially from Emma Stone. But the ending was just disappointing.

They even though everybody are idiots except cruella. One look at the lower face and speech already revealed who she is. An old servant turned against a long master did not make sense here.In conclusion, this movie is childish, fake story, doesn't know the law, low standard, badly made, horrible story, and sadly one of the worst disney movie I have watched in a decade.I cannot give it good stars because this is too horrible wasting money movie. I cannot give it 1 star because it is simply better than the worst movie in the world.",Cruella

Possibly one of the most evil of all, giving a combo between Miranda Priestly and Cersei in terms of her utter evilness. Definitely one of the darkest Disney films, but without going too far. The story was entertaining, and the COSTUMES!!! Beyond magnificent. I can easily see this winning an Oscar for costume design in the future.

And in this light, it did not met my expectations.I was expecting the same twist of turning the villain into to good guy, lots of laugh, sweet tender moments and marvellous photography and design (including costume design).So in Cruella we do get to see she is not the villain. The two main actors (The Emma's) did a wonderful job as always and costume design is awesome.Some special effects could definitely be better.And in sum, it did not make laugh as expected and the sweet tender moments were lacking.But is nevertheless a fun watch.",Cruella
230,greggman,Would have been a 7-8 if not for the overbearing manipulative overused music,6,17 June 2021,"The story was actually not that bad. There were parts that could have been better but overall it turned pretty good. The biggest problem with the movie is every 5 minutes there's another massively overused oldie hit song stuck in to try to manipulate you. Tarantino choses oldies well and he doesn't pick overused songs but this director just shoveled in the music like a kid with a spray whip cream can.It's possible it's not the director's fault. Maybe marketing sat in the back and said ""put 15 oldies in because it always manipulates people. They transfer their affection for the oldie to the movie""Unfortunately it's cliche in the extreme at this point. And worse, the songs are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OVERUSED!!!! Every year, maybe every 4 months, another movie or TV show with these same songs appears. Come on people, STEP UP YOUR GAME!",Cruella
231,MovieWarfare,A lot to love despite being an unneccesary movie,8,6 June 2021,"Great another Disney prequel movie about making a Disney villain sympathetic. That was my thought when I heard the announcement of this movie. I had no care about watching this as Disney have sucked with these live-action prequel/remake of Disney animated movies. I eventually decided to give it a watch as there was a fair amount of internet buzz, both positive and negative, that kind of made me want to watch it. The premise is ""Estella is a young and clever grifter who's determined to make a name for herself in the fashion world. She soon meets a pair of thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they build a life for themselves on the streets of London. However, when Estella befriends fashion legend Baroness von Hellman, she embraces her wicked side to become the raucous and revenge-bent Cruella"". So does Disney finally do it right or is does this skin the legacy of 101 Dalmatians?Firstly, Emma Stone does a phenomenal job as Cruella. I honestly thought no one would be able to live up to the performance by Glenn Close, who is also an executive producer on the movie, as Cruella but Emma Stone proved me wrong. Her performance was very stylish and cruel which is exactly what I want from Cruella. Emma does add another layer to the character in the heartfelt moments which does make her more sympathetic. Emma Thompson plays the antagonist, the Baroness, and she also delivers an amazing performance by being narcissistic and full of attitude. Every time Emma Thompson is on screen she just steals it. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser also do a good job as Jasper and Horace respectively. They play the friends of Cruella and add a level of heart and fun to the movie that I really enjoyed.One of the best aspects of Cruella (2021) is the rivalry between the titular character and the Baroness. Seeing both of them compete in fashion war was surprisingly exciting to watch. Every scene with them together is tense, and this is thanks to both Emma Stone and Emma Thompson having great chemistry. I also really love how bold and dark the director, Craig Gillespie, went with it. There is violence, murder, attempted murder, attempted child murder and corruption that genuinely surprised me. There is also a twist near the end that I think was pretty good and I think a fair amount of people would not expect.Cruella (2021) is a visual spectacle thanks to the costume design by Jenny Beavan's. There are countless different and unique clothes throughout the movie that are stunning. We got the extremely over the top fashion from Cruella but we also got the elegant yet beautiful clothes of the Baroness. There are so many costume changes and they are all great yet perfectly represent the characters, it is quite an achievement from Jenny. The set design is also really well done and bring 1970s London to life. We get the gloomy city but the vibrant parties which all look stunning. The cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis is gorgeous and illustrates the party and costumes perfectly. One scene on the top of my mind is the Cruella catwalk which looked stunning thanks to the cinematography. Cruella also has a great music score by Nicholas Britell. The orchestral compose soundtrack works well for every scene and really captures the emotion of the moment. He also utilizes a 1970s pop soundtrack which you think would be annoying but it works so well here. Every song choice is used effectively and fits the scene that is occurring.However, some scenes get slightly ruined thanks to the really bad CGI. The CGI is very noticeable, especially when it is the dogs which I don't get why they had to be CGI. There are scenes at night that are usually done to hide bad CGI but even that doesn't work to cover it up. Additionally, the story is very predictable for the most part and simply goes beat for a beat on a villain origin that is very formulaic. Disney has done the story beats for Maleficent and this goes the same way.The runtime is also 134 minutes which is very noticeable as there are some moments where the pacing slows down considerably. It could have cut down by at least 15 minutes while still retaining the core elements. There are issues with the screenplay with some lines feeling overly cringy or edgy that sound dumb and don't quite fit the tone of the movie. One big gripe I had was a dumb moment near the beginning to make Cruella sympathetic that was so stupid that I laughed even though it was not meant to be funny. It was just a really weird and dumb way to justify her hatred of the Dalmatians.Overall, Cruella (2021) surprised me a lot in how much I enjoyed it. It was to the point that I couldn't believe this was the same company that made Mulan (2020). Despite feeling there was no need to make a prequel on dog skinning lady even after finishing Cruella (2021), it's an excellent movie. It has gorgeous cinematography, stunning costumes and sets, a vibrant soundtrack with an amazing performance from Emma Stone and Emma Thompson. There is a lot to love in this movie which is why I believe that anyone who is still sceptical, should give Cruella (2021) a chance. It might surprise you.",Cruella

233,ianwagnerwatches,Lost Potential: Another Shameless Disney Cashgrab,3,18 August 2021,"When one thinks of the character of Cruella de Vil from the 1961 film 101 Dalmatians (or the 1996 film, not that it matters to the non-existent timeline), surely the memory calls to mind the fact that she was a villain. That was more or less her entire character in the 1996 film, her entire narrative purpose: evil bad lady. So, imagine my surprise when Cruella portrays this character as a good person, a benefactor, and a not at all ill-willed individual except for a few moments where she leans into the Cruella ""character"" that Estella crafted. Also, the audience is lead to believe that Estella caused the death of her mother by inadvertently leading a pack of angry Dalmatians to her, who pushed her off a cliff. But, it is later revealed that the new evil bad lady, Baroness Von Hellman actually sicked the Dalmatians on Estella's mother, which completely absolves Estella of any guilt and annihilates any interesting or maleficent character motivation that she may have had. You may have also noticed that Baroness Von Hellman's name is very similar to the style of Cruella De Vil's name, and that's no accident. In fact, Estelle bases the entire Cruella character on her: yet another way the writing of this film robs Estelle of any interesting choices.I wanted to know how Disney was going to make a woman obsessed with making a coat out of Dalmatians into a main character. Certainly it would be an anti-hero-at the very least, I'd expect her to be a character made by her choices. Not so. Cruella makes a day out of explaining away literally all of her interesting character traits: Her hair? Turns out she was just born like that. Sure, whatever, maybe having her actually decide to dye her hair half black and half white would something interesting about the duality of her being, or even just reinforce her obsession with the colors of Dalmatians, but whatever, make it a birth defect. Her black veil? Uhhh, she got trash poured on her head, and I guess she thought that it looked cool. Yes, this makes sense. What about her trademark evil laugh? Ehhh, she saw a movie where somebody did it. Then, when she wants to be bad lady, she can do the bad lady laugh from the movie. Emma stone did her best, but the character written for her was completely uninteresting.Look, I'm no die-hard fan of the original 101 Dalmatians, but if you're going to make another reboot cashgrab about one of the most iconic Disney characters, why water her down? Why turn a villain into a good person who hardly even dabbles in villainy? Well, the answer is actually quite simple when you think about it. Disney has never shown any storytelling capabilities beyond checking boxes that'll put asses in seats and money into the pockets of Walt Disney's tragic legacy. I had so much more to say about this film at the time I watched it, but giving it any more breath would be an injustice. Also, as with most films of this ilk, I simply can't remember much about it. I had to look up every name other than Cruella De Vil, when I could have spent that time on a movie that was made with actual care and passion.",Cruella

237,PerryAtTheMovies,"Surprisingly, a must-see....",9,30 May 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
Is a Cruella de Vil origin story something we asked for? No, I don't think it is. In fact, I think most of us had nearly forgotten about the ""101 Dalmatians"", or at the very least I had. However, is a Cruella de Vil origin something we deserved? After watching ""Cruella"" I can say, with some certainty, we did. Back when Disney had announced the film, and released the trailer, I was skeptical about how well it would turn out. On my Instagram page I had claimed that this movie wouldn't be much better than a 6/10. However, I was blown out of the water.The acting was superb from the lead actresses. Emma Stone really knows how to flip the switch from being sweet, innocent, and timid to cruel, devilish, and confident. Many times throughout this film it brought back memories to her time acting in ""Easy A"" where she owns who she is and does a stellar job. Opposite Emma Stone was Dame Emma Thompson. I'm not familiar with her work from the top of memory, but her performance in ""Cruella"" was top notch. She brought an equal part of the heat to this movie going tit-for-tat once the battle of Cruella versus The Baroness really started going. Besides the leads doing an incredible job the supporting actors did a phenomenal job, in my opinion, to carry the movie the rest of the way.I enjoyed the sounds and visuals of the film, as well. My music tastes differ from those found in the movie, however, they fit in a devilish way with rock/punk rock that finds it's way through the streets and on the stage. Visually, the film was appealing from the fashion to the cars to the rock stars it grasped my attention from start to finish.Lastly, the story. This is where it's about 99% great for me and that 1% just didn't sit entirely well. I appreciated that they started from the very beginning of Cruella's life. And when I say the very beginning, I mean, the very beginning of her life. From birth to adolescent to devilish de Vil it all was enjoyable as nothing felt rushed and it all blended well. The timeline chosen worked and never once made me think that it was a mistake to early access this movie. The only two parts that felt weird was first the parachute skirt, but you'll get there when you get there if you decide to get there. Second, the movie gave me flashbacks to my own childhood run in with a not so nice Dalmatian and for a few scenes I didn't fully enjoy the movie, but other than that, great movie.Overall:
A film we deserved even if we didn't ask for it. Emma squared put up a phenomenal performance and much better than I could have imagined. Story was pretty stellar. It flowed, made sense, and was rather quite enjoyable. Sound and Visuals were both amazing.The price tag of $34.99 CAD may have you second guessing the choice to early access. Considering that this film wasn't one of my 'must-sees' and I bought I would say go for it, especially, if a family is going to be watching. As it would be cheaper than seeing it in theatres.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes, because this was a great movie through and through'.Enjoy the show!",Cruella

Can you do all that as a backstory for a six-decade old, animated Disney feature film? Can you sew all those different fabrics and parts into one cohesive garment? Apparently, you can. There is so much brilliant writing, over-the-top performance, and spot-on production brilliance packed into this movie that it must simply be seen to be appreciated. I've never seen a movie like this and I don't think there's a written explanation that can do it justice. If you love all sorts of films like the ones listed above, you'll love this film.",Cruella
242,blackoutH,I believe what made Cruella mad were the CGI dogs,6,30 July 2021,"Yet another money grabbing movie that goes ahead and grabs an existing villain and ""makes it human"".I wanted to dislike this movie more because there are some really annoying decisions that I will get to but I do have to admit that, indeed there are good elements to it.If you surround yourself with amazing actors, you make it less bad, that's for sure, both Emma's do an amazing and believable work on their performances and it does work from a character perspective.The movie direction is fast paced but in a nice way and the set and custom design are very good as you would expect with such big budgets.Now for the bad stuff, for starters the CGI dogs threw me off from the beginning, I mean if they did had to be CGI (which in itself is fine) I expect from Disney to do a way better work, they are 100% unrealistic feeling like a mixed movie with both animated and live action actors whenever the dogs are on screen.Then of course the movie major problem: Hollywood figured out that the best movies and TV shows don't have villains or heroes, the best ones that actually touch you have human beings, and of course as humans our decisions are not always black and white, there is light and darkness in everyone. So the trend began where we moved away from the classic villains and decide to make anti-heroes type stories, which let me say I love.With that being said, you don't need to go ahead and grab every single villain in history and distort their stories just to make it human, Cruella's plot doesn't make sense, it doesn't add up with the villain we see in the original Disney movies - by trying to justify her actions and making her relatable they are simply creating a different version of the same character, it's not actually a prequel, but more of a Reboot.They can make as many anti-heroes stories that they want, and humanize a so called villain but you don't need to grab old characters just be original and make new stuff, let the old ones go!That associated with some ridiculous scenes (the parachute one, really?) just makes this an average film, I would have rated it lower but the acting and set were indeed terrific.",Cruella

244,dan_slentz,Okay movie for teen girls.. but not so much for others (and TERRIBLE digital animation),5,29 May 2021,"Movie review from ""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies""This is a Disney movie, but certainly not the vibes of a Disney movie. First, yes.. this IS a movie about Cruella de Vil, but the story is NOT like the cartoon or the Glenn Close movies (101 Dalmatians). Yes, the lead character is the same (though not the age) and names will be the same, but a VERY different story. So.. first.. do NOT expect that this will resemble 101 Dalmatians and it will help you enjoy the movie. This is more of ""the making of Cruella de Vil"" than 101 Dalmatians.Emma Stone does a fine job, and Emma Thompson and other cast do a good job, but the story lacks a charm to it. The digital animation is VERY poor and completely unconvincing (especially compared to what Hollywood can produce). Disney may want their $150 back they spent on that digital animation. The dogs were so grossly unnatural with their movements that you just couldn't watch it without thinking ""man.. this is soooo fake"" (and that just isn't the norm for what can be done today).My 19 year old daughter enjoyed this (much of the movie has a lot of a ""fashion storyline"" behind it.. so that might be why). The soundtrack was SO different from Disney that you could have swore Dreamworks produced it (Disney doesn't often license a complete soundtrack of popular music from the 60's and 70's.. and this thing was more like a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" soundtrack).On a 1 to 10 scale, I'd give this about a 5.2 (and my daughter gave it a 6.2 saying the costumes were great but the animation was pretty unforgivable). I'd say this a teenage girl movie.. and that's probably the right audience.",Cruella
245,Dottsylove,Cruella who??,7,30 May 2021,"Yeah, yeah I heard the name before and I know the character -- somewhat -- but not at all interested in said character. Only reason why I watched this was because I've seen everything else and am desperate. I'm glad I did though.First off the soundtrack is A M A Z I N G. Sooooo many older popular songs throughout the entire flick and it really works. All Actors do a fine job and the movie is fast paced and interesting until the end. Some nice comedic moments as well provided by Cruella's ""sidekick"" / Friends and a few dogs.🐶 7 outta 10.",Cruella
246,CrazyCockatoo2003,At least its better than the remakes from 1996 and 2000 respectively.,5,20 June 2021,"While this movie does clear up how most of the things had happened before the events of 101 Dalmatians (how Cruella got her car, her goons, her mansion, etc), it failed to answer one of my biggest questions, that being how she got all 84 of the Dalmatians (probably for ""sequel baiting"" purposes)I can give this film props for its acting, CGI, being somewhat faithful to the original 1961 movie, and soundtrack.However, I disliked its slow pacing, half the film is incredibly boring, the infamous ""Dalmatians kill Cruella's mother scene"", it's predictability, Cruella being too tame, and several plot holes.Overall, I found this film rather mediocre. It's not as good as the original hand drawn movies, but is leagues better than the remakes. I also think this is one step up of the Disney live action remakes.",Cruella

248,NestorTheGreat,Two wrongdoings make the third much easier,8,5 September 2021,"The heartfelt tale of how a villian becomes so evil, in this case, makes you love the bad guys more than the squeaky clean ones, unfortunately! The two Emma's are superbly cast in their out-of-character roles, and the rest of the cast shine in the little light they're left with.This is no rags to riches fable, nor an Oliver-esque sob story, yet all the hallmarks of both are embedded marvellously in Cruella's life and given a new hue. The final cut showcases a brand new stylish creation that flows dramatically pompously throughout its running time. Hitting every beat with a note never before heard of in villian backstories, the dressmaker that clothed Cruella saw a shadow in her none of us expected!That her distressed obsession we see in 101 Dalmatians is totally substantiated through the turmoil in this film speaks volumes of Disney's new outlook on the greys between their usual black and whites!I'm not sure I'd feel the same way about the dog-hating version of Cruella we are introduced to in 101... if I'd seen this film first. Maybe parents be warned to show your children 101... first, or 'evilness may be warranted given the right circumstances' will be the new lesson learned? Can't be sure, but surely can feel for Cruella's plight thanks to Stone's brilliant tone!Smart, funny, and a touch sensitive, this film will replace many viewer's favourite bad-guy origin story film, for sure!!",Cruella

Don't get me wrong all the connections are there, but they aren't true to the originals. I love how the Disney live action movies add a lot more to the stories and characters. Cruella is probably the best in this sense. The back story of her childhood and past is very well written. My only complaint is that she's a hero. I understand modern day Disney is nothing like the Disney of the past and they focus strongly on heartwarming hero stories, but if that's the case they shouldn't have live action movies for villains. Cruella is arguably the most ""cruel"" villain in Disney history. While this movie displays that at times, she is mainly a caring hero at the end of the day.",Cruella

I am also taking my wife's opinion of the movie into account who is probably exactly the desired audience, and she found Cruella very average as well. Cruella is acted well, particularly by Emma Stone who is among the top leading ladies in the industry, but ultimately rings hollow. There is no need for the movie to be over 2 hours and really no need to have a movie about Cruella at all. Cruella is a technically well made movie (aside from all the CGI dogs) that some will enjoy, but I recommend avoiding unless you are a big Disney or Emma Stone fan.",Cruella
257,ty-jensen,Fun caper film.,7,20 June 2021,"I was excited for Cruella mainly after seeing some reviews. I was going to wait for the film to be free on Disney+ but I reconsidered. Cruella is a fun caper film.The acting was good mainly the two Emmas. Cruella herself is portrayed as an anti-hero as expected. Most of her victims mistreated her so you can't be mad at her. The Baroness is truly awful, she's arrogant and ruthless.Cruella is a dark film but I expected it to be darker. It has plenty of humor which lands. The film is aimed at adults mainly for it's fashion theme but some kids can enjoy it. Cruella was compared to The Devil Wears Prada which I skipped, I didn't like the trailer.Cruella looks good mainly the production design. The punk rock scene looks stunning and it has the best song. Cruella takes place in the 70s so it has songs from that era. I think the soundtrack was okay, the punk rock song was the only good song and there was one bad song.Cruella is over two hours long and it feels that way. The first two acts are a little overlong mainly the first act. I was never bored but some kids if not a lot will find the film boring. Some fans may find the second act repetitive.Fan service is common nowadays but it hardly bothers me. I enjoyed Rise of Skywalker but I agree the fan service was overdone. Cruella has some fan service which was mostly overdone. The film has a mid credits scene setting up 101 Dalmatians.Overall, Cruella was a fun caper film. It's dark but it has plenty of humor. Kids can see it, maybe not young kids. If you like Emma Stone, you should see it sometime. Disney already greenlit a sequel which could be fun.",Cruella

It's too dark for kids, I don't even think it would appeal to anyone until they're a teen. Nostalgic adults, teens and 20 somethings who like Disney? They've got Estella/Cruella getting drunk yet she can't have her iconic cigarette holder because I guess that's somehow worse?The plot is weird. It's supposed to be the backstory of Cruella, it's largely lifted from a cross between some cheesy crime movie or tv show and combined with The Devil Wears Prada. It often avoids going too over the top so it doesn't really break the dark aspect much.Other than that it's interesting enough and nicely shot. I just can't figure out what they thought the target audience should or would be if they even knew. This is more one for the late teens through adults.",Cruella

265,cristinalinderman,A remarkably entertaining film.,7,9 June 2021,"* There is 1 mid-credit scene *The director Craig Gillespie and crew brought a remarkably entertaining film. Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to it and when I watched the trailer my expectations went further low. What angered me was why sometimes they have to make a prequel origin towards a villain, trying to always explain why a character became evil. There are just some characters that need to just stay villain without a sob story. For me, the character Cruella was a character to one see her as very cruel to the bone and I would have loved for it to stay that way because some people are just born that way. I didn't like the idea of this prequel because I always saw her as a spiteful antagonist in which the animated 101 Dalmatians (1961) did a great job and the live-action 101 Dalmatians (1996) portrayed by Glenn Close gave a great evil performance. Even though I didn't like the idea well the only way I accepted to enjoy this movie was to separate the role from the known character that I have known since I was a kid. In other words like a brand new character.I took to my comfort to embrace this movie like a reboot to the character Cruella and not as a prequel in which has no connection to the Cruella I have known for so long. Being that said on not regarding this movie with any connection to the 101 Dalmatians then this movie was incredible. A movie about dreams, revenge and it all sets around the fashion industry what isn't not to love about that even the dogs were adorable and so good in it. The story pace was magnificent and with perfect timing on setting the twist giving one to appreciate how careful it was set. Also giving the film more time to set a different atmosphere for the unfolding of the character and the narration gave it more spunk.The composer Nicholas Britell brought the right kind of music in which defined the changes of the main character. The movie felt alive with fashion in its mind due to the electric music and the villain's tone. Not only his music was perfect but also every choice of songs made this film energetic and intriguing. There are only a few movies that know how to balance the composer's music and the chosen songs. Especially songs that give scenes the right tone of what it was projecting.The cast was astonishing, Emma Stone, Emma Thompson, Joel Fry, Nicholas Britell, and Mark Strong performances were exceptional. I have to give more appraise towards Emma Stone and Emma Thompson they were powerful and their chemistry was bone-chilling. These two female actors never disappoint and their roles were so strongly capturing the right points of their acting skills. Also, Emma Stone's rise of how her character was changing during the circumstances of her story was gripping and how awesome her expressions were within its unraveling.",Cruella

267,tarwaterthomas,Go see this movie!!!,10,31 May 2021,"It's a good way to find out how Cruella de Vil felt the need to make a fur coat out of those 101 Dalmatian doggies. She started out as teenage fashion designer wannabe Estella (played con brio by Emma Stone) who had been an orphan as has her sidekicks Jasper and Horace. She encounters top fashion doyenne Baroness von Hellman (also played con brio by Emma Thompson), finds out that the Baroness forced her mother off the edge of a cliff side into the roaring ocean, is chased by three Dalmatian doggies, and is out for revenge. Estella disguises herself as the mysterious Cruella, and crashes the Baroness' soirées. There is just no let-up, especially when you find out that Estella/Cruella just so happens to be the Baroness' daughter! And just when you think that Estella is about to meet her adoptive mother's fate, she deploys a parachute! Great visual effects supervised by Max Wood. If this movie does not get Academy Award nominations for Jenny Beavan's costume design, Fiona Crombie's production design, and Martin Foley's art direction, there's just no justice. You feel like you are in the London of yesteryear. But this movie would have bellyflopped had it not been for both Emma. How both those two ladies getting Oscars for their acting?

One of the most iconic villains that Walt Disney ever made was not even a witch, or a sorcerer or even a wizard - it was woman who hated one thing in life, and it was not even the smallest mouse - it was the fact that she was loved and oh yes, even at some point dalmatians.For Cruella or Estella, it was not just about red, it has always been black and white. Nothing, and I mean nothing would stand in her way of getting what she wants. Well, I am not going to spoil anything for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I will say this, this fashionista, is out for anything that she can make out of fur or even the slightest woof.Emma Stone - what can I say, honestly - she drove Cruella to the brink of the spotlight. She had me at ""Hello, darling!"" That iconic laugh - well - she nailed it. Now the other Emma - Emma Thompson - let us just say that she did not give Emma Stone a run for her fashion, so to speak.The music was stupendously, insane. Everything was just ""spot on!""

Take Plots of prior films Oliver twist ,Devil wears Prada, Revenge, & Hunger Games gothic fashion. Mix them up WITHOUT a lot of thought, incl the casting, & result is this lengthy 2.3 hours incredulous, non-captivating shallow violent revenge tale. This is NOT Joaquin's ""Joker"".Plot Cons:
Impoverished street petty crimes 3 orphan teens gang suddenly get big $$, sophisticated equipment & skills to achieve MI6/ Mission Impossible revenge stunts on the established security laden mansion/factory owned by ruthless fashion diva baroness. Same Under 25 gang adds 2 more impoverished peers with jobs to quickly commit more elaborate & costly FELONY James Bond type destruction on baroness properties for ""fun"".Nothing is remotely believable in Ella's hate psychotic driven elaborate revenge spree, incl new roles for Horace & partner (puppy nappers in original). Clearly one can discern she's Ella under her facial ""disguises"" / makeup, & unique voice. Ella & her inexperienced conspicuous gang would be easily caught & persecuted during the 1st act of revenge.The Upper class in England know each other & their close associates, esp at private VIP events. Why would powerful popular trend setting ruthless baroness be the EXCEPTION? Had status quo ever favored anarchy instead of themselves?More importantly, Ella gets her dream job & recognition from baroness on her merits- why discard that & become a violent criminal? Is that Disney's message to teens- choose hate revenge crime spree regardless consequences instead of honing one's s talents by work?The major plot twist also fails due to burden of proof is on Ella in any court. Again she needs big bucks & lots of time to meet that burden esp in 1970s. Even if she did win, baroness had 20+ yrs of control & building her own design business. The plot twist ending is very predictable.Last, the black dog is invisible to everyone.Plot Pros:
Disney uses mostly mutts, preventing sudden demand of purebred dogs. Film is easily forgettable despite its length.Summary:

I liked the movie once Cruella became a competitor to Emma Thompson's character. I like that this movie takes place in the 70s, the movie looks like it takes place in the time period. I really liked the soundtrack. My favorite part of Cruella is the soundtrack. The plot twist in this movie was good. I liked the montages in this movie. I liked how they were done. I really liked the camera work and how the movie was directed. I just wish that there was more to do with dalmatians and less to do with fashion but I'm sure the sequel will fix that. I do wish that Cruella would of died at the end of the movie but of course they wanted to make a sequel because if she would of died then the movie would be about Cruella's life from birth to death. I do believe that this movie was made because of Joker because both movies have a familiar feel, they both take place in the 70s and Cruella was filmed right around the time Joker came out. I enjoyed Joker a lot more than this movie. Since Cruella is similar to Joker that I was surprised that this movie didn't end with playing Frank Sinatra's That's Life. I didn't mind this movie but it could of been better especially if it was Rated R like Joker. I did really like the soundtrack though. Overall, Cruella is probably a 6/10 but the soundtrack makes it a 7/10.",Cruella

Emma Stone and Emma Thompson put in stellar performances. Emma Stone, in particular, sold me on her portrayal of Cruella/Estella. I couldn't help a sardonic smile or two throughout the movie.The young Estella was also really entertaining. The setup at the beginning of the movie was a little rough, but otherwise you really liked the little troublemaker. -1 star for the bumpy start, though.I will agree with other reviews about the digital animals. They weren't very well done. It was painfully obvious when they switched to a digital dog instead of a live animal. -1 star for the digital animals.Anyway, really enjoyed this movie. It's definitely worth seeing.",Cruella

The story, cinematography, soundtrack, and the clever ideas put to screen and brought to life by remarkable writing and acting. The thing is, I couldn't care less about how it does or doesn't relate to previous films or cartoons. Erudite posers love to bash prequels, sequels and ""based ons"" simply because they themselves don't create much of anything. With their home-based ""careers"", they write their opinions on the same tablet that's still warm from watching the film. I read Seitz's ""professional"" critique (courtesy of RogerEbert dot bomb), and I thought to myself he couldn't possibly have watched the movie given how much time he spent trying to prove his own hypotheses.

Cruella displays the history of the wicked designer from 101 Dalmatians, and I'd like to appreciate Disney for noticing this impressive villain with bold personality. Surely, the characteristic charisma successfully supported the development of Cruella's madness and sorrow, and her showdown with the Baroness contributed to her resolution with her identity and aim. To summarize, the film's surprisingly fluent and complete. Huge shout out to the signature piece using cocoons as decoration, very nice imagery and eerie imagination. On the downside, there's a few logical loophole, especially the parachute, and ambiguous character motivation at the middle part of the movie. But Cruella has excelled my expectation in all.",Cruella

So it was easier to watch Cruella, as I didn't have something to compare it to (Not the same for Lion King). And boy was I impressed! Cruella de Vil and the Baroness played their characters extremely well, though I don't feel the same for Jasper and Horace. The plot isn't easily predictable but the first few dim-lit moments did remind me of Joker. It's a Disney movie minus the songs, which does feel weird but was indeed a good decision.And oh the clothes. They deserve appreciation of their own. The movie isn't just about how Cruella de Vil came into existence, it's also about fashion and family. But. If you're watching the movie expecting it to be like the classics, don't.

Directed by Craig Gillespie, this movie is visually stunning, with amazing shots, stylish effects and incredible costumes. Duo of Emmas (Emma Stone and Emma Thompson) are doing amazing work with the material they have, but something is amiss here. It feels as dark in its humor as DC usually does, not Disney, and it lacks something really important - originality. It actually is ""The Devil Wears Prada"" with Harley Quinn in it. No other way to say it. Disney wants to change the villain Cruella, but sometimes villains just should be bad.

And it was due to the traditional lack of balls of Disney.Look, in 101 Dalmatians Cruella wanted to make a coat with puppies. Puppies! It takes a very particular type of person to do that (i.e. A psychopath, a person that lacks basic emotions). If Disney wanted to show that not everything is ""black and white"", that bad people is bad for a reason, etc. (which is great, because, in fact not everything is black or white) they could have. They could have shown us how a ""normal"" person becomes a psychopath. But they didn't. They didn't had the balls to portray an really cruel person, a villain (as she was in the original story). Instead they portrayed a ""mean"" but kinda cool girl, who wears a mask but is good inside. And that could have made a great movie, a great character, except...that's not Cruella.I'm giving it a 7, because I loved Emma Stone, her performance was amazing...and because it's not a bad movie.

311,johnny-89987,this is fake cruella,4,26 June 2021,"It was disappointing it was a fake Corolla. He was not evil at all! Rather, he was like a normal human being seeking revenge. The real Corolla is in the 101st Spotted Dog animation, not in the movie. The film has only beautiful colors and glazes, but its characters have a fundamental flaw. In this animation, we meet a relatively old and evil woman named Corolla who is looking to skin the dogs to make a cape and clothes out of them with a wonderful cigarette that gives off green smoke. But in this movie, he suffers with Jon's daughter based on a fictional story that seeks revenge on his fake mother's killer! There is no mention of attractive cigarettes and old age. The writers too wanted this character to be the human dimension of the body, and he became an innocent human being, completely removed from the unique Cruella of the animation. The next mistake is choosing a young actor like Stone for the role, while the Corolla is not too young in 101 Spotted Dogs. The next problem is the spotted dogs that are portrayed very wildly, while in the animation they are only in front of the wild corolla, not all. And on the other hand, the kind Corolla is depicted !! Altogether, the filmmakers destroyed all 101 Spotted Dogs animation images alone. Ironically, the most ridiculous thing was that Corolla apologized to Jasper and Hors for the slander. It was really funny, I suggest you watch the 101 Spotted Dog animation again after watching this movie, to somehow erase this poor movie from your mind. The point of Disney content is that it ignored and eliminated the role of the father in the film altogether. This particular issue is unfortunate .",Cruella

Devil Wears Prada
Sherlock
101 DalmatiansAn excellent Disney movie. No propaganda, no politically correct bs or ""company vision"" showed down our throats. I was starting to lose hope after the Mulan and Raya nonsense, but Cruella is an actual story with a vision that's interesting, fun, alive and in the spirit of the classical Disney films. PG-13.The story follows Cruella in her younger years of being a fashion designer, many years prior to what happens in the 101 Dalmatians. It was very obviously inspired by Devil Wears Prada, as Cruella struggles to survive under her demanding, cold, totalitarian genius boss; the similarities are so apparent that I refuse to call it anything but a tribute, and also the screenwriter who created Priestly, the ""Devil"" from Devil Wears Prada, wrote an early draft of ""Cruella"" and got story credit on the finished film. Since the film itself is partially about the fashion industry it is just great to look at - stylish, colorful, original (Costume design Oscar??); but it also has that indescribable ""Sherlock"" charm and style around it, with the London setting, posh and eccentric accents and the way the characters roast each other when interacting. Emma Stone absolutely nailed everything: the role, the accent and the looks; and the presence of Emma Thompson is physically felt every time she appears on the screen. A cherry on top is the amazing choice of soundtrack; full credit to the person who chose all the ~15-20 songs that played throughout the film, your contribution was not only noted but essential.Note: there is a specific moment in the very beginning of the film that most of you will find disappointingly stupid and illogical, but don't dwell on it, they will actually have an explanation for everything.

I truly thought however, like in so many recent movies, that after 10 minutes I would get up and walk out, angry because the woke crowd ruined another good movie possibility. But to my surprise over two hours later I was sitting there watching the credits roll happy to be wrong.I read a lot of reviews on this site, especially those who rated this movie a three or less, it seems the common themes are, it is slow, boring and the writers copied the devil wears Prada. I agree there was a lot of feeling of the Devil wears Prada meets a classic Disney character. But so what, this was a movie where the characters were fashion designers so if you're going to use a movie as a steppingstone, then the Devil wears Prada seems like a perfect choice. As for being slow and boring I'm not sure what those people want in a movie, perhaps they should just stick to the Marvel movies. Each character in this movie is very well developed and very interesting the dialogue was creative and ranged from humor to drama at the near perfect times I found myself laughing in many parts, I found myself upset at some of the characters which is the goal, I felt myself feeling sympathy and empathy for the characters and The pace of this movie couldn't have been better and if it could be, then only slightly. The casting choice was perfect almost for every character in this movie.To me the movie felt pretty close to the old Disney films of yesteryear. It had everything and I think it was a great prequel to the Crulla character, especially showing where the obsession for Dalmatians stems from.I'm a little surprised that it only has barely a seven rating, I would give this an 8.5 but as we can not rate with fractions, I gave it a nine, because it deserves the rounding up.As for those who rate this movie 5 or less, turn on another Marvel movie and don't waste your time with movies that have real and meaningful dialogue with meaningful characters and a very creative production, and is not just a bunch of people in tights running around, blowing stuff up.

Cruella is no exception, taking us on a painful winding journey of a young girl lost in the world, struggling with her inner demon and trying to choose a path in life. The question of nurture versus nature is explored deeply in this absolutely brilliant movie. Emma Stone was born for this role. She displays incredible depth and range, a woman struggling with her involuntary past at the edge of controlled madness.Emma Thompson as usual plays her role flawlessly, giving a chilling portrayal of mental illness. Mark Strong of course delivers a calm, reassuring rock of strength in an ocean of chaos. The casting of this movie is brilliant.The fashion aesthetics of this movie are truly exemplary. Every single outfit and ensemble is classy and well placed for the period and the moment. I did not think there would be a worthy successor to 'The Devil wears Prada' but here we are. Hilarious moments and hijinks, and the constant battle of stealing the spotlight in crafty, shocking ways, keeps this pretty long movie clipping along.The soundtrack selection was spot on, each song was well placed for the era and scene. Immersing Cruella's journey in the glorious decades of London life from the 60's onwards, especially the punk era, adds a genuine anchor to the tale.Even though the after credits scene seems to imply a direct transition to beloved cartoons of yore, I would venture to say we should have a sequel within this microcosm.",Cruella

I still remember coming home after school, turning on the television and putting the 101 dalmatians in cartoons while I heated the food that my mother left me, I even remember the characteristic smell, my love for Cruella arose there, then when I saw the Glenn Close's performance my admiration for the character multiplied, I always thought that she should have received recognition for everything she gave in that movie, I mean the movie wouldn't be the movie if it wasn't for her. Now Emma Stone completely fills Glenn's shoes and delivers an interpretation that, based on delicate movements, gestures and forms of accentuation in the correct words, presents the progress of a character known to all, but even more gives him soul, heart and humanity. That would be nothing without a high-level nemesis, Emma Thompson succeeds because during the first half of the film I could not decide which was my favorite, Cruella or the Baroness. Technically the movie stands out from the mound that Disney has created for its costumes, production design and makeup. The only thing that hurts me is that the score did not form a greater prominence since the music is excellent but unfortunately it does not shine as it does when you listen to it in its entirety, but I have to applaud the charm that Nicholas Britell managed to implement in his work. Finally I have to add that we must prepare, since a wave of admiration, inspiration or frenzy for the style both in clothes, makeup and music will take over the world, think something like The Devil Wears Prada, I can not wait for all the trends and videos that will be created in tik tok, because we must not forget that we are the future.",Cruella

However, originality is something much lacking these days.For parents, I would never allow any child under 14 to watch this film.

You could say: Standard for a big budget Disney movie.The costumes, the set design - great.Visually, the film knows how to convince, with a great soundtrack and beautiful local color of the 60s and 70s in London. You can tell the film cost money.What makes this film absolutely worth seeing, besides the great costumes and set design: Emma Thompson!!! She rocks the film and delivers a superb acting performance. It is a delight to watch her. The film is worth it for her alone.But: I see a lot in the film that reminds me of Guy Ritchie (soundtrack, characters, story, style, his Sherlock films) and some Tim Burton. Emma Stone reminds me of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman from ""Batman Returns"". Is that bad? Yes, because the film distracts and lulls me too much with it, doesn't live up to this potential, but exaggerates with it: too much style over substance.The sidekicks pale into insignificance.And: I find it very dubious to instrumentalize a person with multiple personality disorder to fit the story. For me, that's the film's biggest flaw. Here Emma Stone, here the script and here the film could have shown courage, because the word ""psycho"" falls from time to time in the film, but then the film unfortunately did not become so really psycho, but gets into the classic stereotypes of storytelling ( by the final third of the movie it gets more and more dull) with a modern coating. But then it wouldn't have been a Disney movie. And it has become almost mainstream that Disney has become a little darker for a few years, but polished smooth and easy to digest.Entertaining.And : Watch it for Emma Thompson! She's great.",Cruella
330,moviematthewh-60783,"Fresh new ideas, perfect cast, great soundtrack and costumes",8,29 May 2021,"This film surprised me very much. I'd only seen the trailer once and barely thought about it but I was still interested in seeing it and Im glad to say that this film was great. The idea of actually letting the villan be bad and not turn good is rare for Disney films, so the fact that they continued the theme of relentless and evil made me enjoy the story more. The cast is just perfect. Emma Stone is unrecognisable in some scenes and Emma Thompson almost mirrors her in some scenes. They both blend beautifully in either dramatic intense scenes or even some unexpected comedic scenes. The soundtrack is great, the film doesn't need to rely on a background score very often since songs set the mood for the scene and it's done great. The story overall is engaging as well. Some can relate many of the films themes, plot points and characters to The Devil Wears Prada and 2019's Joker and you can definitely see that in this film. The blend of the two films put into a live action Disney villan film worked very well. The setting is unique as well and the costume design is eye popping and mesmerising. Highly recommend seeing this film, hopefully on the big screen if possible but if your only option is Disney+, I'd still pay the extra fee to see it with everyone.",Cruella
331,JoelAlexanderr,Way better than anyone expected -- Emma Thompson deserves awards,9,9 June 2021,"I have to admit, I was not expecting much from CRUELLA, especially given some odd-looking trailers that made the movie seem like an emo version of The Devil Wears Prada. Luckily, the film I watched was far better than I ever could have expected, mainly thanks to filmmakers who understand the ins-and-outs of the source material and to some truly incredible lead performances.For the first 15 minutes, I wasn't sold on the concept of a prequel to 101 Dalmatians, and was starting to think CRUELLA would be a forgettable origin story with a decent soundtrack. However, the film immediately picks up as soon as Emma Stone appears onscreen as Cruella, delivering an electrifying performance that does justice to the works of the past while paving a new and more sympathetic version of this iconic Disney villain. But the real highlight of this movie is Emma Thompson as The Baroness -- she steals every scene her character is in and gives one of my favorite performances of the year. I'm hoping Thompson gets awards buzz for her diabolical work here, along with the excellent production design and the stunning costumes.For a prequel to an old animated Disney cartoon (or the live-action remake, depending on how you view it), CRUELLA is miles better than it has any right to be. After this movie, audiences will never think about this iconic villain in the same light. It manages to create relevant messages about how nastiness is rewarded in industries such as fashion while connecting it to the lore of 101 Dalmatians successfully. This balancing act is a difficult one to pull off, and director Craig Gillespie and the team of writers deserve credit for doing an awesome job. A-",Cruella

The characters Jasper, Horace, and Artie, specifically, pulled me into the film.

The characters are great and fascinating, I want to see so much more of them, but most of the events that happen make little sense once you think about them for even a second. The dialogue is pretty bad at points. For the sequel I genuinely hope they get a better screen-writer. Honestly, the only thing I really liked about this movie is that it's queer as all hell (I mean, it's literally a movie about a girl who is forced to repress her true self because she has been taught her true self is unacceptable and learning to accept herself as an adult). Honestly though, there's no real reason to watch this movie unless you're a Disney die-hard (God help you), or a fan of 101 Dalmatians (like me). It's not that great and you'll probably forget just about everything that happens shortly after the movie ends.",Cruella

338,WillsFilms,Cruella is a Thread of Mediocre,6,5 July 2021,"For the past ten years, Disney has bombarded cinemas with unnecessary live action takes on their animated classics. Cruella is one of the better ones due to its original story. However, it's hardly a good movie. Emma Stone is wonderful as Cruella and delivers a larger than life performance, which she gets completely lost in. As does Emma Thompson, who is brilliant fun to watch. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser also have great chemistry as Horace and Jasper, providing several great lines and comedic sequences. In regards to fashion, this movie W delivers with simply fantastic costume design and brilliant sequences to show them off. However where this movie falters is the ridiculous story. It's riddled with cliches, absurd plot points and ultimately portrays the attempted skinner of puppies as the heroine. The main issue is considering how evil she was, Cruella De Vil shouldn't be a heroine and because of that I struggle to get past this movie. That being said, I still do recommend this movie on account of the story being so absurd that it's honestly rather entertaining.However wait for August 27th when it becomes free on Disney +",Cruella
339,jaredkjacoby,A Much More Cunning Version of Cruella... for Better or Worse,7,1 June 2021,"Taking place in the 1970s during the punk rock movement, the story follows Estella Miller who lives with her friends, Jasper and Horace. Before then, she had an alter ego as a child named Cruella that got her banned from school. When her mother is killed, that is when she found Jasper and Horace. As an inspiring fashion designer, the two thieves help Estella get a gig at a popular fashion store... cleaning toilets and taking out the trash. One day, the Baroness comes to the store and hires Estella after being impressed with her work. During narration, Cruella stated that happy accidents do happen, though she does say she would not know if she would keep the word happy.Most Disney remakes do not intrigue me in the slightest. I think they are hard to get right because if you change too much from the original, it could come off as unfaithful or even pretentious. However, if you make a remake that changes almost nothing in the original film, it could come off as a shallow retread of the animated original film. Those two problems are pretty prominent live-action Disney movies based on their animation library. Why is this film different? I like Emma Stone, the premise intrigued me (A dark story in the lighthearted 101 Dalmatians world) and the trailer looked good so I was curious to see how the direction they would take one of Disney's most notorious antagonists. Cruella De Vil seems like a difficult character to center a whole movie on. How does Cruella fare as a protagonist?I want to say this. I am fine with Disney taking some of their most iconic villains and creating stories about them as the protagonists. Making a villain the main character can bring a new perspective on an old story while giving them more depth. However, while they can have a few sympathetic qualities, the writer needs to remember that they are villains and not anti-heroes. Cruella does a relatively good job at this. While the mean fashion designer is given more depth and a fleshed out backstory, she is still not a good person. She is not as villainous in the animated film, but she is mean and hammy. Nothing she does is outright heroic. That is one of this movie's biggest strengths. Young Cruella seems believable in this world of fashion and ruthlessness.In general, Cruella tells a very interesting story about how the Disney villain became who she was. The focus of the film is fashion. Estella (Cruella's good nature) dreamed of becoming a fashion designer and her relationship with Jasper and Horace. It is also about her finding out what happened to her mother and the truth about her death. I like this movie's sense of fashion as it fits the time period perfectly and it is nice to see a big budget movie about fashion in general. The script is solid as it takes time to explore Estella's descent into Cruella as well as how she got her two henchmen to work for her in the first place. However, the first scene where it supposedly explains her hatred for Dalmatians is so corny and cheesy that I could not help but laugh. That, and the scene itself is poorly filmed and shot, but besides that, it feels like a tapped on motivation rather than just letting Cruella be more villainous. Her conflict with the antagonist is intriguing though and that works because that conflict grows more intense. The tension here builds throughout the entire runtime.Cruella De Vil is hard to sympathize with knowing her nature in the animated film, but there are a couple times where it works. When she is mourning her mother and some of her scenes with Jasper and Horace are examples that show a softer side with depth and not just the hammy puppy killer we know. Aside from that, she works well as a protagonist not because of her sympathetic moments, but because of how interesting her personality is here. Instead of being ineffective and solely reliant on her henchmen, Cruella is very crafty and cunning with her planning. She acts like a troll to get under the antagonist's skin. I love the way she makes her appearances because she knows how narcissistic her opponent is and she goes to lengths to exploit their ego. She is also surprisingly badass here. She fights a couple henchmen on her own, and like I said, she is crafty in her planning. In fact, she relies more on her wits and trolling than her strength. Her side as Estella is also interesting as it explores her nicer qualities as well as her passion for design. Her childhood is kind of sad, but that one scene is a bit too corny to take seriously. Overall, this movie takes a rather underdeveloped comedic villain and turns her into a compelling villain protagonist while still maintaining Cruella's core nature: Her cruelness!Emma Stone as the title character is just phenomenal. I did not know what to think at first when she was casted, but she was made for this role. Admittedly, her role as Estella is more or less a dorky Emma Stone, but when she turns into Cruella, she shines. Her hammy nature is perfect, especially her first entrance at the Baroness' party. She has so much fun with this role with how she embraces the over-the-top nature of the character. However, one of her best scenes here is a monologue with her mother which should be too cheesy to work, but it does because Stone makes it work by showing the character some humility and weakness. Stone also has a scene where she has hilarious expressions matching her narration in a scene where she looks up at the ceiling. Emma Stone was always a great actress, but she shows how she can transform into an infamous Disney villain.As for the rest of the characters and performances, I like Jasper and Horace here a lot more than in the animated film. They come off as real people rather than bumbling henchmen. Cruella's relationship with Jasper was surprisingly sweet. Horace is still a comedic relief, but he is more competent here. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser play their roles well. Emma Thompson plays the narcissistic Baroness von Hellman. She is fun in this role as she clearly has a good time, but the character is surprisingly sinister. It is hard to go into too much detail without spoiling it, but she was a better character than I expected her to be. Anita and especially Roger are rather minor characters. The movie is focused on Cruella and it actually shows her friendship with Anita, but Roger could have been taken out of the movie and little would change.The script carries some level of originality. While there are clichés such as the dead parents at the beginning and life as thieves, Cruella's tactics in dealing with the antagonist are genuinely clever. How often is it that you see a movie where the protagonist focuses more on trolling and outwitting the antagonist than beating them up in a big budget movie? The fashion theme and time period are both used perfectly. This film gave me a glimpse of the '70s rock era both in style and story. It even has Cruella use her nice personality to her advantage. That was really cool. The film is much darker than the animated film, but it still has plenty of comedic and over-the-top charm. The dialogue has some wit and charm as well as some corny parts, but some lines stick out in a positive way. This is easily one of the more creative live-action films from Disney.As for the visuals, they are hit and miss. Some of the costumes look inventive such as this dress made out of newspaper and the flame dress. A lot of the outfits were intriguing, but some of them were not that great. Cruella's design looks solid throughout the film. Again, the opening scene with the CGI dogs looks laughably bad. The dogs look noticeably fake. Easily the worst looking part of the movie. The cinematography is great when the lighting is solid. There are some great shots in this movie such as a scene where the three climb a tall building and the shot with Cruella's entrance. Some of the lighting could get really dark though, particularly the night time scenes.The soundtrack is awesome. My mom recognized every single song and they were all from the era that this movie takes place in. This movie utilized the music from this era perfectly. The editing is pretty solid. The heists with the trio have a good rhythm to them. The movie in general has a good rhythm which helps it move at a solid pace despite its long runtime.Cruella is not without its faults, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I should have. I keep harping on Disney for their live-action films, but this is one of their better ones. It could have been trimmed a little bit and the first scene is weak, but what we have here is a legitimately creative take on a despicable Disney villain. Emma Stone carries the movie for sure, but the whole cast goes all out here. If Disney were to continue to make live-action movies based off of animated movies, I would rather have films like this than remakes.Oh and stay for the credits... for a scene that brings a rather unfortunate implication that brings up a rather unpleasant question.",Cruella

342,willcrabbe,The best live action Disney film in years,8,15 June 2021,"This is a film I did not see myself enjoying as much as I did. Serving as a (sort of) prequel to 101 Dalmations, Cruella is set in 1970s London during the punk rock movement and follows the character Estella (Emma Stone) as she attempts to make it in the fashion industry. She is taken under the wing of the vindictive and domineering Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson) and quickly learns secrets that will push her along the path to becoming the villainous Cruella De Vil.First off I have to praise the performances of both leads. Emma Stone is wonderfully hammy yet charming and surprisingly nuanced as the titular Cruella, while Emma Thompson is cold and ruthless as the fashion mogul Baroness. There was also great support from Paul Walter Hauser as 'Horace', who serves as the main comedic output of the film, a role which he serves with aplomb.I loved the Rock/Punk Rock style and aesthetic the film had, which is exemplified by the wonderful set and costume design and the excellent and unrelenting soundtrack. The original score from Nicholas Britell was also very effective at establishing the tone and mood and was quite Danny Elfman-esque.My main problem with the film comes in the form of writing, with some aspects seeming cheap and overly reliant on coincidence and convenience. The latter stages are definitely weaker and the film doesn't end quite as strongly as it should have.Overall, this is one of Disney's best live action outputs in recent memory although the sympathetic origin story seems tonally dissonant for one of Disney's most despicable villains.",Cruella

The childhood happenings and its aftermath was a delight to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie till 40-50 minutes. The movie succeeds in providing all the necessary ingredients in making yet another disney tale. Acting performances were good especially Emma Stone at times was close to greatness but makes the character more like a Harley ripoff at times yet she does it well , Emma Thompson portrays a different yet cruel antagonist which too added to the pro of the movie. Twists, costumes,lighting, sets and the variety manner of the story progression to the surprising end adds to the movie's delight. The visual grandeur and artistic take Cruella provides with its rich sets makes it a must watch movie of the year. Last but not the least the end credits had a good song,visualization and a post credit sequence offering much more in the future.Cruella has slight problems when it comes to CGI here and there. Lack of proper direction in the middle of the storyline leaves the movie in a mess. Moreover, the film feels lengthy due to numerous factors.

I really don't know who thought to themselves, ""We need an origin story about a popular villain and let the viewer have sympathy for the character."" It's an idea that works well with the Joker, because it's implied in the comics that the Joker did something in his origin that made him what he is now. It's pretty dumb to give a character like Cruella an origin story because it's never mentioned nor explained about what kind of life that character lived. Now that I got that off my chest, what did I think about the movie?Well... it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. In fact, it's pretty solid. It's nowhere near as bad or as awful as the live action remakes. In fact, I can totally see why people seem to love this movie and give credit. But it's not as great as that freaking high audience score on Rotten Tomatoes would tell you.It has a decent script, good cinematography, good visuals, surprisingly great voice acting by Emma Stone, the soundtrack is fine, and the editing fits in this kind of movie.Overall, Cruella wasn't too bad. It's not anything I love, yet I don't hate this movie like I thought I would. I thought it would be much worse than Maleficent and the Disney remakes, yet it's not a travesty of a movie like Mulan.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect based off the trailers. Was it going to be good or bad? That was my question. As I sat through the film I soon realized that I was wrong. The film was great. Plot, actors & actresses, and designs. Nearly everything was how I wanted it to be. Firstly, I would like to tell you that this is not Cruella De Vil. This my friends, this is Cruella. I will never see this as the same lady as in 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians'. It feels as if Disney has written their own new character, but used the same name. Anyway, back to the standard film review. This is honestly the best I've seen Emma Stone in a while. Perhaps the best I've seen her ever. Emma Thompson was also terrific in the role as the Baroness, a villain that you can easily feel threatened by. Spoiler aleet: There was a scene when I thought Disney was about to kill off THE Cruella. That's how good this film was. (P. S. Mark Strong was great too!) The actors for Horace & Jasper were also wonderful in their roles. Next up, I would like to examine the plot. Now, this is a completely original plot, and let me tell you: I loved it.

Luckily this did not disappoint!Emma Stone was truly having a blast with the role of Cruella and I loved her portrayal! Emma Thompson however is heinous yet she knocks it out of the park playing the evil Baroness. Paul Walter Houser is funny as hell playing Horris. The color scheme was very edgy and had some sort of vibrance hidden inside of it alongside with the costume design and the cinematography! I guarantee you if Craig Gillespie didn't direct this alongside with the writers not being involved, Cruella probably would've been a letdown.However I do have issues; A few times the lighting was dimmed out and it was very hard for me to tell what was happening. I can sometimes tell that CGI was used too much for a few things. For instance, some of the dogs, and even backgrounds or scenery's. And this movie relies way too much on popular 70's songs for its soundtrack. Overall, I had fun with this movie and I think it's one of Disney's better films in recent live-action movies. Great origin story too!Grade: A-; Score: 8/10.",Cruella

I'm sure i didn't get a lot of those references.Cruella is the origins story of the villain Cruella De Vil. Played brilliantly by Emma Stone, this character is greatly written amd performed. Definitely one of the greatest performances in Disney live-action movies. Although that isn't saying much.The Villain, Ms. Hellman, is played by Emma Thompson, also brilliantly. The characterization and setting of the character is astounding.You don't go see a Disney live-action movie expecting great direction and cinematography. But Cruella did this really great. There are long shots of fashion offices and ,well, Cruella and they're all done well.With these two Emmas in a film, you can almost assure it's gonna be a fun ride. Only problem with Cruella is the script. There is one event in this film that is very forced and cliched. Some may find it good but not me.Also, the ending is not well at all. The CGI in some scenes being very obvious is just a minor problem for me. But the way the movie ends just leaves you feel very rushed. Some parts don't make senses at all.Cruella is a perfectly enjoyable fun ride in theater or Disney+, doesn't matter for me. Go grab some popcorn and have fun.",Cruella

The Designs And Fashion Were All FABULOUS AND HARD NOT TO LOOK AWAY. The Way They Handled The Story And The Twists Was Soo Good And Very Unexpecting To Me And Emotional To Say. Cruella De Vil's Origin Story Was Definitely What We Needed No Matter What Other People Have To Say About It. 2hr's Of Capturing Disney's Cruel Villian, Explained In Pure Perfection That Just Delivers What Disney Fans Need Right Now And THIS MOVIE WAS ALL WORTH IT.

370,Broccolidwarf,Surprisingly good - and I expected to hate it.,8,7 June 2021,"Of all the Disney characters - many of which I loved as a kid - Cruella de Vil was always the one I disliked the most.It always seemed like a pointless and overly unrealistic character - I mean, come on, who hates puppies so much, that it becomes their obsession to kill and skin them?So despite liking Emma Stone, I watched with some hesitation, expecting a movie as over the top and shallow - dare I say ""annoying""? - As the Glen Close one.Instead, I found an interesting (though still wholly unrealistic) origin story, in a fairly ""dark"" backdrop of 1970's London - but with little funny gems dispersed evenly throughout the script, without it ever feeling forced.Think Devil Wears Prada meets Kingsman.Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser, are very funny sidekicks, who both manage to not fall into the all too common trap of of becoming cartoonish.Especially Paul Walter Hauser's work with the dogs is hilarious, and whoever got the idea to dress a dog as a giant rat, is a genius!Emma Thompson is also excellent as the antagonist, and Emma Stone as the protagonist is simply charming, giving a franchise building performance - especially if they allow for the character, to not develop into the end we all know from the original Disney story. - It would be far more interesting if they took it elsewhere.And yeah, some stuff is still over the top and unbelievable, but hey, so is Iron Man and a great many other movies based off cartoons.I highly recommend it, and it's a great date movie by the way, because of all the fashion references AND the action.",Cruella

373,nIGHTmAYOR,A Movie About Different Perspectives,5,12 August 2021,"So while this movie seems genuine at first glance going through it might slightly push the believe on you that this thing was inspired by the Joker movie .The movie itself is about the origins of the character Cruella from 101 Dalmatians trying to justify her diabolic attitude and selling her as a victim giving a whole new perspective to her mythology .Now I wonder what is this whole raid of ""Different Perspectives"" movies is aiming for ?I mean gaining sympathy to a psychopath like the Joker was a challenge the authors of the script wanted to undergo (where they threw in the card victim of cruel society to pull it off), but it's slightly different when it comes to someone who wants to make fur coats out of Dalmatian doggies that talk .I mean Disney what is the message now ?",Cruella
374,Mike-Bear,"Estella, Cruella, or Harley Quinn that we have been waiting for!?",8,2 June 2021,"Ladies and Gentlemen, this movie does not really correlate with a previously released movies and cartoons for the youths besides the origin (""101 Dalmatians"") of the Cruella and a few puppies of Dalmatian. I had a zero expectations and thought it will be another turn for Walt Disney to make money. However, Emma Stone as an amazing and stunning Cruella that more Harley Quinn than Margot Robbie, made an amazing twist, and I like it. Yes there are some correlation from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and typical cliches in a scenario, but it's unreal to expect uniqueness everywhere in 2021, and by the way it is movie about ""Cruella de Vil"".This movie worth to watch, you will not regret it, and it will not be a waste of time. It production of Walt Disney Pictures but nothing to worry, nothing been ruined, and instead viewers can expect quality. However, it is very unfortunate that Walt Disney was kind of being lazy in regards to the music part and simply took most of the popular hits that nowadays way too familiar for the audience. Also, it is okay to see dumb characters in a movies (for example, like stormtroopers from Star Wars) but when scenario without interesting turns or unexpected shifts, some people would feel bored. Fortunately, boring moments will be greatly compensated and you will not regret that decided to watch it.P.

Emma Stone is excellent as Cruella the fashion terrorist, and Emma Thompson has the best role in the film as the self-obsessed Baroness.Period London looks superb and the pop/rock soundtrack sounds fantastic (although it's comically unsubtle in some scenes).Unfortunately, Emma Stone as Estella misses the mark, and many of the supporting performances (especially the male ones) are cartoonish and unconvincing.Despite an uneven tone and pace in the first half, it builds into a thought-provoking and exciting drama, with plenty for older fans of the animated ""sequel"" to enjoy.",Cruella

387,joostkale,"Not one like the others, but unique",8,29 May 2021,"I was probably the only person who genuinely though this was going to be good, but even for me, it exceeded expectations. A lot of people were already writing it of the moment they saw the words: Disney life action, but I saw something else. I saw an original story, and if there's one thing Disney is good at, it's making good original movies. That's why we are getting so many remakes and sequels after all. The movie itself really delivered on that front. I was a little afraid Disney was too much gonna 'Disney it up', but apart from some cliché family and friend moments they did good. They made a unique and interesting origin to a character that is already iconic. That's an achievement on its own. The movie feels so unique and alive that it feels like its own thing. A lot of people are already making the comparisons to Joker and The Devil Wears Prada, but for me, it's not that. Of course there are some pieces here and there, but it really feels like a unique movie. It stands out. And although they keep shoving the 'I am different' storyline down your thought, it does have a point. They really nailed it honestly. Of course not every joke hits, or every twist is surprising, but it keeps you entertained all the way through.The performances are also fantastic. Emma Stone kills it (as always lately) as Cruella and shows that depth she has. You like her, hate her and care about her at the same time. Emma Thompson also nails the egocentric icon. You hate her, but can not help to respect her in a way. The outfits are also insane btw. I am not into fashion at all, but with entrances like that you can not look away. Oscar for Best Costume Design is probably in the bag. All in all, they over performed and showed that they can take risk and actually hit for once. Good Job Disney. Not stop making remakes and write more original stuff like this thank you.",Cruella

Both Emmas are a joy to watch, they performed their characters very well. Emma is best as Estella and Cruella both.The world-building and character development are too good. The background story of Cruella is brilliant.The soundtrack is excellent and the costume designs deserve Oscar. Such beautiful costumes I get to see in this movie. The cinematography and direction are the best.Cruella's character is quite similar to Joker and Harley Quinn but still, Cruella is much different from both the anti villains.She is dark and became burned by her career and looking for revenge as well as popularity just like the joker. While she loves unique costumes, makeup, a hairstyle like Harley Quin. She is cynical too like Harley and self-interested but then Harley is a good-hearted person who just made bad decisions while Cruella is sociopathic and a bit cruel as well.It's a fun, surprising, and engaging movie.

Emma Stone is phenomenal as Cruella, Emma Thompson does a great job as the Baroness. It also gives you a great 70s soundtrack and it all fits within the film.The Mixed- This is not a kids film, if you showed this to your kids they would probably find it boring.The Bad- The movies biggest fault is it's premise and character. I just can't root for our main character and most of this is down to everything that has been established in different versions of this character. Now this film is drawing comparisons to Joker which does make sense however Joker is played as a tragedy while Cruella is played as an underdog story. The movie can get very repetitive in the middle.Overall Thoughts- This is a very frustrating film, it has a premise that doesn't work for me but is executed with wonderful style and performances. Overall I'm going to give ""Cruella"" a 6/10 and I recommend watching it if you liked the trailers.",Cruella

It just looked amateurish, some of the worst CGI I've seen, and they cheaped out on the soundtrack, too. If you can't afford original artists like The Beatles and Led Zeppelin, maybe choose other songs rather than covers.And what market was Disney aiming for? The family market, so let's watch a pack of dogs kill the mother? Shades of Kim Jong-il, look away kids.That said, it has big movie spectacle moments with some decent action scenes, and the costume design is to die for, which pretty much sums up the lame plot. The two Emmas trying to out evil each other becomes tiresome after a while, while Cruella's two dumb but lovable sidekicks (usually played by mice or other cute Disney mammals) steal the show.This is mindless, derivative escapism for big kids with nothing better to do, and I regret that I didn't have anything better to do. Definitely a lockdown movie, maybe worth 5 stars, but I've giving it one because 7.4 is just a ridiculous score for an juvenile melodrama.",Cruella

There's nothing altogether objectional about any of it.

It was pretty fast paced with a bunch of montages and a great soundtrack. The movie kept getting more and more intense as it went on and I was constantly wondering if I should be routing for Cruella or not.

So I decided to watch this origin film earlier today at the cinema ( Better than watching at home) and it was fantasticEmma Stone killed it as a much younger and more ambitious Cruella who we could see from the get go that the character herself was already nuts. Then again if you knew who Cruella's mother is in the film and what she does, it's no surprise really. I've also noticed a lot of similarities between Cruella and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker from the characters to themselves, their upbringing, the family twists and so forthThe film has a great secondary cast with Cruella's friends and henchmen with one in particular is so hilarious. Now Im keen and will watch 101 Dalmatians movie now that I've seen, and really come to know who Cruella is, how she got to be where I assume she still is by the time of the first 101 Dalmatians movie, and the people she surrounds herself with.

And it keeps you on your seat wondering: ""what else is different"".Movie was a bit long but that's what I expected from a live action movie that is more for the older gen! Gave new hooks in every other chapter I felt while watching, some new info was brought into the movie that made the movie actually link together but still make you wonder ""what next?"". Love the bait and switch sort or characters Estelle plays onto the baroness! Giving her the fashion she so desire while topping off her own masterpiece with....her own masterpiece making the baroness even more envious of cruella! You can tell some of the scenes came from the original cartoon version (Horace watching tv and the dogs suddenly amused by it). It's almost like watching the devil wears Prada also, everyone's almost scared of the baroness and they are the lower class to her. Impressed by the baroness 's first meet with the window display she works her way up from line up fashion ideas to being her assistant and gives pitch ideas of fashion trends. Lots of revenge on this movie and I loved it! Never expected THAT dress!!!!! (You'll know which one I'm talking about) and she made it right in front of everyone.Enjoyed it.",Cruella
416,molobelalesedi,"a colorful movie, fun for children. watchable",6,4 November 2021,The kids loved the colorfulness. I watched it once and was just fine with it. It isnt a masterpiece fot it does pass as a reboot. Cruella is cunning and smart here. The villain is a woman who is also into desinging and the two are gifted on their craft. Disney is really attempting to milk our childhood stories for all they are worth.Im kinda disappointed it wasnt a dalmation movie. Nevertheless it is watchable.,Cruella
417,mgentalen,Absolutely Amazing!,10,30 May 2021,"When I first hear about Cruella, I was apprehensive, maybe scared it'd be the same cookie cutter. Generic plot. Even up til the month's of release, seeing the ad, I kept hoping ""it wasn't mis directed"" or ""aimed too cheesy."" Even as a a big Emma Stone fan, I was worried Disney miscasted. Boy was I wrong this time...Without giving any ploy holes, spoilers secrets away, Ms Stone is Cruella. We see a death in the beginning ( note, I did not say who), this starts the ' anger."" A good way to identify Cruella, without explaining too much, this film is the family version of Better Call Saul. Both Odenkirk and Stone have a ""alias"".Estella, gets taken in by two people running all over London pick pocketing. Cut to a time jump, on her birthday, Estella is given a card to come and work at this fashion where house, where Emma Thompson's character works. Up until this point, Estella is a sweet girl who gets by living in this apartment with these two ""crooks"" she calls family.The project is written by Aline Brosh McKenna, co creator of Crazy Ex Girlfriend, and wrote The Devil Wears Prada, We Bought a Zoo and 27 Dresses. There is a great soundtrack used, great costumes; just overly a fun time. I was going to say, Cruella is the Disney version of The Devil Wears Prada, BUT Disney owns ,Prada through the 20th acquisitionCruella is why we go to the cinemas! This was a great treat, there was no ""message"", no "" theme"", no ""pc message"" . This was a perfect picture. .",Cruella
418,wittkecmission,The de Vil Wears Dalmatians,8,1 June 2021,"""I'm just getting started, darling."" This Disney spinoff, or prequel, of a classic animated film is different from the previous ones over the past several years. How, you may ask? It actually puts some effort into it. It lives up to the hype and then some. The story is sometimes cheesy but always engaging and attention-grabbing, the editing is well done, albeit a little fast-paced, the costumes are dazzling, and let's not omit the characters. Emma Stone delights as the deliciously, viciously, bad, mad but rad Cruella de Vil. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser also delight as her henchmen Horace and Jasper. Emma Thompson is marvelous as the narcissistic sociopathic even-more-evil baroness, whose performance is a la Miranda Priestly. In fact, this film could be titled ""The de Vil Wears Dalmatians"". All the same, Cruella earns from me an 8/10.",Cruella
419,tgagovidigal,Soberb adaptation of the Disney classic,10,31 May 2021,The duo of Emma's is excellent. Both Emma Thompson and Emma Stone make this a fantastic movie. The story was amazing and all the cast brilliant. A special shut out to Mark Strong a underrated actor that deserves much more features in my opinion.,Cruella
420,robertheduardoperezmachado,Emma Stone is amazing,8,4 November 2021,"What a performance from Emma Stone, she carried the whole movie, she deserves an standing ovation. The storyline was good and made sense, however, there are a couple of things that are simply stupid. Overall, its a solid movie, with solid characters, fun to watch even if you know nothing about fashion designers and dresses.",Cruella
421,sugarnspices,Loved!!,10,4 September 2021,"I wasn't sure or even thought very much of this movie when it was announced. I especially wasn't going to pay 30 bucks to watch/rent it, so I kind of forgot about it. Well while my little one was out, I saw this on Disney plus and thought, why not? I'm so glad I did!!The acting - so good
The set(s) - loved
The storyline - revamped and interesting
The costumes, oh the costumes (esp when Cruella outshines The Baroness) *chefs kiss*Both Emma's knocked it out of the park!! I loved the little side kick dogs, too. CGI and all! I want a Wink!Can't wait for the sequel!",Cruella
422,ukuh,Better than expected,7,28 July 2021,"Disney showed it's deep pockets with this movie. A list actors, a list music, and stunning visuals and design. Both Emma's act formidable. The big negative is the plot, it feels flat and uncreative (guess there is no price for creativity). Jasper and Horace save it a little with their funny and witty scenes.",Cruella

This movie is amazing in that regard. From captivating, sweeping shots to elaborate dress ups, and the magnificent set designs, I loved it all.It's not a musical by any means, but there are excellent songs in this that perfectly match the story line and the viewer's mood.From Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps by Doris Day, to Come together by The Beatles, everything was edited in so perfectly.And yes, Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic in her performance.",Cruella
426,ifyogwude,Ignore the negative reviews,9,6 June 2021,It's immediately obvious to me that most of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to see the movie. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson were both beautiful in this. It's very entertaining and very well done. There was one twist that I simply didn't see coming but which made perfect sense in retrospect. Mark Strong is a wonderful actor and has a small but powerful role in this. Watch the movie for yourself and ignore the negative reviews. I understand some people want to remain in the past forever but luckily the only thing constant in life is change. Enjoy.,Cruella
427,tgbldkam,One of the better films of 2021,10,12 October 2021,"The Good:Emma Stone and Emma Thompson's performances. Seriously, both should be nominated for an Oscar.I would be very surprised if this film does not win an Oscar for costume design. The costumes itself told a story and highlighted each character.The storyline was solid and very well executed.The run time of the film worked perfectly to tell the story of Cruella. The movie moved along at a nice even pace.The Bad:I loved the music however I thought it over used.The Ugly:
The CGI. I think all the money went into the fashion and nothing was left for the CGI department.Overall, I highly recommend this movie.",Cruella

Even though the story is packed with comedy, this movie is still able to bring that impression to me, indeed the plot feels a bit dry and linear, but because of Emma's madness in playing Cruella I don't get bored at all to watch this movie.DRAMATIC CRY COMEDY.",Cruella

Both the legendary Emmas were perfect in their roles and overall it was an entertaining film. My primary issues with it were the length and the soundtrack. This movie felt loooooooong. Like longer than Endgame long. And while most of it is engaging, there are a few scenes where I found myself becoming anxious and a little bored. Definitely don't take any young, fidgety children to this Disney flick. I also felt that the soundtrack was distracting. All good songs, but used way too frequently and felt out of place at some moments. I'm glad I gave it a watch, but it's nothing I need to see a second time.",Cruella

442,divinechannel,The battle between Estella and Cruella,7,4 September 2021,"I really enjoyed this. Reading the lower ratings, I do completely understand. However, I also get that this is the back story. So Cruella is not yet in her true form. There is a constant battle between Estella and Cruella, that was a little annoying.The Cruella we are used to, is cruel. However, this movie depicts how she emerged. I just hate when someone is in their true ""power"" yet cowar. For example, the scene where Cruella shows up in a stunning gown (very similar to hunger games) but when she sits with the Baroness, that confidence is diminished. Then, after scenes of her literally breaking the scene and being this force who can't be contained or stopped, she's about to get killed in a fire and shows fear. I would have much rather her stay true to form.In the end however, Cruella fully emerges which makes me look forward to a part two to dive deeper into the history of the Cruella we have grown to love but hate years ago in 101 Dalmations. I am still confused on Pongo and Perdita being siblings and given to her ""friend"" and associate. Maybe part two will reveal more of that true Cruella we know and how she turns on her ""employee"" for her greed of fashion.",Cruella

444,markbarner,Nonsense and foolishly bad,3,22 July 2021,How unrealistic is this horrible movie. The storyline sucks so bad! A bunch of overacting and nonsense.It's even worse than any cartoon or animation would be.So her mom dies after a random event of dogs on a leash suddenly don't have a leach on them for no reason. They chase the girl and jumps over her when they finally have her and for no reason jumps over the kid and pushes her mom off a cliff but doesnt fall down. Then the kid blames it on herself that dogs killed her mom by accident. Why and how!? 10 Years Later the dogs are still alive and growls at her at a party...Later she trips over a table even though she earlier told a story of what a pro Theif she is. And as a cleaning lady falls asleep in a window presentation - which again makes no sense. It's like whoever wrote this took many many shortcuts just to tell a no good story.It doesn't have any Disney magic other than the costumes and interior.It's foolishly clumsy the way it tries to tell the story.Also I don't understand the sudden need to tell every villain's story and make them feel empathetic when we grew up on the fact that they where psychopaths. What is the message in this - that we should want to be alike them or sympathize with psychos?Don't waste your time on this movie if you easily find movie mistakes. I saw it with two kids and they laughed about how bad the storyline and that it made no sense how things happened.,Cruella
445,woeterman_94,Awesome movie!,8,29 May 2021,This movie is awesome! However they tried to put a little too much familiar characters in this movie. For example: Roger didn't need to be in it.I liked the first part of the movie more than the ending to be honest... But maybe that's because she is slowly turning into Cruella.,Cruella

No!Does that matter? Not in the slightest!Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are fantastic leads in Cruella. It's not the best movie ever made, but it's one of the better things to come out of Disney in recent years.

468,valmont1702,Stylish. Dark. Fun. Evil. Glorious. Striking. Moving. Rock and Roll. Exhilarating. Mad.,9,8 July 2021,"A delightful masterpiece from start to finish ! Like a dark tale that tells us the dramatic and tangled story of Estella's discovery of her true self... A complex, layered, and fascinating character in many ways...The production value, artistic direction and photography are top notch. The language through the visual details, costumes (+hairdos, of course) and colors/tones is highly mastered. The plot is pretty clever and unveils nicely, gradually, before our very eyes... The universe & various settings play an integrant and gripping part in the movie, as well as the animals (dogs) who always bring a different note/tonality.Emma Stone was clearly made for this role, she infuses so much energy and just brings her all into the role, whether it is as Estella or Cruella, she sews this role with a multitude of flavors and it pays off the deeper you advance into the story...
Emma Thompson inhabitates her role as 'The Baroness' with so much acidity, at every moment she is corrosive towards everyone around her and her daunting ego is like a sharp blade that automatically occupies the whole space...
Paul Walter Hauser's performance as Horace, is a pure delight to see, he's definitely been having a ball with everything he's had to do in this movie and it translates wonderfully every time he appears on the screen. It's ideally balanced by Joel Fry's interpretation of Jasper, who often brings more depth to the story & the relationship between the 'trio'...I really wanted to pay homage to both the score and the soundtrack, smoothly entwined with one another and with the movie+story as a whole ; the music (as often when it's well done) is an extremely important character, certain pieces and tracks are striking ! It grabs you (as are the performances of Emma Stone and Emma Thompson)...To finish with, I wanted to say that this movie is flamboyant !

Worse yet, the movie has music playing for literally the majority of the film. I get that some of the music added to the chaos and direction of the film, but quite frankly it could've done without about half of it (if not more).Other than that, I have mixed emotions about the film.I thought the beginning was too drawn out (felt like we were being introduced to the film for too long), which is probably why the movie as a whole felt too long. I wish there was more depth to the characters. It felt like the movie was a mess between trying to appeal to adults vs trying to appeal to kids. Cruella felt similar to a mentally psychotic character, yet the film had so many silly moments, which stirs mixed emotions amongst its viewers.I loved the style of the film - the fashion, the color, the video editing.

The flow was excellent. Had it been a different actor than Emma Stone, I dont know if it would have worked as well. Emma Thompson plays her evil part effortlessly. Was nice to see things from the animated movie tied in, that being said.. the role of Anita Darling felt very tacked on. She has nothing to do in the movie. The couple scenes felt very unnecessary like at the last minute they remembered shes important to Cruellas future story and squeezed her in.

Honestly she deserves some serious award recognition here!!Emma Thompson (Barroness) was conniving, evil and brilliant!! Her and Stone played off each other amazingly well!!The StoryLike most origin stories we get a back story. This was one worked. The young actress who played Estella was quite good. Seeing how everything came to was even more interesting. For a 137 min movie this thing zoomed on by.Soundtrack, Sets + CostumesLet me start by saying BEST soundtrack in a movie in a LONG time!!! Everyone from the WHO to the Stones rocked it!!! Those set pieces were freaking crazy good and lastly the incredible costumes the designers made for the characters.Overall a worthy addition to a line of live adaptation failures from Disney.

surely love the costumes but the film is overlong and drags badly. Worse, the whole thing is just setup for Cruellas 2-10.",Cruella

Another mediocre excuse for a villain origin storyIt definitely looks great and I love me a good soundtrack, but it is all UNNECESSARY. There was no need to devise an idea like Cruella De Vil using her old school friend and a fired lawyer to breed a bunch of Dalmatians for later use.Honestly, an entertaining movie was somewhere in there, but if only for a different company.

But nothing to bad as to get me out of the experience.Comparing this to the Joker as some people are doing is definetely a stretch LOL, but overall is a pretty enjoyable film if you don't have too high expactations.I would give it 7.4 if a could, just a little shy of an 8 but not quite there.",Cruella

487,art-miller,Worst Disney film of all time. Avoid,1,30 May 2021,"You first have to ask yourself....who is this aimed at? No adults will go. No boys will go. It is only suitable for 14 year old girls. If that...This is a car crash of a film. Inept on every level. The script writer, editor and actors must all be held responsible.The script is so bad. The two clowns in the film for instance are not given a single half amusing line. There are lines obviously intended to be funny that miss their mark by a mile. A sixth for drama student might have done better.The editing is bizarre with many instances of dead time...nothing happening at all whoever was responsible should go back to film school.Of course, the most annoying thing about this mess is the dreadful Emma Thompson who on the evidence of this characterture of a performance should retire closely followed by Emma Stone. The leading lady without a shred of talent . And don't mention Mark Strong. Did he have a mortgage to pay?Who decided on a running time of two and a quarter hours has no idea of the attention span of fourteen year old girls... should have cut it in half...and still been too long.Of course, with a film this bad the answer is to shoe horn in a pop song every five minutes to try to inject some pulse of life. Failed again as those 14 year old won't have a clue who the Rolling Stones and Beatles are. And Lennon must be turning in his grave alongside Brian Jones at their music appearing in this worst of all films.Do not go anywhere near this. Unless you are a 14 year old girl. Take plenty of sweets.",Cruella

The soundtrack is totally killer, the Emma's are superb, the supporting actors were very well chosen for their parts, and the movie flows so well it doesn't even feel like a 2 hr and 14 min movie. I detracted 1 star for the CGI dogs, but I get it. I paid for the premier access on Disney+ and it was totally worth it as my family has watched it 7 times between three of us.

Enjoyment - 4
Beginning - 4
Ending - 4
Characters - 5
Story - 4.5Negatives:
-The beginning was very dark for a Disney movie, I was quite shocked with one of the scenes. I don't think a young child should watch something like that. Although I enjoyed it, yeah quite disturbing for a child
-This doesn't bother me but I feel like it will bother a lot of people. I don't know how the Cruella in this and the one from the 101 Dalmatian movies are the same or connected in any way. I don't know if they are supposed to be or if Disney decided to change who Cruella is. But I can see a lot of Cruella fans being very disappointed with Cruella not being the Villain she makes out to be in previous movies
-The worst thing about the movie is the length time. Although I wasn't bored at any time, I did look at my phone at one point because I felt the movie had been going on for ages. 2 hours 14 minutes for me is a bit too long, I think 30 minutes could've easily have been cutPositives:
-The best thing about the movie was easily Emma Thompson. She played the Baroness perfectly. Her character was pure evil, very funny and most importantly entertaining. She got a lot of screen time and I am glad. She was outstanding. Probably one of the best Villains in Disney
-Emma Stone played Cruella and Estella very well, she clearly enjoyed playing the role
-The characters in this movie were really great, other than the two above, I have to mention Jasper, Horace, John the Valet, loved them
-Music/soundtrack were done very well throughout
-The costume design was amazing
-I don't watch trailers, so I didn't know what to expect and tbh I wasn't expecting much but I was very surprised to how good it actually wasOverall rating out of 10: 8.",Cruella
493,dustinclousher-16002,Not the kid's Cruella,7,6 September 2021,"My biggest dislike is the pace of the movie, I had trouble maintaining focus on it at times, it was also a movie geared more towards the female audience. However everyone can appreciate the creativity that went into the movie with the wardrobes, the tie ins to the classic story, the battle of the evils and the twist, though predictable it fit well.",Cruella
494,moonmaedyn,Very Familiar...,3,30 May 2021,"The costumes, I'll say right off the bat, were FABULOUS.However...the movie really seemed to take a lot of material from The Devil Wears Prada, including the Baroness's requests for lunch, her general attitude about Cruella/Estella, and her second henchman (Mark Strong--""John the Valet"") looking a LOT like Stanley Tucci, down to nearly his exact mannerisms.Could have done without the CGI versions of the dogs--those always freak me out, but these were really noticeable.Cruella's two partners in crime reminded me of the same relationship of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, so maybe that was ""lifted"" for this movie as well.Sorry. I really wanted to like it.",Cruella

498,Mikheil-H,Surprising amount to like in this cash-grab,7,5 June 2021,"Was not going to bother with this one, however a combination of having not been to the cinema for over a year and Craig Gillespie (director of the brilliant I, Tonya) being at the helm was enough for me to go and see Cruella (with a 25% discount).Despite knowing and despising Disney's desire to take every single piece of popular culture and mould it into a corporatized, disembodied husk of a film compared to the source material, I was curious to see how they were going to handle Cruella as (although having only seen 101 dalmatians once when I was 3), I distinctly remember her main goal being the murder of over one hundred puppies! Not exactly hero material. But of course, like Maleficent before her, the Disney execs got in a room, sat down, thought about it for a bit until someone in the back shouted, ""MAKE HER LIKE HARLEY QUINN!"".So what we end up getting is another case where if this was an original film, not worried about setting up a sequel or pandering to a bizarre Disney Cinematic Universe and was about two extravagant fashion designers trying to out play each other, it would be great fun! But instead the fun is continually cut-off by the unnecessary pandering to what came before.Side character #1; ""Hey, look at this car, it's called Devil""
Side character #2; ""no no no, it's pronounced De Vil!""
no waay, is it really guys?!Problem I now have is despite all of the above, there is a lot to like with Cruella. Gillespie's direction is consistently strong and occasionally impressive, but gets consistently outshone by the brilliant costume design, make up and cinematography. Emma Stone is also wonderfully maniacal as Cruella, the soundtrack that, while very on the nose, is a lot of fun and Paul Walter Hauser provides some comedic highlights despite a horrific London accent.But oh my word, five people have writing credits for this film and it shows and also, please, for the love of all thing's cinema, please note that NOT EVERY FILM NEEDS A POST-CREDITS SCENE!",Cruella

Cinematography - Excellent
Direction- Good
Art, Set and Production - ExcellentThe world Cruella Stands for a character who is 'Cruel'; a very much aspect of of Cruella's character and it was missing. She is Brilliant, Talented, Smart, Mean, Cold-hearted and wicked.Positive:
Good Script
Brilliant Acting by Emma and other cast
Fashion aspect and dresses are mesmerizing (especially the Bead dress)
Art production, Set design and production is very goodNegative:
-Direction and story are not that impressive that they could be.-Estella and Cruella are two entangled characters that should have a clear line of difference characteristics but it was missing.-Despite brilliant set design, production and planing, the producers miss some small details that differentiate current era with Cruella's era. Like cars parked in car chase sequence.-Lastly, Horace was present in Mansion and at the boat at almost same time (10-15 minutes difference), which is doesn't feel possible.Verdict: You should watch it once but don't have very high hopes.",Cruella

Emma Stone is a delight to watch, the relationship with her 2 henchmen is quite engaging. The costumes and scenery aren't bad. The story is mildly interesting and keeps moving. But sadly this is over bloated Disney milking a story. The idea itself is good, exploring the origins of Cruella but Disney doesn't know how to give meaning or put meat on the bones, its all about show, spectacle and over acting., Emma Thompson case in point, just an overacting and non redeemable bad character with nothing more than superficial attempts at any depth. The story itself is engaging but too long by at least half an hour and very contrived verging on repetitive. Sorry Disney, like my own school class reports: must try harder.",Cruella

I never liked fashion or stylism and whatnot these shit excuses for human activities inspire in people, while daring to consume money and attention over nothing. But in later years I've started to slightly appreciate the emotion that you as a viewer as well as the one that dresses in such clothes may feel while those clothes enhance his or her treats or add new ones to the wearer.But whatever, that's besides the subject, the movie was well constructed, it's american Disney after all. Normally it's a 7/10 movie but I give an extra point for costumes and the effort to create artistic design (from hand and pen), imposed and included in this film. As a drama it's ok, doesn't blow my candles but it's a decent drama, arranged into a good story, with quality acting.It slightly made me think of a female Joker (10/10 best movie ever), that's also why I gave it an 8/10, which in my book is a very high mark.

This film kinda reminded me of the film, ""The Devil Wears Prada"", however this is even better and Cruella's character reminded me of Harley Quinn. This is an amazing origin story for Cruella. This is a really good ""birth of a villian"" kinda film. The writing is really good and the story is original.Cruella is brilliantly written, acted and portrayed. Emma Stone is just phenomenal, it is imo, Emma Stone's best performance till date. She is a perfect fit for the role. Loved her portrayal of Cruella and also Emma Thompson is really good as well. The blending and chemistry between these two women is so obvious as is the fun they must have both had in performing their respective roles. This was dark, gritty, everything you wouldn't expect from Disney.The direction is noteworthy. Loved the cinematography in the film and the soundtrack is on point. The costume designs are the best thing in the film. They are beautiful, different and are the feast to the eyes. The setting and the atmosphere of the film is marvellous. Truly enjoyable and entertaining from the beginning till the very end. The young Estella is also brilliant. Dazzling visual feast. The cast is perfect. Everyone in the supporting roles are also good in their respective roles.Cruella is a surprisingly brilliant and visually captivating film that is sure to be a wild ride for all who wish to see how the renowned puppy killer got her name and fame.8.5/10.",Cruella
533,prospero-galvan,You must see it!,8,31 May 2021,"What an excellent movie!. Emma Thompson stole the show as she does in all her movies. Her character resemblances a lot to Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, but I guess that all eccentric designers are the same.Emma Stones acts very well too. When Cruella goes nuts, I do believe her, LOL.But the best of the movie is the soundtrack. Highly recommended.",Cruella
534,jessienovakromanova,Emma is amazing!,5,31 May 2021,"Honestly a really nice movie, I would like that Hollywood for once give us a utterly evil character without a sad, tragic story behind them that made them who they are, but pretty much I enjoyed the movie and Emma Stone is sublime playing Cruella.",Cruella
535,jessibi-91956,Cruella,8,2 June 2021,"My expectations for Cruella where not very high so I was honestly shocked at how great the movie was. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are both phenomenal and I loved every second of their performances. The script is funny and charming and the movie managed to make me love one of most hated Disney villains of all time, They tell the backstory of Cruella perfectly and the opening sequence sucked me in right away. The costume design and cinematography are spectacular and I loved the darker tone of the movie. The LGBT representation was great to see and I instantly fell in love with the character of Artie. The soundtrack was fantastic, every song fit the scene they where used in and the music was perfect. I think the movie was a bit to long and some scenes felt a bit out of place but other than that I loved this movie.",Cruella
536,Unprejudiced_Cinephile,De-Ville may care.,7,3 July 2021,"*** You may jump to the end for a Hot Take. *** (Edited)The Emmas Are amazing. Film is Atmospheric and stylish. Due the screenplay being super imposed by Hollywood Identity politics agenda, it misses a lot of opportunities. It is still entertaining. Over romanticizes the bloated over indulgent fashion industry. Take it like entertainment. If you can. You will be entertained. It is not like Ocean's 8 or the Female Ghostbusters. Watch it when you want some thematic atmospheric entertainment. It Can also play in the living-room on special family get together Holidays like Eid, Christmas, Thanksgiving etc.************Hot Take ******************Pros : Atmospheric and stylish. Fun and entertaining. With a De Ville may care attitude. Fast, some pacing issues but not bad. Fun with family romp.Cons : Relies upon the plot mechanisms of the 90's. Bloated glorification of the fashion industry. Obvious Hollywood ""Representation"" Agenda. Such as Characters introduced just for props without much development.",Cruella
537,tastingthestars,Enjoyable,8,15 July 2021,Emma Stone stole the show and I think it wouldn't have been as good if someone else played Cruella. I had a good time watching it and I was shocked that it was pretty enjoyable.,Cruella
538,aaronjconroy,"Tasteful origin story, not what you would expect",10,1 September 2021,"I must say, this movie exceeded my expectations, story was well written, fresh and original with a few unpredictable twists. Had just the right amounts of humour and drama, all while balancing a sinister undertone, with a lot of heart and keeping true to the original character. Emma Stone was born for this role, I can't imagine any other actress playing a young Cruella. I really don't expect what I got, was quite refreshing and a respectable origin story. Emma Thompsons performance was excellent as well.",Cruella

540,ekimmichael,The surprisingly best of 2021,8,4 July 2021,"I was seriously shocked by Cruella( and also I can't stop saying the name so addictive) it was so interesting and fun that more than 2 hours of movie fly without even a glimpse of predictability.The cast was just a wonder from main character to secondary was just original as hell let's not even talk about the 50 shades of Wink. The 2 Emmas were just a wonder to watch, Emma Stone has never been better(might be looking the nominating for the Oscars next year)Soundtrack is just wonderful I have to get Cruella soundtrackScreenplay and storyline was just wonderful genius, unpredictable, surprising, refreshing and everything. That's what Disney should bébés doing with it's classical characters ""reboot"" and not the same story in movie version like they did with Lion king and other. Cruella might be looking at an Oscar for best adapted screenplay (at least a nomination if something better come along) mark my word*Production design and set decoration fit perfectlyNow Costume design, makeup and hairstyle is just so ironically innovative giving the timeline, it was really original and once again surprising and funny. It's also looking at an Oscar for best Costume designIt's not typically the kind of story you would dig into but God it was good. Cruella will surely crush the Oscars next year.",Cruella

543,Xamalion,Both Emmas are stunning,10,28 May 2021,"It is one of the best villain origin stories to date. I had so much fun watching that I didn't even see the twist coming, and when it hit, it hit in all the right places and took the whole story on another level.Both Emmas are a joy to watch. They play against each other with so much life, it is simply fun and you cannot get enough. The dialogues are witty, fun but never cheesy. Even the Baronesse has her moments when you can glimpse through the curtain and almost see why she is how she is. You almost like her when she is nice to Estelle, but then you realize that she is not nice, she acts for once normal against her usual utter cruelty.The score and the soundtrack are amazing. I had several goosebump moments because the music fits the scenes so perfectly.The runtime is absolutely no problem, time flies when you have fun and beside a bit of a bumpy start there was never a moment I felt bored.I only have one wish, and that is a sequel to this movie, because it sets the stage so well for more. Also I had wished to see Glen Close in a mini cameo at the end. Maybe when young Cruella looked in a mirror you could see a glimpse of the future. I would have loved that and it would be nod to the iconic Ms. Close.Watch this, it is all the boring Harley Quinn movie wanted to be.",Cruella
544,sarahrayburn,An unexpected delight,8,9 November 2021,"I didn't have high or low expectations walking into this movie. I had hoped for an entertainer experience, and that is what I got. I personally feel like they romanticized the character of Cruella more than I had hoped, however, Stone's performance was wonderful. She captured the essence of the character beautifully.The visuals were stunning except for the dogs. For such a high budgeted film, the dogs looked fake and were obviously CGI, in an almost distracting way.That being said, it was a great watch with lovable size characters and an immersive story.",Cruella

548,chloeurc,"Cruella is Joker, Harley Quinn, Maleficent",8,29 May 2021,"Cruella Review: (minor spoilers)
Pros-Emma Stone- Emma Stone does a great job as Cruella, she embodies both aspects of her as Estella (her real name apparently) and as the iconic Cruella! At first I thought her doing an English accent would be weird but it ended up working!Hair, makeup, outfits and aesthetic- This film takes place in the 1970s in London. All of the music in the film (and there's A LOT) is all British 70s punk, very cool! The outfits as well as the hair and makeup would of definitely went to the Oscars had it come out earlier!Some nods to the original- Although not much, there's some tributes and moments from the original that are remembered in this film. I won't give it away but make sure you stay for the credits 😉Cons-They changed things- Theres some things about Cruella that they decided to do without. Such as her obsession to skin Dalmatians and use them to make coats. That's something she's basically a villain for in the original but this time around, she's a villain in different ways. Guess for marketing reasons they decided that wouldn't sell for Cruella to be a dog killer when it came to 8 year old girls wearing Disney Cruella shirts.A long movie- For some reason they decided to make this film over 2 hours long. It seems that every deleted scene is in the movie. They could have easily cut at least 15-20 minutes in some areas.Is she good or bad?- Not sure why this movie is rated PG13 when they took basically a lot of the evilness away from Cruella. Could have made it PG for the kids to come as well. Although in my opinion, they did what they did to Maleficent, made her an anti-hero instead of a full villain. But then again it's a new fun way to look at her.",Cruella
549,ammaples17,What a great movie,10,7 November 2021,"Really enjoyed this movie. Just when you think it's over it's not, the story was so twisting, seemed tragic at first, but leaves you cheering her on. I can respect this character more now. As a kid you hated the women for wanting the dogs, but this new adaptation offers something different and so twisting. Really enjoyed this movie.",Cruella
550,josephmayes,"It was good, Just good",6,21 June 2021,"Compared to past titles, Cruella is easily one of of the better movies in Disney's most controversial catalogue of live-action movies. But even then it isn't a masterpiece of any stretch of the imagination. Cruella is fine. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson equally provide excellent performances, the set design and style is stellar, going all-out with the 60's to 70's aesthetics. But my problems lie with the story Cruella tries to tell. And those problems lie ironically with the rating of PG-13. It's been a long time since Disney handled a PG-13 movie... and it kinda shows. It feels like Cruella was constrained from being a more mature story by being more marketable to younger audiences. And one thing I wish the movie would improve on is Cruella's supposed descent into madness more defined and done with a greater pace.But other than that Cruella is a fine interpretation of the infamous dognapper. Emphasis on ""fine.""",Cruella

That Devil wears Prada vibe as she is working for the Baroness, then it kinda fall apart when she realized the Baroness kill her mother. It gets less fabulous, a little bit mix and messier in the story. More cartoony for sure.Just why does it has to be about Cruella, why not a story about a thief girl that has talent in fashion and trying to steer her way to the top using deceit and punk rock fashion.Least it is better and more watchable (due to the FABULOUS COSTUMES and both Emmas) than Maleficent.",Cruella

I swear if the costume designer doesn't win something from this movie Imma lose it)... The soundtrack was brilliant, nice use of 60s 70s classsics (a bit overused at times, but not glaringly obvious).So far, I can confidently say that, this is the best liveaction remake/prequel from the house of mouse since The Jungle Book.",Cruella

Especially if you're a fan if the original 101 Dalmatian movies. Emma Stone absolutely smashed her part in this film and they couldn't have picked a better actor for Cruella.There is just 1 thing. When the baroness says ""She turned my dogs into a coat"" but turns out Cruella just pretended this and in fact she likes the dogs. I think it would have been better if she had tried to turn the dogs into a coat but they end up escaping back to the barrista. Then this would have led better up to 101 Dalmatians where she wants to make the Dalmatian coat that she had failed to make before.Cruella's character hates Dalmatians so it makes no sense for her to like them in this movie.",Cruella

From the stellar acting that draws you into the characters, to the loudly mixed collection of incredible songs from the 70s Cruella masterfully draws you in to a world full of elaborate heists, extravagant balls and behind the scenes of high fashion.This movie is a must see for anyone who has ever enjoyed fashion, to anyone who enjoys the satisfaction of an underdog becoming the new ruler, to fans of The Devil Wears Prada, and the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

Emma Stone shows once again why she is so highly praised in the film community alongside a great performance from Emma Thompson who inserts her greatness in acting throughout the films entirety. Director Craig Gillespie has earned all his stripes in the film industry with films like I, Tonya and now Cruella, as his direction never fails to have intricately designed sets, costume designs and music choice. Gillespie truly knows what has to be done to truly fully immerse an audience in a story and environment and shows it off to perfection with this film.

599,Rich-91749,Surprisingly good.,8,26 September 2021,It's basically a heist movie with a great soundtrack. Emma stone does a great job of drawing parallels with the iconic character whilst also taking it in a slightly new direction. Emma Thompson makes for an excellent villain. Not much to complain about apart from some really dodgy CGI at the end in the parachute scene.,Cruella
600,marksarko1,"Brilliant, Crazy and Magical",8,29 May 2021,"With all confidence, I say that it's one of the most interesting and best films of this year so far.Of course, I wasn't surprised by Emma Stone's performance because she is one of the first-grade actresses who always show us a new level of creativity.The directing is genius, very bright, and adrenaline-stimulating. The events are linked in a way that tends to be more exciting and active than the boring dramatic inertia.The decorations and costumes are wonderful and very glamorous, which is the main point of the movie beside the soundtrack which is very enjoyable and was like a therapy to the scenes.Unfortunately, the sound editing was not good enough, even the video editing could be better. Many of the scenes were a bit shaky and lacked smoothness and speed.Great work.",Cruella

602,mariannequintinio,Stunning! Beguiling! Entrancing! Wicked!,10,31 August 2021,"This is one of the best live-action films I've seen since the live-action Maleficent movies and the live-action Beauty and the Beast from Disney! Stunning! Glorious! Provocative! Thrilling! Exciting!At the back of my head, I had theories coming up every 10-15 minutes for possible outcomes. And even deeper in my mind, I know the reason I'm squealing in every bombastic scene is not only because of these dazzling divas, but also because of the soundtrack and the narrative!This may not be as dark as Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, but it certainly brought me back to those days when I'm binge-watching Warner Bros.' Harry Potter spin-offs/prequels!Ladies and gentlemen, this is more than a prequel of the 101 Dalmatians series! It's the origin story of Cruella, why she thinks the way she is, and why she becomes the antagonists in the Dalmatians series.After watching Cruella, I watched the first 30 minutes of Disney's live-action movie: 101 Dalmatians (1996). I still remember bits and pieces of 101 Dalmatians (1996) scenes that were placed as Easter eggs in Cruella (and I'm so glad I remembered those from the original series).No one can come close to Glenn Close's Cruella. However, if I may say just one thing: Emma Stone represents the dark half of Cruella, Glenn Close represents the light!Yes, I know. You think I mistyped; but no. That's what I really thing: Emma Stone's Cruella is darker, wicked, evil; Glenn Close's Cruella is painted as the typical Disney villain that viewers will find it hard to sympathize for.I guess this is the future of Disney feminine heroines/villainess that Disney is aiming for. Well, whatever formulae they're using, it's working and making them more money!",Cruella
603,elwynchofmann,"It's not changing cinema, but its full of style and a fun time",6,28 May 2021,"Cruella is full of style and a pretty good time. Emma Stone does great in the titular role, and her presence really ups the enjoyment. Starting off with the good: the production design, costuming, hair, and makeup are so great in this film. Emma Stone gets to rock a ton of different hairstyles, and the period-piece aspect gives opportunities for the costuming team to really show off. The architecture is beautiful, and it does a great job of transporting you to this period in London. I definitely anticipate this film to get some love at the Oscars in those categories. The film is also very colorful and vibrant at times, which was fun. The first act was a bit slow but after about 45 minutes it starts to pick up nicely.Where the film faltered for me was definitely the script. It's not a bad script by any means, but it definitely could have been polished up. Some of the villain's motives are completely nonexistent, and the screenplay makes no attempt to try to explain them to the audience. It was a bit jarring because I thought it would get cleared up in the third act, but they just gloss right over it. The film also doesn't pack any big emotional punch, which isn't a bad thing or even necessary - it just holds it back from being anything great. The film has a good use of licensed music that adds a lot of style to the film, in a similar vein to Joker. However, this did lead me to be a bit underwhelmed by Nicolas Britell's original compositions, which left little to be remembered.Cruella honestly surprised me, and I have to say I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's not changing cinema, but it's fun, stylish, and great time back at the theater. Definitely one of Disney's better live-actions, and I definitely recommend seeing in a theater if you can!",Cruella
604,kirstinelassen,Quite extravagant!,8,26 July 2021,"I have watched this movie several times now. Normally this is not something I would ever say about a Disney live action movie, as I have found most of their other attempts at live action quite laughable. The live action Lion King made me want to take a good long walk and reflect on the state of humanity, and the other Disney live action movies are no exception, well, except for this one. Although nothing incredible is being put to film here, I found it very fun and enjoyable.The worst thing a movie can be to me is boring, and Cruella is certainly not boring; It's fun, camp and very over the top, which is nothing surprising considering who the movies lead is.Not only was Emma Stone lovely and wicked, I found the side characters fun as well, and great aditions to the film.The story is nothing truly amazing, but I didn't expect it to be a masterpiece. The fashion in this movie is great as well, although not entirely accurate, so if you're expecting some great insight into the real fashion world of the 1970s, this is not the film for you.Very enjoyable overall, and I will be looking forward to seeing it again.",Cruella
605,benjamingrubb,A perfect prequel,9,29 May 2021,"This movie was a lot darker than most Disney movies. But that's what made it so good! Emma Stone's acting for Cruella was top-notch!

606,ja-lens,Interesting.,8,3 July 2021,"This one actually turned out being surprisingly enjoyable for me personally. I thought it was a pretty solidly told origin story. The music was one of the best parts and the whole 70s punk rock theme worked for the film too. Also, great performances in the film as well. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson deliver. I'd say give it a shot if interested.",Cruella

With that said, however, I must be fair and say I enjoyed all two hours and 15 minutes of this movie. I love the fact they went back to Cruella's birth and her time as a young child so the viewer could see what shaped her. It does concern me that at the end the character was moved toward actually having a heart, only because the original character was quite numb to humanity. Emma Stone and possibly even Emma Thompson deserve awards for their performances.",Cruella

The script felt like it dragged at times but was bearable. Emma Stone does have the same facial expressions in most of her movies but you either love or hate that and I personally am a fan of her. John McCrea was the highlight of this movie to me, I enjoyed watching him act and thought maybe he was some famous musician before looking him up after watching the movie, he had this amazing David Bowie vibe to him. Joel Fry also gave a very heartfelt and sincere performance along with Mark Strong. I liked the dogs in the movie, not sure why someone mentioned animal cruelty below... did they actually watch the movie? I'd recommend it, just wish it wasn't as long.",Cruella

This is a fantastic movie.I never knew I needed to see a young Cruella drunkenly tripping over herself to Nancy Sinatra's Boots Were Made for Walking, but here we are!It actually has some darker risks taken with this movie, and to have Cruella be such a dark anti-hero was honestly a bit refreshing.Multiple times, I had to remind myself Disney did this.And Emma Stone? Oh she falls into the character! Her charming-but-dreading moxie fits the movie perfectly, and she gives Cruella the perfect type of personality. It's honestly Oscar-worthy.Honestly a great watch, and better than 99% of what Disney is offering at the moment, whether that be Star Wars, Marvel, or their other original properties.",Cruella
622,EdMatt13,Who knew fashion design could be so lethal?,6,5 June 2021,"As the Disney live action remake train continues I find myself getting more and more tired of the same cgi hybrids that seem to be churned out like rabbit babies- fortunately, Cruella does defy some of the tropes that have defined this genre, and does it with such a good soundtrack that I would almost say it was semi-original.The performances given range from very good to average, however Emma Thompson steals the show in every scene she is in giving a cold performance that seems to fill the screen with prude and snobbish style.The dresses in this movie are stunning, and that's coming from somebody who despises wearing anything with any semblance of fashion, and the rival fashion show scenes with the vibrant colours and gorgeous makeup are the highlights to the film.The soundtrack provides a great backdrop to the 70s punk scene London aesthetic (Whoever decided to set it in amongst this era deserves a round of applause!) and helps move the story along.Unfortunately however, I cannot entirely rave about this movie- it felt quite overstuffed at times and definitely had some unnecessary additions to the backstory of Cruella De Vil, meaning it has difficulties being linked to the original as many plot points that I saw as being a foreshadowing of 101 Dalmatians were dropped or resolved too neatly to mean that this film has any sense of continuity. The timeline just falls short of the new x men movies in it's confusing nature.The movie does not feel as though it is willing to commit to it's darker take on the story, and will often go to lengths to ensure that the film is never too scary for the family aimed audience, meaning a lot of the scenes can feel gimmicky and trope fuelled and there is never any true suspense or genuine fear. It also means it is difficult to build a picture of the titular character as she flits from personalities so quick that she is almost a bit comedic.I would recommend it if you are interested in the punk scene or chaotic fashion shows; however this doesn't have enough redeeming qualities to be called a must watch or even a should watch. I can't say if it's Joker for kids as many critics seemed convinced it was; but I look forward to eventually watching that film much more than I do to rewatching this one. Thanks for reading :)",Cruella

A Disney masterpiece!!! While I was watching I could clearly see references from Funny Face, Devil Wears Prada, Marvelous Mrs Maisel, The Joker and other movies and tv shows. I went to the movie theater to watch it, but later on, I thought that I would have rather watched at the comfort of my own home. I got used to staying at home and having my ""needs"", being able to pause the movie (a major one), going back a scene or taking a note on a quote the character just said. Both Emma's did an amazing movie and I'm speechless! They are winning an Oscar! 10 stars.",Cruella
626,MelliDan,"This film has some very strong qualities, however it asks us to suspend disbelief too many times.",6,12 June 2021,"I have such mixed feelings about this film. The good pointe are, the performances are strong. Both Emma Stone and Emma Thompson really shine in their roles and I found myself engaged the whole time because of their presence. Also, the sets and costumes are top-notch, as are the music choices - very strong '70s vibes, and that intrigued me. I liked that Cruella/Estella had such an interest in fashion design, and how strong-willed she was, especially ones the ""revenge"" plot got going.But yeah, on a deeper level, that's a big part of the problem- the revenge plot. When Cruella first confronts her idol-turned-nemesis-turned birth mother (yup, really), it's this big buildup...:and suddenly...she burns her dress without catching fire and has this big showdown...Wait, does she have magic powers or something? Really? That whole scene took me out of the film for a bit. It didn't match up with the context of how the story was going.Then, the tension between Cruella and her adversary just sort of goes back end forth...Emma Stone does have a very good monologue at one point, where she accepts her dark identity...But otherwise, there were just too many situations in the latter half of the film that felt cartoonish and ultimately undermined what could have been a great story if it remained serious throughout.Even the ending! The final showdown was lackluster. I expected more, and then once again, the film asks us to believe Cruella is suddenly a master skydiver or something. Uh, what??!So I give this film a 6 because of the performances from Stone and Thompson, the costumes, music and cinematography. Everything was good expect for some really silly story decisions that I just can't overlook. The writers are asking too much from the audience. The serious tone of the film is overshadowed by those lazy decisions.Maybe some of you will enjoy it more than I did. There are things to be liked...just not everything.",Cruella

636,nmthomas-20486,A taste of narcissistic appreciation.,7,17 October 2021,"The costumes and set pieces - truly stunning. This film draws paralells to The Great Gatsby in terms of its direction, using extravagance and grandiosity in costume and set design, to convey character personalities.Emma Stone is perfect for the role, she brings dark and twisted humour as well as tenacity, fearlessness, ruthlessness and a sense of delightful wickedness. However she is also hateful to her once-friends. She is a cruel bully.I feel slightly saddened by the fact she was rescued by Horace and Jasper but ultimately turns her henchmen into goons. They sort of just become goons. They are initially set up in a more complex manner to which actually is conceived.Does she ultimately deserve to be revered and supported so blindly? Especially Anita- what a waste for the actresses talents, with a bland character, with no point to the movie. Why does she admire her old school friend's transformation,and follow her every request? I feel this character could have been more fleshed out, or questioned Cruella's behaviour. Perhaps the screenplay ultimately let's down the interaction between multiple characters par the two main leads.The first half of this movie reminds me of the Devil Wears Prada. But there is after all only one Miranda. I also felt the Harley affect here. I can see a stereotype forming in wider media -psychopathic women and their behaviour being dressed up as feminist- however, thank god they didn't sexualise Cruella in this too much.I do, ultimately prefer Estalla to Cruella - and root more for her character as she's relatable and vulnerable. But afterall this is a movie about a wannabe puppy murderer.Other supporting characters are underused such as Artie. I don't understand why he is even in the movie as he doesn't bring that much to the table.",Cruella

I have to say, the twist was enough to where my worries were unfounded. I loved the different fairy tale elements as well as the rock and roll vibe. Even if you're not into fashion, the pacing was good enough to make anyone interested. Pleasant surprise.",Cruella
652,rockstardom17,Contrived; boring; predictable!! The end!!,1,19 September 2021,"It's cheesy and so predictable, especially if you know anything about ""The Devil Wears Prada.""The characters are poorly developed and their personalities are soooo cliche.What a dumb story-I don't know who the people are that give this a 10 of 10, but they should do actual jail time. It was just awful.",Cruella
653,brillig-2,Entertaining if you don't suffer from motion sickness,8,6 June 2021,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. However, one aspect of it really bothered me: the moving camera angles. One of my pet peeves in movies is when the camera angle moves in a circle so that the main subject stays in the center of the frame and the background moves around, so you get to see varying angles of the subject. That's not exactly what happens in this movie, but it's similar. The movements are more complex than that. In some places, the feeling is that you are exploring, for example, the interior of a building by riding a roller coaster through the interior, the camera sometimes pointing to the side as the coaster rolls past something. If the director was trying to trigger motion sickness in the audience, I have no doubt he was partly successful in that regard. But why? There is no reason for this. It's very disruptive.The CGI dogs were mostly pretty good, but you could tell they were CGI.I will probably see this movie again. Perhaps I'll take a Dramamine first.",Cruella
654,AWall88,Pleasantly surprised,8,13 September 2021,"First off, know that my favorite Disney movie villain AND book to movie villain has always been, and will always be Cruella de Vil, but this is not a movie about my favorite villain. Having known that from the first trailer I had seen, I did not want to watch this movie. I did watch it. Because I'm married and have kids.I sat down with a bad attitude, ready to nitpick the crap out of this in my head. It started out rough, but then made itself clear that it wasn't a true attempt to stay true to the source material, but rather to simply borrow its themes, elements, and character names. As soon as they managed to push that into my thick skull, I realized the movie's value, and had a lot of fun with it.The Emma's and Tucci, of course, were unforgettably great, but the best part had to be Glenn Close's cameo (the movie is, naturally and literally, partially her movie, too.)It ended up being quite a natural fit into the Disney drama family. Even if it's a different Cruella that we all know and hate.",Cruella
655,snadarsh33,Perfect casting for an incredible movie!!! Loved it!!!,8,4 July 2021,Emma stone was amazing in the movie. She played Cruella perfectly.

They have made cruella too likeable and I'm not sure how a sequel would work. They would have to shift her character from protagonist with some bad qualities to a full on antagonist if they are going to follow the original story of 101 Dalmatians. I can't think of a way they could change her so massively, oh well, I look forward to seeing the next one despite my concerns.",Cruella
659,rondadams,Unexpected surprise!,10,2 July 2021,"I really didn't expect to like this, but it was the most fun I've had in a long time watching a movie! The last time I felt this way was with Greatest Showman.The story was original, fun, and full of surprises that kept me entertained the whole way thru, plus there were some unexpected twists.Overall, I think this is one of Disney's best live action backstories, and it was chock full of little nods to the original animation that made it lots of fun.",Cruella
660,Engerek01,Amazing!,9,4 June 2021,"As someone whose fashion sense is to wear the first clean thing he can find, I didn't have many expectations for this movie. I figured this would be another origin story of a villain with some drama, fashion, and some plot twists. Even tho I wasn't wrong at any of these, I was utterly wrong for underestimating the magnitude of the effect that could make on me.First thing first. Emma Stone sets the tone of this movie. What she does, how she smiles (or not) leads the direction of the events. She is like the captain of a ship with a highly trained crew, featuring Emma Thompson and the dogs.The story is brilliantly constructed and was clearly contemplated upon for some time. The way it was told was like fibers of a lovely dress, everything measured with perfect balance. I never knew what would happen and couldn't successfully guess a single outcome. That was quite satisfying.Speaking of dresses, I am as expect in fashion as a camel would be in quantum physics but that doesn't mean I still adored it. I found myself in awe on more than one occasion. My un-educated guess would be some people might love the show for just that.In the end, I laughed, I cried, I adored, got excited, and most importantly had a great time.",Cruella

Great story and costumes with an amazing sound track to go with it. I kept thinking this is The Devil Wears Prada with a twist! It's a fashion film with some heist elements. Who would have thought that'd be such a great combination. Already one of my all time favorite movies. And of course can't go without saying, Emma Stone absolutely killed the role.",Cruella
663,annlyelsfirst,A Top Three Live-Action Disney Movie,8,4 June 2021,"I've watched every live-action Disney film and Cruella is undoubtedly one of the best. It tells the origin story of Cruella de Vil, an orphan-turned-fashion-designer-turned-revenge-stricken-queen-of-mean and it was glorious! The soundtrack wasn't as good as I had heard from other reviews but the story was delightfully Disney with enough delightful twists and turns to keep me invested. When it concluded all I could think was, ""I need a sequel.""",Cruella

I know, it's so rare it' so hard to image someone to have those. Later we will learn that she wanted to be a therapist and help people, but because of her controlling uncle, who was after her money, she had to toughen up.",Cruella
665,herrimancoder,Stunned by this fantastic movie!,10,1 June 2021,"Wow!! Mind blown. Fantastic story. Smart, sharp dialogue. Excellent acting. The only thing that almost cost them a star was when for about 20 minutes I thought I was watching The Devil Wears Prada. But then again it might have been a brilliant and intentional nod and play on words.This may be the best movie of 2021. If it doesn't win Best Picture and if Emma Stone doesn't win Best actor, the Oscars are a sham.",Cruella
666,boomroasted,"Must Dash. Much to avenge, revenge and destroy",9,23 June 2021,"Cruella is a 2021 live-action prequel around the infamous villain of 101 Dalmatians, Cruella de Vil. Screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, directed by Craig Gillespie.If you see me walking around town with a cane and repeatedly using the word ""darling,"" DO NOT be alarmed. That's just what Cruella did to me. I'll be honest, I have not been very optimistic around Disney creating remakes and origin stories these days, but this one put me in my place. It was pretty damn close to perfect, and let me tell you why:The best aspect of the film was the performances, hands down. Two amazing Emmas at one low price! What FLAWLESS casting. Both Stone and Thompson were perfectly menacing with a ""gratitude is for losers"" attitude. But two powerhouse divas would've been a little too much on their own, which is why Jasper and Horace's characters made the ideal concoction. Jasper gave us justified pessimism, and Horace gave us much-needed humor. I enjoyed all of the characters and their actors immensely.The fashion design theme oozed into the STUNNING costume design. Every single costume was constructed perfectly to show Cruella's (or the Baroness's) state of mind, and I loved watching Cruella's costumes grow more sinister as the movie progressed. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that Cruella is yet another film where a tiny eye mask somehow completely disguises a person, but I guess we're supposed to let that slide.Other aspects I loved: The soundtrack. Almost every song was an upbeat oldie that elevated the movie's ominous tone. The makeup. Rarely do you see makeup that is so noteworthy and intimidating. The direction. The newspaper theme heightened the black and white color scheme. The cinematography. There were many shots with a domineering Stone or Thompson, and the cinematography around these shots (and many others) were brilliant.If I had to name a complaint, it would be that the screenplay is a little all over the place... and long. It was a very original story and an entertaining origin to Cruella, but they stuffed SO much in two hours and twenty minutes. If someone asked me to recount the plot vaguely, there's no way I could do it. And I've seen the movie twice. BUT, I love the fact that the plot progressed quickly (I was never bored) and that there were many twists I didn't expect.Cruella is one of my favorite live-action Disney movies to date. I love the story they gave Cruella and that it made me love her despite her depravity. The movie was artistic and playful enough to be Disney, but still not quite safe for children. It is definitely worth the $30 Disney + premier access fee... and I hope The Academy deems it worthy of multiple Oscars.@boomroastedmoviecritic on Instagram.",Cruella

Yes, there are similarities to The Devil Wears Prada, but I'd challenge that the Meryl Streep character in that was probably inspired by Cruella rather than the other way around! And for the people who say it's predictable; you do know it's an origins story, right!?The acting from both Stone and Thompson was up there with the best. The story was enjoyable and kept me hooked all the way through. Loved the soundtrack and the costume designers definitely deserve awards! All in all it was a couple of hours, very well spent.

It turns out however that the story is much more complex and dark then that. The writing and dialogue was quite well done and the performances of Emma Thompson and Emma stone were top notch. Beautiful costume design and great sound track. The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is its not my ideal genre of movie. Still very well done though.,Cruella

681,tobermory2-1,"This is NOT a ""Disney"" film",5,17 June 2021,"This movie is, like many Disney films, full of good and bad-- good cast, bad direction, memorable visuals, forgettable dialogue. But one thing that separates it from many other Disney films is how unrelentingly dark it is. If parents think this is going to be a good ""babysitting flick"" for their little ones, they are terribly-- horribly-- mistaken. This is VERY much an adult flick with nasty moments of murder and attempted murder as well as complicated, conflicted characters that may engross an older more agile mind but will most likely confuse younger ones.Emma Stone is wonderful to watch and will reward your time well, and Emma Thompson is head and shoulders above her as Evil personified. However, the director tries very hard to make us like both of them and their one-ups-manship of nastiness. No, they simply end up being nastier and nastier. Moreover, the director gives us wonderful moment of possible mayhem and then delivers very little-- all those cakes at all those posh functions and hardly one is destroyed. Even the people at various fiascos scream and scramble with almost no energy.Watch it if you will, but do not share it with your young ones.",Cruella
682,mjharrison247,An Estella performance,8,20 June 2021,"Like other reviewers I was intrigued by this film but with low expectations. Traditionally I would not consider myself a Disney fan but what Disney have done well recently is their live action movies. Jungle book and Maleficent.Like Maleficent our main character is a misunderstood villian with a backstory of how she came to being. We are introduced to all the characters and see our well known tale developing nicely. There is one puzzling question at the end of the movie that would certainly give you material for a sequel or another live action 101 Dalmatians.There is not a single weak performance among the cast and the film has a killer soundtrack to boost. It may appear a little long and it it does dip once, but generally it just gives you longer to enjoy this entertaining and funny film.",Cruella

I wanted this to be good so bad, I was waiting for this movie for a whole week because I loved the soundtracks and the customs. But alas, the plot is like fondant cakes, it looks pretty but actually tastes awful and crappy. It just...doesn't cut it. First off, its completely unoriginal, and we have seen it a thousand times before, second off it doesn't follow any logic in a lot of moments, the robbery schemes just broke the laws of physics and reduced the fun, at least for me. But the most annoying part was that I expected Cruella to be actually cruel. I wanted her to skin the puppies, to get an actual revenge from the baroness, not a namby-pamby ""I was just joking"" and ""She got arrested because everyone saw her pushing Estella down a cliff now she is in prison, the end, and no one questioned the sudden return of Cruella back from the dead and the nonexistent body of Estella"". Let mad, evil characters to be mad and evil Disney, Stop sugarcoating stuff! This is exactly what happens when you make a Rated-R movie a PG-13. Also, why on earth did she gift one puppy to Anita and one to Roger, someone she didn't even know? Prudita and Pongo are brothers and sisters?? This doesn't explain her fixation with killing them later AT ALL! This Cruella is not the Cruella we know (or the one that is going to turn into her) AT ALL!

695,anthonymigliori,A different kind of live-action Disney flick,8,26 August 2021,"For a Disney film like ""Cruella,"" this life-action origin story about one of the most notorious villains in Disney history is actually pretty good, even with it's minor flaws.When you put two Emmas in a film, magic clearly happens. Emma Stone gives off badass vibes with her performance as the young Estella Miller/Cruella de Vil and Emma Thompson gives off antagonizing vibes as Baroness Von Hellman. While I wouldn't say the performances are worthy of Oscar praise, I would say they are worthy of huge amounts of respect from people who view this film.Then comes the screenplay and direction. The screenplay, written by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, along with a few others, is not perfect. In fact, at times when the film feels so thinly-written, it's times like those while viewing the film that you hope the performances are enough to hold up the clumsiness that clearly shows in the writing. As for Craig Gillespie, the director, I think it's possible that Disney gave Gillespie the creative freedom card so that the ""I, Tonya"" director could let his own directorial style run loose, which is at times a rarity in big-budget studio films, the type of films that are mostly products of the studio execs' vision. So, for that, I'll give Disney my blessing.Let's not forget this film's eclectic soundtrack. The soundtrack is full of catchy songs that can easily have you bobbing your head to the beat of the songs. The song selections alone are perfect and often fit the badass vibe of the movie.Otherwise, while this film might have its downs, it still as plenty of ups and is worth the go, especially if you love a good Disney flick.",Cruella
696,charlottestreet-28346,Loved it!!! Except for this...,9,5 July 2021,"A fashion feast for the eyes - played perfectly by Cruella and her nemesis. The family loved the film. Our only struggle is with Disney's insistence on a parent dying during the main character's childhood (typically the mother) to drive a story. Think Cinderella, Frozen, Bambi, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Mary Poppins...the list goes on and on. Our small family group was tragically affected by this a few years back. Our youngest members lost their mother while they were small - still traumatized by the sadness of it all. We now have to 'warn them"" of the tiresome and gratuitous use of a tragedy to lazily motivate the character to greatness.

(Note to Disney: This is a HORRIBLE entry into DC/Marvel Universe type properties)And I'll give you fair warning: This end of this movie does NOT CONNECT with the other Dalmation movies, which means this is really just a set-up for a prequel sequel.Perhaps the best of the worst thing about this is taking turns guessing what other movies this seems derivative of.Acting was good

Emma Stone did a fantastic job as Cruella/Estelle, and you could see the two personalities from her.

Disney is scraping its back catalogue looking for things to regurgitate. The list could go on and on, but one thing is obvious: people are rating it so low because they just want the ratings to drop. It's all trolling.Why? Well for both the 10 and 1 reviews it goes down to the same thing: The Nostalgia Factor.People who enjoyed Cruella enjoyed seeing at a different, edgier side to a candy-sweet classic from the 60s that many remember in their lifetime. They enjoyed the fact that they retold the story from another perspective and that doesn't pander to the good-guy hero. It's no surprise. I keep saying what the dean of my university once advised me when I started working in journalism: ""Nice fluffy stories don't sell.""Even Spinal Tap back in the day said it: ""Every movie in every cinema is about death. Death sells.""It's no secret that Hollywood is now officially dead. The Kubricks and Nolans and the Tarantinos have all stood aside to let the studios do their own thing, so 1) they use the nostalgia factor to lure in those who wish to remember their past, and 2) regurgitate the story from a different perspective, again and again and again, to tell newer generations that there was something back then they should have seen, and remaking it in a way they accept and understand.Then people take this and react each in their own way: praise for thinking out of the box or being indignant that thinking out of the box of their childhood has torn the story and its place in their hearts to shreds.This is how Cruella is polarizing audiences.Personally, I'm not even a Disney fan, old nor new. In fact I dislike how badly they've commercialized Star Wars and the MCU. So I came to watch the movie with zero expectations because my wife was the one who suggested it. By the end of the movie I was quite impressed. Disney had left its sickly sweet mold and chosen to do something dark (""Are you sure you're not from the DC Universe?"" jokes another reviewer, a line from Deadpool)The twists aren't obvious at first unless you really think about them. The Baroness is aided by a silent butler, John, played by the underused Mark Strong who, from the very beginning of the movie, appears to be just as much of a villain as the Baroness. Halfway through he confesses that he had saved Estella from certain death through conflict of conscience. You immediately go ""aww, sweet. He was the good guy all along."" But then, when Cruella finally gets her way and wins as the antihero, we find that John has become part of her malevolent troupe...and your mind starts racing. Was he really a good guy? Was he doing this for his own sake? What on earth brought this twist about? Your head races to find an answer.The movie makes no bones about its intentions: it wants you to feel for Cruella and see how her menace is both justified and extreme. With that, it's inviting you to join her. We all now what she's going to do next involving Dalmatians. We've seen it in the past films and some of us have read in the story. Now she wants us to be with her, whether we like it or not. I don't think many people who are giving low ratings notice or understand the significance of using The Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" as the last song in the movie. I mean, it says everything right there, just in the title!And that leads to the setting of the story and the complaints being made about the soundtrack: Forget San Francisco's flowery counterculture of a few years before. London the 70s was the place to be if you wanted the anger that brought us the punk movement and all attitudes associated with it. It was alive with the sort of vibe that demanded attention in the worst possible ways. It was mandatory to have a soundtrack that reflected the time and place.This is where another reviewer is right about comparing Cruella to Vivienne Westwood, but who wouldn't honestly want to sit and watch a bio of Westwood in an age where 99% millennials and Gen-Z don't even know (or care) who she is. You want to capture attention? Give the audience (s)punk: explain that rebels were just as loud back then as they are now. They just didn't need social media, they did it organically, and with a lot more bollocks to boot!So those who are indignant about Disney ruining the 101 Dalmatians and asking to sympathize with a villain fail to see the point: if you think life is (or shouldn't be) unfair, you're missing the point that fairness is an entitlement.From the dark ages to the modern age the rule has been consistent: Eat or be Eaten. Disney, although it's already been feasting on audience flesh for a long time, is inviting you to choose. It seems most people giving low reviews choose the latter based on the nostalgia factor begging them to cling to the past...which means that, ultimately, Disney won. They've managed to hook audiences with the Nostalgia Factor, and the indignant ones fell for it in their own way: they were eaten. Those of us who are aware that ""nice fluffy stories don't sell"" suspended past associations and used the nostalgia factor as a new lens to looked at the present way of life...They chose to eat just like the movie wanted them to...and it was a delicious movie. Bon apetit, I say!",Cruella

709,mij-63893,A surprisingly good film,8,5 June 2021,I wasn't expecting too much from this film but it's definitely surprised me and I really enjoyed seeing London the fashion and Cruella's backstory who would have thought Cruella was a Disney princess :),Cruella
710,xhaimike,Hands down to both Emma's!!,10,22 June 2021,They portrayed the characters brilliantly! Both Emma did an amazing job! They didn't outshine the other. It was so beautiful to watch and the twist at the end. Wow! I really didn't see that coming! It was so good to watch even for 100th times!! I loooove it!!,Cruella
711,lordoflightrhollor,Best film of 2021 Thus Far,10,29 May 2021,Critics literally suck. This movie was absolutely spectacular. The acting was great. The plot was great. The COSTUMERY was insanity (in the absolute best way). The soundtrack and score was captivating! Best film of 2021 for me thus far. I cannot wait to watch again and again.All star performances by everyone in the cast. The production quality is bar none here. The period fashion and vehicles and set design?! Dazzling! This is a gem and Disney should be super proud of this one!,Cruella
712,linuspmarketing,Disney has restored my faith,10,26 July 2021,"Growing up i was always so afraid of Cruella, from the animations. And still I thought she couldn't possibly have such a story it would be worth a whole movie. Boy was I wrong, about a lot of things.This movie is both entertaining but also incredibly dark, much darker then I ever thought Disney would ever do. I was definitely surprised after seeing Cruella, and I do recommend giving it a watch.",Cruella
713,Nomissimon10,Developed nicely,6,26 August 2021,Weak beginning with the dogs killing Cruella's mother. Feels very forced. However the story going forwards after the beginning is quite interesting and entertaining. High production quality and an all right plot. At least they kept Cruella's driving according to the 101 Dalmatians standard.,Cruella
714,tastelikecayndie,Great Movie!!!,10,1 June 2021,"I am think I am the one who from the beginning was very excited for the film. I was eager to know Cruella's story. I knew it was not going to be another 101 Dalmatian's film. Maybe I am biased because I am a huge Disney Villains fan. With that said, I was not disappointed with film. Stone's performance is phenomenal, so is Thompson's. The movie is all around entertaining. I always tell my kids, villains only seek to avenge to those who did them wrong, except Mike Meyers. LOL. Cruella is one the best movies this year.",Cruella

I've been afraid that they would make everything just another Disney movie but this has proved that they are capable to change!,Cruella
716,faraazattar,Ok-ish film,6,6 July 2021,"The movie is having a bad plot and terrible direction. The story is very lame and feel's like your watching 90's film. If this film was released during 90's then it would have been good. There are many ploy holes and many dumb scenes like taken from an old film. Casting is really good, both Emma's performed brilliantly and other cast also did a great job. If you're really desperate to watch a Disney film like I am then you can surely watch this film. It's not a bad film, it's a good film but definitely not a excellent or blockbuster film. I had initially given 4 stars but I increased 2 stars because of its attractive dark visuals and costume designing. Disney can consider a sequel with a more mature screenplay and should hire a new director.",Cruella
717,mgwdrmatt,The Devil Wears Perdita,7,29 May 2021,"Is it a bad film? Not at all. Is it a great film? No, but some good casting and performances help it a lot.Who is this filmed aimed at? More likely the mums watching this with their kids than the kids themselves. It's long and the obvious references will only be appreciated by adults of a certain age with a certain taste in film and television.One big thing, and I think this is in its favour, is that you could file off the Disney serial numbers and it still stand up just fine as a 70s fashioned-themed comedy heist flick all of its own.Plsu, it does have a great soundtrack, marred only very slightly by some poor cover selections.",Cruella

IMAGINE OUR GREAT SURPRISE when we realized that Cruella is a cinematic masterpiece on every level. The 2 Emmas rip through the story like dueling dragons and the supporting cast is superb. The story is extremely imaginative and constantly twisting and turning in unpredictable directions. The cinematography, soundtrack, and visual effects are state of the art - and the costuming and makeup are imaginative and effective without stumbling into the bizarre in a futile search for originality. And best of all - no dogs were de-pelted.",Cruella

I am looking forward to the sequel!.There was a depth to the acting of all the actors.

Yes it's ridiculous it's a Disney movie but a darker turn than most. I'd advise making sure your kids know what they will be watching, the concept of death and murder is widely explored. Great period piece honestly I'd be surprised if this doesn't win oscars for best costume and set design. Very very well done on that front. Longer than it needed to be by 20 minutes but deserves none of the critic thrashing. It's a pleasant change for Disney and was enthralling from start to finish. 7/10 film, 8/10 acting, 6/10 story, 10/10 costumes and set.",Cruella

The two Emma's absolutely killing it in their respective roles as Cruella and the Baroness. They are having so much fun playing these characters, the script is very witty and whimsical.. throw in a dash of trendy 1970's London, and you've got pure sensory magic for the eyes and ears. It was so refreshing to have something targeted intentionally at adults from Disney that isn't drenched in politics. Loved it, and would highly recommend for a rollicking evenings entertainment.",Cruella
737,soumyabratamajumder25,BOTH EMMA WINS !!!!!,8,20 June 2021,THe movie is visually stunning. Emma Thompson killed it as baroness. Emma Stone is always a delight to watch. Though the movie isn't perfect but who cares you will get a good time withy the family watching this.My only complaint is that estella suddenly becomes mean to her friends and its so abrupt and unnecessary that didn't make any sense for me. It was like the GOT Season finale Khaleesi moment where they needed her to be bad all of a sudden. But Overall I had a good time watching it and I will watch the sequel which they definitely hinted.,Cruella

I would appreciate if she was closer to the original(more glamorous, more evil). But the positive twist is not bothering me as much as I thought and the storyline isn't that predictable. Kept me on edge. The movie is full of fashion references and I'm living.Hopefully I'm not giving too much away when calling this The devil wears Prada with a Disney twist.",Cruella
739,paullevantis,Better than expected,7,20 June 2021,"101 Dalmations is a fantastic film with excellent characters, and after watching it one would think that it cannot be depicted in live action. The live action remakes proved this correct, however Cruella is different.The angle taken on the film actually provides a sufficient and imaginative backstory for Cruella DeVil, and it cleverly manages to position the audiences on the side of the character despite how much we hate her in all her other depictions. That was quite impressive, as well as the acting from Emma Thompson.The story was good, except there appeared to be repetition of segments of the movie which just make you feel like the movie is more of the way through than it actually is. Another thing that did this was the constant climactic moments which end up tiring you out a little. This means that when the proper climax happens, the movie feels like it's been going on forever and you find yourself not really as engaged as you should be.Emma Stone's accent was really impressive, however it must have been the director's decision to make it more posh in certain moments, which I wasn't really a fan of. Also, the incorporation of a full fledged lgbt character felt a little unsuitable for the time period in which it was set (sorry about the spoiler).The soundtrack was filled with excellent songs which were really suitable for the film. However, the events happening on screen couldn't quite match the coolness of the song resulting in the music being a slight distraction.Overall a very admirable and imaginative effort from Disney.",Cruella

Ofcouse not! And isn't the point of reviewing is to review the movie itself and not ""oh no its not the same anymore gotta give 1 star""? You guy are ridiculous sometime.And about the movie.

I give it 10 stars. I totally recommend it.",Cruella
743,kmkarina,Cruella-a new Disney live-action movie,10,17 June 2021,"This movie was better than I expected. I like how Disney explores this part of dark-twisty villan's backstory. The transition from Estella to Cruella was genius. Cruella is like a cat with nine lives. An underrated villan. A well-portraited story in which we get to see her perspective. The script is really written with attention to the details in order to keep the bond between this movie and 101 Dalmatians. I was blown away by Emma Stone's performance even though at first I didn't see her as a realistic choice for the role. But she was great! Her British accent was excellent as most of American actresses don't even try to sound a little like them. Moreover, she knew how to balance Cruella's many personalities. She went from the obediant shy assistant to the bold inovative (psychopath) designer. The actress knew when she had to be funny, sarcastic, or creepy proving her talent. The entire movie was filled with many funny scenes and also succeded in keeping us at the edge of our seats. The relationships between the characters was very well-built. Loved the friendship between Estella, Jasper and Horace and the endless faith or support they had in each other. And also don't forget to give credit to the dogs, they really deserve it. The dresses Cruella (Estella) created were amazing as they gave a really sense of true fashion. The background was fantastic. The soundtrack was great, really completed the atmosphere. Overall, I like the psychological side of the story proving that nothing is what it seems, not even a villan.",Cruella
744,marydanza,Best Live Action with Maleficent,8,12 June 2021,"I have always thought that a live action had to do something more than just copying the original disney movie: it had do give a new perspective of the story and a better characterization of the psychology of the characters and 'Cruella' absolutely did it! This movie is witty, fresh and unpredictable. Disney finally seems to want to remove that hint of shallowness from villains and give an explanation to their behavior and personality as they previously did with 'Maleficent'. Emma Stone is the real thing and gave her soul to this role. In conclusion I highly recommend this movie!",Cruella

Now I'm not complaining as these films are always beautifully made and artistically styled, but i cannot stop and not wonder how on earth this movie makes up for the original Cruella to try to make coats out of puppies but ok, good film.",Cruella
753,elliedario,Pointless,3,6 August 2021,I don't understand the reason for this film. In the original film the character of Cruella was just evil: she wanted to skin innocent puppies to make a coat.

Only watched after reading IMDB reviews..,7,2 June 2021,Movie was suprisingly entertaining and that's coming from a 34yr old man who's a self-professed cinephile that definitely doesn't usually gravitate towards Disney movies or anything too much on the children's spectrum of film. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson were great. Really was a cool character study of a legendary villain. All this talk about the movie being too dark or not for kids is ridiculous. Probably not that appetizing for your 4-5yr olds but kids older than that as well as adults would definitely enjoy the ride. Easily 7or8/10 given the content.,Cruella
757,TheToday,Emma vs Emma,7,25 August 2021,"Both Emmas are great in their roles, that's for sure. This movie has a great character compilation, it's fun to watch, it doesn't feel long at all... It's one of those movies I don't think I'd mind watching every once and then.I guess its only problem is that the main character is no Cruella as it is, given that Thompson's feels way closer to that crazy woman we know from 101 Dalmatians. Besides that... Cheers to the movie!",Cruella
758,fogelmclovin-43464,Great movie to watch with family (or alone),8,11 June 2021,"Cruella is a crime-comedy directed by Craig Gillespie (also the man who directed I, Tonya) and written by Dana Fox (who especially writes rom-coms) and Tony McNamara (think Favourite, The). It stars the Academy-award winning actresses Emma Stone and Emma Thompson, both of whom give a magnificent performance.The story is a prequel to 101 Dalmatians and it's set in the 1960s. So, the costumes and makeup are relevant to the time period, and also, very beautiful. Emma Stone portrays the titular character Cruella, and the whole story is really about how she became the supposed villain that she was.The story also has a side plot in which Cruella wants to pursue a career in fashion designing. There's that office politics side in which Emma Thompson is involved in, which very much reminds me of The Devil wears Prada. I enjoyed the cinematography and the music, which was mostly versions of famous songs, so it was great to sing along with the situation.

At some point is just too much and I got distracted. And I found that it's a new experience that never felt before.Can an excessive exposure of good songs be wrong?I also think they just hit the music ""play"" button and forget about it. There is a particular moment when one of the baroness' minions shouts ""silence!"" when she is coming into the scene, but the music keeps playing. It should have stopped and we should have hear the silence. But no, it kept with the song. I mean: the music was not particularly fitting exactly with the script.Yet, great performance from both Emmas. They deliver perfectly, and while it could be a bit over the top sometimes, the script does nice twists that holds the spirit together.I heard that ""the Joker"" should have been more like this movie.

I loved the live action 101 Dalmatians but I have never wondered who Cruella was so it didn't seem for people like me.

770,fissorevincent,Well... Heh,5,9 June 2021,"It seemingly has been seen as a tall order that Disney might pull off such a high concept premise about trying to turn one of their most well known villains into a misunderstood spirit and someone to root for. It worked with Maleficent essentially due to the fact that that particular movie was a retelling of Sleeping Beauty more than an origin story. It does not work here, and for reasons that are even under the movies control and fails to take advantage of them.Listing all the failures might take some time, but chief amongst them are:-The inanity of trying to turn Cruella De Ville into a misunderstood character with a tragic backstory.-Emma Thompson playing a caricature of herself is not the humorous sting some might have thought.-Emma Stone does what she can with her role, which means Harley Quinn from start to finish.-When did Jasper become the considerate one of the bumbling duo?-Going back to the backstory, the twist regarding the relationship between Estella and the Baroness seemed highly forced and out of order.-When exactly did she befriend the Dalmatians?As for you did I subject myself to this movie, I had a leftover free ticket from last year and I saw it on 09/06/2021, the reopening day of movie theatres in Belgium, and in the absence of titles too far away (Black Widow) or shifted to streaming (Kong vs. Godzilla), this was the main attraction proposed.",Cruella

778,chrinaboehler,Fabulous darling!,10,30 May 2021,"It seems as though the negative reviewers haven't actually watched this movie. The main criticism is the question, why do all villains have to be good first, why can't they just be plain evil? Well, if you took the time to watch this, Cruella herself says she was born ""brilliant, bad and a little bit mad."" This movie plays on nature vs nurture, and nature wins. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson had great diabolical chemistry, the plot was original and well thought out and the use of imagery, costuming and music all blended together perfectly from scene to scene. If you're a Disney fan over the age of 10 you will probably enjoy this, I think the story is too much for young children to grasp and there's some very dark scenes. So far the best live action Disney movie! They have a lot to make up for after Lion King(if you want to call that live action), that was devastating. My only complaint posed as a question is, can they not use real dogs even? For anything?",Cruella
779,proupoupou,Too pop for my taste,6,31 October 2021,I loved the original Dalmatians movie but movies nowadays luck soul. Disney tries desperately to squeeze money out of the franchise it owns and this one is no exception. The movie is watchable and fun but is pretty effortless in terms of... well everything.

I was expecting a kids movie but what I got was a dark, captivating, and very entertaining journey.",Cruella
782,Vincent_Fjodor,"Uncertain at first, but left the cinema pleasantly surprised",9,24 August 2021,"I've noticed that this film received a lot of criticism and partly I understand that. Another Disney live action? Another villain origin story? We've seen that, won't they come up with something new already?Nevertheless, I don't understand why so many people gave this film 1/10 star on this website because it was a pleasant surprise to me. In the past, Disney has made some garbage live action movies, but this is not one of them. Google classified this movie as comedy/crime, so maybe that gave people the wrong expectations. There were some genuinely funny moments in this film, but I would never describe it as a comedy film, and there wasn't all that much crime going on either. Rather I'd call it a psychological action film or something.I know little about fashion, but it is obvious even to a layman like me that they put a lot of effort in the costumes because they looked absolutely stunning. This film deserves to win an Oscar for best costume design. The costumes alone count for at least 3/10 stars, so again, I don't understand why so many people gave this film 1/10 star.Secondly, the story was better than I expected. I've heard a lot of people complain that this movie was too long, but I actually haven't been bored for one minute. I liked that the story unfolded slowly in front of the viewer, because usually in modern movies the plot moves so fast that I tend to forget huge parts of it and can't remember all the characters. Not in this case: every character was neatly introduced and the story was easy to follow. Maybe, if you expect a fast action movie-type of story, you'll be disappointed, but otherwise I don't see how the pace of the movie is going to be an issue.Not just the pace, but the story itself too was pretty neat. It wasn't perfect to be sure, occasionally the script lines were cringy/edgy, but the great actors in this film still made it work and the story was always entertaining. There were some very creative findings in this movie and throughout the entire film I was wondering what other kind of genius plans Cruella and her friends would come up with.I was expecting Cruella and the Baroness to be fascinating characters, but didn't expect much of the supporting cast. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised, because the characters from the supporting cast too were all pretty interesting. There were no characters that had no purpose in the story and they were all portrayed in a brilliant way by their actors, especially Emma Stone and Emma Thompson stole the show and seemed to enjoy themselves. Also Emma Stone deserves to win an Oscar for the monologue near the end of the film alone: no action, no other actors, just a close-up of her face and she still managed to make every second of it interesting.Overall this movie definitely deserves a positive review, even if it is another Disney live action and was occasionally too edgy. The story was good and never boring, the characters were all interesting and the costumes were brilliant.EDIT: After I rewatched the movie on my laptop, I loved it even more than I did after seeing it in cinema. This film is not the kind that is only interesting for it's epic scenes and shock value.",Cruella

787,TheLavenderPanther,Fresh,7,2 June 2021,"Before Cruella was released, I recently had a Disney live-action marathon on Disney's streaming service. Some were good, some were meh. Then just in the nick of time, Cruella flourished where other of Disney's attempts didn't and seemed as such...attempts. Maybe because it is an origin prequel set-up, something we haven't yet seen unlike other live-actions, Cruella is a breath of fresh air. Emma stone being the lead is honestly icing on the cake. Throughout her career, Emma has proved to be a phenomenal actress and very diverse. The setting, fashion and plot is very modern yet still keeps that Disney-esque which is done very well. Flashy one liners and sprinkles of action with some of the best CGI Disney has done in a while also makes watching Cruella a real villain fairytale. The only real issue I had was how rushed certain moments felt but you still don't notice that it was 2 hours until the credits roll. Emma Thompson was delightful and had real dark moments that made you think Cruella was not a villain at all but a victim. Thankfully the story still keeps true to the Villain energy and doesn't give any room to make you question if you feel bad for rooting for her (Cruella). Another shining moment is Emma's solo monologue at the fountain that has a true depth that I haven't felt in years from a Disney original.",Cruella
788,TimelessSelf,I did enjoy Cruella but...,7,7 June 2021,"I guess I didn't get attached to her character. It was too predictable in its childish Disney way. It was classic villain origin story of parent killed by someone but misinterpreted as another thing. So after a third of the film being devil wears Prada, we resolve the misunderstanding- resulting in a 'villainous twist' which leads to the second third which is just a heist film. Then after that there is a second mission which feels as though it should be another episode or movie in and of itself. Then it ends.I liked the costumes but I feel as though Cruella's could have been better still. They were quite high fashion and not what I expected based on 1- the original Cruella and 2- the initial window display outfit in this film. I do appreciate the idea that she grows into the old Cruella devil, by starting off young and modern, but I wish there was more scary unhinged stuff.People say this film is dark for Disney standards but I disagree. I have been more scared and traumatized by Disney's old animated films/villains (lion king). The film tries to put you on Cruella's side, she isn't a villain by the end- even though she has become the one thing she sought to destroy- we are expected to forgive her for her crimes because of her tragic backstory.Cruella is meant to kill Dalmatians later in life, but this film doesn't touch on that future hatred for the dogs, instead she spares them. I don't know how this Cruella ends up being future Cruella- but I'm sure Disney will make another film to try and bridge the gap.The ending- specifically how she survived the fall- was ridiculous, I'd have preferred she died honestly as that would have been interesting and heartwarming actually: to chose justice over cruelty, one final act by Estella. They could have justified future Cruella in that scenario by having it just be another crazy lady who took on the persona of Cruella to finish what she started.",Cruella

794,karissaaaaa,context and everything that lead up to the making of this movie,7,10 July 2021,"I had to swim across all the memes and complaints about this movie before watching it and see what all the buzz was about for myself.And it turned out to be amazing! Emma Stone keeps outdoing herself and amazingly portrayed the double life Cruella was living throughout the movie. The storyline is great despite disney's questionable decision of giving the animal killer villain a chance for redemption and making her sound like a girlboss.But with context and everything behind this movie, it sounds awful. There's too many spin-offs and revisions of 101 dalmatians for me to count and even remember what the original story was about. This is where all the complaints are coming from, 101 dalmatians is a classic book centered around the life of a hundred dogs trying to run away from an animal killer but in this movie there wasn't a hundred dogs, barely any dalmatians in sight and sure the baroness had three dalmatians but they only had a couple farts of minutes of screentime AND they were portrayed as the villains of the story, what did these cute puppers do to you Disney?! Why do they hate Dalmatians so much?!???! Not only that, but the costume design strayed so far far away from the original 101 dalmatians book, in the book Cruella is an incredibly wealthy woman addicted on fur clothing that has taken an interest on the fur of a hundred and one dalmatians, that was the whole conflict of the book, but in this movie adaptation centered on the Cruella herself, there wasn't a single strand of fur! The dalmatian outfit was fake! No dalmatian fur!I probably sound like an elitist writing this, aside all those complaints from the previous paragraph, I actually think this movie was good. Giving the horrible villain a half-assed backstory and origin is genius, no remorse for the animal killer, I don't think anyone genuinely felt sorry for poor orphan Cruella because that's not the point of the movie, the point of it is a talented fashion designer who has personal problems with an egotistical prestigious designer and tries to overthrow her by taking over the masses and overshadowing her in the media. She does this in a very revolutionary way that makes you think this rebellion is for everyone and not just because the baroness killed her mom, questionable but I can't deny I enjoyed every second of it, especially the scene where her outfit is made of garbage fabrics. Oh the girlbossification of Cruella, this was a ride to watch so we'll excuse you this time, Disney. Don't fail me in the next adaptation you're making.",Cruella

This movie does deserve the positive reviews it has been getting.One issue that I can find with the movie is that there's too much music.

2 = Narration
3 = The lack of movie clothes sold in stalls*Cruella was masterful. The plot was spectacular. The only reason why immersion was broken for me was the narration. Characters noticing the differences between Estella and Cruella as the movie progressed was handled wonderfully. The tactics employed to undermine the Baroness were executed effectively. The pace and flow of the plot was enough to keep the audience interested. There wasn't a moment were the show was stale.However, the movie did not need narration. The scriptwriters could have worked around it, instead of having Cruella narrate the opening and conclusion.While the movie did not call for any songs or musical numbers, I would have loved if there were some. In line with Disney's recent modern reboots of old titles, it makes sense. But still.Finally, and most importantly, where can we buy all the clothes shown on screen* for ourselves in real life? Seriously. Disney spent the money and effort to (create? Idk if the designs were original for this movie) and product placement them on screen, hyping up fashion as a force of change and expression rather than a frivolous hobby, and not make them available to the audience to buy? While the cosplay industry will use these, the barrier to entry will be with the luxury brands across the world. We want them. Where's the Cruella fashion collaborations besides the lipsticks and makeup tie ins?*I didn't do enough research. I tried Googling when the movie first came out. I don't have background in fashion, nor do I have an in-depth knowledge about the industry. If Coach, Prada and the likes do actually sell their 19xx collections as shown on screen, wow.",Cruella

They all seem the same...
Call me crazy, call me insane
But you're stuck in the past
And I'm ahead of the game
A life lived in penance, it just seems a waste
And the devil has much better taste
And I tried to be sweet, I tried to be kind
But I feel much better now that I'm out of my mind
Well, there's always a line at the gates of Hell
But I go right to the front 'cause I dress this well
Rip it up, leave it all in tatters
Beauty is the only thing that matters
The fabric of your little world is torn
Embrace the darkness and be reborn""Song: Call Me Cruella, by Florence and the Machine.Does this tune, which plays at the end of the movie, sound a bit... Satanic to you?If it doesn't, I encourage you to look at the many Satanic themes being propagated in entertainment right now (Sabrina on Netflix is one show). You might think it sounds silly and conspiratorial, but even if you're not Christian (I'm not), and don't buy into the dichotomy of God and the Devil (perhaps a more accurate polarity is that of Higher Self and Shadow Self), you've got to admit there is a strange emphasis being placed on ""do what thou wilt"" in recent productions. These entertainment pieces seem to say that as long as we have equality of all races, sexes, genders, and sexual orientations, we don't really need to have morals--there's a real gray area there, in truth--or a profound feeling of connection to our hearts.As a result, if you're truly connected, these entertainment pieces often just don't... feel right. There's something missing with them.First of all, look at the deeper values this movie is pushing: borderline personality disorder is normal and even good (Cruella v. Estella, both of which ""feel much better now that they're out of their minds""); having morals and being a truly well-meaning person is ""boring"" and unoriginal, and lacking in genius; oh and be reborn... By relinquishing your soul to the devil. Or your dark side. No biggie. This is a real children's movie all right! Or, you know, an impressionable 13-year-old's. No need to grow, to stand for the light; no need to get in touch with your heart (as it beats for the real you) and address your real motives behind your own darkness. No no, the real you is simply dark and hungry and twisted and impulsive. Why look behind veil of confusion in order to find yourself? Mental illness is perfectly healthy... Yes, this is the oxymoron being fed to our children.Note: I'm not saying don't have understanding for it or honor what it means for you when you are suffering from depression, anxiety, the like. Just don't pretend like there's nothing more to the story... Or a greater sense of fulfillment to be had.Notably, a certain type of programming that begins with ""mk"", which famously took place in the 60's and is supposedly long gone, chiefly involves inducing disassociative identity disorder in its victims.",Cruella

808,djeugene13,A dog's breakfast,6,29 May 2021,"Overall I'm going to say this film is entertaining BUT it's a mess. It loses focus in every area. There are a few spectacular fashion moments, which is what I think the motivation of Cruella was, but it's a dog's breakfast (pun intended) and a mish mash of different eras, too many songs, Devil Wears Prada, Suicide Girls and Sia. The tragic thing is, they touched on something that could have been a fascinating storyline which was the usurpation of punk fashion by high culture in the 70's-80's. This story could have run in tandem with the Cruella story and would have been socially and relevant and relevant to the overall plot, but they touched on it and then dropped it. A very sad missed opportunity.",Cruella
809,chvlades,Best Disney live action adaptation ever,10,28 May 2021,"After a year of depriving ourselves from the great movie theater experience, having such an incredible show stopping wicked movie, makes the whole wait well deserved.

810,robdavis381,A Sad and Infuriating Tribute to 2021,2,9 September 2021,"My wife and I watched this thinking it was a more adult version of 101, but discovered it was just a perfect salute to the Cynicism of Today, a culmination that started with Zak Snyder, the whole Marvel Universe destroying itself, the DC destroying of Superman, and all that is WRONG in America today. The ONLY sympathetic character in this movie is the poor mutt that stands loyally by Emma Stone's character; coming in second is the sad man who is in love with her. Both lose out most of the film. All the other characters, except the usual loyal John, are so full of cynicism, greed, and self absorbance to be obscene about it. This is NOT a Disney film, no matter what the beginning says or the final credits say. Walt must be turning over in his grave to have his name put to this trash. Unacceptable, regrettable, and a sign of the times that our democracy is doomed by indifference and incredible self indulgence.",Cruella
811,julio-lucas,A good surprise,8,29 May 2021,Finally Disney sponsors a good movie. I was already losing hope.,Cruella
812,skeletornumber70,Maybe Disney can still make unique films,8,28 May 2021,"Of all the evil witches, monsters, dictators, and homicidal maniacs that populated classic Disney animation, Cruella Deville might be the most hated. Sure, she never had plans for world domination and she never even tried to murder another human, but she did the one thing that film audiences can never forgive: she tried to kill puppies. It's for this reason that I've been so skeptical about this film, an origin story that attempts to humanize this character by shedding new light on her turbulent past. The cast sounded stacked and Craig Gillespie is a director I've admired ever since ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" but was it possible to tell a sympathetic, Disney-fied story about someone we know will wind up a would-be dog killer?Well, the answer is yes and no, but mostly yes. Before I praise this film for being such an unexpected gem, let me get the couple of problems I have with it out of the way. First and foremost, without giving any spoilers, I never get the true sense that Cruella is as pure evil as she's supposed to be by the time we get to 101 Dalmatians. She's definitely no hero by any means, but there's not a point where I feel the audience will stop rooting for her. The only other complaint is that there's a bit of a tonal inconsistency at times, as if the film doesn't quite know its target audience. It's certainly not for children, not only is it dark and mature but it's so much of a character study that young kids would be bored, yet there are certain occasions that feature very ""cartoonish"" logic that adults will have to suspend a lot of disbelief over.But on to the good, and the first point of praise is the cast. Emma Stone is absolutely brilliant in this role, and you can just sense that she's having the time of her life playing it. Almost just as amazing is Emma Thompson as the vile Baroness, and when the two are onscreen together the chemistry between the rivals is electric. As far as the supporting cast goes, there really isn't a weak link to be found, with a particular stand out in Paul Walter Hauser who is hilarious as the dimwitted thief Horace. As for Gillespie's direction, the film is beautifully shot and he brings the same stylistic energy he brought to ""I,Tonya"" though it's greatly enhanced here due to the 1970s punk rock aesthetic of the film. This leads me to the soundtrack, which is not only pure awesomeness, but is used to turn Cruella's story into an almost allegory for the transition of London music scene in the late 60s-early 70s.I could go on and on about the individual components that make this film work, but the truth is what really makes it work is how well these individual parts come together in a seamless fashion (no pun intended). In another time perhaps I might be more critical, but honestly it's been a while since I've seen such a major studio blockbuster, especially one based on an established property, that feels like it's actually the unaltered vision of a filmmaker. The story, the cast, the music, the style, everything all fits together to make something truly satisfying. That's how movies are supposed to be made, and with that I give this my first strong recommend of 2021.",Cruella

Emma Stone is projecting so many different aspects of such a complex character, owning Cruela, proofing once again her.brilliant acting skills. Even the supporting actors are well played and entertaining. The fancy costume design is incredible. The well picked music is the cherry on the pie. It is not an action movie and it is not a simple copy and paste of the original movie, it is more intelligent and deep, e.g. By not just polarizing to simple good and bad, but characters as human and diverse can be.

Those elements aside, it's pretty dull and goes on far too long. I'm a fan of Emma Stone but I don't think she was right for this role.Also.. The character comes off more like someone with dissociative identity than someone who ""transformed"" out of necessity. Except, it's portrayed comically.

The plot is predictable but thats not the problem, its that the it takes soo damn long for them to get to the point and theres just no fun to the journey and the interplay between the characters.

As others have mentioned, I don't feel that the Cruella pictured in this film represents the Cruella from the original movie. For diehard 101 Dalmation fans who don't want to see an antagonist become ""a troubled girl who deep down is good,"" I recommend not watching.I truly think this movie would have been better if the character was not based on an antagonist from an old movie. Why couldn't they have made these two films unrelated? A backstory for a person we all wanted to assume was evil wasn't necessary or wanted and frankly seems unrealistic and impossible.That being said, if you had never watched 101 Dalmations, you would have likely enjoyed this movie. It's entertaining, has a great ending, and it is a lot of fun to see Cruella and the Baroness go head to head.

With this path, spiraled to the journey of becoming Cruella.The scene where Estella faked her death by parachuting off the cliff & being picked up by a boat during the storm was a little too theatrical.Overall, very entertaining!

845,faulknerlaird,Too overrated crappy fairy tale for alternative kids,1,8 August 2021,"God, this is one of the most overrated projects of our time.The girl Cruella in the 60s-70s behaves openly defiantly and brazenly, moreover, she is not sent to a special school for problem children.Her only friend is politically correct.Then her mother is killed by dogs, purely by accident, attention, KICKING a woman off a cliff.If anything, the dogs do not push, attacking, but on the contrary, pull to the ground to either bite the victim's throat, or fix the aggressor below in a subordinate position.Was there really not a single dog handler on the set?Graphics.Constant, everywhere and everywhere, as if modern actors can only shoot close-ups, and everything else is enough to make plasticine in the editor.It looks absolutely unconvincing and all this falseness destroys the entire illusion of the reality of the picture, which is necessary in order to watch it.What, the actors are paid so little that they can't even jump with a parachute from a height of 5 meters for the finale?You really try, you don't unload the cars, you can break a nail once. You won't die.Although, when 20-25-year-old young people are played by people who are under 40 - this is, of course, a grand idea.But we will also return to that ridiculous parachute with you.In general, from the very beginning, we are taught that Cruella is a GENIUS.But this is not shown anywhere and she does not try at all, does not work and does not study design.Just accept that she is the best from birth, knows everything in a word-a GENIUS.After the death of her mother, Cruella meets the most cleanly and luxuriously dressed vagabond children in the world, for some reason decides that she will be accused of murdering her mother - a 10-year-old child, whom no one has even seen at the crime scene, although the whole city has gathered there and decides that she urgently needs to hide... by repainting...
Oh, if all the bandits in the world used hair dye, the magic of which would hide them from the police...
And, attention, together with these ragamuffins, alone, these children live in an abandoned house, not found by anyone and fishing for theft, as much as 10 years!I was reminded of ""Oliver Twist"", but the author of the book is just nervously smoking away from such plot twists of ""Cruella"".Yes, after 10 years, these 10-12-year-old children are sharply under 40, I have never met the worst selection of actors in my life.And they're cool.They're like Ocean's friends.Cruella also has expensive fabrics for her models, there is all the equipment for sewing, however, they could not save money for her birthday cake, and their abandoned apartment looks more elite than many homes of the middle class.Then, not much, not less, Cruella alone invents the punk style, and you will immediately find out who will be the main villain in this piece of Disney.It's amazing that time has stepped forward a lot, and the technique from the 60s, when Clark Kent took off his glasses and no one recognized him, also works at Cruella!Masterfully putting on a wig, Cruella is suddenly not recognized by anyone from her entourage, moreover, her friends are not recognized, who are looked at point-blank during their acts of vandalism and hooliganism, and when they bring her parcels to the office of the villain.By the way, there is no police in the world of ""Cruella"", no one was looking for these three stooges, despite the damage they caused to the city and one of the most influential women in the fashion world.They can steal cars and ram parked cars, but there are no police. Just accept it.The nonsense about the true Cruella is unconvincing, when she changes back the color of her hair, no one has prevented her from being herself before.Her rescue from the fire by dogs, by the way, one of which has a pirate blindfold for some reason, looks very ridiculous and stupid.Otherwise, everything is predictable, boring, and, like an extravaganza of complete scenario nonsense, a sudden rescue in the style of James Bond by parachute.There will be sequels and this is obvious.But don't believe the ratings, ""Cruella"" doesn't deserve a rating higher than 5.0

Fabulous costumes, a soundtrack that had me dancing in my seat and some just great fun performances made this a movie I'll buy for my shelves. Emma Stone is always fun to watch and while her performance is heightened I think it kind of has to be to play the titular role in this one.

Emma Stone turns Cruella deVil on her head and delivers such an outstanding performance as the titular character that she becomes instantaneously lovable; not a word anyone would normally use to describe Cruella deVil.Emma Thompson is fabulous as usual in a role that seems written for her, with her Baroness looking like she could go the distance with Miranda Priestly.Performances from Kirby Howell-Baptiste, John McCrea, Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser stay with you after the movie as well. Mark Strong and Emily Beecham, while underused, are also very well cast.These new reimaginings from Disney may not sit well with the purists but having motivations for these historic characters without taking away from their implicit drama is actually quite genius.While not always on the mark in a very dynamic sociological landscape, Disney appears to have found a way to demolish good/evil tropes in their Fable Stable and 'grey up' very traditional labels, adding rich layers to otherwise very cookie cutter fare.The 70's soundtrack and London settings are also huge bonuses for Cruella.This is an easy 10/10 for adults and kids alike.",Cruella

""Cruella"" is not only in bad taste, but attempts to rebrand maybe the worst baddie in the Disney universe. Disney made a movie about a character who wanted to make a coat from the skins of dead puppies! What's wrong with this concept? Take a moment, if you need it! Time's up. If you actually needed the moment, shame on you! She wanted to A) kill puppies and B) make clothes from their skins. Who thought this movie was a good idea? What's next? What other diabolical Disney villains from the past are going to be brought back, given a makeover, and recast as protagonists? Is Disney trying to tell us there are no villains? Or, are the decision makers at Disney so personally and morally bankrupt, they can't tell the difference between the heroes and the villains? In ""101 Dalmations,"" the character wanted to make a coat out of puppies, how do you get more evil than that? Seriously, how do you get more evil than that? Disney, what's wrong with you?

I love the fashion designer angle, but there were some interesting plot points that took me out of the movie a bit. Spoiler:Dogs pushing her mother off a cliff?? Okaaaaay. Not exactly the most immersive choice but whatever.I think among the questionable, half baked plot points they failed to establish Cruella as an endearing, yet viciously *ahem* cruel, anti-hero (like disney/marvel did so successfully with Loki). They made her character a little too redeemable, where everyone else was the problem and she was the victim in the end. After the credits I was wondering why she was considered a villain after all? The bad guys got justice and she didn't do anything to the Dalmatians.",Cruella
858,nakpro76,The Emmas make an awesome team,9,29 September 2021,I can't imagine how much fun they had making this film. Emma stole the show by far and Thompson delivered so well back.,Cruella
859,vincent-425-782726,Delightfully devilish darkly humorous punk-rock fashion drama.,9,25 July 2021,"""Cruella"" is pure fun and forges its own identity and style that's different from previous iterations while maintaining their flamboyant drama and moustache twirling villainy.The two Emmas hit like a freight train loaded with acting talent but much credit also has to be given to the movie's canine actors. The dogs being little furry rogues.is a highlight of many scenes.Like in a Tarantino movie the music in Cruella is integral to its style, atmosphere and emotional beat and it never fails to generate excitement.A few of the jokes didn't quite work for me and I thought the motivations of some characters, like Artie, could've been fleshed out more but in the end this movie executes its intent with great success and well beyond that.Make sure to stick for the end credits. ;)",Cruella
860,globewarmer,Kerching,5,29 May 2021,"Definitely inferior to the original Glen Close version, this is still a highly watchable and expensive production, but the passage of time shows in the new tenderness towards dalmatians, and although it appears Cruella uses 3 hounds in a coat, it turns out the trio seem to still be alive, so perhaps she used faux fur? Made for money, there seems to be little love behind this film. Performances are fine-ish; I have a lot of time for Emma Thompson in anything she does, but less so for Emma Stone who seems to me nice but not a major talent. The biggesst downer here is ther script; workaday and though you will smile, you will not laugh much. I laughed once at an offhand comment. There is, alas, no wit here; hollywood strikes again.",Cruella
861,federico-rivera-742-481089,Nicely done but...,9,11 June 2021,Why would you cast Emma Stone and tell her to to act like Eva Green? They should've just hired Eva.,Cruella

864,plhollyoake,"Boring, long and extremely un-entertaining!! Please don't waste your time!!",3,18 August 2021,"This is awful! I don't understand the high stars. This gets 3 stars purely for Emma Thompson's performance, which as always, is brilliant. Alas, that is where the praise ends!The story is confusing and does nothing to relate to the original Disney classic. The acting is questionable and the CGI dogs?!?! Just why?? They are a joke!!Now I love Emma Stone, but she completely overacts this role and the 2 male lead roles are very annoying, especially the larger one with the horrendously fake London accent!The whole movie is just a mess and I wouldn't waste your time. Much more entertaining 2 star movies out there! Such a disappointment!!",Cruella
865,erinwalshtx,Loved it!!,8,2 June 2021,I loved this movie!! It was so unique and an amazing origin story for cruella!! I feel like the plot line may have a few holes but it was so entertaining i didnt care!! Go see it!! You wont regret it!!!!,Cruella

867,immbg5400,Fantastic!,9,5 July 2021,The writing was really great all throughout the film but there is 1 thing everyone who watches this film can agree on and that's Emma Stones performance. She just kills it. All the supporting cast do very well too and the soundtracks is A+.,Cruella
868,brescd01,amazing and stylish,8,18 July 2021,"I'm not sure I enjoyed this film as much as I should have, the subject matter is derivative so somewhat predictable. But that aside the movie is an exceptionally stylish and well written revisionist take on a Disney villain, much more satisfying than Maleficent for example.Emma Stone gives an amazing performance she could garner the Oscar (she is that good). The costumes script and cinematography are all first rate. CGI is kept to a minimum and the direction is snappy.This is a first rate family film and really a stunning product from Disney, who so often disappoints with its treacly and vanilla offerings.",Cruella
869,FritzRolle732,Long Live the Queen of Chaos & Creativity,8,6 June 2021,"What do you get when you mix chaos and creativity? A pure work of art designed by its queen. Cruella presents itself as one of possibly Disney's best live-action adaptions of its current era. With its stellar cast and engaging characters, you may want to watch this again and again. Also, the drama and suspense will lead you on the edge of your seat when this gives you the thought of, ""Who truly is the good guy?"", and makes us wonder ""Am I given the benefit to being the villain in the story when the one who portrays the hero was the one who made me evil?"". Kinda like how Joker presents itself. Although there is a difference between a thief and murderer, there's no denying that this film presents Cruella as a ""bad"" character who will get away with anything and try to over the world with her fashion, even if it comes with a cost. At the same time though, she still has a family by her side. Speaking of fashion, it's the part of the movie (as well as its music) that stole the show! Let's see if we get an Oscar nomination. Overall, Cruella truly is Disney's live-action Queen. The only warning I would give to movie goers (aside from questioning the characters' motives) is just be prepared for the game of leap-frog that takes place in the first quarter of the film. The pacing in that part goes by a bit too quickly. 8.25/10.",Cruella
870,wraggj-09324,Secondary characters made it even better,10,13 June 2021,"So many positives, but I want to shout out the contributions of the supporting characters, on both sides. The sidekicks and assistants added so much, often with just a word or a look.My most enjoyable film in a couple of years, and I see a lot of films. I had, at best, mediocre expectations for this. I plan on seeing it again. That's a rarity for me.",Cruella
871,Alireza_Thz,One of the most amazing movies in 2021,8,20 June 2021,Most of the movies released this year were awful but this one ... Amazing musical comedy movie and I really have to say Emma Stone was so good and I can't imagine someone else in the Cruella role now. She was FABULOUS.,Cruella

I'm here on IMDB trying to explain why so many people truly are ignorant snobs who don't know movies or culture. Let's not even talk about how amazing Emma stone was. Or how amazing the script and story were. It's a step outside the box for Disney and it's a huge hit. With comedy, mystery, drama, action all wrapped into a beautiful movie. If you take away your discretion for sensational bs and a true background story with great acting. Then you will enjoy a classic. This movie should be rated up there with lion king and Aladdin. If I could applaud Emma stone and the entire crew. I would. Bravo!",Cruella

I am in shock over how much I love this movie. 101 Dalmations was never one of my favorites but I wanted to see this because I love the 2 leading ladies and it seemed edgy. This movie is great from top to bottom. Acting, costuming, music, were all top notch along with a well thought out and well written story. Rarely do I finish a movie and immediately want to watch it again but this movie, I can't wait to see again. Make sure to stay for the scene at the end of the credits.",Cruella

877,megantwisk,I knew I'd like it and I really did...but Emma Stone is horribly miscast,9,21 June 2021,"She turned in a perfectly good performance and hammed it up as well as the character demanded but to me fell a smidge flat. There was a trailer for Free Guy (Ryan Reynolds) before it started and I found myself mulling how much better Jodie Comer his co-star would have been in the role, especially with her talent for accents. Stones accents as both Cruella and Estella were both uniquely crappy in their own ways but maybe you need to be British to actually notice?Emma Thompson as always was magnificent, as was the supporting cast, especially Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser as unfalteringly loyal and patient sidekicks Jasper & Horace. The sound track was superb, the costumery was dramatic and immensely pleasing to they eye.I'm not sure why people are getting so hung up on the skinning dalmatians idea. It was presented as tongue in cheek and she never skins anything or anybody.Nor why people are moaning about it being an origins story. 101 Dalmatians was clearly just a leap pad to tell a new, more palatable story to the 21st century audience.If I ignore my rather petty beef over Emma Stones miscasting I highly rate this very fun romp of a film.",Cruella

I was impressed at the actor that played Horace.....is that name right? Last I had seen him in was Richard Jewell which was so serious but in this movie he had more comic talent than I expected from him.

900,archy-5,My Review in Four Words: Music Supervisor Gone Wild!,9,6 June 2021,"Music supervisor Susan Jacobs stuffed Cruella with the longest list of hit songs I can remember. Suitcases of cash must have changed hands to license this picture. Non-stop, wall-to-wall heavy hits from the sixties through the eighties and beyond. Barely ten seconds goes by before another memorable tune carries the picture forward. Great music most of the time, occasionally annoying in its panoply.The Costco size can of music is tempered by the phenomenal animal animation and a cornucopia of visual effects that are breathtaking in their subtlety created under the supervision of Max Wood.A mountain range of hair, oceans of costumes, and a predictable, yet charming, parable of a script pitting good against evil, and black against white as the production's color palette goes, conspire to sweep away our imagination.While black and white lead by default in Cruella, it is not for one second meant to detract from the production design and camera department's symphony of stunning imagery that provides a world in which black and white can truly rule the rainbow.Consistently and appropriately over-the-top performances from an awesome cast of great actors provide the foundation for this remake (Reboot? Reanimation?).Working on a picture like this must have been exhausting for the performers (and everybody else for that matter). But their finished product makes it look like it was a breeze and a laugh.Cruella is a technical masterpiece with a soundtrack that would span four CDs if such things were still widely sold. Digital downloads of the complete playlist I fear will run in the GBs rather than the MBs. Please budget accordingly for a worthy music purchase when made available.Please allow me to try my review in just three words: Disney on crack! Mmmm...not sure. Still workin' on the review in ""X"" number of words thing.Meanwhile, when you're in the mood for some fun and laughs from the lighthearted dark side, please give Cruella a look. Might be a bit scary or emotionally scarring for the wee little ones though.PS - Can't wait to see how the theme park division will interpret this one...",Cruella
901,sam_guy_sam,Good but dissapointing,6,2 June 2021,"The movie was well made, well acted and lovely music. BUT !!! The one reason that made me see the movie was to find out why cruella was obsessed with killing the dalmatians and making a coat from their skin. It didn't come up. The one point when they did touch upon the subject , it did not make any sense. When you're making a prequel/origin you should be sure to explain the reason of the characters obsession which made her.",Cruella
902,kezerian-casey,Everything was perfect,10,28 May 2021,"I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. I am not a huge Disney fan but I love Emma Stone. I was blown away by this movie. I'm pretty sure I can call it one of my new favorites. I noticed so many things I don't usually notice in movies. I'm definitely not a film expert but every single detail was just so good. The set designs were beautiful, the baroness' mansion was amazing. I loved the moody, dark lighting. The costumes were INCREDIBLE. The costume designer better win some kind of award for this. The acting was *perfect* from every single person in the movie. I kept forgetting it was a movie and not just them living their lives. I even loved that the dogs were cgi because it was fun seeing all the personality in their facial expressions. The change in the storyline was also brilliant in my opinion. People always complain that movies are boring and they just keep remaking the same old stuff but then they also complain when they take a drastically different approach. I love that they showed cruella from another perspective. It would've been boring to just see the same thing in a new live action. I'm probably going to watch this movie 10 more times before it's out of theater. 10000% recommend.",Cruella

It's not Shakespeare, but the twists surprises me, and that's asking a lot from me. It was beautiful to watch, and Emma Thompson can chew scenery on my screen any day. I won't say anyone's criticism is wrong, you are entitled to your opinion, but if you are basing it on this movie ""ruining"" your favorite childhood character, I wonder if you are missing the point. This is a reimagined Cruella. If you want to watch the spiral-eyed cartoon character, or Glen Close hitting the P's extra hard when she wants those ""PuPPies,"" go for it - I loved those films too. But those movie were really about the Dalmatians. This is a new story about a complicated woman who wears spectacular clothes and, as she points out, is also willing to wear the persona of a villain. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that a movie about someone who is pure evil just for the sake of being evil would be, quite frankly, a bore.

921,raven-11881,Cruella is simply brilliant!,10,4 September 2021,"But I'm getting ahead of myself. I have watched Cruella once in the cinema and already twice on Disney+ and am simply thrilled by this cinematic work of art. First of all: I don't know the original ""101 Dalmatians"", so I can't draw any comparisons to it. I am therefore completely unprejudiced as far as Cruella is concerned.The review is almost spoiler-free. The first paragraph recounts cliffhangers from the first 15 minutes.Estella ""Cruella"" is a young girl who, due to the loss of her mother, finds herself on the streets with some small-time crook boys her own age. From then on, she spends over ten years with the boys. But her dream since childhood is to become a fashion designer one day. Just when that door is open to her, her own past catches up with her....The story has been intriguingly and sensitively staged and offers quite a bit of variety. There is a healthy dash of humor, a lot of passion, a portion of tragedy and drama and many heartfelt moments. Chronologically, the film takes place from 1965 to 1975.But the film also knows how to convince in other places. It offers something for the eyes as well as for the ears. Visually, the film is extremely aesthetic and impressive. The backdrops are great designed and the costumes in the film absolutely stunning, and also the masks are really great. But also the background music is just perfect and fits perfectly with the film, the events and the time.Acting-wise, Cruella has been superbly cast. Emma Stone is an incredible actress, which she proved once again as Estella / Cruella. If there are no awards beckoning here. Emma Stone shows here very varied and is sometimes the cool and hard-boiled Cruella and on the other hand again the dear and warm and clumsy Estella. But also the supporting cast is very convincing with Emma Thompson as the cold-hearted Baroness, Mark Strong as her butler and Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser as Estella's best friends. All play their roles very convincingly and with passion. Of course, we can't forget dog Bobby as Buddy and dog Blueball as Wink. Simply great dogs!Cruella is the best movie of 2021 so far in my eyes and I can only highly recommend it to everyone. I can't wait to see it another time and hope that the movie will be available on Blu-Ray. It will definitely go into my collection then.10/10 points - High rewatch value",Cruella
922,burlanescuelena,amazing movie,10,7 June 2021,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The plot was well-written, the actors were amazing, the camera job was breathtaking, definitely recommend this. Enjoyed the scene at the end after the titles as well! Glad I stayed for that.",Cruella
923,sorinamgheorghe,Not too bad,7,13 June 2021,"I've started out with low expectations because honestly I was not interested in seeing a movie about a villain that ends up killing dogs for coats. Plus the trailer did not change my mind. But I ended up seeing it and all the time I was waiting the moment when a seemingly decent human turns so evil she could actually kill dogs. Which Disney writers chose to avoid at the last moment and keep Cruella as just a ""give them what they expect"" kind of character...
Decent movie, great music and pretty good acting.",Cruella

925,ysraelc,The Emmas were SUPERB. Both were deliciously evil ;D,10,30 May 2021,"I have to be honest, I never saw this movie in its animation format, but had the general idea of who the character was, and how it was perceived.IDC what the critics have said about this movie, it was well made, masterfully performed -as expected from two fantastic actresses-, and satisfyingly entertaining. Some said it wasn't necessary to be made, well, so it was the sucky remakes I've seen of other stories. I really enjoyed how the dark backstory of the character could've answered the questions about its persona, and not just guessing about it. The digital ""errors"" -I honest didn't see any-, were so imperceptible; that NO ONE w/o AN ACTUAL experience or knowledge of how to animate have a valid say. So, go on, and enjoy this movie👍",Cruella

What a great movie to start with!It's fun, it's fresh, it's different and beautifully made with great acting!I really only have 2 negatives and that is the wig in a few scenes and one scene at the end but the movie has so many positives that you can not fault them for the few negatives.Emma Stone..

928,puredeepcalm,Really Astounded,10,13 July 2021,"I'm actually in a little shock and also the same at various points during this movie......the depth, the creative vibrational rainbow of depth, feeling, taking a story and making it so full, so very full of aliveness....of story-ness. The quality of acting is just superb and Emma Stone - from her it's really an award winning character performance that mixes in with the best in the history of film....she basically fulfills the characters needs as an artistic creation fully and completely 100%....with both subtle and subtly outrageously measures of character portrayal in perfect timing with what is needed.....the whole full spectrum is there and alive, so alive because there's so much depth and the whole film is just the same in it's arguable perfection, so it all unifies as if in some beautiful symphony of art. And it is just that....art and art and art, from the set pieces to the costumes to the comedy, to the use of and timing of the music, to the script, to the directing.I'm just blown away and I don't write many reviews but I felt compelled to express my gratitude and feelings about the whole team that together made this wonderful art piece.As one example amidst the incredible spectrum of depth in the movie and Emma's as Cruella.....there's one point when she's by the fountain alone and she really almost was The Joker out of Batman....either Heath Ledger or Joaquin...that delicate insanity coming through that is truly fine acting. To bring that momentarily into the depth of Cruella's character is masterful, considering the whole feel of the rest of the movie.Thankyou to all the makers of the movie! It s a masterpiece.",Cruella
929,thelocalclub,Very flat movie,3,28 September 2021,"1. Actors are doing their best.2. Soundtrack, the set is perfect but feels like the person who was selecting it just randomly squeeze good tracks in totally random moments. Does not work that way.3. Costumes? Yeh, fine, but after 30 minutes you get used to it and simply do not pay attention.4. Screenplay, thanks but no go. Have you ever seen angry dalmatian?

And then for the first time, i see a gay man (not the trans) exciting (not the sexual part, i'm fking straight here). Well they are good, funny, fabulous, and.... just like us.

I think this aspect absolutely Oscar-worthy, no doubt.The story itself is so Disney-ish and ehm, well, kinda predictable. It's a bit overlong too, especially the first act. I liked the dark theme of this movie, its remind me of Joker, well, Joker a la Disney haha.Two Oscars winners, Emma Stone and Emma Thompson was really bring this movie into high level of performance.

947,marshalldbonner,Doesn't do what it needed to do,7,27 June 2021,Emma Stones performance was great and if it was a standalone movie it would be great but it needed to meet certain requirements and it simply didn't. There is no explanation for why she wants to skin Dalmatians considering she had the chance and chose not to. She said at the beginning of the movie while she was a child that she hated matching and that is most of her fashion as Cruella. Also by the end of the movie you still feel putty for her and want her to win which is the opposite of what a villain movie should do. Finally why would she gift Dalmatians to people that helped her and then try to skin them a few years later.,Cruella
948,verawbrauer,Very pleasantly surprised,8,14 June 2021,"I'm gonna be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Emma Stone and especially not her with an English accent... But, god! This movie was great!Cruella was very predictable, but I thought it added that special charm to the movie. The plot itself was okay, though it was the music, the clothes (and make up) and the acting that completely made the movie. I was very surprised from the beginning of the story, it felt like a more family-friendly (and funnier) version of Joker. I'm a huge fan of 101 Dalmatians and honestly had high-expectations, and it didn't disappoint. I loved how it stayed true to that movie, although this is a completely different story!I loved all the side-characters, they were just as good, if not better, than Estella/Cruella, and everything was well-planned out and well-written. So many cool details and twists, and I love the good representation.I'd love to go even more into details, as there were certain things that could've been better, but I want this to be available for everyone who hasn't seen it as well.

I didn't watch any trailers but I did glimpse at some favorable reviews shortly before going to see it, so I was hopeful that it would be good. It did not disappoint. It was really interesting to see the origins of Cruella, having not known much about her before. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson were fun to watch, and it was fun to watch Emma Stone transform into Cruella. It did feel similar to watching a movie about The Joker, in a good way. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the plot was great too. Just an all around fun, interesting big screen experience. I recommend it.",Cruella

959,rosemarrym,What a great print,7,6 June 2021,"Very excellent with the recreation of new ideas that was hidden behind this character, and stunning performance from Emma Stone. Costumes should definitely win some awards, however they were displayed very fast and shifted fast, i think the costumes deserved longer shots.",Cruella
960,sandro-08247,We expect better disney,7,10 June 2021,"Honestly, other than the shaky rivalry between the two main characters, the movie was pretty good. The thing which does make the movie worse though, is that this movie doesn't show cruella. It shows a girl with some personal problems who is really good at fashion. Had this not been named cruella, this movie would be a stellar 8. The problem is, with this being cruella, different things are expected. Some people are more inclined to do evil than others. The person shown in this movie wasn't one of them, and that is the problem.Even if you've only heard the cruella theme song, you'll already know, that she is evil, ruthless. Those adjectives cannot be connected to the person portrayed in this movie. I mean, she doesn't even kill anyone! Her rival would have had a more appropriate character for that.There is a silver lining however, the acting was awesome, as were the clothes. The dogs were the only thing which bothered me, they were just too fake.I would recommend this movie simply because of the nice fashion and the character interactions,",Cruella
961,miaeli,Not as depressing or dramatic as the trailer portrayed,8,14 June 2021,"This movie turned out to be interesting to watch and not as depressing, dark, or dramatic like the movie trailer portrayed. Emma Stone did an excellent job in the title role. I especially love the scenes of her crashing her boss's entrance in various outrageous manners that is quite a sight to behold. There is a plot twist towards the middle to end of the movie that will surprise you. I read somewhere that Cruella had a boyfriend in the band which was not shown in this movie, but there was a band playing scene. After the band playing scene her childhood friends were seen walking away unfriending Cruella which I didn't understand why; something about her making new friends or being another person. The movie didn't elaborate on this so it was confusing what led to this. Other than that this movie was worth watching.",Cruella
962,bekyzander,Impeccable soundtrack,8,10 September 2021,I loved this movie so much. The storyline showed a great other side of Cruella. Emma Stone perfectly performed the Cruella hunch paired with her elegant stride while adding the perfect Cruella laugh to the mix.On top of the great production of this movie the soundtrack was just impeccable and just brought everything together.,Cruella
963,faroebaldur,stop this madness,1,20 September 2021,"STOP, STOP STOP trying to make villains into misunderstood victims in Disney live action adaptations. I would just say stop trying to make animated classics into live action films but since they are not going to do that , leave villains as baddies. Literally no one on earth wanted a cruella redemption or apology tour, she was evil , she wanted to wear puppie suits.That said on to movie, Emma Stone is charismatic but not much to work with here, script, dialog and story are meh at best , here is a thought do not hire perky pretty actresses as villains doe not seem to work , Even when trying to look deranged and angry Stone still looks great like a hot chick trying to look angry, Robbie had same issue as Harlequin , just doesn't work ./Avoid this movie, wait til its free on a streaming service.",Cruella

965,camille-18008,It was great,9,5 September 2021,"Not gonna lie, I came in with very low expectations and it turned out to be 95% better than I thought. We got a whole backstory for Cruella, who, to me, used to be some evil, dog-killing weirdo but at the end of the movie she was a still an evil dog-killing weirdo but with a touching backstory (she's a still terrible person). The fashion and soundtrack were OUTSTANDING. Emma Stone is an amazing actress. From Easy-A to ZombieLand, has she ever underperformed ? Probably, but in this movie she was amazing. I'm not sure what point I'm trying to make right now but go watch that movie it's worth it and you don't even have to root for Cruella at the end because that's not the point. It's hard to believe it's a Disney movie.",Cruella

There is no question about that it was a top notch production. While you may be concerned over the length of the movie, the storyline moves wel.I would actually see this again! Well done Emma Stone! Well done Emma Thompson who by the way not only pulled off being a great antagonist but looks awesome.Well worth my annual subscription.

It just made my day. What a wonderful surprise.",Cruella
973,lelya_fantastka,"Never think, let be entertained and you like it",6,20 August 2021,"Last weekend we watched a new Disney movie about the main villain of ""100 Dalmatians"" Cruella Devil and knew at last what has encouraged her hating dogs especially dalmatians.Unfortunately, it was the only useful information from this movie but first things first.I faced with ""Cruella"" trailer accidently far weeks before the official release and liked it for the bright picture, easily recognized music, and my adorable, love, unforgettable Emma Stone in the title role. In addition to her equally famous and beloved Emma Thomson in the role of awesome baroness, and the ticket was purchased.At first sight the movie is not so bad how the most viewers and critics point out in the reviews. But the main idea to sort out to yourself why did you come to the cinema. This movie is just entertaining the public, diverting it from the covid, economic and other troubles. It doesn't bring any reasonable or logic thought. It is only entertaining movie!The movie is striking by the fantastic, incredible, dazzling costumes, the work of the costume designers was completed at the high level. You can't take your eyes off the innumerable dresses, hats, skirts, and other beautiful things there are no in your wardrobe. And that is one reason why you can go and watch this movie. The second is a strong duet Emma Stone - Emma Thomson. Last time I watched Emma Thomson in ""Nanny McPhee"" and Harry Potter. These are her roles - The arrogant Baroness, queer nanny, homeless prophet, she is a peculiar actress and she looks good in such roles. Her opposite at the first glance is young and talented and a little bit crazy Emma Stone who blames yourself for her mother's death. What a naive girl! She really doesn't know who is her mummy. I like how Emma Stone could transfer the difference between naïve, young, talented and unlucky orphan Estella and stylish, confident, breath-taking, ambitious Cruella, how her acting game has been changing from shot to shot. And that should be curious for the attentive audience.There is no profound thought in this movie except may be trying not to betray your friends or any people with whom you began your climbing to the mountain. Screenwriters show us the story of friendship, when you are accepted despite your weird look and strange behavior, when you haven't a family but you have a true and faithful friend.I agree that music is cliched and on-the-nose like some people wrote in the review, but that is a great music, famous hit singles, your ears are having a rest just listening these inspired notes.As a resume. If you prefer to provide more than 2 hours being entertained in all possible ways, watching at the same time the criminal drama, family story, fashion police, action movie with chases and minor mischief, hearing the most famous single of the modernity, and looking at stylish picture- you are welcome to ""Cruella"" world.",Cruella

It's entertaining. It's great!Sure, it riffs on The Devil Wears Prada. No surprise that, since Prada was riffing on the original 101 Dalmatians' Cruella in the first place. And, yes, there's a certain fairness to comparisons to Harley Quinn. But like the twisted Miss Quinn, crazy can be fun if you just give in to it.And yes, from a certain perspective it's a bit cartoonish. But hey, that shouldn't be surprising either. Cruella DeVil was born of ink and paint. But, like Pennyworth, it does an admirable job of straddling a fine line between it's roots and the obvious goal of origin stories to take a 2-dimensional character into the almost-real world of conflicted emotions and motivations.At any rate, it's really well crafted. The story line is great. The script excellent. The casting couldn't be more perfect. The performances superb, across the board. The soundtrack is fantastic. And, yes, even the fashions wholly believable, to both this fashion illiterate and the more design-critical eye of my wife.For entertainment value alone, it's a sold 10 worth getting lost in for a couple of hours of pure fun.",Cruella

989,schoolsdm1,The best Disney+ originals can offer,7,29 August 2021,"The poor reviews here are awfully misguided. This was a creative twist on a classic children's cartoon movie that delivered a decadent dark origin story on a female villain and Emma Stone was fabulously spot on (see what I did there). Not only was it surprisingly original, it was fascinating to experience an anti hero rags to riches story about someone we all recognize but know little about. Well done all around. The only reason I give it a seven and not an eight (and it would have been a 7.5 if IMDb allowed for partial ratings) was the CGI of the dogs, the terrible acting of Horace, and the almost total disconnection from the 101 Dalmatians story.Overall, this Disney film was like trying vegan cuisine and finding it to be one of the best and most tasty dishes vegan cuisine can offer. That said, it was still vegan.",Cruella
990,mariana-tsak,Story made no sense,4,11 June 2021,A famous designer who wanted to kill her own daughter with what excuse?? Her narsicism?? It really made no sense and never any good explanation was ever given. A Cruella who is bad or good?? Not even the scriptwriter can decide and we never understood why she would ever want to kill the Dalmatian dogs as she appears not wanting to hurt them directly and she seems to love the dogs in general. In the beginning the story was enjoyable to watch but later seemed rediculus they could give so much debth in Cruella's mother character but they never did. Such a waste i hope to make a bettt storyline for Ursula in little mermaid at least.,Cruella

992,billycaa,Completely surpassed my expectations,10,13 September 2021,"I have to say I'm really not a fan of the plague of live action disney remakes that have been flooding movie theatres for the past 10 years. It was cute when tim burton decided to remake alice in wonderland.. by the time every disney movie had AT LEAST one live action remake.. well lets just say Disneys complete lack of originality is starting to show. Anyway, i am actually a big emma stone fan, have been for many years, so when my friend told me she was dying to watch the new cruella movie, i thought 'well its emma stone playing an iconic disney villain, how unbearable can it really be.' I saw it in theatres and I just have to say it's been a long time since I enjoyed a movie in theatres this much. I was completely blown away. Everything about this movie works so well. A few highlights to me were the soundtrack, and the characters. Emma Thompsons' baroness was a major highlight in this. Thompson is just so funny in the role, playing a deliciously evil cruella-esque character, i loved it!! Also the side characters - Jasper and Horace. Normally I really don't appreciate the annoying, unfunny, unlikeable 'side characters that are there to make childish unfunny jokes for the sake of comic relief' but these characters were one of my favourite parts of the movie. They were both a) actually funny and b) not annoying, and actually contributed to the film and story. I have to say I'm actually excited for the sequel, which is something I can't believe I would say, but I just can't wait to see these characters again, and i love craig as a director so much, I am so excited to see where he takes this story next. Highly recommend this movie!",Cruella

I've watched this movie three times as it is just so entertaining and amazingly brilliant. And each time Emma Thompson just keeps getting better.Emma Thompson steels the show with a performance that seems to combine two of the greatest Ruthless Women Characters ever to grace the silver screen, into on one brilliant performance the likes of which may never be matched again. I'm talking about Gloria Swanson's role in Sunset Boulevard and Meryl Steep's performance in The Devil Wears Prada. Now you can add, Emma Thompson as the Baroness.The on-screen chemistry by the cast brings a whole new level for Disney movies, and the two Emma's are a tour de force. Even the closing credits of this Ruckus Affair are a work of art.The writing and script are more than on point, and its abundantly clear a lot of time and thought has gone into to every word and scene. Great Direction and a killer supporting cast are the cherry on top. I'll be watching this movie for years to come.",Cruella

And if you're in the mood for watching a ""Disney villain has tragic backstory"" but done well AND with love, I'd recommend Starkid's Twisted, which is on YouTube.

The girl at the beginning who plays young Estella (Cruella) is really good, however I wasn't sure if I was gonna love the movie until I saw Emma Stone. When she came in, she brought such great depth and life to her character. She is such a wonderful actress.

When I saw the trailer I was afraid that this would be a bad movie but I'm happy to say it's a good-to-watch movie.A young girl with a bit of an extreme side wants to become a fashion designer. After an unfortunate event she has to grow up as an orphan. She finds some friends with who she mischievously survives. In London she got a job in the Barones her fashion house. Who she starts designing for. What comes next can be described in the words of Estella AKA Cruella: ""Don't worry, there's lots more bad things coming."".The protagonist and her nemesis are constantly competing each other in a fun kind of way. Both Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are putting up a compelling act. Even though this is a Disney movie, it's not see through. Cruella her story is unexpected, there are a lot of surprises and the movie is funny as it is!The movie lacks a bit of a general public point of view; bad behaviour is, what it seems to be, the new black.

It has all that it needs: comedy, drama, emotional parts and a twist! It gave me harley quinn-joker vibes in some moments, and for sure it's a darker adaptation made my Disney, witch i really like!Emma Stone gave a really good performance as cruella, it made me feel the pain and trauma of the character, and i really loved her transformation from the beginning to the end.Emma Thompson, what a great actress! The Baroness was one of the greatest live action villains, Emma played the role so good that it made me hate the character. She is truly evil and magnificent.The Script is amazing, an original story of the beloved villain from the 101 dalmatians animated film. It paid tribute to the amazing Glenn Close, who played cruella for the first time in the live action version of 101 dalmatians. The costumes were stunning, if you are a fashion fan, you're gonna love this! The soundtrack- just amazing, i have no words, rock and instrumental music, this is great!From the beginning of the film, it introduces you to the life of young estella, that slowly transform into the villan Cruella, and you feel that transformation through the film.Jasper and Horace are really fun, and they are the only family that cruella has, and yes, she was kinda boss-style with them from time to time but their connection was really emotional and amazing. Cruella didn't really hates dalmatians by the end of the film, but it showed us a glimpse of why she doesn't like them and she says they will make a good coat and that line was amazing. But for now she doesn't have intentions to make coats from puppies.This film also includes anita darling and roger, before they married, and they both knew cruella. Anita helps cruella through the film and stay after the credit for an amazing scene.This movie was a masterpiece with a clever story, familiar and new characters (the baroness, artie), great performances and cinematic experience!

1011,bmau-18781,What a surprise ! wow !!,10,2 June 2021,"I will try to paint a picture without spoiling - darling.The movie starts off sort or rustic, with a sad mellow tone and honestly makes you wonder how the movie is going to reach what you think. Im not saying it's bad.. quite the opposite. The main character plays a subdued underdog for most of the movie and then adopts a new persona, an act - but quickly realises she has it wrong.. she has been living the act and the persona is the real her. The movie has so many twists and terns with the main character adopting a very much ""Penny Dreadful"" personality. In fact she pulls that off so well I really had to think back to who the original actor in Penny dreadful really was.Due to some rubbish reviews in the msm, I was expecting this movie to flop and was waiting for that shoe to drop.. you know where the ending fizzles out like bad.. well you know what I mean. But it never came.. The movie was Fabulously fantastic and left me reeling gleeful tears at the ending - a perfect poetic justice.So I did not spoil it for you rather.. teased you a little. So here is a little advice.. Watch this in 4K because the visuals demand it. If you are tempted to get a lower res version.. don't do it. You will regret it forever and need to watch it AGAIN in 4K and well.. it wont be the same. And yes.. I demand you watch this fabulous movie.",Cruella

1014,cecovics,Could have been better.,6,3 June 2021,"I'll keep it short and sweet. In my opinions, this movie would have worked best as an artsy film. Cruella both as a concept and as a character is an incredibly artsy and deep person, and this movie just barely scratches the surface of what she could have been. I think the movie should have been made with a PG13 (or even 16) rating, to really show how messed up Cruella becomes (blowing shit up, actually KILLING those dalmatians, maybe even people). She's described as a crazy, maniacal person, but all she does throughout the movie is ""Tee hee, I pranked you good! Buahahahaha!"". Its super corny and it could have been a lot better. That being sad, there were still some clever ideas in it. The costume design is great, the sets too.

Natalie OWhat did you think of the movie?It's incredibly fun to watch especially the first hour because of the fashion, soundtrack and two Emmas. Emma Stone's accent is a bit fake-British but that's a small thing. However, what brings the film down is the plot, or lack there of. It's like they just kept doing the same scenes but changed the costumes.

2. She will have killed the Dalmatians, turn evil, take revenge for her mother by killing the Baronesse and become evil.

1026,cmoskito,Gives me hope as a writer.,5,3 June 2021,"If Disney, a multi-billion dollar corporation, can release a script this bad, it gives me hope that maybe I can write a script one day. This movie has incredible effects, acting, even editing, all of which is completely brought down by a script worthy of a kindergartener. Let's go over the good stuff.Emma Stone, as always, is a treasure. She just doesn't miss. Nicholas Britell's score was good, if a bit understated at times. When you have as much money as Disney, good effects come as an expectation, but it's still nice to see a movie that looks well done. I'll say that the cinematography is nothing unique, but the color palette and lighting were good, and makes it look better than average.But like I said, the script tears down any success this movie had in my mind. The script wildly goes back and forth between literally nonsensical and cliched to the point that I literally laughed out loud in the theatre (on the emotional parts, keep in mind). I will say that this movie was a far cry from 'easy to write'. How do you justify Cruella de Vil? How do you make an audience connect to a character who's goal in the original movie is 'skin puppies'? Unfortunately, this movie addresses none of that. In order to set up her hatred of Dalmatians, they use literally the cheapest tactics known to screenwriting, and it's just annoying at this point. Without getting into spoilers, just know that this movie uses 5 of the most cliched and overused tropes in Disney movies. And this is not a movie about Cruella de Vil. By the end of the movie, Cruella is nowhere near where she is in 101 Dalmatians, and it bothers me.I don't like it when movies fail, even when I have literally no expectations for them. I want and love to be surprised by movies, but when there's a problem so glaringly obvious, especially with a company as big as Disney, it's hard to look past. Watching Cruella reminds me of watching Wonder Woman 1984. Patty Jenkins is an extremely competent writer/director, so it was shocking to see a script as bad and disjointed as WW84. Disney has had so much success, and they can afford quality control on their films, so it's always a surprise that they let this kind of stuff get past.TL;DR: This movie is well executed, but the script is terrible. The writing is cliched beyond belief, and at times just doesn't make sense.",Cruella

It starts out as every other Disney princess movie
Turns into
Devil Wears Prada.Then ""Oceans 11""
Then ""she's all that"" (with no love interest)
Then ""the Italian job""
Then ends as a Disney princess movie with a ""twist"" where she's not a princess, just a baroness.Don't get me wrong Ema Stone did great... but it wasn't Cruella De Vil... the writers just used the name for a pop reference.The movie was about an Angry little girl that grows up, gets revenge and takes over.

Yet, I understand why many people is beyond disappointed with the movie. The writers and the directors decided to follow a different path regarding her original character. Thus, if you're a huge fan of Cruella's character in 101 Dalmataians, you'll find this movie quite illogical and boring.I enjoyed the movie so much because I never liked 101 Dalmatians and Cruella isn't my fav Disney villain, therefore, it was easy for me to watch it as an ""independent film."" It might sound crazy and even stupid but if you detach her character from the original film, you might end up liking the movie.I think you should give it a try cause is not the worst film you'll ever watch in your entire life, but before you pay 30 box keep in mind that: THE MOVIE BARELY RELATES CRUELLA TO HER ORIGINAL CHARACTER IN 101 DALMATIANS.",Cruella

This movie has similar elements to a Disney take on devil wears Prada, but not too much. The plot kept me on my toes the whole time and had shocking twists. Horace was hilarious. Loved Artie's character too. Wink the dog was a favorite as well, so cute and played an integral role in the film!! Loved all the dogs in the movie. The costumes in this movie were show stopping as well. The team who designed them is genius and SO creative. The soundtrack was a masterpiece, loved all the 70s classics.

If you took away her name, and I guess her two-toned hair, nothing about this story is reminiscent of Cruella. The whole movie is extremely cringe, especially her transition into Cruella as well as her mother's ridiculous death. They're really out there making dogs the villains in this. And then the death of ""Estella."" dear lord. Honestly, a team of animators in the 70s did a better job, and I'm sure their budget was significantly lower. This movie was too focused on fashion/costumes, CGI dogs, and their soundtrack, to actually write a decent movie. If it was for kids, fine. But remember this is for 13+. Overall it was just worse than I imagined.",Cruella
1033,goldenkirby,Great movie but...,7,30 May 2021,"Cruella is a great movie, probably a type of movie you would even rewatch. It truly does bring in who Cruella is for 101 Dalmatians, but there is one problem a lot of people are talking about and is very apparent. The CGI, especially in 2021, is bad to today's standards. The CGI wasn't good, where the dogs at the beginning felt sloppy and the CGI at the end felt uncomfortable. The scene where Estella supposedly dies but she lands in the water to be saved by Horace, the CGI was sloppy there. We get it, you can't really make dogs push somebody over the edge, but if you are going to use CGI, do it right. Especially for Disney, this was bad CGI. Everything else was fine. The jokes are fine, the writing is good, the acting is nice, and costume design is... questionable. However costume design of the items really doesn't matter in the case that Cruella was an exotic fashion designer. To get to the antagonist, the Baroness, there is a lot of good and bad to say about her. For starters, she isn't too intimidating as the antagonist. Yes, she almost burns Cruella up in a fire, she killed the mother, she killed Estella. She has the power to do that, but she isn't intimidating. For a fashion designer as an antagonist, its a bit of a pass. But, they did a nice job on making Estella a character, so there is a bit of leeway. But personally, the soundtrack slapped. Excellent choices for songs, especially Sympathy For The Devil by the favorite Rolling Stones, or Come Together by The Beatles. Great choices all around. I am a classic rock fan so I naturally liked these, but I hope other people that are a different genre fans will enjoy what they gave throughout the movie. And yes, while I said the CGI was bad, the effects were fine. The CGI specifically or places where you can just tell it is a green screen, that is where the editing went and jumped off a cliff. Overall, the movie is fine to watch, but please, Disney, fix your CGI.",Cruella

1043,kzcfwv,Rich plot,8,11 August 2021,This film is very satisfying to get to the end of; so many twists and turns in the story but by the end it is all cleverly tied up and pays homage to the original animation right at the very end which was a very sweet touch. The costumes were exquisite from all of the characters. The young actors at the beginning of the film were very impressive (with Disney films they're always sweet but have a tendency to be too sweet and become inauthentic) and just as exciting to watch as the adults! The soundtrack really adds to the film too!This film is appropriate for children and adults of all genders but I thought some bits would be scary for younger children!,Cruella

Emma Stone is beyond greatness.,8,7 June 2021,"Wasn't really expecting anything because of Disney, but this movie actually is very good, and Emma Stone is the best actress in the world right now, no doubt at all; she's easily the main reason this movie is great. Yes, it has the vibe of The devil's wears Prada, but the production of this movie is in another level and the costumes and dresses are awesome.",Cruella
1052,luke-andersun,A lot better than expected...,7,29 May 2021,"Cruella de Vil...My expectations were drastically low for this film. I've hated almost every live-action that has come out ... but I was by myself on a Friday night during COVID, and the trailers intrigued me. What else was I going to do?I was pleasantly surprised. I would say that about 3/5 of this movie hits the mark, with the remaining 2/5 being lame and unnecessary. Mainly the first 15 min of the movie - it went on too long when it should have been a 5 minute prologue - but I also understand why they did it. I did feel like this movie, after all, is supposed to appeal to children. And then shortly after the ""fountain scene"" until the end, I felt like the movie went downhill. All in all though, that 3/5 of the movie was highly enjoyable to me.The acting itself is pretty remarkable - Emma Stone and Emma Thompson absolutely nail their roles in this as Cruella and The Barronness, respectively. The rest of the acting from the supporting cast is also pretty great. Though I wish Roger and Anita had more pivotal roles - more involved in the story.The aesthetic is superb. They really had the entire 'tone' of the movie down to a science. Wasn't too much a fan of the music, but that was entirely the way they edited most of it into the movie. Felt out of place at times; if they let some scenes play out with some overly loud music, it would have been a lot more cohesive from an editing perspective ... just my opinion.Judging by the reviews, I already know that this is a movie you either love or hate. If you like campy, over-the-top acting, fashion, and plot, you will probably love this. If you are looking for something more subtle, very few scenes of this movie have that element and it would be better to save your money/time.The movie felt like a mix of Devil Wears Prada, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and The Dark Knight Rises - acting, plot, set design, tone, etc - all of it. And for the people complaining about the CGI ... I agree that it looks weird ... but it really doesn't ruin the movie at all.My final comment about this film is that I'd be happier with a villain who is villainous because they are an evil/bad person from the start. Cruella somewhat acknowledges this, but I feel like too much of this film has changed the fundamental tenets that made 'Cruella' a villain in the first place. I do understand the need/desire to do this ... but I do think that we can let villains remain evil without trying to humanise them...No Dalmatians were harmed in the writing of this review.",Cruella

It's just people hungry for something decent.It's seems that very average movie will get top mark this day's.Characters empty and boring. No intrigue or surprise.

It was clever and funny but not violent enough that kids could also enjoy it too. And it had a very clever story ark. After reading all the 1/2 star reviews I'm really struggling to see what exactly they were wanting from this movie. For me it delivered on all angles. Disney back to its roots. Hell.

1076,matthewdedwards,Falls flat,3,30 August 2021,"The problem for this movie is how do you create an origin story for a character who is pure evil? Indeed, do we need or want an origin story for such a character? In the Dalmatian movies, Cruella is a psychopath who makes coats out of dogs, she isn't a character who can have a sympathetic backstory to explain who she is. That problem is the gaping hole at the middle of this film. For the first half of the movie, Estella/Cruella mooches about disguised as Zooey Deschanel in a remake of The Devil Wears Prada, her driving motivation being the death of her mother and her morphing into full on Cruella is explained by discovering who was behind her mother's death. That was fine in itself, indeed for a while I thought this was a re-boot of the character, rather than a prequel, which would have made this a better film.But just as you think the movie is reaching its climax, they throw in a whole other story line about Cruella's true parentage. It's as if the writers had two ideas about this movie and rather than choose one, decided to use both. The problem is, the ""real mother"" storyline is thrown in for no good reason, other than to extend the runtime by 45 minutes longer than is necessary or welcome. From that point on you're just left waiting for the thing to end. Even worse, by the end of this movie, it has failed to really explain how the Cruella we know really came to be, the character we're left with isn't quite the psychopath of the original- other, that is, than the bizarre revelation that she gifts the two dalmatians, whose puppies she will come back to steal and make into her coat, which seems a rather strange and complicated plot. Maybe they're intending a sequel to this prequel, explaining how she evolves into the monster we know.",Cruella

1078,apriloish,Cruella Spoiler Free Review,7,7 June 2021,"There will be two types of people with this movie. Those who will judge it for what it should be and those who judge it for what it is. This movie isn't really a Cruella movie about the 101 Dalmatians villain character. This movie just like the Maleficent film takes the character and some ideas from the film its based on and throws in call backs while simply doing its own thing. In this universe, Cruella is simply a misunderstood anti-hero Punk Girl with Horace and Jasper as her partners in crime like her own adopted brothers instead of people she just beat up and ordered around. If you can separate this movie from the animated film, it's a fine, good 7 out of 10 standalone movie. But if you have to judge it as a real adaptation of the source material than it's mediocre to bad adaptation of the villain character because it simply has little to nothing to do with said villain. This movie is really just a film that takes place in the 6os about a slightly crazy but lovable cool Punk Rock chick played by Emma Stone, nothing more and nothing less. I chose to see the film for the movie it is instead of what it should have been and for that it's a fine solid harmless movie that is an easy 7 out of 1o.",Cruella

Cruella is taken from the merciless puppy killer that she was in the 60s to a plucky antihero who feels like a pale imitation of the iconic fashionista fatale. If you were to tell me that Emma Thompson's character was actually supposed to be the Cruella de Vil of the movie and Emma Stone was her understudy, I would be inclined to believe you. It's yet another example of Disney not allowing its villains to truly descend into ""evil"" territory and instead leaving them to wade in the waters of the misunderstood.",Cruella

1100,Masterzat,A sensational heist film,8,7 June 2021,At first I was worried about Emma Stone playing Cruella de Vil. I just felt that the character of Cruela was too sensational for an actress that made her career off of playing down to earth characters. Disney has proved me wrong however and I'm glad to report that Emma Stone pulls off the sensational and over the top attitude of Cruela de Vil extremely well. Now it's even hard to imagine who could play Cruela better than Emma Stone did. It wasn't only Mrs. Stone who rocked the role either while Cruella's two henchmen who were played by Joel Fry and Paul Walter Houser were surprisingly entertaining and well written. With the great performances and the plot of a nice breezy fashion/heist film I would highly recommend it for anyone who's looking for a good popcorn film. If you're looking for this film to be some deep character study like Joker then this film probably won't be for you.,Cruella
1101,roroh-84511,Absolutely phenomenal.,10,31 May 2021,"""Cruella"" is a truly magnificent film. I personally think that this movie is a perfect combination of incredible acting and beautiful screenwriting. In fact, each cast member executed him/her role wonderfully, wether it was Emma Stone, Emma Thompson, Joel Fry, Mark Strong, etc...Bringing such an iconic character to life and adding a twist on it was a great option to act upon... it really implanted an unforgettable memory of a unique storyline involving a Disney classic. I have nothing else to say except that 2021's ""Cruella"" is one of the best movies of the year, in which I dearly recommend all of you to watch this legendary film as soon as possible!!",Cruella

1105,ashleylynn-73080,Good movie for 101 fans- but it definitely had issues..,7,11 July 2021,"It was a good movie, and I enjoyed it, but there were a lot of things that didn't add up, and the CGI was almost laughable. If this was supposed to be a prequel to the 1996 film, they did a dreadful job. Anita and Roger had the wrong careers, they were the wrong race (what was that about?! Jasper too), and Anita and Cruella's relationship was completely off. Why make such drastic unnecessary changes?! The entire movie would have been exactly the same without Roger and Anita's characters, so what was the point of even adding them? Also, why in the world did Disney find it necessary to make the Dalmatians CGI in 95% of the film?! They looked horrible, cartoonish, and moved more so like lions than large dogs. It completely threw me off for the whole movie.In the movie Anita and Roger are friends with Cruella... so why the hell would she want to turn around and kidnap and murder her friends dogs to make a coat out of them some 10 years down the road?! Biggest plot hole and almost ruined the movie. For the 5 years they had to make this movie they could have done a much better job. But I would say it's worth the watch for sure.",Cruella

I never expected to see what was just pure brilliance. The film is predominantly for adults, its dark humour is pitch perfect, the story is captivating, and the performances are sharper than a pin!The back story of Cruella is a well considered epic and if the intention was to entertain and laugh and be drawn into the fantasy world, then this hits the mark. The costumes are incredible and Emma Stone is just lovingly scary.Already planning on watching it again.",Cruella

The midpoint stayed stagnant for a while and what came after was unrealistic and ridiculous. The most absurd thing is the disguise. It's like an old Chinese movie that characters can just change the cloth and hairstyle and expect people not to notice. Nevertheless, I got through it with a satisfying ending.",Cruella
1111,adzbell,The best live action Disney yet!,9,1 September 2021,Cruella is written fabulously having watched it on Disney+ I can say Dolby Vision really brings this film to life the story his fantastic the twists and turns can be unexpected the only negative thing I have to say about this movie is the CGI could have been a little better but overall a smashing movie!,Cruella
1112,reviews4musicals,I have waited 5 years for this film and wow!,7,27 May 2021,"It has been 5 years since I first heard of this movie and I lost my head, expecting a Maleficent remake with my favourite villain ever. I was so excited and went in with high expectations hoping for the best and to be honest, I was surprised despite a few small things I picked up. I know the reviews have been hit and miss so far but this one really did it for me. The costumes were amazing, a real stand out, along with the sets and the music as well (all definitely Oscar worthy). The acting was spectacular, particularly from Thompson who made a fabulously hideous monster out of the Baroness. Stone's portrayal of the famous Cruella De Vil was brilliantly exhibited, and many of her scenes (particularly the fountain scene near the end) were my favourites in the film. However, two things in particular stood out for me. Firstly, I believed this film was supposed to be a prequel to Glenn Close's portrayal of the classic villain. However, many things did not match up between the two films. The timeline was screwed, Anita and Jasper's race, Anita and Rodger's professions, Anita's relationship with Cruella. Basically all of Anita as a character did not correspond with the 1996 film and the character even being named ""Anita Darling"" was unnecessary. She was a smaller role and definitely could have been a side character, but not so small that this didn't stand out for me. Also, the graphics in this film were wonderful (the fire and dogs particularly). However, the ocean waves toward the end were possibly the worst examples of computer animation I have ever seen. This was a real letdown for me and almost ruined the end. However, the film is so wonderfully written and engagingly eventful, no one should let any of these faults ruin the experience for them. Cruella is a brilliant film, and should definitely be praised as one of Disney's better live action movies.",Cruella

I feel like her backstory was such an obvious choice that is really unoriginal and doesn't quite fit the character. I mean, what's fun about Cruella is that she's just... well... cruel. And in this movie her backstory was chosen for people to sympathize with her, so they ended up erasing the coolest thing about this character which is exactly in the fact that she's not sympathetic. That's why people like her, because she's such a good villain and that is due to the fact that she is just bad.(And I didn't really like Emma Stone as Cruella)On the bright side, the movie is visually appealing because it's so dark (unusual for Disney) with a different aesthetic and the fashion is obviously very on point.",Cruella

I had no idea how amazing it would be.The storyline is so gripping, and perfect for those who remember little about the original film (like myself) and those who do will be able to spot the little details referencing 101 Dalmatians. The acting by Emma Thompson and Emma Stone is phenomenal and they play the characters so perfectly. Emma Stone plays the beautifully mad and fabulous Cruella perfectly. The music is so iconic and fits the film so well.Now, the fashion and makeup. These were incredible, award worthy works of art. Cruella is a very fashionable woman, and the film centers around the theme of fashion design competitiveness, so of course the fashion is beautiful. Every look is so perfect and incredible, and pairs so well with the makeup used.Clearly you can tell how much I adored this film, and I'm sure you will too. If you think it's the traditional fairytale-style Disney film that's all pretty and dainty, you'd be wrong. It is so different to any Disney film you've seen, with the quality and brilliance of a Disney film. A must watch.",Cruella

I don't care if it doesn't align perfectly with the original or whatever everyone is complaining about. Also, it's supposed to be a funny, captivating movie, not war and peace, and not the most amazing thing ever. It's just a really good film, and Emma was amazing.",Cruella

atleast one death. Possibly like ""Sherlok Holmes, a game of shadows"" but both die. But I guess Disney needs to keep it family friendly.",Cruella

So I watched this movie with low expectations and I guess that's what made me like it. It's kinda dark and very different from other live action Disney movies.So the performances in my opinion are pretty good. Both Emmas give great performances. But there are a few things I thought were a little added and unnecessary. I won't say what but just some of it is pretty awkward and funny. The plot and twists are amazingly well and goodly paced. The one last problem is that maybe it overuses song choices especially in the first act. Overall a solid film and highly recommend watching it.",Cruella

I believe that all men are born good and that goodness can be cultivated plus nurtured. In this day of age, we need to have the power from within us to nurture the goodness to prevail over evil.

The costumes were very well done.3. For once, there wasn't any political agenda.4. Disney always includes a message in their movies but this time it was actually subliminal instead of the focal point. As the aforementioned states, it also wasn't political which is a big plus.5. There was a point in the movie that I like to call a ""false ending"" where they leave room for a sequel but instead of ending the movie, it keeps going to the next chapter. It makes the movie feel like a long one but in a good way.These are all attributes of an excellent movie and my faith is Disney has been restored because of it.",Cruella

1147,cocolouisejones,"Dark, honest and modern",10,30 May 2021,"In a modern telling of a villain's backstory, there isn't another movie of its sort that could compare to Cruella.Forget what you already know about Cruella DeVil and prepare to learn the dark, dirty, brutal truth. Those Dalmations? Not as innocent as you might care to believe.No other actress in this generation is fit to play Cruella like Emma Stone. She truly embodies her role by making her enviable, pitied, and adored.Playing opposite Emma Stone is the every incredible Emma Thompson, who takes every role she plays to the next level, and in this telling of Cruella's backstory she does another fantastic job. Between the two Emma's they make it hard to remember that they're two of the most likeable actresses in the industry.Aside from the wonderful leads, the entire film is shot beautifully. It really is one of the most visually stunning films released in a while. Both the cinematography and costumes are worthy of recognition by the awarding bodies for this beautiful piece of work.If you haven't already seen the movie, I highly recommend it.

1153,scarletdavies-11972,Annoyingly adequate in most aspects...,5,28 June 2021,"For a villain story- the sort of film where you can bend the rules slightly, even as a children's Disney film- Cruella was disappointingly average. The storyline was too cliché for my tastes (the duchess being her mother was one coincidence too many) and Cruella was somehow heroized into a designer who (by the end of the film) you think would never skin a puppy- and yet the whole film is advertised as Cruella's path to becoming a felon. Despite the film being 137 minutes long, I was still waiting for another few scenes explaining Cruella's downfall or personality change by the ending credits. She even has a line which re-instates that her fur coat wasn't real, setting up unrealistic morals for a woman who ran about town trying to capture puppies in the original film.However, some parts of the script were very dark for a Disney film, which I liked- the scene with the.flying insect dress was a very-well thought out scene, and both Stone and Thompson's acting was exceptional. I also loved the costumes and the setting of the film: 1970s London felt very authentic, and an exciting place to set the film. The costumes by. Beavan- inspired by Vivian Westwood- stole the show, particularly the bin-van dress and Cruella's classic Dalmatian print throughout the film. I liked the little Easter eggs from the original film throughout, but despite the film's attempts to redeem itself I still left the cinema feeling unsatisfied. Where was the villain story?Overall, I would encourage you to watch the film, as long as you aren't expecting any character development from Cruella, or any definite links to Cruella's part in '101 Dalmatians'. Next time, I'll stay at home and watch the original film instead- it may be older, but at least it's not scared of creating a good villain.",Cruella

1165,jabloom-14-166499,Both excellent acting all round and great cast and great first watch,2,26 July 2021,Cruella on it's first watch is very enjoyable Emma Thompson and Emma Stone are at there best are Lovable villains but watching it second time you wonder why Emma Stone character takes on her real mother's role and calls herself a psycho just because she is her mother her real mother never raised her and the mother that did that was killed by real mother was loving and why use language like psycho when Emma Stone has masterpieces like maniac good on you Disney on keeping woke and pc or at least when counts for some but you don't give Cruella a reason to continue on with her life as exactly like her real mother or worse she has friends around her she gets her revenge so why will turn into someone without reason just revenge and in the end credit go after people who done nothing to her and I haven't seen the cartoon in years but they are people she later try's to kill there dogs over all great acting incredible acting and fun first time around but in the second watch it more like watching someone serious psychopath issues which leaves you bad feeling in your gut like why Cruella? Why? It's done give it up ? It hurts to see that's painful existence to live and a sad one and upsetting.,Cruella
1166,fieneke-kroon,Surprisingly nice,8,9 June 2021,"I came in with very low expectations. In the end I really liked it. The worst thing about it was Emma Stone's terrible British accent. Oh and I'm really confused how this Cruella is turning out to be the 101 Dalmatians Cruella, so there better be a sequel!",Cruella

We were treated to a great soundtrack wonderful costume design and acting that was spot on. Especially the dueling Emma's they were both perfectly cast, both performances I feel are Oscar worthy. In fact I think the entire cast was perfect. One of the best Disney movies in a long time.I can't praise this movie enough for being what I needed to see, a story that doesn't rely on a over blown budget of special effects. This is a great way to welcome movie goers back to theaters. Bravo!",Cruella

This film had some funny, happy and a bit of sadness combined but overall very satisfying ending. I cannot wait for this film to have a sequel 🤞",Cruella

It was a wonderful origin story for Cruella that provides depth and empathy for a villain I grew up disliking. The fashion, writing, acting, small moments that can easily be missed, and the perfect soundtrack. Don't wait to watch like did. I missed the angle, but I see it know.",Cruella
1176,Rmdor,Best disney's live action movie since... 101 Dalmatians,9,30 May 2021,"It is a pleasant surprise to find a children's movie with high expectations delivering the audience a good dose of entertainment.Cruella feels like a children's movie, maybe not the best posed possible, nor so childish, but there is certainly some heart in the movie, and that shows a lot.The performances of both Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are dynamic and, at least in the case of the antagonist (Thompson), it feels as genuine as it is terrifying at times, there is no doubt that it is the darkest movie Disney has made, fortunately it's well done.In general terms the script is not excellent, but it is good, enough to serve as a pretext for an origin story for Cruella. The performances, putting aside those of the protagonists who have reached an exceptional level, the rest of the cast performs well. The rhythm of the film is good, despite the length of the film I did not get bored at any time.One thing I should be complaining about is that at certain times the production feels a bit light and gives the feeling of watching a low budget Disney Channel movie, yet those moments did not ruin the movie for me.Conclusion: recommended.",Cruella
1177,m-t120910,"Absolutely ""Stunning""",10,5 June 2021,"If you have watched the movie, you understand that title. Cruelly was a masterfully scripted movie, with some of the best and most fun lines to quote for time to come. My family and I had the wonderful pleasure to watch the movie in a Drive-in which just seemed fitting for the Era. And it brought a whole new nuance to the movie. Emma Stone was a perfect fit for the young Cruella. Exhibiting a joy of the game, so-to-speak, that made you root for her. You even feel for her, strongly. That is, if you're like me and you really get into the movie and characters. And if you are patient, wait till the end of the credits for a eater egg that is a bit tantalizing leaving you wanting more. Bravo Disney, this was ""stunning""!",Cruella
1178,calliet-563-18284,They didn't do this Disney Villain justice.,5,7 June 2021,"You know I get it, Disney is trying to show us these heartbreaking origin stories of our ""beloved"" Disney villains to sympathize with them and truly understand why they turned evil.The movie that comes to mind that actually did this right was Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. He broke your heart and explained exactly why he became one of the most demented twisted villains out there. And even though you wept for him none of it took away from the fact that he was an actual bad guy by the end. But Disney did not do that. Yes she was a little dark, a little touch of crazy but Disney had such an opportunity to make her the actual crazed villain that she was in the cartoons and failed.They had two hours and 14 minutes to do her justice but instead they filled that with unnecessary heist scenes, car chases, cheesy banter and the Baroness(Emma Thompson) pretending to be a psychotic Miranda Priestly. They spend time giving her a dog companion to humanize her and to steer her character away from the fact that she originally murdered dogs but failed to actually make that dog important. The little rat dog with one eye had more screen time.I love Emma Stone and believe she could have made a truly demented villain. She has the eyes for it. But they didn't give her that opportunity. Instead they made her a brilliant designer who suddenly went crazy over revenge but not crazy enough. And the hint at the mid-scene credits that there will be a sequel seems a bit far-fetched but if they go for it maybe they'll actually make her evil.I have much more that I could pick a part but I think that's enough so let's sum it up. The movie was about an hour too long, Cruella was not nearly crazy enough, the Baroness was a cheesy villain, and the dog companion could've been better. All in all it really wasn't a horrible movie. I laughed, I was somewhat intrigued, and I loved the fashion aspects. But go see it for yourself! You may not agree with my opinion. Happy watching!👀",Cruella
1179,jack-kelly15,Repetitive until the plot kicks in,6,13 June 2021,"This will not be a long or scathing interview but just a slight criticism that somewhat halted what could have been a very good film.I'd split this film into two parts for quality. The first half of the film opened with a poorly written and tamely acted (albeit by child stars). Considering this opening is the premise for the whole movie, it is meagre and unenjoyable - unless you are a huge fan of 101 Dalmations. The majority of the second act is the writer throwing in a line of dialogue we've heard a hundred times before, and the director playing a song we've heard a hundred times before in attempt to give what little action/plot is happening some meaning that isn't there. However, the acting from Emma Stone and Emma Thompson drags it along with some stunning visuals that make you forget that everything that has happened so far has been extremely predictable.However, I think this all changes when the moths come out of the vault. From this moment the story and arcs of the film have a real focus and we aren't just hearing a nostalgic song whilst somebody walks around. Whilst revelations aren't shocking they are interesting and play out well to culminate an exciting ending to the film.As a full film, it does feel like a Disney exec has been watching Suicide Squad and Joker repeatedly in lockdown and is attempting to cash in - but the visuals, acting from the Emmas and slow to catch fire (but eventually lighting) plot makes this a decent film well worth a watch.",Cruella

Emma stone was AMAZING & SO SEXY! I was so happy to see Emma Thompson as the villain of the film. She's been a favorite of mine since the movie ""junior"" the coloring, The soundtrack, and the wardrobe all marvelous!The reason I give it 9 stars is because we still never really find out why she later decides to steal 101 Dalmatians to make a fur coat out of it. The ending of this movie made it seem she was the new queen and the dogs new master. But, maybe I read that wrong.Over all,
AMAZING MOVIE.",Cruella
1182,stan-benda,Sumptuous,10,19 August 2021,"This movie is a re-imaging of the original. There are bits and pieces that pay homage to the original cartoon. However, this ought to get academy award for costuming and photography amongst other things. Emma Stone is delicious, as is Emma Thomson. Emma Thomson in particular channelled the Devil wears Prada in her performance. Emma Stone is wickedly over the top in a number of areas. It is simply invigorating to watch. It is so visually stimulating, rich and amazing. I left the cinema on a cloud. Well done.",Cruella
1183,achihansi93,More in the range of Devil wears prada.,7,13 June 2021,I was amped up about this movie yet when I started watching I couldn't help but remember all the scenes from Devil wears Prada. I feel this is much more similar concept. Emma Stone did a good job. But I couldn't it was entertaining but rather predictable.,Cruella
1184,mentrik-tjen,Too long and unexplained character motivation,6,29 May 2021,"The sequences when Cruella is upstaging the Baroness and designer costumes (another character) were the best part in the movie. And Baroness's entrance and her 'Dior' sculptured fashion with turban.Though Emma Thompson was fabulous as the Baroness, her snarliness and sarcasm became one tone (Meryl Streep's Miranda had more of an emotional arc- even had a quiet moment where she had a chat with Ann's Hathaway's character in the car on why makes them similar and what gets her to where she is)SPOILERwhat made the Baroness want to kill her own daughter? That was the origin story I was interested. The explanation that she is evil, emotionless and likes to be centre of attention helps her to become successful didn't digest well.... Emma Thompson should have done some of the writing. In Batman Returns, Penguin's origin story was easy and more emotional to understand on why his parents rejected him and him turning bad. What was Baroness's reason? Selfishness, her black/white hair - weak!I know they were playing the popular music of the 70's but it got overly much- it felt like set pieces and it was drummed into us. Some scenes could be cut for pacing. I could have done without the obvious narration commentary eg I was a bad child when I escaped car to enter party when my mum told me not to (cue the action)Glenn Close made a better Cruella. Emma stone was convincing but not ground breaking.Overall an ok film for a movie night in on a cold (London) day.",Cruella

It's like the action movie with the action sequences when the hero just makes it by the skin of their teeth in completely unbelievable fashion (every single time).Overall it's still a fun movie, but kind of ruined by some absurd and annoying writing. Once it get's going, the crux of the film, Cruella's rise and the fashion-fighting is pretty entertaining and magnificently presented, but the beginning and ending are ridiculous and the character development is confused and confusing.Can we just have a bad guy? Does everyone have to be victimized by a more-bad guy? And Cruella's mother being killed by BAD CGI Dalmatians is laughably melodramatic. Did they really have to do that?",Cruella

1188,leedav-87604,Well done movie and both Emma's were brilliant.,9,9 June 2021,"After watching the trailers i had high expectations of this movie. It did not disappoint. Both Emma's gave an excellent performance and really brought their characters to life. In fact all characters were done well. I also like what they did with Cruella's ""sidekicks"" as opposed to the originals. Those characters also had more depth and development and contributed to the story instead of just being bumbling idiots.There was some concern about Cruella's signature cigarette holder not being in this movie. It is not needed. It would do nothing for Emma Stone's Cruella. Was not even missed. Stones portrayal of her character reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker performance in the Dark Knight. Definitely award worthy performance from both Emma's.Thompson was also brilliant with her character. After reading the list of others that were considered for this role, they made the right choice going with Thompson. I don't think any of the other considerations could have brought what she did to the Baroness.The story was well done as well. It starts off a little slow, but it is all relevant to Cruella's origin so pay attention!. It all comes together in the last third of the movie and they tie it up nicely at the end.So why did i only give a 9? Because 10 is reserved for movies i love so much i watch them over and over again every so often. I would definitely watch Cruella again, it just doesn't hit that point where i want to watch it regularly.",Cruella

The story is set in the 70's London.Camera movement was perfect. The soundtrack with that electric guitar and some Tiana Turner sounded wonderful.Emma stone did a really good job and was convincing as Cruella. Her acting with the help of some really good dress design was on top.Forget about the cruella from the Cartoon.

Aside from some very creative scene and costume design, the film is as bland as it can be. Proper character development inexistent, tooth-achingly awkward overacting and a montage-to-montage-to-montage manner of directing due to pure story-telling incompetence. The perfect recipe of disaster for one of the worst movies of all time lacking every bit of depth, excellence or intellectual stimulation it so desperately pursues while plummeting into the abyss of genuine garbage.

They're only that low to allow for the costumes, makeup, set design and cinematography to be a 10. So, why a 1? It is all about bullying, deceit, and pathopsychology. Given that this is a movie aimed at tweens and teens, especially with the Disney marketing machine behind it, this is a disappointing movie.The pure Brilliance of all of the Professionals in front of, and behind, the camera is lost once I considered both the target audience and the likely audience. For a generation or more, young women seeking to be strong and exert not only their strength but their brilliance, this is a bad blueprint for them to follow. It is a perfect road map for how to build a borderline personality disordered person and or how to behave as if you were a true sociopath.

1205,gk-65514,Disappointed but entertained,5,28 August 2021,"5 stars=""It was ok""
This was supposed to be the story of how Cruella de vil became who she is. Spoiler: SHE WAS CRUELLA ALL ALONG! Ok, so she had some hardship growing up (including dead parents, but this is a Disney movie, so you already knew that), but does that make her less annoying? No. Straight off the bat, the main character is super annoying, and moves on to become a super thief. Doesn't exactly make it easy to root for her. I get it: she's supposed to be a villain, but the movie is made as to make you sympathise with her, which I couldn't bring myself to do, and that made it near impossible for me to enjoy the movie.I had hoped this would have been more like Joker, where we start off with a relatable character, who ends up becoming a villain, due to circumstances.The movie does have some good things going for it though: The soundtrack is great, the styling is beautiful, and both Emma Thompson and Emma stone delivers great performances.All in all, I was probably fifty percent entertained, and fifty percent annoyed. Not a bad movie, but not as great as some reviews have hyped it up to be.",Cruella

1219,mohamed-88554,Best *Female Empowerment* Movie I have seen,9,15 June 2021,"When Cruella has to keep getting back up due to being bullied by boys at school it is not because it is not because she is a girl and boys always bully girls for no reason it is because her fashion desire makes her different.When Cruella adamantly drives her career forward it is not because the industry is run by men but it's because being a designer is the most to her.When Cruella shows off her talents in fashion or anything else around it. It is never to flip of the entire world of men by saying that I am woman and better than you but instead just to say that she is better.And because this stuff is built deeper than just the most basic superficial factor of gender we can all relate to it regardless of gender. Because we all know about having to struggle due to desires that are different and putting in endless hours of work to improve at those desires. And we all know about that inner driver to be better at our desires than the person next to us. We can understand, feel, support and take part of that while watching this movie.When Cruella dares to break norm by speaking and showing up in a way she shouldn't that's a universal message that conveys something to all of us.Just because you left women up doesn't mean to bring men down. Giving something to one group of people doesn't necessarily requires you to take it away from another.In order to make these female empowerment movies successful you need to start thinking of them less as movies about this specific group of people and more as movies about people who belong in this specific group and reach the other groups through that.

I really could not find any plot holes at all, and believe me, I look hard. The acting was excellent, especially Emma Thompson who repeatedly made belly laugh.

1229,DnvrWolf,A great Disney movie for grownups,8,29 May 2021,"A live-action prequel to ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" (1961).This is the story of how Estella Miller (Emma Stone) became Cruella De Vil. After being orphaned at a young age, Estella grows into her talent as a fashion designer. But here in 1965, ""The Baroness"" (Emma Thompson) is currently London's premier designer. She's a megalomanic, viciously dominating others and stealing ideas to fuel her own success. Through a series of unfortunate situations, Estella allows her ""evil"" alter ego Cruella to battle The Baroness for attention and success.Emma Thompson is the reason to see the movie. Add in Emma Stone and I was delighted to see these two in a battle of over-the-top personalities. Notice that this movie is rated PG-13. Clearly and wisely this Disney movie was targeted directly at adults. It is noticeably not like most Disney movies and that was a great decision. Once in a while, Disney decides to take a chance and break out of its strict formula. With the exception of the recent ""Maleficent"" movies, that doesn't seem to happen often. So, it is very refreshing to see this excellent example of how Disney can take a villain's story and produce something great.There is almost nothing I can tell you about the storyline. There are no big twists, but there are enough changes and additions to the previous storyline that I don't want to spoil things for you.When portraying a character with a big, campy personality, many actors simply over-act. Most fail with the over-acting covering the character like thick, badly smudged makeup. But sometimes the actor can pull it off. Think Jack Nicholson's Joker or Tim Curry's Dr. Frank-N-Furter. They over-acted and it worked. The over-acting becomes part of the character rather than being evaluated as a flaw in the actor's performance.Emma Thompson, however, always seems to be able to portray this type of character without over-acting. The Baroness has a big, sharp, ruthless, laser-focused, and incredibly campy personality without seeming unreal. Thompson takes it right up to the edge without going overboard. The Baroness is insufferably unpleasant, but the character never feels over-acted. Emma Stone's Cruella is similar, but Stone slips and slides. Sometimes Cruella is spot-on without over-acting, but in other scenes Cruella feels staged and conspicuous. Stone does a very good job, but doesn't match Thompson's magical precision.The pace is slow in spots. The editor could have easily cut fourteen minutes from the two-hour and fourteen-minute run. The Jasper and Horace characters are more human and fleshed-out in this version but are still basically used as pawns and props. This is probably intended as it helps to show Cruella's lack of gratitude and appreciation for her friends. But the flaw is that it is overt and obvious that the WRITERS used them as props to move the story forward.Finally, there is a major deviation from the established storyline of the 1961 animated predecessor. It feels like a very good thing for this particular movie, but I'm not sure I see how the obvious next step (a live-action version of ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" using this new Cruella) can and will evolve. That could be a bad thing. I guess we'll have to wait and see.",Cruella

1231,boonekim-34500,It's okay if you forget about the 101 Dalmatians film,4,2 October 2021,"As a stand-alone film this would be pretty good, but in the 101 Dalmatians story line it doesn't make sense. One big (major!) thing that really sticks out to me, having just watched the film, is they made Anita Darling black, which she clearly isn't in 101 Dalmatians. So I guess she can just change her race on a whim. Another is the mid-credits scene where Roger and the race-fluid Anita Darling are gifted the Dalmatian pups Pongo and Perdita, whose own puppies Cruella will try to kill and turn into a fur coat in just a year or two, sooooo.... there's that.",Cruella
1232,maaoyaalnassar,"A very good & shocking movie, but MALEFICENT is way better!",6,26 May 2021,"This movie was a very good movie but kind of shocking from disney lol, i mean the costumes and the soundtrack are the best, and I really like that they through some 101 Dalmatians (Glenn Close) hints here and there, and the comedy is #1 in one of the best things in the movie. Although it's a good movie, it can be easily forgotten unlike Maleficent, Maleficent is way better then this in both acting and story.Cruella is using a shocking plot twist script thing, just like the joker, its not similar to joker but it has some bad-ass joker psycho scenes, I don't know how explain it, although the plot twist is shocking, it seems to be used in many movies, and the CGI is a disaster just saying lol, The Plot holes, let's not talk about that lol, there are MANY plot holes more then an any disney live action movie but it's a fun movie and you will definitely enjoy it. Maleficent is better to me! (And i think it's better to many other people honestly).",Cruella

1238,Liith,"""A little bit mad.""",10,9 June 2021,"I wasn't expecting such a change from the cartoon movie to this movie. There's villains i like and cruella definitely wasn't one i liked. Altho the name was amazing and the character made it's appearance very memorable, no one that likes dogs, would like to see Cruella kill dogs in this movie. That was something i specially loved here. Altho, i'm not a big fan of fashion whatsoever, so this part for me was quite meh, but was amazing how wicked she turned up, and as i said before, her character appearance either on cartoon or in the movie is super memorable. This time, Cruella had a motive and no killing, she was absolutely amazing and the movie had an amazing cinematography. I love Emma stone, she's probably one of the most versatile characters, she does all those faces and has a bit fun in them everytime, no matter a crazy mad woman, or a sweet fragile girl looking for her dreams like Estella. I really loved this movie, altho, i would like a explanation as to why she has her hair since birth with black and white, that's not normal. And the Baroness, Emma (another Emma) Thompson, had an amazing role, one that makes me crawl to make her disappear from the screen, not due to the actress, because the actress is really good, she made me hate her. Overall, really surprising surprise.",Cruella

1242,entertainmentboy,Cruella review,8,3 June 2021,"Hello, Eric here with another movie review, right out of the theater. Cruella was a fabulous movie. Craig Gillespie the director did a remarkable job, Cruella might just be my favorite movie of the year. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. The script was what caught my attention. Cruella is not a perfect film, but a clever one, like the villian herself. The acting was so good and the jokes, and the script was so perfect for this type of character and the movie really benefited from it. Emma Stone is an fantastic, fabulous actress and does a incredible job here. I think this is her best work ever, she does wonderful here. She fits the role better than the animated movie back in the 60s. Although I thought this moive was amazing you can also see the flaws. Overall its a good movie and the ending, score, acting, and the script is all amazing would definitely recommend it. I'll give Cruella an A-",Cruella
1243,leolynn-53517,Cruella,7,30 May 2021,Cruella!!! What a great movie tbh I thought this movie would be so bad but I was wrong. This is like female version of Joker I'm not comparing but this movie changed our thoughts on Cruella .This is not as dramatic as Maleficent but this is worth watching At first I thought Emma Stone was too soft for this role because I can't forget Mia from Lalaland so I wanted Dakota Johnson or Emily Blunt as Cruella but now I can only see Cruella as Emma Stone. Another interesting thing is that there are a lot of queer culture references in this movie like from the dresses to Cruella's make up looks everything screams queer. Its like watching the drag show.and the best part is the sound track ofcourse the sound choices are just Chef's kiss ..it's a perfect movie overall.,Cruella

1245,oliver_sedgwick,The Devil Wears Prada X Tim Burton,9,15 June 2021,"I went to see this on a half price viewing, I have been so let down by almost every live action remake/edition of the classic Disney films. Cruella deVil is a favourite villain from my childhood and I was worried they were going to ruin her, as they did with Maleficent. It's the best live action Disney so far.I found the casting to be really well done, Emma Stone was a really good choice and I hadn't expected her to be so good with the duality of the role. Emma Thompson was made for the Baroness- though she did seem to borrow aspects of Miranda Priestly here, I really liked the strong woman against each other here and I felt like I was watching an adults film for a lot of it. My only casting gripe are the child actors at the start- Horace & Jasper have that delivery like they're doing a school play on stage for a lot of their lines.There was a more gritty feel to this for a Disney film, whether that was it being set in London, the 70s punk visuals or the general themes and story.The visuals, costumes and soundtrack were all very cohesive, the camera work especially during the Liberty entrance was full of energy.The main thing I enjoyed though was the character of Cruella. They brought it into the modern world by cutting her fur obsession, she wasn't made into a total victim like Maleficent and she also was left with some ""villainous"" traits and personality.Overall, I couldn't recommend it enough for a recent Disney film. The only issue I could complain about is the running time, at 2h15 it's a long one. It doesn't feel that long, but it's not full of action scenes like an Avengers film so anyone watching with children might find them bored/distracted if they aren't ""into it"".",Cruella

The movie itself, in general lines, looks good, with acceptable camera takes and direction. I loved the plot too. I can't say it was unfunny to watch. I would say this movie is ""watchable"".But then.Why would you use such terrible graphics for the dogs and chromas? It was like an amateur movie with awesome actors. The last scene where Cruella lands in the sea is just awful. Invest a little more money Disney, we know you can.Another thing I can't stop mentioning is the disproportionate usage of Black and Brown actors. Not gonna lie, it is great that we are slowly transitioning into more inclusive environments, I like that. But, why would you make Anita and Gasper black? Why would you include 50% of black actors in every, literally every, scene, in a movie that occurs in the 60's-70's? We are not dumb, we know reality is far from what this movie shows. Inclusion is not about deniing history and reality, but about studying it and learning from it. Disgraceful movement from this progressive company. This Is Not The Path!I give this movie a 3/10 and I'm being generous. The movie is 40 minutes just-too-long and the graphics made it hard for me (and my family) to even concentrate in the great plot and acting.",Cruella

I adore the multiple heists and robberies as well and the general aesthetic of the film is amazing.

But after the 2nd time, nope........for sure there won't be a 3rd time!I can't write anything negative about the cast or the performance. There is humor in it, wonderful dark humor, I love the soundtrack, I didn't really care there where so many, songs, each and every one of them was brilliant. But the complete story is just a big no-no. We are talking about Cruella, the evil b*tch who hates dogs, wants to turn puppies into a fur coat for crying out loud. Epecially, for some reason she hates dalmatians. You never understood why watching 100 Dalmatians or any other Dalmatians movies so I was hoping to find out. Well after seeing this movie, twice may I remind you, I still don't understand. After 3 Dalmatians pushed her mother (turns out she wasn't her birth mother) of a klif, I was like aahaaa, there you have it, completely understand why Dalmatians must be turned into fur coats......only to find out that at the end of the movie she keeps those dogs?? She did dognapped them but did not turned them into a fur coat, which I half expected, nnnooo she cares for them, she even allows one of them to lay down next to her at the fireplace. She even has a dog of her own. So I still don't understand why Cruella is Cruella. You do find out how she got her name, but that's it. Ooh and the total shock for me......Pongo and Perdita are siblings?? Excuse me Disney? Really? Do explain.",Cruella
1267,Huz41f4h,Cruella review - Emma Stone is a joy as the refashioned supervillain,9,29 May 2021,"If you know me you know 101 Dalmatians (the Disney 1961 animated film) is my favorite movie and Emma Stone is one of my favorite modern actresses. I've been excited; but nervous, to see this movie for the last 5 years since they announced Emma Stone as Cruella. Was it worth the wait? 100% Yes! Simply put, I was blown away! There were plot twists that made my jaw drop and I was on the edge of my seat and couldn't wait to see what would happen next. My friend Bethany commented on my expressions during the movie. (By the way, make sure you stay for the mid-credit scene).The movie is a prequel to the live-action 1990's 101 Dalmatians and the mid-credit scene sets it up nicely. The movie is set in the 1960/70's. You first get introduced to Estella, a young girl who tries to be good. Like all children she is not perfect; however, Estella tries to please her single mother. Estella soon meets Horace and Jasper. They form a friendship, turned family and this is where the story truly begins. In this adaptation you will also meet Roger and Anita.The acting was great. The dynamic between Emma Stone (Estella later Cruella) and Emma Thompson (The Baroness) are amazing. (The other cast are all great as well.) I have no complaints. Both Estella and The Baroness are hard-working, talented in the fashion field; but, you wanna stay on the good sides of these two ladies. The Baroness is Estella's cut-throat boss later turned nemesis. The Baroness is a rockstar in the fashion world and Estella's Idol. This brings me to the costuming.The costuming has to win some awards. It was truly a work of art. As a guy who knows basically nothing about fashion it made me wish I did: because I felt like I would have appreciated it more. It was truly impressive especially the one scene with Cruella's train blowing in the wind. (When you see it you'll know what I mean!)You know how the original 'Cruella' song says ""to see her is to take a sudden chill' I did get a chill from Emma Stone a couple of times. Both these ladies were phenomenal! Speaking of the original song let me talk about the music.The soundtrack has all 70's songs. Most of these songs aren't huge hits but not obscure songs either most of the songs you will know. Many of the songs chosen are not originals but remakes. There are some original songs in the film as well. Band 'Florence and the Machine' has a song titled ""Call Me Cruella"".The music was used to convey a lot of emotion and used very well for the dark cinematography which starts out in black and white. Which is perfect! It is PG-13 I wouldn't recommend for children because it is a bit dark.How does Emma Stone compare to Glenn Close? I'm not sure! Emma Stone is supposed to be the same version that leads into Glenn Close. As I'm writing this I'm watching Glenn Close to compare and I can't. I think they are both great!What else can I say? This is definitely a woman empowerment movie. You may feel a little sad for Cruella; yet, you will still think she is evil! You will admire Estella for her hard work. It is over 2 hours and is much better than 2014's Maleficent. Lastly, I highly recommend this film! On a scale of 1 to 10 I definitely give it a 9.5.",Cruella

1277,sydneyjohnson-08426,Surprisingly Brilliant,8,28 May 2021,"I will be honest.... I did not have high hopes for this movie. I simply went to go see it for the sake of my weekly ""going to the movies"" routine, however I was pleasantly surprised. Cruella is vastly different from any other Disney film I've watched, and the simple fact is that it just works. They don't try to make it something that it's not, but they fully embrace exactly what it is - a magnificent mashup of Devil Wears Prada meets Sweeney Todd...if Sweeney Todd were a young female fashion designer who still possessed a shred of sanity and not an old, washed up barber.Emma Stone was just brilliant. BRILLIANT. If anyone had doubts about her ability to take on a darker role before, those doubts should be washed away after seeing this. And Emma Thompson....good Lord. I've never seen her shine the way she was able to in this movie. They gave her a platform to be the biggest b**** on the planet and she fully took advantage of it. You can tell she enjoyed the insanity of every scene she was in.The only negative thing I have to say is that at the beginning of the movie, the pacing seems rushed and frantic, however once we get through the traumas of childhood Cruella and we settle into the reality of her adulthood, things slow down and the movie finds its beat. We see unique character developments like those of Jasper and Horace that are surprising to say the least, and we also see the origins of Anita and Roger and how they're tied into Cruella's life. They did a great job with developing characters while keeping the focus on Cruella and her descent into madness in the midst of being a rising fashion star. It was a true ""birth of a villain"" kind of movie.This movie was an original through and through. I had no idea what to expect and I was blown away by how dark, creepy, and tension filled it was while still somehow keeping that Disney charm. I almost felt like if it wasn't a Disney brand movie, they could've fully embraced the dark subject matter and made it a hell of a show...quite literally. The film deals with some tough realities in regards to mental health disorders, particularly narcissism. It toys with the nature/nurture debate and causes you to ask, ""Does anyone really have the ability to change and make decisions for their own life, or are we hopeless victims doomed to repeat the sins of our parents?""The fact that this film causes you to empathize with one of the biggest villains in all of Disney lore is a triumph in itself. But it pushes the boundaries a step further and makes you think, ""If I were in her shoes, what would I have done?"" It causes you to see just how much deep childhood trauma shapes one's adulthood, which is something that has largely been avoided in Disney's historically trauma-laden films. You may find yourself hating Cruella and rooting for her at the same time. And maybe that's the point. She lives out the darkness many people keep hidden and suppressed deep within.Cruella is a surprisingly brilliant and visually captivating film that is sure to be a wild ride for all who wish to see how the renowned puppy killer got her name and fame...and it might just have you whistling her notorious theme song as you walk out of the theatre.",Cruella

No Pistols of course, although little miss dark sunshine is a bit of a Vivienne Westwood, but this one is definitely not The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. All in all the movie itself as an origin story or as a standalone flick of course is nothing new, nothing iconic or at least memorable, nothing groundbreaking, thought-provoking or lachrymose - but for Disney not being preachy, self-serious, and forced itself is a HUGE achievement in 2021, so... definitely not bad at all. Acted well - Emma Stone is an amazing Harley Qu... I mean Cruella, directed well, the costumes are cool, the soundtrack is awesome (missed Pistols, Nina Hagen, etc, but well..).

Coming on a wave of mediocre remakes sold by Disney in recent years, the film still promised to demystify the villain Cruella De Vil, the same proposal of the financial hits Maleficent and Maleficent 2. The casting of Emma Stone, who despite being a great actress, spent the last few years stuck in relatively similar roles, it also left the audience with a flea behind its ear. Cruella, however, surprises and, backed by the charisma of the cast and the confident direction of Craig Gillespie, arrives as the best live-action version of House of Mickey classics so far.",Cruella
1287,zeusion,"Combined with the novel version of ""Cruella"", this paper makes some supplements and carding on the details of the film",5,9 June 2021,"Prior to the release of the film, supporting books were on sale, including Hello, cruell heart, Cruella's sketchbook and Cruella live action noveltization.The novel fills in some of the details left out in the film and answers some of the audience's puzzles. At the same time, it gives more description of kuira's psychology and baroness. I find that some people don't seem to understand... So I'll sort it out from the beginning
Estella learned sewing from her mother when she was young, and gradually showed her talent in design. She began to behave unconventionally, and her temper became more and more eccentric and mean, while her mother Catherine was a gentle and kind person, and she hoped her children would do the same.It's cruel. Your name is Estella, not Cruella
Kuyla is her mother's nickname and her other self, but out of love for her mother, she has been suppressing this side.At the age of 12, Estella was bullied by her classmates because of her natural black-and-white hair and unique dressing style (the school uniform was changed by herself), and she retaliated against her mother's opposition and was expelled from school. The retaliated child's parents were city dignitaries, so their mother lost her job. They planned to go to London to start a new life. Estella chose Regent's Park as the first stop of her new life. In her opinion, this place symbolizes her mother and is her emotional sustenance.Then, just like in the movie, mother goes to the baroness for help. Estella can't resist the temptation of the dress and sneaks into the dance party, which leads to being chased by the spotted dog. In the process, she hears a sharp voice but doesn't know what it is. When she gets back to her mind, she sees her mother fall off the cliff by the spotted dog and lose her necklace. There is more about the ball itself and the conversation between the baroness and Catherine. The theme of the dance is Queen Mary Antoinette. The baroness, dressed in gorgeous clothes, swings down from the swing and appears in front of the public, saying the Queen's famous saying: let them eat cake. Then the curtain fell behind, revealing a huge cake, which also said ""let them eat cake""( The director said that this scene is one of the most gorgeous scenes in the whole film, but it didn't cut much, probably to match the perspective of Estella and prevent the audience from seeing the Baroness's face, but it's totally unnecessary. This kind of plot is easy to guess.Estella ran into Jasper and Horace that night after escaping and spent the day stealing. She thought that she had not obeyed the rules to kill her mother. With guilt and regret, she dyed her hair red and decided to integrate into the low-key life of normal people"" Kuira was buried for a while, but she was satisfied with her current life, and she could continue to make clothes and have friends. However, as the actor said in an interview, Estella's relationship with the two changed as she gradually blackened into kuira, from friends to bosses and subordinates, and gradually to 101 loyal dogs.Emma Stone said in an interview that the film contained two maternal and female relationships. So far, Estella and Catherine's story have been told, and then another completely different relationship is coming
Estella, an adult, was portrayed as a fashion Baron to work for her( The Baroness hired her mainly to keep an eye on the girl and prevent her talent from being seen by the world. She used all the competent people for her own use, and the Baroness was proud of her ability) perhaps because of the consanguinity, perhaps the desire for the power to control fashion. Estella, though unable to say she liked the baroness, admired her awe. Estella stood at the door with the plate in her hand as the Baroness counted the two shop men, which was written in the book,
""Estella listened with fear and fascination, and she never heard such bold and confident words, let alone a woman.""
This appreciation was bidirectional, and the Baroness changed her name from ""dirty girl"" to ""Estella"". Estella was so happy that she had never heard the Baroness call the name of others. Estella, who was in a state of trembling, was quite delicate in the relationship between the two, and she did not know when the Baroness's additional attention to herself would disappear, and she saw the Baroness as someone who could help her realize her dream.(PS: the two men were in the car, and the Baron threw the lunch out of the window and looked at Estella's shocked face. She explained, ""it's because the neighborhood here, they hate me. Professional women are upstarts. Anyway, they hate me so much, so let them hate enough. "" Fun face: the Baroness takes a 9 minute nap every day 13 minutes after she finishes her last lunch.)
Then it was the first turning point in their relationship. When their intersection gradually increased, Estella accidentally found the Baroness wearing the necklace of her dead mother. She knew that the ball was held by the baroness. In addition, the Baroness's contempt and insult to her mother angered her. She finally realized that the Baroness was not a good man, and her dreams were broken. The more Estella thought, the more unfair she felt, she lived a miserable life and the Baroness lived in a mansion, so she decided to steal back her mother's necklace. The play also laid the groundwork for Estella's fans. When the Baroness was going to go out and took the necklace off and handed it to the housekeeper, Estella kept staring at the necklace,
""John (Butler) looked at her eyes, with a slightly open eye, but not suspicion, but a totally different emotion - understanding.""
Then there was a big black and white dance( Insert an Anita's personal device. She didn't want to report baroness. The boss forced her to come. She wanted to report something more important than fashion. So she helped kuira simply.)
The play is very important, and Estella releases ""kuira"" for the first time in years. She washed out the dye and showed black and white hair color, and deliberately changed her accent. But at this time, she was just to disguise herself. Until the Baroness asked her name, she was stunned. She didn't think about this. It was the mean cold eyes of the Baroness that reminded her of the boy who bullied her in school, and she remembered the Revenge of her, Firmly speaking of himself as ""kuira"", this is also the first step in the process of blackening.[here is another hint of Estella's life, (not written in the book, but in the movie) when asked about the color of hair, the Baron thought about it and the housekeeper looked at her. There was also a cushion at the beginning of the film. When the housekeeper took off the little Estella hat, his eyes changed. Obviously, the housekeeper knew her.John's look changed
""Estella looked at the spotted dogs around the baroness and thought,"" it should not be the ones who attacked my mother, ""the book says. Does she change them one after another, like a handbag? '""
The two sat down and talked a lot. Estella asked her the secret of her success to delay time, the Baroness replied,
""Two hours of sleep, rule with fear, be a creative genius, don't let anything stop you, destroy all competitors.""
""I don't have friends, I find no one can reach my level, so I prefer it.""
Even though Estella hated the baroness, she had to admit that she had great power and used it as a weapon.Then there was a mess caused by the mouse. The Baroness whistled and ordered her spotted dog to chase buddy to grab the necklace. Estella remembered that she had heard the harsh sound. She looked at the baroness, and she knew that she killed her mother through the spotted dog. Her bad impression of the spotted dog was dissipated. She knew that the bad was human, not dog. For a while, sadness and anger rose to her heart, and her feelings towards the Baroness became an extreme hatred, and decided to destroy everything.Estella began her revenge. As mentioned above, her attitude towards friends has changed, and Estella was angry that Jasper was unable to fully understand the matter in the quarrel. It is not only revenge on the baroness, of course, it is very good to defeat her, but more importantly, her design has the opportunity to come out, she can establish her own brand, and her dream can be realized, which is one stroke. At this time, her cognition of her identity has gradually changed from Estella to Cruella, who played kuira before, and from now on, she will play Estella.When she was called into the office the next day, she found that there were newspapers on the ground (newspapers were an important element in the film), and the Baroness was very upset about what happened to the ball. (there was a cushion here, and she said to the housekeeper, ""did you notice her hair?"") She hoped that the staff could create better designs, but Estella didn't want to do her best. So she drew a few draft designs in the daytime and went to the red carpet where the Baroness was present at night to fight for the wind. She intends to use this time to learn from the baroness and the door that the Baroness inadvertently opens for her to become a designer who shocked the world( First make a sense of mystery, let everyone know that there is such a woman, then the time is almost, and then their name is announced to the world, a shot and red.)
[every time kuira appears, he is wearing clothes that taunt the baroness. The first red dress was an improved version of the old Baroness skirt; The dress covering the Baroness's car says ""the best"", which means that the Baroness has been in the past; The old skirts that the garbage truck has fallen down are all the barons' designs, which means that she is garbage
One afternoon break, Estella sneaked to the alley and continued to design her clothes. But the security guard found that the clever Baron had long discovered that Estella was a little strange recently,",Cruella

It got off to a slow start, and the acting of the children playing the younger versions of the main characters felt fairly awkward. However, as soon as Emma Stone took over as an older version of Cruella/Estella, the movie came to life. The costume design, the movie soundtrack (listening as I write), and the set were all phenomenal, and really sold the entire movie. As has been noted in other reviews, Emma Stone stole the show as Cruella, but Emma Thompson smashed it as the movie's villain, and Joel Fry (Jasper) and Paul Walter Houser (Horace) held up their own, and their comedic timing felt effortless in the mix of the movie. The only downside was the CGI lacked every now and then, but overall, an amazing movie with an amazing cast. Hope there's a second one!",Cruella

After all, what can be interesting about one of the most 1-dimensional characters in Disney lineup? Not to mention the string of horrible live action adaptations we were served recently by Disney (Mulan hurt the most).Well, this movie completely crushed me. It oozes style in every frame, from the fabulous narration by Emma Stone, through colorful fashion, to gripping music. Emma Stone jumps effortlessly between her two personas (with Cruella taking more than just a bit of inspiration from Eva Green). Emma Thompson's character is less nuanced, but she plays her part to perfection. The story is fun and adds a lot of depth to several characters from the original movie.The best movie I've seen since the pandemic started. Highly recommended.",Cruella

This movie as an independent story (and not related to the animation 1961) is really a piece of work!Just like Maleficent. At first I doubted to watch it but it completely changed my mind to a very positive opinion!The most creative fashion designers gathered to make this miracle happen. A masterpiece! Thank all of them!The filming and the way the cameras move are amazing!The music! THE MUSIC! How can I explain it with words?! Just listen to the soundtrack album and the best songs of the 60s and 70s they've chosen!!!!You're my new favorite composer Nicholas Britell!Of course the actings make it greater. (Emma Stone reminds me of The Favourite!)
And Emma Thompson is dreadful, as always, in a positive attractive way :D.Watch it. You won't regret it!",Cruella

I like that the story is not classic and not so predictable. Emma Stone was very good and convincing, both in the role of a scared and withdrawn girl (Estela) and in the role of a narcissistic and perfect (Cruella) . Very suitable film for watching with the family, quality humor and a quality time. In my opinion something I would definitely watch for the second time!",Cruella

Something is clearly wrong.What happened to all the classic writers? Are the writers even trying anymore?If you are a classic Disney guy like me you will not enjoy this movie, unless you turn your brain off, then you might like it.There where tons of potential with this cast, props to the design crew, they did a great job.For me Cruella is a ""bad guy"" in the Disney universe, but this movie makes her out to be a ""Neutral"" semi good, with a few mistakes. What happened to this fearsome crazy women, that will do absolutely anything to get what she wants.They turned one of my favorite ""bad guys"" into a bad girl with a few flaws. I was actually kinda sad after watching this. Please find some better writers and redeem it with the next Re-make movie you are gonna do.Yeah I typed re-make, because I don't think they got anymore in the tank to create something new and great.

It's clever plot twists keep you engaged throughout and will keep you guessing for the whole time. I would suggest it probably is a little long for the younger audience, and maybe unnecessary so, but it is one of those films you don't want to finish. It's deep, dark and funny. 100% worth watching and I personally think the best Disney film in years (my daughter has me relentlessly watching them all). Well done Disney.",Cruella
1356,illyaleonov,My favorite movie of the last ten years,10,27 October 2021,"Beautifully conceived, beautifully acted and most of all beautifully photographed, this is a stunning retelling of the 101 Dalmatians story. This has not got a great deal to do with the original Disney movie except possibly as a twisted origin story. But on its own it is simply fantastic. Voluptuous sets, marvelous cinematography, humor, acting, wardrobes from heaven meet with the best soundtrack of the century to create what is quite simply a masterpiece.",Cruella

Is nobody else appalled by how ludicrous this entire origin story is?! What the hell were these writers thinking?And that's not even including all the plot line inconsistencies (dying her hair red but then actually it's just a wig?; not bothering to dye her hair as a child to avoid ridicule but then doing it later; NO ONE recognizing Cruella as Estella like some wild Clark Kent/Superman garbage; these dogs living 10+ years without aging)The acting was fine (Emma Thompson was spectacular) and the costumes were outstanding. But I would NOT recommend this film at all..",Cruella
1358,luczakedward,An excellent prequel,9,3 June 2021,"I had made the mistake of reading some early ""professional"" reviews on this movie and was not excited to watch this. I'm not reading those any longer. This movie starts out in typical Disney fashion by killing off a parent, but from there it takes off on its own. Excellent performances by Emma Stone and all the cast, Emma make the story shine. I won't get into the details of the movie but this is well worth watching and not just once. Excellent movie, I loved it.",Cruella
1359,andreaestrada,Costume design is fabulous,8,31 May 2021,"I remember when I first saw the trailer of Cruella months ago, I was so excited to watch the movie for a lot of reasons (one of them being Emma Stone), but what really caught my eye was the costume design. And it didn't disappoint me, every look is espectacular, Jenny Beavan is a fashion genius considering she also was the costume designer In ""The Nutcracker"" and ""Mad Max"".

1364,desireeha,"All style, no substance",4,11 July 2021,"The story is an amalgamation of: Mean Girls (taking down a rival), Devil Wears Prada (Mean boss), with a little nod to Mannequin (gets noticed by a department store window display), a rip off of Emily in Paris (the dump truck scene plus graffiti), Star Wars (hidden heir fights their parent). I had a hard time believing 3 ragamuffins could survive on their own in a fabulous flat in London for so long. Then, like GOT MOD, Cruella's heel turn happens so suddenly. She turns on her makeshift family, Horace and Jasper. Fabulous costumes and fun soundtrack. But then, the soundtrack doesn't stay in the time period. It's kindo of a mess. Best part is Wink in a rat costume. Then, why does Mark Strong help Cruella? Why did he work so long for the Baroness? Mess. If the Baroness had so much money, she didn't have to raise a child. Hired people and boarding schools could do that for her. So why need to kill the baby? Where was the Baron at the birth of his child? Dumb.",Cruella

At first I wasn't sure how Emma Stone would handle this role but it was clear after she first appeared that she could nail this one home and she did. After the re appearance of Cruella I literally got chills time after time how amazingly and again, stylishly she was displayed.

1387,elisebergsma2000,Adored it,8,10 July 2021,I absolutely loved watching this movie. Emma stone is the perfect actress to portray Cruella in this movie. Since it is an origin story and they went a different route. Trying to show that even when Estella is gone and Cruella falls in her place she is still not as cruell and typical villainous. It gives dimension to the character in a way that really works. I loved the mix between the devil wears Prada and ocean 8. I read another review stating they thought it felt as a knock of combination of the two but I happen to disagree a lot with that. It takes elements yes but every movie takes elements from other movies. Most often unknowingly. Even if they knew it still works. I loved seeing Cruella as a designer!,Cruella
1388,kendalljordan-07025,Don't Expect 101 Dalmatians or Meaningless Cruelty From Cruella,10,4 June 2021,"I don't usually take the time to review films or shows, but after scrolling through many of the reviews here, I couldn't help myself.Firstly, one recurring complaint that has come up: why can't she just be evil without a sad story? I don't know, maybe because in life abuse and trauma usually begets abuse and trauma? There's a reason that sociopaths throughout history have sad origin stories: because people don't become that twisted without going through some serious loss/trauma/abuse. Movies like this are about showing a different perspective - the villain's - which is obvious from the trailer alone. So if you don't want to see that and you just want a one dimensional villain with no story, no life experiences and no personality, why would you even watch it?Secondly, complaints that it strays away from the 101 Dalmations story. Well yeah, this story isn't about the 101 dalmations or the protagonists of that film - it's about the villain. Again, pretty obvious from the title and trailer.Frankly, this is Disney's best villain origin story yet - by far. Thompson is always brilliant and I can't recall seeing Stone in anything I didn't enjoy, but I was very dubious of her ability to play Cruella before seeing this. I was, however, pleasantly surprised and the on screen chemistry between the two Emmas was electrifying. The film is longer than Disney's standard instalments but it didn't feel long as it was well paced. The writing was good, the stark differences between Cruella and Estella were unsettling. The overall use of colour, largely black and red, worked well to set the right tone for the story. I have no doubt I'll be rewatching this many times in years to come.",Cruella

1393,natalou-72469,Sorry how is she a villain?,4,21 June 2021,"Liked some of the plot twists, they were fun and the acting was alright. The script was tired. The score consisted of all the overdone songs in movies back to back. But the most annoying part is that this is meant to be an origin story for a villain. How is she a villain? By making up with her mates, and avenging her adoptive mother's death the right way? Cruella De Ville is meant to be the symbol of evil, vanity and greed.

You'll possibly get 2 easy - going hours.That being said, there is not much depth in there (as in all Disney movies in my opinion). Additionally, I am really getting sick of this trope where in order to justify that a character is genius or extraordinary you have to follow the path of descent. Why couldn't cruella be a lower class genius? This is a remnant of ""archaic"" thinking, which I can hapilly accept when reading ancient mythology, but not in this case.",Cruella

It had me feeling like I was in the early 90's as punk kid exploring himself through fashion, music, and an anti-authority and anti-capitalist fist. I first saw it with my dad, surprised by the detail and work that had to have gone into the fashion. The scene with the trash truck full of dresses has me in awe. Therefore, I had to take my 14 year old daughter. Leaving the movie my daughter and I sang ""Now I wanna be your dog"" as we both kicked the movie theater exit door open. In the car home, and for days later, we talked about what punk is, what punk-fashion does both socially and culturally. My daughter has since been inspired to pursue fashion and style with an attitude toward music and an attunement to social and class issues.

1404,keishasareen,Phenomenal performance by Emma Stone,10,11 June 2021,What can I say? Emma Stone delivers a mesmerizing performance as Cruella. The costumes are fantastic as is the soundtrack and performance of the supporting cast. Stone pulls off the Jekyll and Hyde persona of Estella vs Cruella seamlessly and this is a film that will very appeal to young and old audiences alike.,Cruella

Did I miss something?"" I'm left with more questions.She never really blamed the Dalmatians for her mom's death. She blamed herself, then Baroness. She then got close to the dogs seemingly... raising and giving their puppies as gifts. Gifts she... steals back in the original? What made her hate Dalmatians again? Also it's implied that Pongo and Purdy were siblings, so...?She got mean with Jasper and Horace, but went back to being nice. So what made her mean again in the original?An easy explanation could be that she's just crazy and unpredictable but I still can't imagine the ""Cruella"" Jasper and Horace being so willing to kill puppies like the ""101 Dalmatians"" Jasper and Horace were.The lack of connection to the original left me disappointed and unsatisfied overall.",Cruella

If you know something about movie production, this movie has everything; great editing, lighting, music score, make up, costume design, acting and a very good storyline.The only weird thing is the ending, it doesn't make sense with the original 101 Dalmatians but again there is going to be a second one so they might explain better then.",Cruella

1420,phworty,You can see the money on the screen but....,3,13 September 2021,"Another Disney script that centres round a dysfunctional, one parent (?) family.The morals of the story are as low as you can go ( being a thief is fine, get drunk and vandalise your workplace to get the career move you need)There are some great songs in the film but playing 30 seconds of The Clash does not make it a good soundtrack. Feels more like someone is looking for a song from the 60/70s in the next room by playing snippets of themThe two Emma's feel like they are doing an Absolutely Fabulous tribute and Mark Strong can't make up his mind if his character has assisted in multiple murder for years or if he's a good guyThe worst thing is the script and the glaring holes in the plot
I don't know how the US system works but in the U. K. when the husband dies all his earthly belongings are left to his wife until she dies. Even if his wife goes to prisonThis is a prequel.

Definitely a modern twist to the original - but to all you 1-4 star haters - why would you want to sit through 2hrs of the SAME movie?! Disney always try to add an emotional piece to their movie reflective to the sign of the times, and this movie depicted multiple sentiments masterfully! I can see young children seeing this movie and being inspired by Cruella's (Stone) work ethic, resilience, and tenacity. Can you imagine how many up and coming fashion designers were inspired by this movie?! Let's be honest y'all.. Couture fashion has been dwindling for the past few decades... but this movie, just wow! 11/10 honestly!",Cruella

1432,joeparrottt,Joker meets The Devil Wears Prada in this witty and thrilling prequel.,8,2 June 2021,"Cruella De Vill - the iconic villain who tried to kill Dalmatian Puppies - has been featured in a prequel that tries to humanise her? Surely, this must be just an absurd way of Disney making more money? Well, no, actually. In fact, there is virtually no traces of Walt Disney in this 12 Rated, rather dark film. From the setting to the accents and actors, it is actually extremely British. It's like if Richard Curtis worked at DC.As said previously, the acting is amazing. Emma Thompson puts in a wonderful performance as the camp Baroness. Emma Stone, in my opinion, is incredible as Cruella. Although not as mad as Glenn Close's Cruella (it is a prequel after all) we see a brilliant split personality between Cruella and Estella. The plot was thrilling and exciting, the characters were very well developed and, oh my god were the costumes mesmerising. They got 70s London very well, the music was great.Could they have knocked 15 minutes off of it? Maybe. The first 15 minutes weren't great, hence the 9/10 instead of the 10/10. The CGI dogs in that bit was visibly fake but from then on I was amazed!",Cruella

Emma Stone is brilliant, Emma Thompson never disappoints, all the supporting staff, children and adults, are rock solid, the writing and direction keep up the pace, the art direction and costumes are sumptuous and there are loads of horrendously bad 1960s/70s vehicles to enjoy. The soundtrack is outstanding (if just slightly intrusive once or twice - but this is a very minor complaint). A deliciously evil romp of action, dialogue and characterisation. Recommended by all the family (including a 10 and a 13).",Cruella

Once Upon a Time did a better job on her backstory(which btw was bc her mother was a dog trainer and would traumatize her). And seriously the hair when she was young, the hair color would come after not before the tragedy.Emma Stone even copied the voice of the actress of Once Upon a Time. And of course she has two guys bc women can't do things on their own. This was a cash grab through and through. Had potential until the 10 year later looked like 20 year later.",Cruella

And I seriously didn't expected such a wonderful ending. I mean it's epic, she not only does justice to herself as a rightful heir, but also brings justice to her mother, which brought her up, and loved her more than her life. And I could sense that love through cruel , Cruella's eyes.I'm shocked that would even rate such movie . But as I said, such a wonderful ending. Must watch, thanks #Emma Stone.",Cruella

1455,dfzsbgpf,A good movie that was just slightly off,7,18 June 2021,"Overall the movie was really fun. There were moments where I was in the edge of my seat in anticipation (that dalmation coat? Such a great scene) but overall the movie felt really clunky. The music would swell up getting ready for a montage and then die before it got momentum. Some scenes just felt too short and others felt too long. The acting, costumes, and even story were all really good but I felt discombobulated a few times throughout.Would recommend watching, but wouldn't call it one of Disney's best films ever.(Side note the fact cruella didn't kill the Dalmatians bothered me. The movie didn't have to kill them but Disney wanted the emotional weight of cruella killing the baroness' dogs and had the huge dramatic fountain scene but then shows us a scene later the dogs are alive with literally no explanation. They wanted the drama without the weight and it felt cheap. Literally 1-2 lines of dialog would've fixed it but the fact they didn't even address the dogs were still alive just felt like a cop out.)",Cruella

I've never had the urge to watch a movie more than once a in a week, so Cruella is pretty special.First of all the costumes, specifically Cruella's dresses are soo breathtaking! As a men I'm very jealous that men don't have such creative and fabulous clothing available to us.The acting is top notch Emma Stone as Cruella is literally perfect, Horace and Winky are hilarious, and the manager of Liberty department store is so well written and acted.The writing is genius this is the first movie in a long time that didn't have obvious clichés that I could see from a mile away except for one where Cruella adds a sixth stage of grief ""revenge"", but other then that it's as I've said genius.The cinematography is soo creative and well thought out that I think it should be that art film making schools (I'm not a full student so I don't know what they exactly teach at these schools).The music and the soundtrack is also very good, though not Star Wars level I enjoyed the tracks they have licensed for this one, especially ""Feeling Good"" by Nina Simone.Lastly I think this movie is a must watch for everyone. Even two of my friends enjoyed the movie more then I've thought they would.",Cruella

1478,nahidanizu,Mediocre; lacks elements of surprise,5,2 June 2021,"Cruella is a cruel devil that skins dogs' fur for business. She is cruel, greedy, and whatnot. They decided we needed an origin story for Cruella. When the movie starts Emma Stones's amazing voiceover will make you think you're in for a badass movie about a badass Cruella. ""This neckless is the reason why I am dead."" Ooh so badass. This reminded me of the best Disney movie of all time; Tangled. But yeah, Cruella isn't. As we have already seen from the trailer, she is hired as a fashion designer and doing what she loves but how did she become Cruella? Oh. It was tragic. So tragic it didn't even make me feel sorry for her. The movie was extremely predictable. You can guess what the next dialogue she was going to say. All the characters except for Cruella was just plot device that was there to make her who she is. They had no other purpose at all. When the big twist is revealed, it lacked the element of surprise. I almost wanted to yawn.I wanted a badass Cruella and I got a Cruella whose every move was predictable. She tried looking badass with all her dresses and moves but she wasn't bad enough, not for me. I guess they wanted to make Cruella a little human. But they didn't make much of it.When Cruella says, ""I am not like my mother, I am better.""I wanted her to say, ""I am not like my mother, I am worse , way worse.""But there were obviously good things. To my fresh eyes, the costumes were amazing. The music was splendid. When they played ""One way or another"" it made me dance. And oh Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are such good actors, it needs no explanation.But at the end of the day, I didn't watch the movie for good costumes, music, or acting. I wanted a badass, mind-blowing story. But I got this.Would I recommend this movie? If you want to have a good time, go ahead. You will have a nice experience. Would I rewatch this movie? Ah, I don't think so.",Cruella

1481,kaykypereira-07867,magnificently amazing,10,6 June 2021,"A charming film, which holds you from beginning to end, because you want to know more about the future and past of this secret and at the same time obscure character that is Cruella and how far she goes to make the Baroness go crazy.The CGI is very good and you see the details, but since nothing is perfect it ends up giving a ""Slippery"" and ends up being very fake, but that won't interfere with your experience with the film, because the script is so closed and good that you make you pay attention to the story and not the CGI.The plot twist is really good and cool.And the post-credits scene is deft.The Actors and Actresses (Mostly The Baroness (Emma Thompson) The Cruella (Emma Stone) And Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) (Anita even though she doesn't have a very important role for the film, the actress makes a choice very good on how she's going to build the character.) And these characters are the ones that caught my attention the most).And there is also his costume, which is a character apart, it speaks for itself of so beautiful and creative, I bet that if I competed for the Oscar, I would definitely win easily.Cruella is a very beautiful film and the script is very well done, of course as any film has its flaws but nothing too glaring that makes you leave the film hating it.The performances are great, the costumes are incredible and the soundtrack is magnificent that talks to the scene.For me Cruella closes with a grade: 9.8.",Cruella

1485,courtneykcannon,FAR EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS,10,28 May 2021,This was my first movie in theater since pre-Covid and boy it was a winner! What a movie to go back to the theater for! It's not one I would necessarily recommend for young kids but my husband and I loved it! Left the kids at home. The storyline was super well written- there's comic relief. There's light hearted moments and yet of course a lot of dark elements. The cinematography was wonderful and wow the costumes were fabulous!!! The acting was great- Emma was the perfect cruella! I mean she nailed the role! She was fabulous! Disney really hit this one out of the park! It's a must see! It's a long movie for a disney but it's really engaging for both male and female. Definitely recommend!,Cruella

1488,brittbree-64471,BRILLIANTLY done. BEST live action Disney Film Ever.,9,28 May 2021,"( Not that you care, but after watching the film I am stuck in a British accent, and I am therefore writing this review in a British accent.) I have NEVER written a movie review before, which I think, in and of itself says loads about this film....if you happen to give a crap about my opinion. I suppose it doesn't really matter if you do or don't, though, as I'm going to give it anyway.The only CON I can think up to this movie is there are a few scenes that are OVERTLY NOTICEBLY CGI. The dogs for instance, can be distracting in all their digital glory, and there is a particularly guilty scene near the very end. The only other thing I might add for those who are devout Disney fanatics is that it doesn't really FEEL very Disney. It's a similar atmosphere to Maleficent, but less mythological/ma gic-y I suppose you could say. I mean it is an origin story about a villain so....... I don't think it's too far off base.I grew up in the 90's. The Lion King came out the year I was born. So it's safe to say I was raised on DISNEY films. But as I've gotten older I've begun to see, despite my INTENSE LOVE of the originals, some major missing information or plot holes that the newer/ live action films have satisfactorily filled in. In this film, for instance, learning about Cruella's past gives more context to her behavior later. It fills in gaps about how Cruella and Anita new each other prior to Cruella's arrival in the original cartoon.The story line was deliciously diabolical, with twists and turns I didn't expect. In my humble opinion, the dialogue was some of best we've seen in a Disney film in years, despite other reviews claiming otherwise. The movie never felt long to me, in fact, I wished it never ended because it was so entertaining and spectacular. Emma Stone was nothing less than BRILLIANTLY GENIUS in the role, bringing to life the nuances of the character that lacked substance in the cartoon. Emma Thompson very nearly stole all the glory and attention. The two Characters duking it out on screen was suspenseful, and riveting in all its petty and vain motivation. The costuming was BEAUTIFULLY done , and yet not overwhelming or overdone.The characters all had substance, and all seemed to grow and develop more as the movie progressed. I'm not saying, what they learned was particularly ""good"" in a moral sense, but they definitely filled out as people throughout the course of the film.Jasper and Horace were more than mere complicit and submissive idiots in this version. They truly cared for Estella, and were trying to help her grieve and move on. Whether their actions were actually helpful, or good, is debatable since they were criminal, but their intentions were to help someone they cared for. Jasper actually had a conscience and was clever, while Horace was genuinely funny throughout (he wasn't the smartest but he also wasn't completely stupid.)I think we as people like knowing why people are the way they are, and this movie impressively explains a lot about what has contributed to Cruella's personality, and behaviors.I have seen a lot of reviews talking about how evil this movie is because Cruella is a puppy killer for personal gain. For those of us who have actually watched the film, you will know she doesn't actually kill any dogs in the movie. She simply implies that she did to unnerve her enemy. She's a villain, or at least an anti-hero. The definition of such is that they do evil and manipulative things usually for personal gain. Why are we so concerned about a movie wherein it's implied dogs are harmed (when they aren't really) but all manner of violence towards humans is acceptable fodder for entertainment? If you don't like it, don't watch. And no, this is NOT me condoning animal cruelty. I would never. I have pets of my own, and have loved and cared for animals all my life. I just happen to think people as a whole now a days tend to get their knickers in a twist over pretty much everything.Oh, and the music!! The music was PERFECT for the story and the character being portrayed. The music brought it all together, and cemented this film's true overall AWESOMENESS!!!As with pretty much any film that doesn't offend one's personal view's or sensibilities, I say give it a chance. If you like it, you like it. If not, you never have to watch it again.It's as simple as that, Darling.",Cruella

1502,zmvghbj,Cruella lacks bite and the film is a mess,2,29 May 2021,"The perfect movie to return to the theatre in person, right? Nope! Just a who cares movie. Emma Stone working at a fever pitch while the rest of the cast is generically disappointing. Horace and Jasper seem to have been cast for their body type and dialect, but are ho hum with their comedic chops. Where were the character actors who could have shined with this material? Emma Thompson, who I adore usually, seemed to be giving it the collage try, in a half hearted way. Costumes were unremarkable with the exception of the ""garbage gown"" which was a moment of brilliance. Finally the film appeared fuzzy as thought they'd pulled out the treatment they gave Lucille Ball when she played Mame , But it's unclear to me who or why they were softening for.

The Cruella that I know smokes cigarettes on a cigarette holder, wears prominently huge pelts, owns dogs only for obvious reasons, never shows any signs of self reflection or moral... There are too many things that don't add up for me to accept the 'new' Cruella as the same as the one from the 60s cartoon that I perceive as 'original'.Same for Anita and Roger. Same names, similar roles but different characters in my opinion.Last but not least CGI dogs are horrible. I can get that CGI dogs can do what real dogs can't. But at least there is one thing that real dogs are unbeatable at: being convincing.In my opinion it's a good standalone movie, but it fails as a prequel.",Cruella

1513,elman-81901,Very solid Origin film from Disney,8,1 June 2021,"I thought the pacing was a bit fast and slow at times, but the dialogue was great, the soundtrack is excellent (especially if you're a fan of late 60's - early 70's music) and of course, Emma Stone knocked it out of the park as the titular character, enough to give Glenn Close a run for her money. Speaking of characters, Emma Thompson's Baroness character gave me a lot of vibes from Meryl Streeps character from Devil Wears Prada, since a good portion of this film revolves around Cruella trying to appease the Baroness character with her fashion designs, which works surprisingly well for the overall pacing and storytelling of the film. My only real gripe is a scene towards the end with cgi that looked like a lower budget film. They either rushed this scene or the budget ran empty. Other than that, no real complaints from me, and It's definitely worth watching multiple times. So far, it's the best Disney movie of the year for me.",Cruella

1515,terrilalalohr,Best movie I've seen since the pandemic began.,10,31 May 2021,"Cruella is a brilliant film with superb acting, beautiful costumes and spectacular backdrops, adorable puppers and the soundtrack is just beyond amazing. Roger even sings the original Cruella DeVil song at the end. The movie is set in 1970's London during the punk rock revolution and the entire film is just GORGEOUS. You could honestly pick up on the feel of the era and the authenticity of it really took me back to that time in history when punk rock was in its infancy. Being an adolescent in the early 80's punk scene, it felt truly nostalgic to me. I honestly haven't enjoyed a film this much in quite a while. I really loved the way that they were able to portray Cruella in a light other than the treacherous character we all met back in the 70's in the original 101 Dalmatians that was trying to make a coat out of the Dalmatians ... (did she or did she not ???)
Emma Stone and the entire cast did an amazing job!!! Horace and Jasper were great supporting characters. I can't even think of 1 bad thing to say about this film. Even the 2 hours and 14 minute run time didn't scare me away or take away from the experience. I actually didn't want it to end. I wanted to see what Cruella and Jasper and Horaces next adventure would be. Ohhh, also, it did not feel like a kids movie at all however it is totally safe for your kids to see. Grown up and kids alike all will enjoy this highly entertaining movie.I'm telling you now, If you have a chance to see Cruella, please do yourself the favor and see it!!!

From the very, very bad CGI on everything, not only the dogs, to the predictable story, which was not that good to being with. The movie could be good if it wasn't yet another cash crab from Disney. Cruella is the only villain that did not need a tragic backstory, because she was just evil and yet, here we are...

Trying to picture her as the only villain that gave me nightmares as a kid just did not compute. All I have to say is wow and I take all that scepticism back. Her range of emotion and how expressive her eyes are was amazing to watch. Whether that was craft cgi or all Emma it was wonderous to watch. It was awesome as someone who grew up watching 101 Dalmatians to see the story pick up tidbits from the original to see how things came to be. Add to that the amazing fashion and heist storyline everything was enjoyable. Emma Thompson was deadly hilarious and that garbage out the window scene was everything. The only thing I question was the Dalmatians themselves. They were heavy cgi and scary af. I don't see Dalmatian sales sky rocketing after that movie, so that's a plus.

The photography, the settings, the interesting direction and more than anything the more than excellent costumes, make this movie stand out at its highest points.But not only is she technically incredible, Emma Stone is probably giving us one of the best interpretations of her and in my opinion the one that will be the most iconic in her career. Emma Thompson is very supportive, giving Miranda Priestly vibes, but not at all, she is very good at what she fits.If it is true that I feel that they could get into more specific things, although I think that depends on Disney and the limits that the company places on its productions.Even so, this movie stands out among live actions as one of the best and most outstanding.",Cruella

Over 2 hours of fun provided by strong female characters , and an entertaining mix of male roles. COMBINED with the best soundtrack and as for the costume design just wow . If you love punk , Vivienne Westwood , the 70s and 80s this movie is a must . Leave the kids at home ( its lost on them ) and immerse yourself in this truly special disney story of a young Cruella .

Brilliant acting by both Emma Stone (one of my favs) and Emma Thompson (luv also). Main supporting cast of Paul Walter Hauser, Joel Fry & Mark Strong (and the cute pups!) was superb adding many laughs & cheers.

I know it's the new ' thing' now to make the evil characters look cute because people sometimes like them more than the good characters
it's starting to be like a cliche now
evil characters were cute but they got bullied back in school
and now they evil but not evil evil they still cute
but come on, we love those characters as they are
they are evil and they are still cool . As simple as that
also the plot is very silly and predictable like a B-grade movie
the young estella is meant to be a genius in fashion
why ? How ? When ? You don't get to know she just have ' it '
and the baroness got impressed by her talent from the first moment ?The baroness who turns out to be her real mom that tried to kill her ?How can this movie be more silly !Her 2 friends had no girlfriends or lovers or even friends except for the dog
they were like 2 shadows just to give the main character some attention
the main character that is also a shadow with no real personalty or character development or even real moments of authentic feelings even her talking to her mom's grave was meh
The conflict is so lame and the resolution is even worse
Emma stone is amazing but there is no emotions or real acting in the movie
I mean you were about to get burnt alive and you just closing your eyes and cry a little ? You then wake up realizing you are not dead,and the guy just saved your life and you didn't even say thank you ? You literally wake up from a near death experience and you were like OK I'm late where is my coffee -_-
and the ending is sooooooo clicheeeeee how many times have you seen this come hug me so that I can kill you thing aghhhh Im so maaaad
and a parachute suit ? Come on guys who wrote the script ?A seven years old kid ?I don't even know why I wrote this review this is the first time in my life I write one I just felt so disappointed and I needed to talk it out

It's not your typical Disney, a bit like Malificent, not the usual fairytale. The movie is rated 13PG, which I totally agree with.Great movie for teens and adults. Yes, especially for adults.

1571,imogenwinmai,"Disney's best origin movie, if not just the best movie",10,13 June 2021,"One of Disney's original, most famous and most hateable villains. The fashion-designer-turned-villain is known for her obsession with spots, wanting to skin dalmatians in order to use their fur for clothing. But is this truly who she is, or is she misunderstood? This is the story of how Estella becomes Cruella.The movie starts with Estella's birth. From the moment Estella was born she was considered strange and unlikeable, as she is born with half black and half white hair. This continues to be an important aspect, because throughout her life this provokes a rather nasty reaction from strangers.Ever since Estella was young she struggles with being a well-behaved, normal kid and being the victim of bullying provokes her 'bad side' even more. Instead of accepting her fate as a victim, she fights back. This gets her in a lot of trouble and she is often seen as the culprit. Eventually she is expelled, which leads to her and her mother (Emily Beecham) having to pack their stuff to start a new life in London. Unfortunately, Estella loses her beloved mother in a tragic event before they can start any of it, along with an important piece of family jewellery.As an orphan, Estella (Tipper Seifert-Cleveland) meets Jasper (Ziggy Gardner) and Horace (Joseph MacDonald). I immediately was impressed with how Gardner was able to bring his character to life, as Jasper is the more complex character of the three at this point. From then on they form an alliance and steal their way through life. Estella dyes her hair an unflattering red in order to fit in more, which is ironic to me. The way her hair colour is meant to make her stand out less is unflattering to who she really is.As they grow older, they perfect their craft. Estella (now played by Emma Stone) adopts her mother's love for fashion and develops her designing/sewing skills in order to disguise themselves. At first glance Stone seems to have taken on a role she often takes on: a quirky, relatable, funny girl. But Cruella is the opposite of that: mean, intimidating, scary. It was interesting to see how well Stone managed to play both Estella and Cruella convincingly. They were clearly two different persons, even though they are one. Even when Estella first became Cruella and wasn't always sure of herself, Stone was able to play this out very skilfully by letting Estella shine through here and there.Jasper (now played by Joel Fry) ends up getting Estella a modest job in a popular London warehouse. This results in her meeting her idol: The Baroness (Emma Thompson). The Baroness is an incredibly famous fashion designer and she ends up hiring Estella as a designer. One day Estella notices The Baroness wearing her lost piece of jewellery, causing her not only to gradually find out who The Baroness really is and what actually happened to her mother, but she also finds out who Estella really is. Estella channels her dark side, creating her seemingly evil alter ego: Cruella.Cruella's hair symbolises and represents her perfectly: half dark, half light. Cruella is constantly battling herself, both fighting her good and her bad side. Estella v.s. Cruella. In her own words: 'her mother tried to love her into shape'. Estella without the right chaperone would have been a very chaotic and evil person. But Estella without her dark side is a wallflower and a pushover. Neither sides are particularly good for her, which is why she needs to find balance. In the beginning her dark side overtakes her and she loses herself. But she undergoes character development after character development after character development. In the end she turns out to be both a powerful, ruthless woman, but also a loving and caring one. 'I am woman. Hear me roar'.",Cruella

Maybe it's because I haven't seen a movie in the theater in over a year, but it was such a blast watching this on the big screen! Emma Stone was a vision-truly, her acting made this movie what it was! Her monologue at the water fountain gave me full body chills! The Baroness was perfectly evil and phenomenally acted. The supporting roles were great and provided some comedic relief from what was an overall, very dark film on the making of a villain. You are left uncertain of who to root for, which, in my opinion, is the mark of an impressionable and well-acted film. Go see it; you won't regret it!",Cruella

And now, having looked, I remain under a pleasant impression after what I saw. The film almost completely met my expectations.I first met Cruella's character when I saw Glenn Close in 101 Dalmatians. Cruella was a mature woman then: an eccentric woman, obsessed with furs, and obsessed with stealing Dalmatian puppies.Yes, Glenn Close set an incredibly high bar, and it was interesting to see if Emma Stone could hold that bar. And Emma could!This spin-off introduces us in detail to the character of Cruella, starting from childhood.The girl Estella was born with a difficult character: she was a kind child, but sometimes showed cruelty. Therefore, her mother jokingly sometimes called her Cruella (from the English cruel - cruel).Estelle also had a gift for fashion. She wanted to create beauty, create unusual images in the fashion world. And so soon, from a small town, he and his mother go to London.But it is not so easy to conquer London. There were many tragic events and upsets along Estelle's path. As an adult, she has to change one terrible job after another, but she continues to live the dream of high fashion.And fate gives her a chance. Estelle's life is surprisingly connected to the influential Baroness von Helman, played by Emma Thompson.Then we will see the transformation of Estella into Cruella, the competition between her and the baroness, a lot of action and a lot of fashion.Immediately it is worth noting the magnificent work of the costume designers: all the outfits are bright and memorable.Also, the selection of soundtracks for each scene is quite interesting, conveys the spirit of London in the 70s. The title track to the film ""Call me Cruella"" - very accurately matches the character created by Emma Stone. Great song!As for the plot, it is quite simple and predictable. But this is Disney, so I don't think it's a disadvantage. Rather, on the contrary, it turned out to be a film for family viewing. At the same time, he is bold, effective, with excellent acting.Emma Stone and Emma Thompson have created a powerful tandem. Emma Stone played the role of young Cruella so well that the image turned out to be bold and bold.Emma Thompson once again appeared as a master of reincarnation. Facial expressions, facial expressions, movements-an exact hit in the image of the eccentric baroness. At the same time, Thompson also brought some comedic features to the character's image.Minor characters are also remembered: Horace and Jasper-Estelle's loyal friends, Mark Strong's character, and others.The result: the film is beautiful, driving, with bright characters. A kind of fairy tale in a modern way. It turned out stylish and bold.",Cruella
1586,i-38471,Classic Comic Book Villain Backstory,10,20 June 2021,"We came to the film prepared - a couple of days ago we reviewed the original cartoon ""101 Dalmatians"" in 1961. I can't say that watching this classic movie was exciting for me - the times are not the same anymore. The eyes are cut by a very stylish villain Cruella DeVille, but with absolutely zero motivation and a pair of absolutely idiotic henchmen-Jasper and Horace. But my God, this investment of time in the cartoon paid off with emotions in full.What do we have? We have a classic problem for any comic book villain. This villain was invented at a time when the motivation ""I want to cut dogs, because I'm evil, and laugh at the same time"" was absolutely sufficient. 50 years have passed and we need to add depth to this villain, but it is desirable not to break the sequence of events. Retconim-retconim-retconim and voila-it turns out not a masterpiece, but an extremely fascinating film. At every moment, you know that Cruella is going to go crazy. And you just sit in suspense and wait - when this sweet and charming girl will come this break. You're not afraid of any spoilers. Comfortable. Childhood injuries are great for this - at 20 you can be a little bit bad, and at 40 you are already a full-fledged killer of puppies. And the Stockholm syndrome explains why the henchmen are so attached to a domineering woman.Emma Stone is certainly gorgeous. The costumes are divine, straight to the Oscars. The performances in the films remind me of the game that Pussy Riot created in their golden era. The action takes place in the mid-60s, so rock and roll and the scrapping of classical foundations are absolutely appropriate. The soundtrack matches.Among the problems of the film - against the background of the general bacchanalia of style and impudence, there are too bland scenes that are appropriate in a safe family comedy. Well, of course, it was strange to expect such a thing from Disney - I can't call the film toothless, but a rating of 16+ would definitely benefit it. Make him even angrier and more arrogant. I do not believe that 12-year-olds will be interested in watching it - the whole storyline is quite adult, except for a few scenes where dogs run around and there is a light version of "" Ocean's 11 Friends»In total, I strongly advise you, especially if the original is fresh in your memory. The kit includes a fanservice and a bunch of small references.",Cruella
1587,n-41788,"Disney, is that you?",10,20 June 2021,"God, Disney, is that you, my big-eared friend? Suddenly decided to make an independent story based on the original film? Have you finally realized that your movie remakes are a complete shvak? Congratulations.The film is healthy! I can't believe I'm writing this right now. It is cool because it has very bold solutions that are in harmony with the children's rating.First, the film is about a villainess. The creators are great that they decided to tell about Cruella's past and tried to explain why she is the way she is. There is a great potential for a character arc, but the film failed to fully reveal this arc. I will explain the reason below.Secondly, the film is shot in the colors of the main character. It exudes a gloomy combination of white and black, which is not typical for a big-eared company.Third, the music and costumes. The events take place in the seventies of the last century. The world is undergoing a sexual revolution. People become more relaxed and begin to think and act more freely, as it seems to them. Hence the music and costumes, and they are incomparable!Fourth, it's a powerful acting game. The strongest duo of Emma Stone and Emma Thompson. Actresses were not just taken for advertising. They have something to play for, and they do it!Now the minus sign. He's alone. This is Disney itself with its children's rating. Why create a movie about a villain with a mental disorder if your target segment is children? You can skillfully walk on the edge. The creators have successfully done this in this film. The question of the disorder of the mind of the main character. On the one hand, it is obvious, but on the other hand, there are still doubts. Is Cruella a villainous character or not? What will happen in the sequel? Rethink? As for me, this will be a bad decision, but for now, the film is worth paying attention to.",Cruella

Because I bought it, too......AND I DIDN'T REGRET IT!!!By and large, there are only two shortcomings in the film!The first one! As the military vehicle polutorka barely teleports through the swamps and hummocks of Belarus, so 'Cruella', in my subjective opinion, despite the interesting and delicious film, is a little tight, a little tedious and slower than necessary.The second one! There are a lot of semantic mistakes. AND REALLY A LOT!!! I'm not a fan of poking around in the logic of the characters, the deep meaning of the films - I'm not always aware of this and understand it, but here there are elementary far-fetched things, stupid decisions of the characters, and other other nonsense and nonsense-more than enough!BUT!!Beautiful picture! Juicy bright colors! Spectacular main characters. Interesting plot. Beautiful music. Intrigue. A reference to the incomparable 'The Devil Wears Prada' and 'The Joker'. The film is good. Solidly glued. The operator is often very, very often a masterpiece, taking all the best from the movie hits of Britain and Hollywood of past years.Emma Stone is simply a divine woman! Her main on-screen rival is a real Goddess!Unfortunately, the film was not spared by the dominance of Hindus, dark-skinned harn lads in the frame (in the courtyard of London, the 60s of the last century... just in case...), transvestite, weak men, strong powerful women, in general, feminism.There is a lot of limp and he, frankly, limps...But overall, the film is very good. The quality is above average. Absolutely viewable. Fascinating. Entertaining. And simple... COOL!Look-and you will hardly regret it!

1589,w-50925,Cruella is coming...,8,20 June 2021,"Disney once again took up the film adaptation of the formation of one of the brightest villains of animation, namely about Cruella De Vil, a heroine who was obsessed with the idea of making Dalmatian puppies an item of outerwear. The story takes us back to the 70s, when Cruella was still Estella - an extraordinary girl who wanted to be a fashion designer and create, but life did not give her a chance to express herself where she wanted, until she had the chance to work for a famous Baroness...To be honest, I went to this film without much expectation, but the movie just captured me from the first to the last minute. I would like to note the recreated atmosphere of the 70s, the entourage of that era, fashion, music, the creators of the film managed to imagine everything so well that you plunge into the story that takes place on the screen with your head.I liked the dynamism of the narrative, despite the fact that the film has a pretty decent timing, the story itself is about a little girl who becomes damn bright, fascinating, smart, cunning, a girl with a character it's interesting to watch how Estella becomes Cruella.The story itself combines drama, comedy, tragedy, and adventure, the heroine of Emma Stone is charismatic, it was interesting to watch her ""antics"". I would like to mention the camerawork, I liked how the film was made from a visual point of view, the color scheme, dynamics, a small minus in some scenes the Dalmatians were just too drawn, it could have been done better, especially in the film a huge budget.Of the pros, this is of course the work of costumers, dresses, images, some are more beautiful than others, they are unusual, bright, shocking, I hope that in the future the film will get into the Oscar nomination for the best costumes.About actors. Emma Stone, Estella / Cruella, Emma managed to embody a bright personality on the screen, to convey the feelings and emotions that her heroine experiences, and if in "" 101 Dalmatians ""we had such a"" mater "" villain Cruella, here we see what she was originally and why she became so, Emma Stone played perfectly, felt the spark of madness of her heroine.Emma Thompson, the Baroness, an ambitious trendsetter of London,"" under the wing "" of which Estelle falls, the Baroness is in control of everything and everything, she is such an iron lady going to her goal no matter what, Emma Thompson in the image was good.In general, ""Cruella"" turned out to be quite a good interpretation of the formation of the villainess De Vil, this is a story about transformation, finding yourself, finding your goal, who to be in life. In recent years, Disney has presented villains from a completely different side, for example, ""Maleficent"", the villain is not just for a reason, for that there are reasons.And if watching the movie ""101 Dalmatians"" as a child, the character of Cruella inspired me with some horror and I wanted her to ""win"", becoming an adult you understand that villainy has its roots and causes, and in ""Cruella"" we were well shown why the heroine took the path of villainy and in the future so ardently wanted to get Dalmatian puppies for her own selfish purpose.",Cruella

1591,ogahvivian,"If this movie is anything, then it's definitely ""EXTRAORDINARY""",9,25 June 2021,"MOVIE REVIEW-CRUELLA (2021)Cruella is a 2021 crime comedy film directed by Craig Gilespie. It stars Emma Stone, Emma Thompson, Joel Fry, Paul Walter Hauser, Emily Beecham, Kirby-Howell Baptiste and Mark Strong. Its runtime is 2h 14mins, box office $132.9 million and it is based on the novel The One Hundred And One Dalmatians by Doodie Smith.Set in London during the punk roll movement of the 1970s, the movie follows the story of Estella, a rambunctious, wild and unconventional girl with dreams of becoming a fashion designer.Born with the most atypical of looks, Estella faced reproachment right from childhood due to her peculiar hair color and was termed ""unfortunate"".After the tragic loss of her mother at a tender age and bearing the guilt of being the sole cause of it all her life upon defying her mother's instructions, Estella felt as though her dreams had been crushed. She finds family and support in the company of two young men, Jasper and Horace and together they rob people inconspicuously to make ends meet while making sure to always be there for one another, seeing as they only had each other as lonely as they individually were.The title of the movie ""Cruella"" bears a striking resemblance to the name of the protagonist ""Estella"" and this is as a result of the personality Estella embedded as a child which could be termed ""cruel"" therefore, the name ""Cruella"" was established.The personality (Cruella) died alongside her mother and she gave up that delinquent lifestyle with the belief that her stubborn nature caused her mother's death.As a birthday present from Jasper, Estella was given the opportunity to pursue her dreams as a fashion designer. From here on out, Estella faces so much ranging from experience, steadfastness, maltreatment,unexpected opportunities, shocking revelations and so much more.After being employed by the narcissist fashion icon and queen, Baroness Von Hellman, Estella finds favour in her eyes and her unique sense of fashion catches the attention of the Baroness enabling her to become closer to the Baroness than her fellow co-workers. This interaction put forth in motion a shocking revelation which unearthed the long lost ""Cruella"" and necessitated the application of the Cruella manner of approach.In the long run, Cruella manages to pave her way and grow her talent amidst the rollercoaster of emotions and crazy events.The fashion sense of the movie is quite ravishing and definitely an eye candy. The movie brought to life the beauty of fashion at all ages & times.It also dwells on the importance of applying creativity in everything done because that is what makes each person stand out.The costume designer really did an impeccable job as each fashion item worn in the movie was extremely astonishing.The soundtrack of the movie only added to the numerous reasons why it's a must watch, ranging from gothic to punk rock to others, the soundtrack really fell in line with the mood of the movie and made each scene more lively.It goes without saying that this movie is an absolute must watch and if you're a fanatic for fashion then you'll love it more. The movie didn't fail in arousing that thrill in the viewers. It also succeeded in passing across the message which is creativity,stand out,make a difference, pursue your dreams,be yourself,appreciate those who care about you,stay true to yourself and always remain strong no matter what life throws at you.Personally,I found this movie mind blowing and it's absolutely recommendable.",Cruella

The soundtrack is awful, with music that interrupts scenes. They completely demolished Cruella's character, making her a bore to watch. Cruella is usually a showstealing character, but the Emma Stone version is just here for eye-candy. There are lots of plot-holes and inconstancies and they race-bent characters for extra clout points. This isn't a feminist movie, it's simply tricking you into thinking it is. Just watch Joker.",Cruella

1598,pdominic-30311,An overproduced steamy poo,4,28 June 2021,"Yes, you read that right. Unfortunately for Disney, the mighty mouse-house has done it again; re-hashing old IP's for money printing seems to be the only thing motivating the studio anymore. Walt would be spinning in his grave.The script leaves little to be desired; I'm supposed to believe this 're-imagined' story of Cruella De Vil centers around some lost, misunderstood wonder child who just can't ever be understood by the world around her? Her character isn't even dark or layered in misfortune and misery (mildly speaking). In any realistic scenario, someone of her 'brilliance' would be shoehorned into a gifted program and placed under special care. But, sure, let's suspend disbelief for a few moments and dig into the crux of the problem.Emma Stone, Thomson and star cast alike do their best with what they have. A commendable job if I'm being generous. However, it's simply overproduced. What it lacks in script, substance, heart and grit, is made up in flashy action sequences and expensive CGI. This is where it got the majority of the score is in my books. The overall audio and visual quality of the film is top notch but that's all you're really getting; I suppose it was entertaining at the surface. Don't forget to check your brain at the door.Another 2 hours killed when scrolling through Netflix proves fruitless. Thanks, I guess.",Cruella
1599,ericsandrade,Exciting and Twisted,9,29 June 2021,"Cruella is a movie where you already kind of know how the story ends. We know Cruella can't die because this is done in the past before 101 Dalmatians. And movies like this, can sometimes be predictable and quite boring. However Cruella has just the right amount of change to make it interesting and a little twisted.I was especially curious to how the writers were going to make her evil and yet still have cheer for us. And that's where I think they lose the last star... Cruella isn't evil but rather ruthless and revengeful. Which makes us the audience scratch our heads to how this woman goes on to try to kill puppies for their fur. I think they lose a star because this movie isn't close enough to the 101 dalmatians. Cruella in both movies cannot be the same person. We can see that from her relationship with her ""family"". Which she obviously didn't have in the 101 Dalmatians movie.Finally though I think this was a breath of fresh air. I thought the story was twisted and exciting every step of the way although I already knew the characters. I think Emma did an amazing job with both Estella and Cruella , and really portrays the anger, sadness, determination and ambitions of Cruella perfectly. I loved it.",Cruella
1600,maggiexue-86425,Absolutely horrifying,1,29 June 2021,I like the costume design & style.It makes me feel so horrified that people actually found the plot interesting???? It's just 2 self-centred narcissistic psychos fighting each other and treating everyone else around them like trash and people still love to help them???? All the characters are the tools for either Cruella or Baroness. None of the character is developed and I don't see the movie show any effort in doing so. Cruella and Baroness has the most annoying personality irl but they are somehow liked on the screen???? Hello???? Am I the only one feel that???? Ik I shouldn't expect on commercial movie can give me any enlightenment in life but that's a total waste of time.

1604,apgray-96605,"Not great, not terrible.",2,5 July 2021,"There are so many things personally wrong with this movie. The original Cruella was snappy and charismatic. She was mean but it worked because she was god among her peers. This doesn't work because she has humble beginnings. She didn't seem regal and powerful like before, just mean. I don't know why her lackeys stay with her after all she's done to them. They have absolutely no reason and can easily survive on their own. I feel like her having a dog would negate the kidnapping and attempted or implied murder of other dogs since she'd know what that'd feel like.Putting the other movie aside this was honestly just good fun, it was a bit all over the place but it can be clever and I honestly love every character except for Estella.

1620,wswain-99905,Worse than I expected,1,28 July 2021,"Cruella is an awful character in this movie. They tried to make a Joker, with the whole psychopathic villain origin story, but Disney insists on portraying Cruella as the good guy. She kills 3 dogs in this movie, and the only reason we know this is because of a single throwaway line. This is Cruella we're talking about, the woman who trapped 99 puppies so she could kill and skin them. Not to mention Emma Stone's poor performance. She essentially plays two characters, Cruella and Estella, neither of whom she does well. She plays Cruella like an over-the-top villain (Even though the writers made her a hero) with an annoying and poor british accent, and a tendency to contradict her own character (e.g. Caring enough about her henchmen to get worried when they are threatened by the baroness, but not enough to refrain from threatening them herself after one of them expresses his frustration with her very sudden personality change.) Estella, on the other hand, is just a ripoff Clark Kent. She bumbles around like an idiot as though she's just hiding her true self but she still makes decisions that make no sense. (If Cruella is her true-self, then why would she continue being an idiot when no one is watching? She doesn't have split-personality because we are told in the beginning Estella has to hide Cruella.)There is very little conflict in this movie and what conflict there is is based on flimsy reasons. As I mentioned above one of her henchmen tells her that he doesn't want to work with Cruella, and prefers Estella. She then yells at him, and this is never explored again. Cruella kills the Baroness' dogs, and all we get is one line telling us it happened, and then that's it. The Baroness gets replacement dogs, and Cruella doesn't kill again. The only reason Cruella hates the Baroness is that she sees her wearing her mother's necklace, and later finds out the baroness was responsible for the mother's death (Of course, Cruella is indirectly responsible but after finding out the Baroness had a part in it she loses all responsibility). How does this conflict play out? A montage. We see a couple shots of Cruella crashing some fashion shows with music playing in the background, which comes off as petty more than real revenge. The climax of the movie has Cruella exposing the Baroness for trying to kill her, and then the Baroness going to jail. Did the movie forget who the main character is? This is Cruella we're talking about, she's a horrible person, so why wouldn't you have Cruella brutally murder the Baroness to show her lack of empathy? Is it because Disney can't resist making their villains into likeable people? In the Joker, we understand why Arthur Fleck has become the Joker, but that doesn't make his actions any less disturbing. If Disney wanted to make a dark film, they should've made Cruella actually evil.Also, while the visuals may be the only thing I have an ounce of praise for, Disney made the choice to use CGI dogs. Remember the live action 101 Dalmatians in the 90s, where they trained a dog to do household chores, and other impressive displays? Because in Cruella they just took the easy way out, and the movie is significantly worse for it. Instead of having actual character, the dogs in this movie are just overproduced trash that only exist to either be raging murderous animals or cute. The original's dogs had much more character, and they were a significant part of the movie, as they should be. But Cruella? The dogs feel like they were thrown in solely because the original had it, and not because Disney wanted to make them a part of Cruella's character.Overall, Cruella was a disappointing movie, and a part of the trend of Disney abusing their old classics and clearly not understanding what their predecessors wanted to express with the characters. I wouldn't recommend watching it, nor would I recommend watching any of the other Disney remakes, as they have all been terrible. At this point, the only thing keeping Disney going is Marvel, and that's been downhill since Endgame.",Cruella

So anyone who knows the movies knows she is white, and not a reporter. Anita was also into fashion design. They started off with the fact that they new one another all their lives. Now in the Dalmatians movie the first clue, and I quote ""How long have you worked for me"" says Cruella. Next and I am still on Dalmatians the movie, she had know Idea about Dalmatians, when the movie Cruella shows us that she is the one that sends Roger and Anita a puppy each, ""Huh"" Seems odd again.

People told me it's like ""The Devil (hah!) Wears Prada"", but while having certain analogies, Cruella is so much fun!Granted, I have many VOGUE covers on my wall directly from their store, so the whole theme and setting would fit me. And I was also kind not sure if I'd like the two side characters of the gang. While they were fine, the whole movie caught me from the first second.The high production quality is norm for Disney. The actors are incredible. What I am surprised about is the whole rollercoaster of mini genres: First the intro, then some mini-heist portion, then revenge, heist, revenge. I don't want to go into detail, but it is a great mix while featuring great visuals, awesome costumes and so much sweet, sweet and clever revenge!Cruella as a character is incredible and I'd love to see more of her well-dosed ""mean-ness"". Also, can't deny the looks Disney gave her are a blast - one of the few villains who deserve to wear long leather gloves!The reason I did not give 10 stars is the fact 10 means ""can't get better"", and there are some quirks.

Cruella has dogs and tolerates them and in 101 she hated them. Cruella met Anita in elementary/middle school and in 101 Anita worked for her and cruella was a bit older. In cruella Roger was a lawyer who was quite a bit older than them and in 101 he was a song writer and about Anita's age.

1657,huggerz28,"I love it. Great soundtrack, great story amazing outfits",9,31 May 2021,"But that still doesn't make total sense because...
The ending of this new movie shows Anita and Roger receiving the puppies from Cruella, so maybe we're supposed to think that Cruella sent them those two puppies to orchestrate their meeting so that she could eventually buy their dogs? But that feels like a really big stretch. Why wouldn't she just... buy the puppies for herself and raise them all in that huge house? Is the Roger/Anita meeting in the other movies pure chance? HOW does this make sense??.And the biggest problem, IMO, with the 202@,1 movie is that it still doesn't adequately explain why a person would want to skin a bunch of dogs. Like, yes, her mom was killed by Dalmatians, but... skinning puppies?! It feels a little drastic for anyone, but maybe that's just me. The movie seems to want to tell the origin story of the Cruella character without really diving into how dark and twisted the character is, and that's probably because it's a movie meant for middle schoolers who don't actually want to root for someone who murders dogs for coats. Just a thought! At least the clothes were fun??",Cruella

1670,gipsyblood,What a Surprise!,10,31 May 2021,"Honestly, I had very low expectations for this movie. It turned out to be a bigger surprise than I expected. In a nutshell, Cruella is phenomenal. The film feels rebellious and captures a true sense of horror within the darkness and cynicism of the title character. Along with a great performance from Emma Thompson, who is infused with her greatness throughout the entirety of the film, Emma Stone once again proves why she is so highly regarded in the film community. Craig Gillespie's direction has always included impressive set designs, costumes, and music selections. With this film, Gillespie shows off to perfection his understanding of what it takes to captivate an audience. Cruella is, without a doubt, the best live-action Disney adaptation to date, and it will likely stay that way for many years to come. Digital dogs didn't appeal to me, though. It would be only fair that the best costume designer won an award.",Cruella

Emma Stone was fantastic. The twists and turns were so enjoyable and the soundtrack is perfectly complimentary and helps the movie hit all the right notes. The supporting cast, including the dogs, added great color and comedy, and helped Emma Stone's Cruella shine. The nods to the original cartoon were an added treat.

1689,pinkpiggy234,Walt Disney would be heartbroken,1,5 September 2021,"I was extremely excited to watch this film and see how Cruella de Vil became the mad women she is. Instead I see another money grabbing remake that dwindles her character down to another ""women-empowered"" disappointment. Cruella in the original cartoon was empowered due to her mad insistence of achieving what she wants, a fur coat made of Dalmatian puppy fur, so much that she would push down anyone in her way. She was not ""empowered"" by being a women-boss and having the basic ""evil"" requirements for a Disney villain (a villainous pet, a life of crime, power, etc). Disney is so concerned of having parents blame them for showing their children ""how"" to be truly evil, that they make Cruella the stereotypical ""evil"" villain already found in society instead of the true mad women she is. They have forgotten that the world of film is not the real world so it doesn't need to follow societal rules, especially since children aren't idiots that would see a fiction film and think its ok to kill 99 puppies. They have forgotten that they shouldn't be the one in charge of parenting other's children. Disney needs to give children imaginative, new stories, not disappointing remakes that bring nothing new or important to the world just because society tells them the components they need to include and exclude.The writers and film crew may have all been amazing in their field, but these societal bans on what is allowed in films has left these writers lost on how to write a new, ingenious remake. It is a live action film, but they view it as if it was a cartoon. The movie just felt ridiculous since it was so unrealistic. They had a chance to make the story melt into the real world, and they failed the story by keeping it in the ""magical"" Disney realm. For example, in the film her hair is natural, not aesthetics. She blames herself for her parent's death, just like every other new Disney main character. She is obsessed with dogs due to her pathetic childhood and even has a dog sidekick, instead of wanting to murder 99 puppies. They make her so she just wants to be powerful in the world via her fashion and alpha tendencies, but that is not why she truly is deciphered as powerful in the cartoon. They just made her ""misunderstood"" in the live action so it could connect to its little girl audience. Cruella never wanted to be powerful in the cartoon. As she is very self centered and mad, she just wanted to be fashionable for herself and she did this via furs. She wanted furs; she loved furs; she was mad for furs; she would do absolutely anything for furs, even kill 99 puppies. But this is not because she wanted to rise up in the world, but because she was so obsessed with them. Her two male minions weren't her old buddies, they were just another two conniving people who wanted the money Cruella offered them. Why did the writers make them have a friend relationship when there was never one to start with? For pete's sake, she constantly screams at them and whacks them in the cartoon. They only did it to create sympathy for a mad women, which they didn't even need to do because they destroyed her madness in other ways so no sympathy was even needed. Finally, the dog sidekick. Not only is the CGI horribly done for all the animated animals, but why would Cruella want a dog? She loves furs as I repeated many times. If she had a pet dog, it would have been a throw rug or nice hat the moment it was big enough to make a nice sized fur pelt. She was definitely not an animal person, and the writers should have at least included this aspect into her new characterization. Overall, I could not stay interested in the story due to it being so ridiculously contrived and unrealistic. They tried to save it with big names like Emma Stone, but failed miserably. I was shocked when I saw the high reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomato. I used to trust these sites rating systems, but they have gone to trash because of Disney's manipulation to change what is considered quality film for its new viewers eyes. MetaCritic was the most honest about it, and even then it still didn't have a horrendous review, but at least I know the most honest critics now. Walt Disney has had his heart broken for years from all the originality being lost from his creation, Disney, but Cruella has definitely made that crack much bigger.",Cruella
1690,ulpyon,Lives up to its hype!,10,26 May 2021,"The trailer was amazing and I had high hopes for this movie. It really does live up to its hype. The extravagant costumes, the acting, the story, the characters, the 101 Dalmatians easter eggs - everything is so delightful and satisfying to watch. It's more of a heist movie instead of the usual dreamy, all-CGI Disney movie. Emma Stone delivers Oscar-worthy acting here. We can totally see her transition from Estella to Cruella, driven by anger, sadness and revenge. Emma Thompson is so charming as the villain, you can't stand her but you can't hate her either. Overall, best Disney stand-alone movie yet - even better than Maleficent. Unfortunately this movie might not be suitable for small kids.",Cruella

1694,fayela86,HATERS ARE MISSING THE LESSON HERE,8,12 June 2021,"All I can say is watch the film and make up your own mind.A lot of the negative reviews are slating not only cruella but maleficent as well by saying we shouldn't feel for the villain why is disney ruining our childhood villains that were pure evil.Well what they are missing is that the truth is we are all evil its just a case ofA) upbringing (like in cruella where mother tried to raise her to be gd and due to loving her mother tried to be gd ""love me into shape was the plan I suppose""B) everyone has there breaking point (cruella says it herself "" born brilliant born bad and a little bit mad"" but given the events that happen to her through out her life and the information she finds out its enough to make anyone snap) (maleficent although nice to start with to have that much rage over being so betrayed by the man she loved had to of had some evil in her to begin with)Even serial killers although evil conform to society while growing up until something triggers them.These films are just explaining what these characters triggers areAs for the elements of the film that kinda change the original story well I guess we'll need a cruella 2 to explain that as, as far as I can see the only thing that's changes it is what she does with the dutchess dogs and her relationship with Anita.But I suddenly have a theory about that that truly does make her evil but since I don't wanna give any spoilers away I guess I'll have to wait and see. If they do a sequal.Both Emma's are brilliant in this film love the character of arty would love a friend like himSome have commented they would of liked a mod to Glenn closes' portral of cruella to of been in it a look in mirror etc however as great as Glenn was it was a complealy different direction as think about it original animated cruella fierce evil crazy scary but the live action films had cruella be more slapstick with the things that happened to her and her reaction to it Where as in cruella its back to her being a serious character that's unhinged at times and caring at others due to the ""love me into shape was the plan I supose"" that she had for about the first 10 years of life.",Cruella

1708,fahmiamarrilo,"A Surprise to be Sure, but A Welcome One",9,19 June 2021,"Cruella is, dare i say, the best movie Disney had produce in the past years. The cinematoraphy, camera work, and, obviously, the production and set design are georgeous. I had my doubt, since both Malevicent movies are mediocre at best and their live action adaptation of Lion King, Dumbo, and Mulan seems so uninspired and downright lazy in terms of storytelling.Although, Cruella isnt without its flaws. The writing can sometime be too predictable, hence ruining the entire plot twist feels. Some plot point, which i won't uncover here, feels unnecessary and a few characters are written as a tree 1 type role without growth in terms of character development. Emma Stone on the other hand, is indeed the star of the film and although we know her work in Birdman and La la Land, she is mindblowingly great with british accent.But the flaws won't take you away from the experience and the beautiful piece the it is. I wouldn't be surprised if this film got nominated for Oscar for cinematography, production design, and best actress.Summary, a must watch film.",Cruella

I'll give praise to the costume and sets departments as the visuals are striking, but unfortunately that's about the only praise I have.Also, the moral seems to be 'treat everyone around you like garbage and eventually you'll get your way,' so I wouldn't even recommend showing the kids.",Cruella
1723,rosejake,"Bland, predictable, cliche",4,3 June 2021,"I (a 30 something man) couldn't finish it, along with my 13 year old song and my 20 something Disney-obsessed finacee. We all love the original and have watched it more times than we can count. Even the first live action version was decent in memory.In this version, we spend way too much time with Estella as a child, although the origin alter ego Creulla, which might have been interesting, was given one sentence of attention. She conveniently meets Anita, Horace, and Jasper as a child which just comes across as lazy writing. Her ascension into the world of fashion is completely boring and predictable.The idea that we should root for a one-dimensional villain we know turns out to be a puppy killer is ludicrous. As a musician, I also have to note there's back to back songs for the first half of the movie, the choices so cliche and unimaginative. This continues the streak of Disney duds along with Mulan and Raya.",Cruella

1727,ruthi3lyds,Poorly executed.,5,29 May 2021,"I have very mixed feelings over this film. I went in with such high hopes and came out somewhat deflated.Emma Stone is phenomenal as are the rest of the cast. There are some really iconic moments when it comes to the costuming in the film, Jenny beaven did an excellent job in the design there. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack and visually it really can be quite spectacular.The story however really let it down for me. Something was really lacking within the writing and it just didn't sit well with me. She's a villain but I'm supposed to be sympathising with her, she's horrendous to her ""friends"" and is a bad person but I'm supposed to be on her side There was a lot within the plot that just didn't make sense. It all just came across...messy. If you're going to write a villains story, write a villains story.The film itself does feel quite long. If I were to go again it would be purely for the design aspect and the soundtrack and to marvel at the treasure that is Emma Stone. This film had so much more potential.",Cruella

We left and not only was I disappointed my wife actually said ""Disney has gone down hill"" the same woman who has an entire collection of Disney classics on her shelf completely shunned this movie. For what was spent on this movie, I'd be shocked if they actually screened this for test audiences before it was approved for release.

Except a good storyline,5,2 June 2021,"The acting is great, Emma Stone definitely made me hate Cruella with her acting, the clothing is fantastic, the songs are played at the right moment and the CGI of the news articles is well done.However... The villains have little to no real motive, Cruella has almost nothing to do with fur coats and apparently was ""born this way"" which kinda defeats the purpose of an origin story for a villain.Is really hard to sympathize and even humanize her when she seems to be the devil on earth, leading to a confused felling when everyone keeps helping her without a good reason to do so.",Cruella
1733,dariamuklewicz,Unexpectedly amazing,9,2 June 2021,"I agree with some of the other reviews that the trailer didn't necessarily have me excited to see the movie. However, I left the movie in awe of what I just saw. First of all, Emma Stone is a brilliant actress. She beautifully plays a dynamic role - one moment she is clumsy and a normal person, the next she is the most confident woman on the streets. Additionally, the outfits in this movie were absolutely incredible. So many scenes began with elaborate, eye-catching outfits on the baroness. I had to remind myself to listen to the script instead of being in awe of how beautiful the outfits were. Overall, I was really surprised with this movie and it makes me want to rewatch 101 Dalmatians now that we see this side of Cruella!",Cruella
1734,slyespinosa20,One of the best movies I've watched this year!,10,17 June 2021,I think the current rating (7+) for this movie was a mistake. I'll even rate this 11 out of 10.,Cruella

1736,talitha-furlan-68-590952,There was an attempt....,1,30 May 2021,"I did not have high expectations for this movie, being that
A. No one could replace Glenn Close
B. That person certainly will not be Emma Stone
With that being said, i did try to enjoy it as an easygoing movie. Unfortunately all I saw was a poor attempt at telling the original story, and the changes that were made were definitely not logical or practical; that includes the use of magic (what the hell was that?? Where was the need??) and the cheap and inattentive character arc Cruella suffers. Cruella could be so heartless that she could kill puppies just to be made into clothes and even tried to throw them into a grinder and cook them alive out of spite for making a fool out her, and that's what made her so terrifying as a kid! She is like any other rotten person in real life. Making her have magical powers really made me roll my eyes.On the other hand, this new Cruella actually has childhood trauma from having the dogs kill her mother. So now she's a victim. A woman who dreams about torturing dogs. A victim.To top it all off, Cruella ends up empathizing with the puppies and ends up forgiving them.Would you kindly take care of dogs that killed your mother?Also the visuals were overrated, the first one has more style and don't even get me started on the CGI. Who would've thought Disney of all places wouldn't have the budget to make better visual effects?",Cruella
1737,livi-73-759045,An excellent origin story with Oscar worthy acting.,9,31 May 2021,"I was a bit skeptical about Cruella as I have not been a fan of the Disney live action remakes. Other than Maleficent, I have been disappointed. So when I heard that Cruella was coming out I was not really interested, but being that I love Emma Thompson in pretty much everything, I figured I would give it a go. Cruella is a almost perfect villain origin story. Emma Stone is exquisite as Estella/Cruella and plays beautifully against the cruel and nasty Baroness. That's how you know a great actor, when you can hate them so much but love them in the next movie you see them in. Emma Thompson is one such actor and Emma Stone is another. So thank you Disney, keep doing these amazing villain origin stories and leave the live action remakes alone.",Cruella

1739,lamagiafilmes,Nice try,1,31 May 2021,"As usual, hollywood exploits amazing soundtrack for the lack of drama or internal movement on the mise en scene. Great actors badly used, I'm sorry but the tone was all over the place and not even funny. Unrealistic even if it's a fantasy comedy. Almost at the end the script twists dramatically for no reason, there's too much external action when there is no internal action in the characters. If it is a biopic about someone who is going to become evil, try and talk about the internal need of a person being unmet and the morality of evil. I think that kids movies can be smart this is not it. The script was awful.",Cruella

How awful was this seriously? Cruella likes dogs? She doesn't harm animals eventhough the movie is supposed to take place in the 70s? What a joke. I guess Disney just wanted their own Harley Quinn. Also how are you punk when you make use of the most expensive types of dresses and fabrics out there? That's not what punk is about and I wasn't in the 70s.

The Dalmatians during most of the movie and the scene with Emma Stone near the end is terrible.Storyline - at parts is was predictable.

This movie was everything a re-telling should be. It was fun, creative, engaging, and for a woman who trademarks in black and white, was filled with color.

1788,alanpeterlewis,Surprise Smash!,9,27 June 2021,"I am glad I went into this film with no expectations - this was a real surprise smash! The two starring Emmas (Stone and Thompson) were superb, hanming up the posh evil English accents just the right amount; the junior version of Stone's character actually made me think that she might grow up to be played by Felicity Jones (I wonder if she was ever on the possible cast list). Thompson's entrance was spectacular, and reminded me very much of a 60s Diana Rigg. The plot was unexpectedly pleasantly engaging, and the film has a really lovely attention to period detail, including a nice selection of now-classic cars. A slight feeling that the Special FX budget had run out near the end is really my only slight negative, but perhaps we can blame lockdowns for that. Musically, much was achieved through a very well-chosen variety of historically accurate pop songs, almost Nora Ephron-like in the aptness of their selection. Composer Nicholas Britell (If Beale Street Could Talk, The Big Short) did a fine job contributing original scoring, present in an understated yet essential role, which is as it should be. Most importantly of all... the much loved song ""Cruella De Vil"" was not massacred in a trying-to-update-for-the-modern-generation way! Instead a really nice solution to this potentially thorny issue was found, which I will not spoil for you here - well done, director Craig Gillespie and team - a triumph!",Cruella

1797,andrewkishtuh,Had some fun moments. About what I expected.,4,10 June 2021,"There is the ghost of a movie I would have liked here. Not surprisingly, it feels pretty calculated. I think the decision to make this an origin story is a bit of a questionable one.Estella doesn't really undergo any character growth, (which I'm fine with) but rather she stops surpressing her more ambitious personality traits. The whole backstory with her mom dying feels unnecessary, hacked together, and more like an obstacle for the actual story to start. All of the characters are utilitarian cutouts anyway.I'd much prefer it if the film focused on the fashion and industrial espionage angle. I loved the montage of her upstaging her tyrannical boss as Cruella. I wasn't even bothered that Estella & company have seemingly unlimited resources and flawless execution every time.*Moderate Spoilers*
There's a scene that I have to remark on, where it's demonstrated that the Baroness legally owns a design that Estella made while off the clock. Naturally I'm thinking, ""Oh, she's going to realize that Estella is Cruella and legally steal all of her designs. How's Estella going to get out of that?"" Except that doesn't happen. Instead, the Baroness realizes that Estella is Cruella and tries to burn her alive. On the surface, this seems like a dumb decision, but I'm sure there is a reason they didn't use my idea. Is it because Disney didn't want to make intellectual property theft a plot point because they actually do this to their employees? Is it merely bad writing? I'm inclined to say yes.The nonsense that's revealed about ancestry and birthright really ruined it for me. Rather than being an exceptional individual, Estella is essentially born into the plot, and poetic justice requires that she triumph. I thought this was a film about ambition, not karmic retribution.The licensed music feels pretty superficial too. I'm not usually one to complain about this kind of thing, and maybe this sounds pretentious, but the music has a tendency to lyrically restate rather than inform or even reinforce what's textually happening in the film.It's fine. Not bad. Not overall good. Disappointing for sure. The dalmatians didn't need to be in it.",Cruella
1798,aidocyt,A cocktail mix!,2,5 June 2021,"I agree with some people that this movie is a mix of other ones: The Devil Wears Prada, Maleficent, the Hunger Game.. I can even list out more movies/show that this Cruella reminded me to while yawning through it: Edward Scissorhands, Sherlock, Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street, Birds of Prey.. And the plot that Estella princess was supposed to be killed at birth but was saved and raised by a maid and later found out her identity is actually very popular in Asian dramas!At some point I wish this were a musical movie. Would be somewhat less boring. 2 stars for costumes.",Cruella
1799,patifranco,Much more that expected,9,17 July 2021,Amazing movie ! Perfect Music ! I Love this Kind of Villain!!Must see !,Cruella
1800,junewmikkelsen,"Incredible, breathtaking.",10,30 May 2021,"Emma Stone is as always a masterpiece. Disney proves yet again (...wandavision) they are the biggest for a reason. They are the best. Problematic as it may be, we must acknowledge that fact first.",Cruella
1801,juanignaciog,GREAT MOVIE,8,30 May 2021,It has great costumes and great performances by Emma Stone and Emma Thompson.,Cruella
1802,afamnaper,Best movie I have seen in a very long time,10,20 June 2021,Wow. Friendship. Love. Cruelty. Madness. It was so beautifully executed. Every scene. Every word. Every costume. Every song fit perfectly. Acting was superb across the board. This was every bit a Disney movie with a honest and authentic edge. I absolutely loved this movie.,Cruella
1803,mbrauer-28680,Best movie in a while,10,29 May 2021,I've been looking forward to the release of this movie for several weeks following the previews. I was a bit nervous that they gave away the movie during the previews but was most pleasantly surprised with several twists and turns I didn't anticipate. The Emmas were each fantastic as was the entire supporting cast. The costumes and especially the designer dresses were amazing and added to the overall style of the movie.I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. I'm typically a super hero movie guy and feel like this is the best movie I've seen since Avengers: Endgame.,Cruella
1804,kelly_hutchinson,Why has Hollywood not put the two Emmas together before?,9,6 June 2021,"Exceptional acting from these two. Emma Thompson knocks it out of the park, as always and Emma Stone as Cruella is simply delicious. Well done, all.",Cruella
1805,rsrahulsingh-73938,Loved it!,10,27 August 2021,"Loved it disney, great work very entertaining, loved both the emmas playing there character beautifully. The movie kept me involved till the end. Must watch movie. People those who are giving low ratings i guess there genre is different because Cruella is one of the best in its genre. ""Cruella is not that cruell"".",Cruella
1806,naturalblonde-19604,How has this got such a high rating?,4,29 August 2021,"Have these high ratings been bought? The film is too long, boring, didn't laugh once. The costumes and look of the film are the only reason I've given it 4 stars. Shame as the cast looked brilliant.",Cruella
1807,rhadoovinsanity,"Boring, predictable and unoriginal",1,2 June 2021,"It's hard to understand who this movie is for.The humor is outdated, the plot is predictable and it's just plain boring to watch.I don't understand who's giving the high ratings.",Cruella
1808,DannyYoung,The De Vil Wears Prada,7,4 June 2021,Fantastic movie! The fashion themes were spectacular!,Cruella
1809,animemicheal,awful,2,27 October 2021,"I hate this movie, not in any way similar character wise to 101 Dalmatians. And they essentially give her full credit for creating punk aesthetics/dress, and costumes are historically inaccurate. I hate this movie with a passion, i give it a 2/10 because at least there was some aesthetic parts.",Cruella
1810,andersoncruz-57945,A stunning movie!! Emma Stone brutal,9,4 June 2021,"When the first trailer came out I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies this year. The movie was incredible and visually stunning.I really enjoyed it too much, the performances, costume design, production design, soundtrack, direction were spectacular and amazing, I think it is one best movie of the year and the Disney's best live-action, I hope a sequel very soon and more movies like this,please!",Cruella
1811,ericsamer,Perfect origin story,8,29 May 2021,As someone who grew up watching the cartoon and then the Glenn close movies in theaters yes all of them of them. I really like this edition to the franchise. No I kind of want to dig out my damnation from Disneyland from storage lol. Emma Stone was and they sort of maybe left room for a sequel fingers crossed.,Cruella
1812,nickyalex-37297,Amazing!,10,6 June 2021,I didn't have any expectations for this movie and I don't know many people that did. I went to see it just for the fun of going to the movies after a year of not going. I absolutely loved it! I was not expecting it to be so good. I recommend this movie to everyone. A lot of people aren't planning on seeing this movie because they haven't liked past live action movies but this one has been the best by far. I'm obsessed.,Cruella
1813,carrieszumanski,"It doesn't disappoint if you love fashion, fun & music",8,8 June 2021,"The people giving harsh criticism to a fun Disney film need to really lower their expectations. It's not like you're going in there expecting to see a potential Oscar nominated film. It's called ""entertainment"" and that's what this movie 💯 percent did. My husband and I went to see it and he thoroughly enjoyed it and that's saying something because my husband never watches Disney films! We both loved the soundtrack, the dark humor, and well, we were enjoyably entertained! Sure, the
young Cruella doesn't jive with how the original Disney Cruella is portrayed. She actually LIKES dogs and has one of her own. The younger Cruella is softened and less despicable. Just go and enjoy this wonderfully put together film and take it for what it is and you won't be disappointed. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are a joy to watch.",Cruella
1814,samernphysics,Professional performance and direction and care of details,8,6 June 2021,"Despite the few gaps in gaps the story, there are alot of thing got my attention in the movie.1. The movie has a special attention to fashion and clothing. You may not be interested in that facor in any other movie.2. Emma's facial features and perfectly fitting the role. She has the devil smile, making her the best choice for this character.",Cruella
1815,abd-22791,Good for woman,8,31 May 2021,"It's very good more likely for woman, but I enjoy it
Thanks for it.",Cruella
1816,shaharw-54082,Surprisingly Good,9,10 June 2021,I like it!Really good.Not a usuall disney movie.,Cruella
1817,talhamehar007,Absolutely Stunning.,10,9 July 2021,"I was not expecting much from this movie. But absolutely loved how amazing and stunning the movie was, the performances from both Emma's, the dresses, the cinematography, i was amazed. Disney never fails to maze us.",Cruella
1818,michalhawke,Simply amazing,10,22 July 2021,"The best movie I have seen in ages! Funny, creative, cruel just enough, simply perfecr!",Cruella
1819,ninietran,Absolute delight !,10,12 September 2021,"This movie is a masterpiece. It was a real delight to watch. Pretty clothes (obviously), great scenery, wonderful actors, I couldn't think of any moment I would change in it. Or maybe add a Stanley Tucci cameo would be great (I don't know why, I just see him doing great in there), or even previous 101/102 Dalmatians actors cameos, why not ? It's just a nod.Anyway, while watching the film, I had this rare feeling that I would definitely stop and replay it instantly from the beginning. Of course, there could have been other ways to turn things but I love it this way. Will definitely rewatch. Emma Stone is perfect ! And Emma Thompson is monumental. Well done Disney ! Your last live actions since Cinderella are flawless !",Cruella
1820,rahulthapa-93261,Great movie but..,10,2 June 2021,"Great movie thrill, anticipation, excitement every thing you want from a movie is there but that smoke in cruella's hand is soo missing it's not a movie for children so why don't you put it anyway.",Cruella
1821,jeaninekivimaki,Amazing,10,31 May 2021,"Ok, I'm a Disney addict, and I absolutely loved 101 Dalmatians as a kid (and honestly still do.) I was not sure what to expect with this movie, I was excited, but I wasn't super hopeful.This has to be the best live action movie Disney has ever made. Hands down, incredible and unexpected. Everything about this movie was fantastic. The cast was perfect for the roles they played, the costumes were amazing, the music was amazing, and the story was perfect. Definitely holding out hope that they turn this into a sequel (to a prequel?) and do a revamped 101 Dalmatians.Honestly, if you aren't sure if you want to see this, you do. Lol.I just finished it and want to see it again.",Cruella
1822,juliehuey,Made my overweight teen anorexic.,2,21 September 2021,"There is too much narcissistism on both sides. There's no real good guy here, so the movie confused my daughter. She watched this movie over and over again. Then, she stopped eating meals after this movie brainwashed her. This is not safe for kids to watch at all. Why is Disney honoring bad guys and semi-bad guys all of a sudden? Loki? Something wacky is going one.",Cruella
1823,zainsaleem-39068,Just watch it 🔥🔥🔥,10,29 May 2021,"Unique, style, gripping and fun really really loved it.",Cruella
1824,tbird12519,more please!,9,3 June 2021,"Both Emma's and the rest of the cast were perfect for these roles! The costumes were beyond entertaining, but the storyline and execution are what pull this together. Amazing costumes and good acting will not make a film good if the plot does not carry you along (example: live action Cinderella---beautiful, but not original and extremely boring). The only haters of this movie seem to be those that oppose turning a villain into someone you are routing for. I went into this movie knowing that we were going to empathize with her---the same with the musical ""Wicked"" that shows the story of the wicked witch before Oz. It is also rated PG 13 and I would not expect to take someone who can't process the typical Disney movie. I also happen to believe that people are not born pure evil. As far as how Cruella continues on the path to become a puppy killer, I do not expect a sequel that can wrap that up in a way that anyone can swallow. (regarding the person who mentions her glorifying killing dogs--she did not kill any and if a dog viscously attacked and killed your family member, most would have them put down (not that I agree with that--depends on the circumstances)--I would not equate that with glorifying killing animals. I say enjoy the ride this movie takes you on---it is the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time! PS the only reason I gave it a 9, was there were a few scenes with the dalmations that are too obviously CGI and young Jasper I'm afraid was not cast well (very minor part).",Cruella
1825,xxiangel,Amazing !!!,10,18 September 2021,"THANK YOU DISNEY FOR AN AWESOME FLICK. The music, the costumes, the acting, the sets were STUNNING. I couldn't have asked for a better film this year and for the last couple years. Def Oscar worthy !!!!",Cruella
1826,contortionist-39452,Absolutely brilliant!,10,29 May 2021,One of the best films I have ever watched! Soundtrack is also epic!,Cruella
1827,daveweaver-84662,Cruella's de Vil-initely a must see!,9,28 May 2021,"Whether you're a fan of actress Emma Stone, Emma Thompson, or the original animated film, I gave this prequel a 9/10 and urge everyone to go see it. Semi-remembering the original movie from my youth, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with a plot that centered around Cruella's early to young-adult life. There was no disappointment though, as the twisting and turning energy between Cruella (Emma Stone) and the Baroness (Emma Thompson) kept spectators craving more. Capturing a similar feeling one got while watching 'The Devil Wears Prada', the electricity was definitely high throughout the movie as viewers once again stepped into the competitive world of fashion. I thoroughly enjoyed the supporting characters/cast within the film, as they did an excellent job of sustaining the momentum. It was a breathe of fresh air from the constant remakes of the ""exact same film"", a welcomed new perspective on an iconic villain and their background story. If you're wondering how this all leads into '101 Dalmatians', well...go see it for yourself and then judge whether or not Cruella is truly all bad.(Warning: Although not as dark as the DC Universe, this is not your common lighthearted movie. Be ready for prolonged moments of intensity and a dark mood within the scenes themselves.)P. S.
I know this movie doesn't compare to films/theatrical plays like 'Fences', but it's extremely well done for what it is.",Cruella
1828,jaxtonsmom,Nostalgic,10,14 June 2021,I love how this movie sheds light on cruella. The original gave no explanation for why she was the way she was. This movie was awesome. The whole family loved it. 10 out of 10.,Cruella
