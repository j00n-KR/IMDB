0,MartinHafer,"A 10 if you see it in the theater, a 1 or 2 if you see it by yourself.",3,12 July 2021,"Despite my score of 3 for ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", I am NOT saying it is a film to avoid. If you have a theater nearby that allows audience participation (a MUST) or if your local community theater is putting on the play, by all means go! After all, this is a great story to watch with friends and the participation portion can be a lot of fun. But, on its own, it's a film that shocks but isn't particularly good. A few of the songs are nice but the plot just leaves me flat and the acting, at times, is pretty amateurish. No masterpiece...but it can be fun if seen with like-minded friends.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
1,TheLittleSongbird,Best cult movie ever!,9,6 February 2009,"I have this on VHS, and it is one of my all time guilty pleasures. It has a great cast, a catchy music score and unforgettable satire on monster movies, like Frankenstein. If you haven't seen it already, give yourself a treat! I will warn you though, it is extremely silly at times, but that is all part of the fun. And I seriously don't care whether it's poorly made or not and I don't think so personally, all that matters is that it's entertaining, and that is what exactly RHPS is. The cast is wonderful. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick do a great job as Brad and Janet, although I didn't know they could sing, which really surprised me. Richard O'Brien is solid as Riff Raff and he also wrote the songs. Also solid are Patricia Quinn and Peter Hinwood. The best performance, however, comes from Hollywood's most underrated actor, Tim Curry, who I must say looks hot in fishnets and heels. He has a great singing voice, that is always overlooked. FrankNFurter is a landmark performance, but Tim Curry has also done other great films such as Clue, Legend,Muppets Treasure Island, Blue Money and It. (which has his career-best performance by a mile.) Voiceovers include Captain Hook, Slagar, Hexxus, Drake, Forte, Von Talon and the Mouse King. The songs are so catchy, especially ""Time Warp"" and ""Sweet transvestite"" that I actually wanted to dance to the music, but I am a novice at dancing. The complaint about this movie, which is undoubtedly the best cult movie ever, no matter how many times it's been imitated, is the song ""Science fiction"" which is not in the same league as the more uplifting songs. Still I am happy, and lets do the time warp again! 9.5/10. Bethany Cox.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
2,bkoganbing,An LGBT cult item,7,9 October 2015,"Before finally watching The Rocky Horror Picture Show to review I asked a young friend who was visiting me what he thought of it. I offered to give him the DVD when I was finished with it. He said fine, but he thought that The Rocky Horror Picture Show was better as a stage show. God only knows it's revived often enough and has been taken to heart as a cult item with shows in just about every where there's a visible LGBT community. In fact I know at least one person who in Toronto every year plays Dr. Frank N. Furter in a production.The three leads in fact saw their breakout performances in this science fiction parody which takes its plot partly from the Frankenstein story and from the Island of Dr. Moreau. Having Mary Shelley and H.G. Wells as inspiration gives you a good start.Young couple Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon get themselves lost and wind up at the home of mad cross dressing scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter played by Tim Curry. If you've seen both those classic films than you have some idea of the story line.I'll say this if Dr. Frankenstein was gay Peter Hinwood would be exactly what he would dream up for an artificially created man. Whatever happened to him?The musical numbers performed stylishly by drag performers are staged well. And certainly the pyrotechnics are probably better seen in a live production.So I guess I'll have to take my friend's comment and judge that for myself.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
3,Leofwine_draca,Not quite my idea of entertainment,4,3 November 2016,"Possibly the most infamous cult movie ever made, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW was specifically designed to be a camp, cult film. It's full of odd characters in even odder situations and every few minutes everyone starts bursting into song. Now I don't know about you but watching men run around in suspenders and stockings definitely isn't my idea of fun and I'm afraid to say that this film really isn't my cup of tea.For one, I'm not really too fond of cult films like this which try to be cult films - I prefer the sort of film from the '50s which doesn't realise that it's destined for obscurity. However, there are some interesting scenes throughout the film, mainly the take-off of RKO pictures, the creation of Rocky Horror, and the scene where singer Meatloaf is murdered and cannibalised by the aliens.The actors and actresses are an assorted bunch. Susan Sarandon wanders about in her underwear for much of a film, the award-winning Hollywood actress has certainly gone on to better things since this early role in her career. Tim Curry has also gone on to star in such diverse productions as LEGEND and CONGO, receiving lukewarm responses after his astonishing debut here. The Rocky Horror creation himself, Michael Hurst, really didn't go on to much and instead starred in an obscure Australian horror film DEATH WARMED UP and then became the second lead in HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS.Richard O'Brien is also on hand (he wrote the original musical), more familiar to British audiences now for being the one-time host of THE CRYSTAL MAZE, where he used to run around in snazzy clothes, shout and get excited a lot. Also on hand, strangely enough, as the narrator of the story is actor Charles Gray, primarily known to horror fans for his role as Mocata in Hammer's masterpiece, THE DEVIL RIDES OUT. This was popular enough (audience participation played/plays a big part in the success of this item) to warrant a sequel, SHOCK TREATMENT, which I thankfully haven't seen.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
4,SnoopyStyle,"As a movie, it has some fun songs and good camp until it becomes tiresome",7,27 November 2014,Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) are a sweet innocent newly-engaged couple. Their car gets a flat in the rain. They stop at the mansion of transvestite Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) where they meet various weird characters like Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) and Magenta (Patricia Quinn). The Doctor creates golden boy Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood).There are obviously two ways to rate this movie. My first encounter with the movie is when some people put up a viewing party. I didn't know what they were talking about. It was only about 10 people but it was a lot of fun. Needless to say that most of it had nothing to do with the movie. I would give that experience a 9/10. I'm sure watching it in a midnight madness theater would be a 10/10. However that's not really the movie as much as it's the audience participation. The movie itself has some great songs. Its intended camp and craziness is quite compelling. However it wears out its welcome after about an hour. It gets tiresome as it becomes obvious that the film has nothing to offer other than being bizarre.,The Rocky Horror Picture Show
5,Hitchcoc,Not for Me to Criticize,8,17 September 2010,"I was never part of the cult following for this film. I saw it nearly 30 years ago. I went after midnight with a roommate and found the experience quite interesting. I don't criticize people for enjoying life and having fun with something like this. God knows, life can be boring at times and whatever puts a smile on your face and gets you through another day is OK with me. The movie itself is unlike anything I've seen. The songs are clever and over the top. From Tim Curry on down it is one strange kick after another. It is, of course, filled with every representative of what came to be the GLBT experience. It was a bit much for me at times but it was like watching an event that you can't explain to another person. It sounds stupid to describe it and yet it has an unfathomable charm and a place in the movie musical canon. It was kind of cool to see it again, thirty years later.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
6,classicsoncall,"""It was a night out they were going to remember, for a very long time.""",8,23 June 2018,"Well what can I add to the conversation that hasn't already been said about Rocky Horror, both good and bad. It's decadent, bawdy, camp and audacious, and for those of a scientific bent, it serves as a nifty sc-fi flick as well. Actually, for whatever reason, I began watching this film before about three or four times in the past and never got to see the entire thing until this morning. Something always managed to interrupt my viewing pleasure. Except for Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and his fiancee Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon), all the rest of the characters are way over the top and outrageous, so by the time the picture hits it's stride, Brad and Janet have become corrupted as well. I can't say that I approve of the message it sends to teenage and young adult viewers exploring their own sexuality because it's bound to raise all kinds of questions to cause confusion. There's probably no other single movie out there that promotes it's 'let it all hang out' message as forcefully or creatively. But taken at face value, the picture is a garish romp set to an inventive musical score that gets one's energy flowing and feet set to dancing. In fact, and it's kind of embarrassing to admit, but last week my high school graduating class celebrated it's fiftieth reunion, and our dinner/dance evening was capped off with a rousing rendition of 'The Time Warp'! Very appropriate under the circumstances, and you had to know it was a blast when the entire waitstaff looked on in amazement and broke out their cell phone cameras. Those of us who could still get around put on quite the show.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
7,lee_eisenberg,You'd better believe that Susan Sarandon can sing!,10,23 September 2005,"Well, everybody knows that ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is probably the ultimate cult classic; at this point, ""RHPS"" isn't even really a cult movie anymore, due to its prominence. The plot (or whatever it is) of course has Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) and Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) going to a castle run by the bizarre Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a ""transvestite from transsexual Transylvania"". Mostly, the movie seems like a big excuse to be weird, and they do just that to great effect. And who ever would have guessed that Susan Sarandon, now known for serious roles, could do such a cool job singing? So, was ""RHPS"" trying to tell us anything? Who cares? It's just so neat that you just have to sit back and enjoy. And enjoy you will, even if you think that nothing good came out of the '70s (I, for one, don't hold that opinion).",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
8,jboothmillard,The Rocky Horror Picture Show,8,5 March 2008,"I had seen horror musical Sweeney Todd by Tim Burton, and then I saw this cult classic based on the play, I was very impressed. It is a very good send-up of old horror flicks, including Frankenstein, haunted house mysteries, sci-fi clichés and Carry On sexual identity confusion. Basically newly engaged Janet Weiss (young rising star Susan Sarandon) and Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) have their car break down, and they wind up at the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite alien from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania (lol). They also meet brother and sister Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien, who wrote the play) and Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and they have come on a ""special night"", Frank's creation is to be born. This creature, Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood) lives successfully, and after a quick burst in, Frank kills his last creation, rebel Eddie (Meat Loaf). Then in comes rival scientist, and Eddie's uncle, Dr. Everett Von Scott (Jonathan Adams), and Frank is chasing and freezing everyone. The finale, where Frank plans to go back home to Transylvania, and it becomes a floor show (where everyone must be hypnotised), and in the end, Frank and Columbia ('Little' Nell Campbell) die horrifyingly, and the house blasts off, Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott survive with torn clothes and battered bodies. In between, The Criminologist (Diamonds Are Forever's Charles Gray) is commenting on the incidents. Also starring Jeremy Newson as Ralph Hapschatt, Hilary Labow as Betty Munroe Hapschatt and Christopher Biggins as a Transylvanian. The songs (of course all performed by the actors themselves) are all rocking and rich, in particular: ""Sweet Transvestite"", ""The Time Warp"" and ""Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me"", Curry and Sarandon stand out from all the other actors and characters, it is a treat musical. Susan Sarandon was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
9,Woodyanders,Just give in to the absolute pleasure of this cult sensation,9,25 June 2019,"Straight-laced couple Brad (a perfectly drippy portrayal by Barry Bostwick) and Janet (an incredibly sexy and radiant Susan Sarandon) whose car has broken down in a remote area run afoul of flamboyant mad scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter (a delightfully outrageous performance by Tim Curry) and his quirky minions.Director/co-writer Jim Sharman and co-writer Richard O'Brien display a genuinely giddy affection for vintage horror and science fiction movies, with loving nods to everything from ""King Kong"" to ""Frankenstein."" Moreover, the lively song and dance numbers are staged with tremendous rip-snorting gusto, with the rousing ""Time Warp,"" the galvanizing ""Sweet Transvestite,"" and the saucy ""Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me"" rating as definite highlights. Yes, this film comes across as pretty naughty and more than a bit kinky, but fortunately it manages to stay on the right side of racy (i.e., it's never crass or trashy).The game cast have a ball with the zany material: O'Brien as treacherous hunchbacked servant Riff Raff, Patricia Quinn as the equally wicked Magenta, Nell Campbell as smitten groupie Columbia, Jonathan Adams as the uptight Dr. Everett V. Scott, Peter Hinwood as Frank's hunky creation Rocky, Meat Loaf as rowdy greaser Eddie, and Charles Gray as a pompous criminologist. Best of all, this film serves as a gloriously unabashed and uninhibited celebration of do-your-own thing individuality and being true to your own freaky self. Don't dream it, be it indeed.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
10,Tweekums,A must-see camp classic,9,1 November 2009,"Love it or hate it this film is a classic which surprisingly doesn't seem dated, presumably this is because the props and special effects always looked a bit ropey... deliberately so I'm sure.The film opens with Brad proposing to his girlfriend Janet after a friends' wedding, the two of then decide they must go and give the news to their friend Dr Scott in who's class they had first met. On the way they have a puncture and are forced to go to a nearby castle to use the telephone. It is soon clear that something is going on here, there is a strange gathering with an even stranger host in the form of Dr. Frank-N-Furter... played by Tim Curry in over the top form wearing a costume which must be seen to be believed. After the introductions he invites Brad and Janet up to his lab to witness the birth of his creation Rocky; a blond muscle-man wearing skimpy gold underwear. Things get a bit gruesome when a motorcycle riding Eddie, played by Meatloaf, bursts out of a vault singing a song... Frank is not happy about having his moment interrupted kills him with a pick-axe. This doesn't seem to bother people too much and soon the guests have departed and Brad and Janet have retired to separate bedrooms. Once in bed Frank sneaks into each room in turn and proceeds to seduce our previously innocent heroes. Janet doesn't stop there, she goes out and has her way with Rocky. The plot thickens when Dr Scott turns up looking for his nephew Eddie, Frank assumes that Brad and Janet must be spying for Dr Scott. After a rather uncomfortable meal he immobilises them and forces them to take part in a strange floor show. After which underlings Magenta and Riff-Raff announce that they have had enough of Frank's excesses and are going to return to their home planet.While the plot isn't that great it is still a fantastic film due to the wonderfully over the top characters and the memorable songs. The actors did a great job, Susan Sarandon had a great singing voice and looked great wearing little more than plain white underwear for much of the film; she managed to look innocent and incredibly sexy at the same time. Tim Curry's Frank never looked or sounded innocent everything he said and did oozed with decadence and sexuality. Comment must also be made about Richard O'Brien who not only did well as Riff-Raff wrote the original play on which the film is based.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
11,BA_Harrison,"Don't dream it, see it.",10,10 August 2016,"Newly engaged couple Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) are travelling to visit their old college professor Dr. Scott (Jonathan Adams) when their car has a blow out. With no spare tyre, they seek help at a nearby castle, where they encounter a group of decidedly strange individuals, including handyman Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien), maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), groupie Columbia (Nell Campbell), rocker Eddie (Meat Loaf), and, of course, transvestite scientist Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry), who has been busy building a man in his lab (Rocky, played by Peter Hinwood). I remember reading the novelisation of Fame, back in 1982, in which a couple of the characters attended a late night showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show; it sounded like a lot of fun, and as an inquisitive young fan of cult cinema, I knew I had to find a copy of this film. Eventually, I was able to buy it on VHS and was hooked by its uniqueness, its energy and its catchy songs. Over the following years I watched it repeatedly, learning the words and memorising the details.I've just watched the film again for the first time in well over a decade (maybe even nearer two), but within seconds it all came flooding back (as if I was in a Time Warp): the excellent tunes, the quotable dialogue, the wonderful cast. That's the sign of a true cult movie: it's more than just a mere film it becomes ingrained in your very being. The story is extremely silly and scattershot, but that is all part of its charm. Let your inhibitions go, and you'll have a blast. Or to quote Frank N. Furter: give yourself over to absolute pleasure.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
12,moonspinner55,"""Great Scott!""",5,18 November 2006,"Lethargic glitter-rock musical adapted from the stage show (which was initially a failure) about a young, square couple stumbling upon a mysterious castle right out of an old horror movie from the 1930s; the occupants are a decadent and weird bunch, with Tim Curry heading up the brood as lascivious transvestite Frank-N-Furter. Director Jim Sharman packs in quite a lot of low-brow style without much of a budget, and some of his smaller moments are brilliant (particularly the opening wedding scene and our introductions to leads Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon). The hypnotic credits sequence and several of the musical numbers are charged with the same type of sordid showmanship that permeated Bob Fosse's ""Cabaret"", yet Sharman can't do much with the piqued plot (reedy to begin with) that doesn't fulfill the early promise. Sexual shenanigans and strange bedfellow-slapstick somehow lead incongruously to a sci-fi climax, endearing the picture to the midnight-movie masses but certain to leave most other audiences out in the cold. ** from ****",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
13,Coventry,"Yes, it really is the greatest cult-film of all-time.",8,25 December 2005,"It's fairly easy to see why ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" became such a huge cult-favorite so quickly... So huge even that the fans went to screenings all dressed up like drag-queens, singing along with the songs and waving around cigarette lighters. ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" simply is a tremendously inspiring movie and it's almost impossible not to start swinging yourself when the legendary songs such as ""The Time Warp"" and ""Touch Me"" are being sung by the vivid cast. The screenplay is adapted from Richard O'Brien (who also co-stars) play and it still comes across as very wit and all-knowing in its humor. There's spoofing and referring to everything from Universal and RKO-Pictures horror movies over typically 50's science-fiction to Hammer horror and the filming locations & set pieces are leftovers from other classic genre titles. The story is ridiculously simple and merely just introduces a young couple whose car breaks down near a ominous dark castle. When they go there for help, they're sucked into the eccentric world of transvestite Dr. Frank 'N Furter and his bizarre collection of servants and friends. The frenzied doctor created himself a muscled and blond-haired toy-boy and he's in the middle of presenting his creation when Brad and Janet (a great early role for Susan Sarandon) stumble in. The lines and song lyrics are often hilarious and far from politically correct and the lingerie costumes are quite nifty. All the acting performances are terrific but immensely divergent, since Tim Curry's Frank 'N Furter is extremely grotesque whereas Charles Gray's narrating character is straight-faced.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

15,Hey_Sweden,A unique entertainment.,8,14 July 2012,"From its origins as a stage production to its current status as an enduring bit of cult cinema, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is not for everybody but proves to be an irresistible bit of schlock, send-up, and musical. One has to love it for its kink factor, considering the costumes characters are often required to wear, and the performers just completely throw themselves into this thing, especially the dynamic star, Tim Curry. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick play a ""normal"" couple on a trip who get stuck in the middle of nowhere in inclement weather and are forced to seek shelter at a nearby castle, which is being populated by oddball characters from Transylvania, which in the case of this film is a planet. Curry is aces as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, cross dressing scientist who contrives a being he names Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). Paying heartfelt tribute to genre movies and B movies from cinemas' history right from the start, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" never runs out of wild, inventive ideas, energetic musical numbers, and catchy rock tunes. Among said rock tunes are things like ""Wild and Untamed Thing"", ""Dammit Janet"", and the immortal ""Time Warp"". Its off the wall sensibility helps to keep it refreshingly unpredictable, and it's got some pretty good atmosphere going for it. Music and lyrics are by Richard O'Brien, who plays the role of Riff Raff, and who is delightful along with such other great characters as Patricia Quinns' Magenta, Little Nells' Columbia, and Meat Loafs' Eddie. It's hard to imagine somebody watching this and not digging these characters or bopping along to the music. Overall, this is good fun for any fan of B movies, musicals, or rock music, a rousing and raucous experience with plenty of humour and pizazz to sustain it. Followed six years later by ""Shock Treatment"". Eight out of 10.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
16,preppy-3,I'm giving it a 10 but it's NOT a good movie,10,20 June 2005,"Two squeaky clean innocents--Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon)--get a flat tire while driving in a rainstorm. Fortunately there's a castle down the road that might have a phone. They are greeted by Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) (the butler) and his sister Magenta (Patricia Quinn) (a domestic). It's the night when the Transylvanian transvestite Dr. Fank N. Furter (Tim Curry) is making a man (Peter Hinwood) for relieving his...tension. Oh yeah--and it's a musical!OK probably EVERYBODY knows about this by now. It's on video, TV (although horribly edited), DVD and CD. In it's initial release it bombed but became a monster hit as a midnight movie--which still runs to this day.Seeing it on TV, DVD or video doesn't work. Basically this is NOT a good movie. The low budget shows, there are some tacky special effects and a real slipshod script. BUT if you see it WITH THE RIGHT AUDIENCE as a midnight movie it works. The theatres usually have a cast recreating the events happening on screen under the screen and the audience yells out some very funny and dirty remarks. If the audience knows what to do it's great fun. If not it can be deadly dull.I do love this movie (in a way--I'm giving it a 10) but I won't say it's good. It just makes no sense! Still the movie works beautifully when the songs are on. The songs themselves are great and very well-directed. Also the cast is going full throttle all the way through. Curry is just superb, Quinn is hilarious and Bostwick and Sarandon have fun (take a look at some of the faces they making during the ""Time Warp"" song). Also this is a classic of pop culture.

I suppose the main thing that stands out about The Rocky Horror Picture Show is that it is a musical & people burst out into song every so often, the biggest single problem I have with this film is that none of the songs expect the popular & somewhat catchy Time Warp number are that good. None are overly memorable or catchy, I just thought they were very dull songs that didn't inspire me at all. While something like Grease (1978) has three or four instantly recognisable songs which have worked themselves into popular culture the same cannot be said for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The story itself is secondary to anything else but if you want to examine it there's not much here to keep one entertained, character's & plot are basic & certainly didn't do much for me. The film borrows most of it's influence & ideas from other films, just listen to that opening 'Science Fiction Double Feature' song which is littered with name-checks & references.The film does look good with some nice colourful cinematography & some nice sets but it's merely window dressing to try & cover-up what I think is both quite a poor film & musical. The film does have a bit of energy & it's quite often rather bizarre but I am not sure that's enough to justify 100 minutes of your time. The costumes are outrageous & there's plenty of cross-dressing going on but these days it comes across as silly rather than daring or shocking.With a fairly modest budget of about $1,200,000 the film does look nice & is well made. Shot on location & in the studio here in the UK. The acting & singing is alright but I can't bring myself to be any more positive than that.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a film with a strong cult reputation that I can't fathom out at all, what it boils down is that I didn't like it & it's as simple & straight forward as that. An acquired taste to say the least. A sequel Shock Treatment (1981) reunited the writer's, director & some of the main cast & character's.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Utterly tongue-in-cheek from start to finish, the outrageous material is embraced enthusiastically by every cast member with Tim Curry, in his debut film performance, gleefully delivering possibly the campest character to ever grace a cinema screen.To be frank, this isn't really my sort of film, but I would have to be more of miserable curmudgeon than I am to fail to recognise the joie de vivre which inhabits every frame.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Tim Curry enters as the ""sweet transvestite"" and orders his guests to strip to their underwear. Hardly normal and dressing up as such is not observed as normal behavior in society. Why anyone would dress up as such is beyond me. Intriguing with many strange developments until it diminishes in its third act. Directed by Jim Sharman with an outrageous performance by Tim Curry who seduces his reluctant guests while revealing his strong man creation. Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are hilarious as the All-American couple. Richard O'Brian plays the eerie Riff Raff. Meatloaf makes an appearance as a biker named Eddie who makes the mistake of stealing the moment from our ""sweet transvestite.""

21,Aaron1375,What is the big deal?,2,11 April 2003,"This movie is a cult hit, as people like to dress up as the characters and throw toast at the screen during their midnight screenings.  However, for the most part, this film is awful to me.  First off, it is a musical...and I hate musicals for the most part so me hating it could not be helped. Second, this movie has such an awful plot...what is the point of any of this?  Third, the singing of Susan Surandon and Barry Bostwick is totally awful even if I did like musicals.  The story has a couple that wants to get married getting stranded on their way to a friend's house.  They seek shelter in a nearby castle full of dancing and singing people.  Then Tim Curry makes this guy and that is about it other than some really dumb plot twists (What is up with the ending?).  The only parts I can say anything good about are the time warp dance scene and the scene with Meatloaf mainly because they are very high energy.  Also, Surandon and Bostwick aren't doing the singing so the songs aren't totally butchered. Another interesting point is Charles Gray recounting the story.  It is nice to see a former Bond villain doing the role of the criminologist.  All in all though if you like musicals you may want to check it out if you have time to kill, but for the most part this movie did not appeal to me at all.  I also think it is pointless to scream at the movie or throw toast or water at the screen. Quite frankly, you can do that with any movie if you wanted to, there is nothing that really indicates that this movie was made to do stuff like that.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
22,The_Void,Stupidly entertaining celluloid,8,11 August 2005,"I'd had The Rocky Horror Picture Show on tape for a good few months before I finally got round to watching it. I was expecting to hate this film with a passion due to my general dislike for musicals, and the fact that the idea of men wearing stockings and suspenders doesn't really appeal...but, to my surprise, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a damn good time! The songs, most of them famous in their own right, are very catchy (if somewhat irritating), and a great ensemble cast gives life to a whole host of weird and overly camp characters. Quite what the point of this film is, is anyone's guess, as it doesn't really have a plot and if there's any substance at all, I couldn't detect it; but what The Rocky Horror Picture Show does is prove that films don't need to have substance to be great, and can achieve that acclaim by simply being deliriously entertaining. The film, being made in the seventies, does have something of a social value; as it somewhat sums up the carefree attitudes of the decade. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is just out to make sure it's audience has a good time - and although I can see why many, many people hate it, it does achieve it's aim.Tim Curry has the role of his career as Dr. Frank-N-Furter. Camper than fifty rows of tents, Curry gives great vitality to the film, and it's hard to do anything but laugh (or stare in sheer horror, if you prefer) as he performs his entrance song (and the best song in the film) 'Sweet Transvestite'. Despite some other nice performances, Curry is always the standout and I honestly don't think that anyone else could have played the role to such great effect. The film is constantly silly throughout, and this works massively in it's favour as it gives the film free licence to basically do whatever it wants. The Rocky Horror Picture Show can throw absolutely anything at you, and it's easy to buy it because, after seeing 'The Time Warp', it can't really get much more stupid. The film does, however, get a bit too overwhelming at times; and at about the half way point, it throws so many songs into the mix that it's hard to keep up. This is the film that the phrase 'love it or hate it' was made for  it's the sort of film that gets a reaction. If you cant buy into the style and verve of the movie, you will undoubtedly hate it; but if you're in the mood - this is really good stuff. I recommend that everyone sees this movie, as this is the sort of film that people become film fans for. It surprised me anyway...",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

24,StevePulaski,70s at it's best!,9,15 July 2010,"Thirty five years in limited release and still shown in midnight theaters throughout the United States, its The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It was unknown and neglected when in theaters in 1975. But now cherished, loved, and welcomed by a heap of cult and film fanatics around the globe. It's now being sung and danced to in the theaters by people dressed and resembling the characters in the movie, like Tim Curry's famous role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter. I was lucky enough to see it with a close filmmaker friend, Brian Patrick O'Toole (screenwriter for film Atlas Shrugged and producer for Dog Soldiers) who basically made comments and remarks throughout the film. Hes seen the film over 200 times and has to be the biggest fan I know. I've caught his disease.A criminologist tells the story of a newly engaged couple by the names of Brad Majors and Janet Weiss who become lost with a flat tire on a rainy night. They find a castle, asking for help, but are soon victims of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a ""sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania"" who's minions are his sister Magenta, servant Riff Raff, and a fan named Columbia. Numerous twists and turns go along with this film, but the fun comes from the enjoyment had by the musical numbers and bizarre acting. I had fun just dancing to the great fabulous score and just loved Brian's quotes.This shows you how big movies can be, even when ignored. This movie has made $139.8 million dollars and probably didn't even make $20,000 back in 1975. This is true beauty film-making, even with a weird premise. This is a movie that I can say, I have never seen as many soundtracks for. There's the original, the Say it! Karaoke CD, the audience participation CD, the re-release CD, the instrumental, etc. DVDs are a little less. The 25th anniversary tape in 1990, the new DVD, and a future Blu-Ray this year. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a sequel....well there is.The sequel is called Shock Treatment that was released in 1981. It wasn't a strong sequel from what I hear. Tim Curry originally planned to cast in it, singing all the songs written for him, but refused last minute, and then the singers were replaced and they got new ones. It only made $2 million dollars which is dirt compared to the money the first film made. It even performed worse than RHPS's first run which is hysterical because it seemed if anything, Shock Treatment's gross would have been larger than biblical proportions compared to RHPS. But, it flopped, miserably, end of story.Now to be fair, critics hate this movie, and my parents aren't to fond of it. But this is the ultimate test. If you can sit through this film, hating it, and still having the nerve to shut it off or walk out, but make it through, that proves you can make it through any film. But I for one enjoyed the film and hope MTV Films reconsiders with the remake.A remake of The Neverending Story is also in the works, and though I haven't seen it, I heard its a flawless film. Same goes with RHPS, remakes never do the goal they should, make the original film better. No remake is better than the original, except for maybe Scarface. But 99% of the time, remakes fail. So since The Rocky Horror Picture Show is such an overwhelming success, MTV Films thinks they can get a piece of the pie by making a remake of it. News to MTV Films: It may draw money, but not like the original. It will not be attended, by true fans. But by far, it will not be shown at midnight showings every Saturday and be attended by die hard fans dressed in almost identical apparel to the actors on screen. That will be in store and exclusively for the 1975 film.Starring: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Meat Loaf, and Nell Campbell.

Everything about this movie is very catchy. The characters are fun to watch. Dr. Franenferter is beyond entertaining. For some reason Tim Curry actually looks good with lip stick. Now, I will always be in question. Also, the plot is very very strange. But you get into it. There is a great cameo by Meatloaf in the movie.

26,blanbrn,Far out and crazy different type of drama comedy musical that teases and tries to entertain.,2,26 March 2016,"I know that the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is one film that's a cult classic and is on many of lists for midnight shows in art house cinema's and it even plays at many homes late at night. So I decided to check it out and clearly the film did not hold my interest as it just wasn't my cup of tea. I for one found it a bore as the music just did not strike a note with me nor did I find the picture very funny. To me it's just a different far out far off march to the beat different type of movie. It featured some well known people in early roles like Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick and even an appearance by singer Meatloaf is seen! The story is just about a couple who happen on an old house a mansion type and they find it's a house with a Frankenstein type and a gender bending transsexual in stockings and garter belt hoses! Overall crazy far out picture that tries to entertain but doesn't for my taste.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
27,lasttimeisaw,The Rocky Horror Picture Show,8,5 November 2012,"To celebrate the Halloween, inadvertently I found out that this perennial cult classic would be shown in cinemas with its original version, which prompted my belated viewing of this notorious B-movie tour-de-force for the first time, although B-movie has evaded my entire childhood and I have barely watched any the classics to which the film pays its overt tribute, but, the film is a satisfactory and daring musical with its campy costumes and music arrangement (a cocktail of Glam Rock-New Wave-Nu-Disco musical numbers and giddying dancing routines), a perfect option for its groupies and people who are repellent to horror genre in Halloween. There were a bunch of devotees inside the full-packed screen hall, but the sing-along spectacle didn't happen as I expected (incessant hails were very much present nevertheless), anyhow, we were all enthralling with the atmosphere and the film per se. For me, the musical numbers rendered throughout the film are the predominant assets which should be much appreciated, Richard O'Brien (who is also the sidekick Riff Raff in the film) has managed to write a bunch of utterly spirit-rousing theme songs pandering for the sub- culture habitants, especially for the gay and transvestite disadvantaged groups, which facilitates its iconic status through its conspicuous delivery of messages such as sex liberation, homosexual impetus, free-your-mind and ravished by life. While you can decry its escapism and hedonism misappropriation in your hindsight, but at the moment the film was playing, the invasion of ubiquitous pleasure could encroach upon all the sensory passages, which is an undeniable achievement of the crew. Tim Curry, arguably has delivered the best music performances in a film, whose knockout fabulousness alone could make the film stunningly enjoyable and substantially controversial (from the blood-red lips singing in the opening credits until his valedictory song near the end, it all justifies that either garishness or sappiness could be put into a moment as a revelation!). Susan Sarandon's voice bent is creakily suitable for her shallow and flashy character, which is in tune with other standard B-level performances from the rest of the cast members (although Meat Loaf's one-off interruption of the Transylvanian orgy has the only slash movie quality).An atypical exploitation of Frankenstein (e.g. Peter Hinwood's immaculately sinewy body and a young Robert Redford resemblance is a slap in the face to the usual disfigured stunt of the monster), both male and female bodies should be worshiped in an equal scale, which uncannily prefigures today's zeitgeist. It is a pity director Jim Sharman's career has never taken off, even in his own cult way, but at least he has built a miracle, the film's leggy longevity will never wane, and it will summon its zealots generations after generations.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

29,Red-Barracuda,Not perfect but mainly enjoyably bizarre stuff,9,16 June 2016,"Well, whatever you may think of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, you can't say it's not unique. It didn't do very good business on initial theatrical release but, like the earlier Night of the Living Dead (1968) and the later Eraserhead (1977), it slowly gathered a significant following while being shown at midnight screenings at various cinemas. It became one of a very select few movies where audience participation became actively expected. Needless to say, this has gone on to become a cast iron example of a cult movie. It was based on a theatrical musical written by Richard O'Brien, who appears in the movie as the manservant Riff Raff. It features a stellar turn from Tim Curry as the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a wide-eyed and sexy performance from a young Susan Sarandon, a pre Bat out of Hell rock 'n' roll cameo from Meat Loaf and strange deadpan narration from Charles Gray. The cast are all commendably game and over-play things to the max.The story is really just a means to an end. It has a naive WASP couple called Brad and Janet wind up as reluctant guests at a strange mansion after their car breaks down on a rainy night. The people they encounter are spectacularly odd - Riff Raff the hunchbacked handyman, the full-on Dr. Frank–N -Furter, Columbia the rock groupie, Magenta the goth house maid, Eddie the bike riding rocker, Rocky Horror the creature and the guests, the Transylvanians. These characters alone give significant interest to this bizarre film but what elevates it to another level are the songs. From the opening 'Science Fiction/Double Feature' through to 'Eddie' there is an unbroken sequence of nine or ten songs that work brilliantly. They are both musically and lyrically good but also pretty amusing. The cast all make them work very well on screen. What I have always thought though is that after this very strong opening two-thirds, the film drops in quality somewhat in its final third. The stronger material is loaded at the front and the movie always seems to suffer a bit from this in that it winds down with weaker material.Despite this reservation, this bizarre movie gets far more right than wrong. Even though it is unashamedly silly, it has a strange atmosphere where it's quite easily to get drawn into the world where strange gatherings of oddballs happen at Gothic mansions in the dead of night. There are a real mish-mash of influences thrown into the pot and mixed together such as Frankenstein, RKO Pictures, 50's sci-fi and rock 'n' roll music; all these elements are then thrown together mixed up with light sleaze, high camp and knowing comedy. The combination is pretty unprecedented and Rocky Horror still feels utterly unique, whether or not this is a good thing for you comes down to a matter of taste, as this is certainly a film which alienates a sizable number of people. For me, despite the weaker final third, this is a lot of fun and terrifically bizarre stuff.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
30,cherold,hit and miss cult movie,5,9 January 2010,"I heard of Rocky Horror before I saw it. I saw it on TV, by myself, and thought, wow, this is really bad. At same later time I saw it in a movie theater with the audience yelling and throwing things at the screen, and viewed that way, it's a lot of fun.But when reviewing a movie, you shouldn't be reviewing the audience, although that's exactly what some people do.Recently Rocky Horror was on TV and I decided to watch a bit. It was better than I remembered, but still is problematic.Parts of it are actually amazing. The first song is quite good, and the first 10 or so minutes in the castle are great, with two of the best numbers from the show and the appearance of Tim Curry in a brilliant and fearless performance.After that, the movie goes up and down. The acting is varied although Bostwick and Sarandon are quite amusing (and as a bonus Sarandon spends most of the movie running around in her underwear). The dialog is weak. The movie has a low budget quality, and while some of it is visually imaginative and clever, at other times it seems indifferently filmed. Some of it is funny, some of it is stupid, and a lot of it is dull.Part of the problem is that the movie tries to be a takeoff of bad movies while never establishing that it is not, in fact, a bad movie. A successful bad movie parody has to leave no doubt in the viewers mind that those behind the camera know exactly what they're doing (for example, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra). But Rocky Horror has no consistency of tone, sometimes seeming like a tribute to bad movies, sometimes like a movie that is trying to be a really slick musical. The movie never tries to make much sense, but it's not well-made enough to get away with that.Ultimately, Rocky Horror is a curio distinguished by one brilliant performance and four or five really good songs. And, of course, Susan Sarandon in her underwear.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
31,Lejink,Shock Shlock musical,7,13 August 2010,"Almost unbelievably, I first saw this movie in around 1976 on a double feature with of all things George Harrison's ""Concert For Bangla Desh"" movie, which as a young Beatles fan was the main attraction (and second feature on the bill). I thus had to sit through ""T.R.H.P.S."" and had absolutely no idea about its content or otherwise. It's fair to say, I was about as shocked as Brad and Janet at the castle by what I saw...Looked at now, it actually still has the power to shock, which of course was no doubt the point. It's one thing to parody 50's science fiction B-movies, listed at length in the title sequence song, but it certainly takes Tim Curry in a Basque and suspenders to drive the point home.For me, the movie does sag in the middle as the songs get a little weaker, after the triple whammy of ""Damn it Janet"", ""Sweet Transvestite"" and of course ""The Time Warp"" but there's still some funny, if naturally, smutty humour en route particularly when Dr Furter ""does the double"" on Brad and Janet. There are numerous nods to other classic movies including of course ""Frankenstein"" but also Busby Berkeley musicals, ""Sunset Boulevard"" and climaxing on ""King Kong"" before the movie remembers it's primarily a sci-spoof with its alien abduction ending.As for the actors, everyone enters into the spirit, hot on the heels, literally, of Curry's example. The lip-sync-hing is sometimes clumsy, the settings occasionally too studio-bound and the music not always inspired, but where else would you get to see as much of Susan Sarandon in her underwear as Tim Robbins on a good night, Meatloaf served up as, litearlly meatloaf, an elderly wheelchair-bound scientist in suspenders giving it, well, low kicks and Charles Gray exhorting us to give it some pelvic thrust (they should have got him into drag mode too - a major mistake!!!).Let's do the time warp again, once more with feeling...",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
32,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The time-warp won't save you.,5,24 August 2020,"Though obviously dated in some areas (such as its use of the term 'transvestite'), 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)' - a stage-musical adaptation that's now over forty years old and still gets screened - is generally rather progressive in its portrayal of (eventually) sympathetic LGBTQ+ characters and non-hetero-normative, seemingly polygamous relationships. The movie is brazen in its bizarreness, barely having a proper through-line to connect its camp costuming, throw-back set-design, ostentatious performances and, of course, outlandishly mile-a-minute songs. It's quite charming to begin with, its science-fiction satire meshing with its almost aggressive non-conformity to create a bewildering but intoxicating experience that puts a smile on your face. Sadly, though, it doesn't take long before it starts to wear thin. Without the novelty of its style, the movie's lack of real substance becomes painfully apparent. There's just not all that much behind its outer layer, to be honest. Although there's nothing inherently wrong with any of it, it all just becomes a little dull. It's also never quite as compelling, or comedic, as you'd expect. It's genuinely not a bad film, but it isn't consistently entertaining enough to be a particularly good one, either. 5/10",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
33,Cineanalyst,Trans-Frankenstein,7,25 August 2018,"There's no substitute for attending a theatrical screening of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" it's true, with the the rowdy audience participation that accompanies midnight showings of the campy rock-musical cult classic. I've done it, and it's a lot more fun than viewing it on home video. Yet, I suspect some write off this film for that reason as unworthy of serious appreciation. And some of the criticism is fair; for instance, its staginess doesn't fully transcend its theatrical origins, it's pastiche, and it's difficult to appraise it as a mechanically-reproduced film and not only as an event. I returned to this film in my search to see a bunch of Frankenstein movies after again reading Mary Shelley's novel--something I also recently did with Dracula--, and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" slyly adapts one or two major themes from the Frankenstein and other monster stories, which play into the film's transgressive appeal, LGBT or otherwise.Stage and screen adaptations tend to lack the authoritative voice of a narrator. There's a narrator in this film, but as camp, he's humorously superfluous in the traditional role. This opens different paths of spectator identification, which have led to the monsters of such Gothic horror narratives as Dracula and Frankenstein becoming the sympathetic characters. Unlike Bram Stoker's story, this was already partly the case in Shelley's novel because Frankenstein's creature was one of the narrators, although it was still mostly, as the main protagonist, Dr. Frankenstein's narrative. In many of the classic horror movies, the books' storytellers, whether Victor Frankenstein and Mary Harker or the even more forgotten Robert Walton and Gabriel Utterson, take a back seat to or are entirely written out in favor of a focus on the monsters. More so than before, the monsters emerge as sympathetic outsiders--persecuted and misunderstood as the ""other,"" as invaders, as ugly, as aliens. Even if this doesn't excuse or even explain their killings, it makes them entirely more interesting than the normal narrators and protagonists, the would-be Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Hapschatts of the world, who themselves only transform into interest through their interactions with the monsters.""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" makes its mad scientist, Dr. Frank-N-Furter (played by the fabulous Tim Curry), a monster from the start--a ""freak of nature"" and literally from another world--supported by a host of other Transsexual characters and spectators. His final creation, on the other hand, is the kind of Aryan ideal that would've pleased Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein, although Frank-N-Furter still responds to an earlier work of his with the traditional violent disgust. The normals here are represented by the engaged couple of Brad and Janet, who enter Frank-N-Furter's party castle in the fashion of an old-dark-house horror film with their car breaking down.Essentially, then, transsexuality, transvestism and bisexuality (as well as the Universal hunchback trope and the incestuous siblings) are analogous to Shelley and Frankenstein's shunned creature. The film's sexuality, however, including Frank-N-Furter invading the bedrooms of both Janet and Brad and turning them into fellow corset-and-garter wearing sexual beings, is more in line with Stoker's ""Dracula,"" and, after all, Frank-N-Furter is a self-described ""Sweet Transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania,"" the last place also being the namesake of Dracula's home, for which he also left to invade another land and convert foreigners to his ways. In the suave Count tradition of Bela Lugosi's version, Dracula could also be a welcoming, if strange, host at first.As for adapting the play to film, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is less creative. The rock soundtrack lends itself to some quick editing and a few odd camera angles, but even the set designs and settings reinforce that this once lived on stage. The climactic scene, although it features the old RKO Hollywood studio logo in the background, is even set on stage. Although, the theatricality, the fourth-wall breaking and the inclusion of Transsexual participants and spectators does invite the mirrored behavior of participants and spectators in the audience. Besides musical theatre, the film also re-animates the traditional art of painting, as in its depictions of Grant Wood's ""American Gothic"" and, appropriately, Michelangelo's ""Creation of Adam."" The result is rather stagy and full of episodic musical set pieces, as excellent as they are, but that belies the film's transgressive adaptation of familiar monster narratives--even though it's only as an event shared with dedicated followers when It's Alive.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

He studies one emotion known as lust and being an extra-terrestrial he knows no limits.A young couple going on a trip to visit a professor of theirs, Dr Everett V. Scott as a sort of celebration of their engagement have a car breakdown in the night in a fierce storm. They decide to knock at the door of the castle they see and they get into the ET lab. After many incidents, detours and other adventures in this labyrinthine castle, they will both be initiated to sex by and with Dr Frank-N-Furter. But Dr Everett V. Scott arrives in a wheelchair and kind of saves the situation by explaining us and them what it is all about. At this time the main servants of the castle/spacecraft decide to go back to their planet Transylvania leaving behind Dr Frank-N-Furter dead but his creation Rocky Horror runs after his body and takes it away: he is in love with his maker and he is immune against the laser weapons of the ETs.The three humans, Dr Everett V. Scott, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss manage to get out of the castle before take off and end up the show in the mud. Brad concludes that ""inside he is still bleeding"", Janet that ""the beast is still feeding"", and the storyteller that ""on earth some insects call the human race lost in time, lost in space and the meaning."" The show was not erotic but sexy. The film is the same sexy but not erotic. Yet it is a comedy that plays on sexually ambiguous situations, on words tremendously and on all kinds of strange costumes, effects, lightings, music. The proportion of music, singing and dancing is enormous. It is an entertaining story with a slightly titillating content.Now the DVD, which is the film, made and still makes this play a success beyond the theatres where it was performed.Apart from the opening wedding scene the whole film systematically keeps a distance from real cinema. It is not a play per se, far from it, but it is not a film either. It is somewhere in-between the two and that's the interest of the film itself over the play.The first element that is obvious is the filming on location for outside scenes and when it is filmed in a studio the set is that of an extremely vast castle, at least that's what they want us to believe and that vastness is emphasized by the long ""travelling"" of Dr Everett V. Scott in his wheelchair to come to, or be brought to the laboratory. But there are some other scenes that amplify this vast dimension; The action itself takes place in various rooms and these rooms are big and large enough to entertain a dancing body of twenty people or so. You cannot get that effect on a stage. Including several motorcycles and cars, one motorcycle in the main room of the castle too, running and smoking.The special effects are numerous and all add something to what a stage play would be. Sound and visual effects create the storm and the suspense necessary for the evocation of fear and danger. But there are other special effects that are more subtle and less visible. Yet without them many scenes would be flat. The main visible element in that line is the constantly changing camera shooting angle and probably camera too, and the editing that emphasizes this whirling effect by cutting and pasting small sequences one after the other of the same scene all from different angles. Then you have a lot of smoke, artefacts of all sports, the apparition of a swimming pool where you had not seen it, the falling down of the radio tower of the RKO Radio Picture logo when Rocky Horror and Dr Frank-N-Furter try to climb on it to escape Riff Raff and his sister Magenta, the ET masters of the spacecraft.Of course we must also think of the special effects needed to turn someone who is dressed into an entirely nude stone statue. That is both special effect and editing. And there are many instances present giving to the film a speed that it could not have on a stage and at the same time an intensity of action and peripeteia that would also be difficult on the stage.Finally along that line the use of TV screens to put people under surveillance is possible and frequent in the film because of the close-up shots on them that enable us to see what is on the screen, like for example Brad being sexually served by Dr Frank-N-Furter, which Janet will eventually see on the screen, though after the act itself. The film enables us to see these moments which would have been awkward on the stage, or plainly invisible.The last remarkable element that the DVD and film provides is the storyteller, called in the credits the criminologist, in a private library in a completely different place and atmosphere. That trick is rarely used in films, certainly not that often, at least eight times in the present case. He explains and creates a perspective, which forces us to listen and think a little bit to understand the craziness of the situation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I personally am fed up with all those whiny mediocre minded and weak-hearted minorities depicted in modern movies, characters who always complain about life being unjust, being not understood etc. pp. - life is always unjust, every single man and woman on this planet has a burden to bear, no matter if one is a heterosexual or whatever-sexual, no matter if one is white, black, yellow, pink skinned, two- or three-legged.The Rocky Horror Picture Show: a great plea for acceptance and a strong defender for ""being different"".

The story concerns a couple, played by Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon no less, having the unfortunate mishap of a flat tire near a castle occupied by a weird group of sundry sexual miscreants.  The story is tied together through songs sung by the characters and by a narrator seemingly in an omnipotent state of being. The film is meant to be high camp...and it is. It does not at any point take itself too terribly serious.  Which is good. But, for me, it was just too bizarre, too perverted, too outlandish, too much singing.  I know many people love this film.  I wish I had liked it more.  I wanted to like it more.  But, alas, it was not meant to be.  The acting...if you wish to call it that...is decent.  The music will appeal to some.  And I suppose the sight of Tim Curry in garters, stockings, and other feminine attire will even have its fans somewhere.  Not here.  I really could not tell you what exactly happens in the end.  The biggest plus for me was seeing a very suave, dapper Charles Gray as the narrator reciting ridiculous lines and even sing a line or two.  Gray was a great actor who for many has been immortalized through this film.  That is good, but I hope they also know that the late Mr. Gray was an actor of the widest range and ability.  He had presence and such a distinctive voice.  At any rate, I must give a negative nod to Rocky Horror for myself.  For what it is...and for those that like ""that"" kind of stuff....enjoy!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

It's made in the spirit of the way Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was created. It's quirky, odd, different, and a cross between a comedy, a musical and a drama.The cast is heavy with stars who later become A listers. This happens to be Tim Curry's first staring role. There is also Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick and Meatloaf.The creator of this production was Richard O'Brien. He wrote this while unemployed in London. He liked B movies and Science Fiction. So he combined that with the humor of shock horror, muscle flicks, 50's rock and the era of Glam Rock. It was a collection of all these influences which symbolizes O'Brien's life and allowed him to write freely this parody.The original production was a stage production in London. It ran for over six years. It was also brought to America and was produced in LA and NY, then other cities.Besides the amazing sound track, this show has spawned a cult following which has reproductions, usually midnight showings, in theaters across the country. The crowd is expected to dress up and take part in the dancing, singing and sometimes they are brought up on to the stage.I attended several of these events and I can say it was a HOOT! There is so much fun going on, and people who go are usually expecting the participation.The reviews at the time were terrible. They said that it ucked and that it was tasteless, worthless and plotless. However, over the years, it has become a cultural phenomenon. It is one of the longest running movies/plays of all time.The crowd has traditions during the movie to shout certain comments at the screen. One such comment is ""Buy an umbrella, you cheap itch"" when Janet is using the newspaper to stop getting wet.It is a movie which has been selected for preservation in the US National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is about a newly (very newly) engaged couple, Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) whose car breaks down at night in the middle of the woods after their friend's wedding. They walk up the road to a castle that is home to Dr. Frank- N - Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite from the planet Transsexual (very strange, I know), who has created a human being. Based on a play, ""Rocky Horror"" is a thoroughly strange but highly entertaining little slice of cinema history. The entire plot is ridiculously unbelievable, but the fantasy land that is created makes this irrelevant. The sets are strange but fitting, and the movie is very atmospheric. It's not a movie you are supposed to take seriously. The music is probably the most memorable thing about this movie though, after watching it a few times you'll likely remember every song word-for-word. Good acting is present as well from Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick, and Tim Curry as the flamboyant Dr. Frank-N-Furter.Bottom line is, you should enjoy this movie because of all of it's catchy songs and bizarre events that take place. It has a lot of random but funny scenes and I can see why it has become such a classic- because of how off the wall it really is. Some find it stupid, others find it enjoyable.

You may adore this movie or hate it because there is not much left in the middle but the sure thing is that you will never forget this film once you have seen it.The crazy, diversified and simply unforgettable characters where each one seems to be at a near equal level even though everyone seems to have a personal favourite (mine is probably Columbia), the catchy songs where one hit hits literally the next, the very creative and surprising scenario which honours many clichés of the horror and science-fiction genre and the different actions that have to be done during certain scenes of the movie have all contributed to the fact that this movie has become a masterpiece that has still a big group of fans and followers nowadays and has been presented as a musical in many countries. I have seen the musical as it came into my hometown when I was ten years old and I will never forget it. This is the perfect movie to get together with friends and have a good time, to sing, drink and laugh along no matter to which generation you belong as this movie seems to connect them all.To keep it short, anyone who likes the cinema and music in general should have seen this movie at least once in his lifetime as it would take too much place and would effectively never really work to describe this flick about transvestites in a few words because there is such a high amount of sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, love, passion, horror, drama and slapstick in this masterpiece.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

That is the dilemma with TRHS. Every cast member can sing pretty well, and I enjoyed the musical numbers for the most part, but whenever someone isn't singing, the film can't really sustain itself. The actual content of the film is pretty weak, the songs are catchy and it's something that can be fun to act out with the costumes, but the actual writing and plot is fairly flat.

58,aidanratesmovies,Implausibly Brilliant,9,14 June 2021,"One of the most incredibly unique films ever made, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a movie truly ahead of its time- it may not have much of a plot, but it makes up for its lesser parts with is exuberant spirit. First off,I just have to say how brilliant veteran actor Tim Curry is in this film in his famous role as Dr. Frank N Furter. Not only is his brilliant and having such a blast for his role, but it's his first role in a major motion picture, which just adds to the breathtaking performance that he truly dedicated himself too- providing us with one of the most unique and creative characters in all of film, and nailing it every step of the way. The plot of this film is ridiculous and kinda campy, which I assume is done on purpose. Despite its moments though where you clearly don't know why things are happening, the film is very fun to watch, and at times can be quite humorous. The film is also incredibly ahead of its time. It has brilliant cinematography, makeup, and many other physical attributes- but it also provides a safespace for those in society at the time that weren't as well accepted- a classic meaning of being yourself for a whole generation that was afraid of who they were- and I find it's courage and brave uniqueness to be quite inspiring- especially considering it came from the 1970's. With its themes of transexuality, homosexuality, and odd kinds of violence throughout- its hard to imagine this film was ever made, let alone over 45 years ago. Yet, as brilliant and daring as it is, it manages to stand the test of time, and shine as an incredible important milestone for Hollywood, indie films, the LGBT!+ community, and more to see.My Rating: 9/10.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
59,adamjohns-42575,"""Even Smiling Makes My Face Ache!""",10,25 May 2021,"This film has a lot of history for me. I remember being at home one day and my Mother drawing my attention to Anthony Stewart Head (The Nescafé Man at the time) who was on 'This Morning' with Richard and Judy promoting the tour of the stage version. He was playing Frank-N-Furter and I think the 10/11 year old me, who already knew that he was slightly different, was fascinated from the get go. A year or so later this film came on at Christmas and I stayed up until the early hours to watch it, doing Damian's dance moves to the 'Time Warp', because I didn't know they weren't the originals. Since that first day and then again on that night I have been in love with this film and story. When it was released on VHS in about 1994 I of course purchased a copy and I watched it every night for at least a week when I returned home from school, much to my sisters displeasure, so it pleased me to watch it on this occasion with my nephew, who didn't actually mind it at all. It was just a shame that my Gruncle moaned all the way through it.The actual story is so weird that it's difficult to say what makes it so brilliant. It's a one of a kind with only the most basic similarities to the likes of 'Little Shop Of Horrors' (1986) and 'Cabaret'. I can think of nothing else that comes even remotely close to it in the way that it is put together and what it represents.It is made in the style of a bad B Movie, but overplayed in such a great way that everyone can get the joke. Full of whacky characters and odd situations, the viewer gets to experience the trip through the eyes of Brad & Janet. There's lots of sex - explorations of sexuality and sexual identity as well as a superb soundtrack referencing years of low budget science fiction. It's just so uniquely out there and I know all the songs.The cast are all excellent and if you look closely you can spot Biggins as one of the unconventional conventionalists.My sisters favourite musical now is Grease and I can see the values of that too, but this ""Picture Show"" will always feature in my top 10 films no matter what else is released.I have seen the stage show twice and highly recommend the experience as you get a chance to be part of something with other nutters like yourselves. It's such an inclusive and joyful event, that even the biggest miseries could be swept up by it.It's funny then to think that I still haven't seen the sequel 'Shock Treatment'.

62,eric262003,Eccentric and Energetic Fun For Everyone,10,27 June 2016,"From the look of its DVD cover, you may think the 1975 cult classic ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" to be very weird and whimsically creepy. And that analogy is rightfully fitting, because its 100 minutes of fun singing, dancing and enough fueled up energy to likely keep you up awake for long hours of the night. From the narration of an unnamed criminologist (Charles Gray), the story centers around a normal young recently engaged couple named Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) who's car gets brunt out in major downpour. The couple end up in a castle and are greeted by a transvestite scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) who has in the same tradition like Dr. Frankenstein has found a solution to create life. After successfully bringing his creation Rocky (Peter Hinwood) to life, Dr. Frank-N-Furter show Brad and Janet to their rooms where he embarks on a passionate experience this young couple will remember till the day they die.With all the whimsical weirdness dominating the screens, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is the ultimate fun a movie fan can ever have and Tim Curry is at his most zaniest he has ever been. Sporting full transvestite regalia, Dr. Frank-N-Furter takes Brad and Janet and his entire viewers to his delectably scary house of horrors while leading them on through a variety of spontaneous tunes. With his demeanor set on abrasiveness, his seductive ways goes both sides as he utilizes his persuasive charm to engage in intercourse with both Brad and Janet. The house of Dr. Frank-N-Furter is the estate where normality is extremely alienated. The spiritual guide is his loyal butler Riff-Raff (Richard O'Brien) and his is ghoulish maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn). It's Dr. Frank-N-Furter who decides on the the differences between right and wrong and Tim Curry looks like he is having a blast in his performance where the boundaries of moral decency has absolutely no limits. A major idiosyncrasy that has made this film reach cult status is the the rightfully selected music. The opening scene which features a pair of lips singing ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" that pays homage to classic science fiction movies, makes it clear that the music matches the over-the-top characteristics to the leading character. If I was to choose a favourite song of choice it would have to be ""Time Warp"" in which Riff-Raff and Magenta lead a pair of oddball characters in an upbeat dance. Who could forget the song ""Sweet Transvestite"" where we're first introduced to Dr. Frank- N-Furter. These two songs come right after one another giving us the double pleasure that keeps our fingers snapping and our toes tapping. Directly after its release, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" launched a fan following. Fans just threw themselves into movie as they hollered back at the screen, taking quotes from the movie, having performers decked out in costumes as the audience is watching them like from the song ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". I was born in 1976 so I never had the chance to see those midnight viewings (sigh!). It would have been a ton of fun to have had experience something like it. But from the comfort of my humble abode, this film was truly a riot. But in front of crowd, it would have been a lifetime I would never forget.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
63,Matt_Layden,Another Kind of Rocky,8,27 July 2010,"If you'd had said that I would love a film that involved song and dance numbers, a character who cross dresses and Susan Sarandon, I'd call you crazy. Yet here I am, reviewing the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The craziest film that gets you singing along. I had the great opportunity to see this in the theatre once for a midnight showing. It was a blast. Brad (asshole) and Janet (slut) have car trouble and take refuge in the Frankenstein Castle. While there, they run into some Transylvanians and a mad doctor, Dr. Frank-n-Futer. He is creating his masterpiece, Rocky. The film blends horror, sci/fi, comedy, musical, camp, and thrills in one unforgettable package. The moment those lips appeared on the screen singing the opening number, Science Fiction + Double Feature, I knew I would like this film.I was wrong, I loved this film. Riff Raff, my favourite character, is played by Richard O'Brien. Half of the creative team behind this piece. The most iconic character in musical films, in my opinion, is played by Tim Curry. In an unforgettable role as Frank-n-Futer. The film has catchy songs, every single number I seem to like. Of course I have my favourite, but there is not one song that I can't stand. A rare thing for me and musicals. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a hard film to sell to people. It might make them uncomfortable to watch, but I love it every time I see it. It's campy for sure and it knows it. People didn't get that back when it was released, but they did once it played to the midnight crowd. It holds the record for longest film release for theatres, because it's still going.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
64,mike48128,If Grease was a Monster Movie it Might have been This?,9,31 October 2016,"A couple of things I don't like about both versions is the annoying narrator and how short ""Eddie"" Meat Loaf) has in the movie. His solo is a ""showstopper"". Eddie is one of Dr. Frank-N-Furter's failures and is hacked to pieces by Frank after singing and crashing his ""cycle"" throughout the house. Why there are several cyclists is never explained. Tim Curry is the Transsexual Thing from Outer Space. (That's the reference to RKO Radio Pictures). ""Rocky"" is an amazing physical specimen and indeed does resemble Charles Atlas. Has several memorable songs including the opener with the famous red lips. (Science Fiction),Time-warp, Dammit Janet, and the ""a toucha me"" song stand out. Susan Sarandon is delicious as undressed Janet Weiss with her white Maidenform underwear. She goes from virgin to sex fiend in about a minute. Wow. Teasing skin and some male & female genitalia on white statues. (Big deal?) Yeah, skimpy and tight costumes. Gets a tat creepier in the middle, as the difficult subject(s) of straight, gay and incestual sexual encounters gets explored. It should be watched uncut, as the cable telecast censors a few shots and words. Silly and nice ending as Frankie, Columbia, and Rocky get zapped and the spaceship-castle returns to it's home planet of Transylvania. It's implied that Frank and Columbia might make it back home also. (Watch UK version.) Only Brad, Janet, and Dr. Von Scott remain on Earth. Yes, it is much more fun with repeated viewings. Quite risqué for it's time. Watch it with the ""Midnight Theater Soundtrack"" on disc. Made on an incredibly small budget, but very well filmed. It's a UK movie and plays much like a filmed Broadway Musical, for the most part! 5:1 sound and the mono tracks are quite good. Picture quality is amazing.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
65,LeonardKniffel,Cult Classics Does Not Mean Great,6,29 April 2020,"This odd film is what has become known as a ""cult classic."" To understand why, you have to know that it was something of a flop when it first came out, but it got picked up at late-night screenings on college campuses and audiences started dressing up as characters in the film, throwing rice and toast at the screen during appropriate moments, talking back to the characters, and just generally turning the screening into a party. What the partying did was make hard rock, sadomasochism, and homoerotic innuendo palatable to the movie-going public. Still, knowing the great roles that were to follow, it's fun to watch the young Susan Sarandon as the innocent ingénue. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association. 2013",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
66,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,There's a reason why this movie is so popular and it's not the movie itself...,4,26 January 2015,"The Rocky Horror Picture show movie is terrible. That's what I'm rating, the movie itself. The reason this movie happens to be so popular is because at the theaters where it is shown, people have fun making fun of it. At the midnight showings, not only do patrons dress up, they bring props. (rice, cigarette lighters, newspapers, etc.)and they dance, sing along and laugh at it. I have yet to meet a fan of this movie who actually likes the movie itself; most of the fans of it I've met only like it because of the theater activities that go along with it, which are apparently very fun and exciting and I wouldn't mind going to see sometime.The movie itself is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tim Curry was sort of funny but that's about it. Usually I'm a big fan of 1970's movies (I loved Hair, Go Ask Alice, I Drink Your Blood and Harold & Maude), but this movie just went too far. It was weird, not in a cool way but in an annoying way. And I realize it's a musical, but it's so annoying when the characters have to randomly burst into song for no apparent reason. The Time Warp song was pretty good, though. Anyway, maybe there's something I missed about this movie that makes people love it so much, but I just don't get it. It just seemed to be a really perverted movie just for the hell of it. I'd probably appreciate it more if I saw it in a theater but I don't recommend watching it on just a television or computer screen.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

It's definitely a movie that shouldn't have ever worked by any means but by some cinematic miracle it does and brilliantly so. You know the story, a recently engaged couple Brad played by a sexy Barry Bostwick and Janet played by the iconic Susan Sarandon are traveling home from a friend's wedding and their car breaks down. So they head out in the rain and come upon a giant haunted looking mansion. Upon arriving they are greeted by a creepy and fabulous brother sister duo and than they meet the doctor a ""sweet transvestite"" played the charasmatic and timeless Tim Curry. Filled with amazing songs and an abundance of infinite creativity. Rocky Horror picture show is one of the best films ever made and should never try and be remade (let's forget about Fox's travesty).

69,Jeremy_Urquhart,Still as strange and mesmerising as I'm sure it's always been,8,24 February 2020,"Hey look: it's another film that's been talked about to death, and here I am with yet another review that isn't truly needed. Consider me like George Costanza's dad during Festivus: I got grievances that I want to have aired, even if we might all be better off if I kept my trap shut.Okay, grievances is a strong word, because when it comes to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, there's a lot more that I like than dislike. In fact, there's a good deal of the film that I basically love. It's overall a messy but quite loveable film, if you know more or less what you're getting into (because I can't imagine it's for everyone. Indeed, I know people who find it too weird and uncomfortable for their personal tastes). So when it comes to the grievances/flaws, they're there for sure. You can pick this movie apart quite brutally if you feel so inclined. However, it's hard to say whether the film would be considerably better if some of those imperfections were addressed. It might be the loose, unhinged feel of the movie that makes it so engaging for much of the cult audience that has grown around it since its 1975 release.Well, may as well start with the good stuff regardless, because ultimately that is what stands out more, even with the flaws. Tim Curry's performance is undoubtedly iconic, and one of the main things people remember about the movie for good reason. There's never been a character quite like Dr. Frank N' Furter before, and it's also hard to imagine anyone but Curry being able to pull off playing him so engagingly. It's one of those performances that's so good you almost feel a little sorry for everyone else in the movie, because while they're all generally quite good, there's little hope for any of them standing out as much as Curry. It's a role and a performance that really has to be seen to be believed.The whole film has this loose, bizarre, borderline nonsensical at times, but strangely engaging tone and atmosphere. When intentionally and hilariously naïve Brad and Janet stumble upon that castle and enter it, we really feel what they must: both they and we as audience members are transported into this absolutely bizarre, otherworldly location. Nothing really looks or feels quite like how this film looks or feels. Again, it's hard to truly explain with simple words: it really has to be experienced.When it comes to the music, it's excellent for the most part, but unfortunately, most of the iconic songs are all contained within the film's first half. In a similar manner, the most memorable parts of this film are also featured within the first fifty minutes of the film. At a certain point, I felt like everything sort of dropped off. It has this truly crazy and unhinged energy to it, where it kept building and building and getting continually more out there, only for that build to peak around the halfway mark. It's right after the famous Meatloaf scene, in my opinion, that this drop in quality becomes noticeable, and for me, it's the main thing that keeps it from being an absolute classic.There may have only been so much material that needed to get stretched to feature length, and in the end, the good stuff all got lumped together. At least we do get one great half followed by a second half that's not without its merits, but is certainly less impressive. Still, the film as a whole deserves credit for how brazen and unashamedly provocative, camp, and crazy it is. I wasn't around in the 1970s so can't say for sure, but seeing as it still feels pretty out there in 2020, it must have been quite a shock for audiences back then, and for that I respect the film a great deal. The decent number of very catchy and memorable songs is also worth praising, as is that aforementioned distinctive and surreal look and style.So overall: sure, it's imperfect. But there is a lot to love here, and even if it doesn't completely stick the landing well enough to be considered a true masterpiece, I'd recommend that most people give this time warp at least one shot in their lifetime.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
70,Joxerlives,Unmistakable and irrepressible!,8,22 June 2014,"With Rocky Horror you either get it or you don't, it's that simple. It really is an excuse for a heterosexuals to embrace their inner fetishist and embrace the hidden campness within. It has no equal, it has no rival and it will live forever more. The fact that such a trendy series as Glee sees fit to pay tribute to it in one ep with actors who weren't even born when the movie version was released ably demonstrates its' timeless appeal and popular resonance. What's great? What isn't great? Tim Curry is the ultimate Franknfurter, better even than Anthony Head who also excels in the role. Barry Bostick and Susan Sarandon are also terrific, Richard O'Brien, Little Nell and Patricia Quinn all brilliant, much like Dickens there's no such thing as a small role in this film. Interesting to see Christopher Biggins as one of the Transylvanians and a very young Koo Stark as one of the guests at the wedding. And off course this is the film that made Meatloaf a star, he makes a huge impression for having so little screen time and actually no spoken lines, he sings absolutely everything. Charles Gray makes a wonderful narrator, so weird to think he actually never met the rest of the cast. Great music, Richard O'Brien must have a terrific songwriting ability to produce all these crackers. Love Time Warp, Sweet Patootie, Sweet Transvestite, I'm Going Home, Burning at the Frankenstein Place. Not so fond of Janet Bryce and a few of the others which tend to slow things down a tad in my opinion.Contains 2 of the best lines in movie history. Firstly; Franknfurter; ""Magenta, you and your brother have served me faithfully"" Magenta; ""I ask for nothing"" Frankfurter; ""And you shall receive it in abundance!"" plus Magenta (surveying the carnage wreaked by Riffraff); ""You killed them!

71,one9eighty,Cult classic with lots of neon lights and foot-tapping goodness!,8,19 January 2021,"TRHPS is the age-old story of lust, transvestites, aliens, debauchery, and music. Brad (the hero) and Janet (the heroine), a newly engaged young couple run into a s pot of bad luck. Their car gets a flat tyre, and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere during an almighty storm. They decide to call for help so they go to the nearest building with signs of life, a big ol' castle where the residents seem to be getting ready for an annual convention. The couple are taken in by the Riff-Raff, Magenta and Columbia, the staff of the castle (apart from Columbia, she's more a of a 'groupie') and they soon also meet Dr Frank N. Furter. He is apparently a mad scientist who is also an alien transvestite - or more accurately, he is a ""sweet transvestite from Transexual Transylvania"". Like all good mad scientists, Dr Furter has been busy of late in his lab, he has discovered the secret to life and has made a creation in the shape of a buff and muscley man called ""Rocky"". All hell breaks loose when Eddie arrives - he is Frank's ex-lover, Columbia's current lover, and a partial brain donor to Rocky. Eddie is murdered and in the chaos the couple are trapped in the castle and eventually seduced too. A new face appears soon enough, Dr Everett V. Scott, Brad and Janet's old high school teacher, he is looking for his nephew and has stumbled onto the castle. Dr Frank suspects the Dr Scott is investigating UFO's for the government, and when he learns that Dr Scott knows Brad and Janet, he suspects they are colluding. By this point its dinner time, the guests are fed on a meal of Eddie's remains - a harmless bit of cannibalism never hurt anyone after all. When the guests realise more chaos ensues and Dr Frank uses a Medusa Transducer to turn Brad and Janet into naked statues. He dresses them up in Cabaret costumes and unfreezes them to perform a Cabaret show. Riff-Raff and Magenta interrupt the madness to announces that they, along with Dr Frank, are aliens from the planet Transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage coup with the intention of leaving for home. They kill Columbia and Dr Frank. An enraged Rocky also dies. The three humans are released, while the castle blasts off into space.At the time of its release to the world, ratings were not kind. It was far from an obvious submission into the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress as it is now. A lot of people considered it a gratuitous freak show that stumbled by with some catchy songs. Despite that, it has developed a massive cult following and garnered a huge legacy which stands proudly in many walks of life. It helped some low-budget art projects get off the ground, it has been a massive influence on sexual liberation, it is adored by certain areas of the LGBTQ communities, and it is considered one of the greatest pieces of art of its generation and is still standing strong in modern cultural entertainment. It is one of the few pieces of art that allows you to see a queue of bearded heterosexual men wearing fishnets and maid outfits, waiting in line to get into cinema re-runs or theatre productions when it comes to town.On a personal level, I watched this film when I was young - early teens. I did not really get it other than it being very colourful, fun, and having catchy songs. It managed to grow on me and when I watched it in my late teens, I understood it a little more. It is not as perverse as a lot of people made it out to be, it is something that you can strip back and see various messages and metaphors with if you so choose, or you can just sit back and watch the random bonkers and listen to the foot-tapping goodness. One of things I learned early on from this is that it is okay to be different, it does not mean that something is wrong or bad because it is different. This film excels at being different, while relying on some familiarities that everyone can identify with. But who exactly is it different to; the hero and heroine that believe what society has told them; the sweet transvestite aliens who are having fun and living the carefree way they want to (using their interpretation of life on Earth as basis); the audience who isn't quite sure of what to make of it all? Rather than worry about any of that or even the question I have just posed, embrace difference and it might just make the whole stinking world a nicer and more colourful place.I recently watched this film with a view of writing this review, it has been at least 10-15 years since I last watched this film. I must admit, I enjoyed it as much now as I did years ago and still find that this is a film that I am happy to recommend. It is still as relevant today as it was in its heyday; in fact, it might be more relevant today with societies changing beliefs and identity than it ever was.An arty musical film if ever you did see one - great music - colourful and interesting - good cinematography - great pace plenty of presence - and ultimately, lots and lots of fun!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
72,gftbiloxi,Let's Do The Time Warp Again: The Cult Classic,10,21 April 2005,"From absolute disaster to international success, few titles have had the roller-coaster ride of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Originally a low-budget English stage show, it exploded into mainstream popularity and became one of London's longest running musicals--but then died a quick and very painful death in New York. As an afterthought, the American company played a limited engagement in Los Angeles and once more the show was a smash hit and soon became a motion picture--which received mixed reviews and proved a box office dud. That probably would have been the end of it, but the film suddenly and unexpectedly emerged as a cult movie phenomena and ascended to international acclaim.The story is well known. All-American Brad Majors and Janet Weiss become engaged and rush to tell their mentor, Dr. Everett Scott. But they take a wrong turn, have a flat, and suddenly find themselves captives of a bisexual transvestite from outer space who is intent on making the perfect boy-toy lover from scratch. Although the material was considerably softened for the screen, even today it remains surprisingly sharp, and the film contains numerous references to the classic Hollywood horror films that inspired it.The cast, most of whom played in the various stage versions, is truly astonishing. Tim Curry was little known when the film was made, but he shows tremendous talent in the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter, the bisexual transvestite from outer space; his performance is a remarkable combination of broad farce, sensuality, and dark wit. While Curry is certainly the show's centerpiece, the rest of the cast is equally effective. Both Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are beautifully cast as the goody-goody Brad and Janet; Richard O'Brien (who wrote the stage show), Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, and Meatloaf all give memorable turns as the mad doctor's bizarre associates; and character actors Johnathan Adams and Charles Gray offer considerable drop-dead wit in supporting roles. Only Peter Hinwood seems out of his league, selected more for looks than talent--but strange to say, this actually works in the context of the film.If you've only seen this film at an audience-participation showing, you're in for a surprise: THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is wickedly funny, something you're likely to miss when every one in the audience is screaming at the screen. Although the material was toned down for the movie--song sequences were rearranged, lyrics rewritten, and script and characters softened--the whole thing still has plenty of bite. The story, of course, is intrinsically subversive; the script has a uniquely British sensibility; and the songs are catchy, bouncy, and frequently have lyrics that are very clever in an underhanded sort of way. Like most cult films, it will not appeal to everyone--but if you get it, you've gotta have it.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
73,johno-21,"Fun as a midnight movie experience, but only once",5,23 June 2006,"As a strange and witty stage musical of the early 70's The Rocky Horror Show was probably a fun experience for the theater goers when it originally ran in London in 1973. Successful Austrailian stage director Jim Sharman directed the original play by Richard O'Brien with O'Brien who also wrote the songs in the cast that included Tim Curry. Lou Adler brought the production to Broadway in the spring of 1975 with Sharman again directing Curry and O'Brien in the cast and rock star Meatloaf also added to the American production. Adler put the play into production as a Hollywood film with Sharman directing the film and Curry, O'Brien and Meatloaf reprising their stage roles and costumes by Sue Blane who did both the stage productions. Film actors Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick were cast for the film as the young couple who's car breaks down in a rain storm and they seek refuge in a strange castle of a transvestite scientist and friends from the galaxy Transsexual. As a film and a musical it was a little too bizarre and over-the-top for audiences to last very long in general release. Years later marketed as a midnight movie that evoked audience participation it became a cult classic. Tim Curry is good and so is O'Brien but it's hard to actually judge their campy performances when the rest of the cast is purposely bad. The songs are witty lyrics set to bad music. As a theater play it might be fun and as part of a theater audience where the theater goers around you are dressed up like characters from the film and talk back to the screen and throw stuff at the screen it's definitely entertaining.

Guaranteed To Un-nerve And Offend After Forty Years.,10,7 October 2010,"how do you praise a film that already has so much praise heaped on it? i guess try to say something different that hasn't already been said. easier said than done. for one thing it's hard for me to think about this film in a detached way since, like 'Mary Poppins', i've also seen this over a hundred times at least. no exaggeration. i've seen 'Rocky' and 'Poppins' well over a hundred viewings. it's like my brain has become so meshed with these film experiences it's a little hard to accurately assess what i'm feeling or these film's effect on me as i view them.i could go on about the cleverness of the whole production, the incredible performances, hilarious, ribald script, or the truly memorable and tuneful score. i could even wax enthusiastically about the deep brilliance of Curry's performance, most notably in the ballad 'I'm Going Home', but it's been done and i won't.probably the most original and unique thing to say that other's don't say is this; you don't need the audience experience to get the best viewing of 'Rocky'. i know. i can hear a primal scream arising from my generation and 'Rocky' fans at this idea, but i believe it to be the case. this is such good musical theater that you don't need an audience yelling out the dialogue and songs to enhance it. actually the audience only distracts from the great music and performances. so much in fact,that i never realized how truly good 'Rocky' really was until i started viewing it at home without the audience participation and distraction.to each his or her (in this case you can't be sure) own, i suppose. the audience participation is fun and worth a look, but not ultimately the best way to see this. i wouldn't go see a Lloyd Webber play with everyone shouting out the songs and dialogue, so i don't really want to view 'Rocky' that way either.it also seems like some of the die-hard fans miss the experience somewhat. i've actually talked to fans who loved the film but thought it was cheesy and poorly made schlock. couldn't be further from the truth. i am always amazed at what a slick, glossy, professional production the film makers achieved on such a low budget for the time. 'Camelot' and 'Hello Dolly' might have been twenty times more expensive, but as good cinema, those films are disasters. not to mention their grotesque budgets almost sank the studios. 'Rocky' was made for a mere million dollars, and is far better than it's grotesque, behemoth, counter parts. i can't watch the likes of 'Camelot','Oaklahoma', or 'Hello Dolly', without feeling bored and nauseated by their conventionality.it's also funny to note how many people are still uncomfortable with the films outlook and message. that's cool. that's the way it's supposed to be. the film is about crossing the line and shaking up the norm. i was surprised at how many Gay men i've met who hated this film and were uncomfortable with it. but then again those were the ""log cabin"" types of Gays. you know the ones that try so hard to be straight acting and normal.even though many would disagree, this film has a lot of class. it is also very good cinema(on stage it was a spoof of 'B' movies), and much better musical theater than most of the gobbly- gook Broadway and off-Broadway has to offer.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Produced By Lou Adler, Michael Whiet and John Goldstone, Cinematography Peter Suschitzky, Costume Design By Sue Blane Since 1975, The Rocky Horror Pictures Show has delighted audiences during its long run of midnight movie showings and it has a high place among cult classic films. Outwardly, it's a hilarious, campy, nutty homage to sci fi movies and horror movies pre-1970's (RKO films like King Kong are spoofed, Frankenstein, Dracula, and 50's aliens from outer space movies). But its inner magic comes from the no hold-bars liberal spirit which belonged to the 1970's, a time of gay pride, open sexuality, vulgarity, craziness and overall non-conformity. The film showed an openly bisexual transvestite as its lead character. The movie was released after the success of the stage musical in London by Richard O'Brien who did the music and lyrics (and starred in the film version as Riff Raff). O'Brien followed the success of Rocky Horror with a less successful sequel ""Shock Treatment"" in 1982.Plot: Brad Majors (Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Sarandon) have just gotten engaged after attending a friend's wedding in the old-fashioned, 1950's like town of Denton, USA. During a rainstorm, their car breaks down and they enter an old castle to call for roadside assistance. Here, they immediately become the new prisoners and playthings for its decadent and wild master, the scientist/vampire Frank'N'Furter (Curry). After a Transylvanian party, Frank'N'Furter invites his new guests to witness his latest creation- a muscular blonde man named Rocky (Hinwood) whom he later marries. But Frank'N'Furter's crazy sexual cravings soon includes both Brad and Janet, whose morals are corrupted. Not used to the craziness of the castle, they soon become victims. Before long, it becomes necessary for wheelchair-bound Dr. Scott (Adams)to save them. Wo are Frank'N'Furter and his servants Riff-Raff and Magenta? Ghouls ? Aliens ? What devilish plan has Frank'N'Furter formed ? Tim Curry's performance as the transvestite castle master is sheer comic brilliance. With his powerful rock star voice and over the top personality, he shines in such scenes/songs as ""Sweet Transvestite"" and ""I Can Make You A Man"". Other numbers include an homage to rock music ""Hot Patoo-tie"" by Meatloaf as a psychotic motorcycle rider. There's the famous dance number ""Time Warp"" and more moving and artful songs ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" which opens the film and ""Over At The Frankenstein's Plac"" and the sad concluding songs ""I'm Going Home"" and ""Super Heroes"". Nelle Campelle ""Little Nelle"" is delightful as his groupie Columbia and Patricia Quinn is exotic as the Transylvanian maid Magenta. The cinematography by Sushutzky is meant to resemble the Hammer studios/Eastman color horror movies with its depiction of haunted houses. There is never a dull moment in this highly entertaining 2 hour film. But keep in mind, this movie has always been an adult movie, not so much because it includes partial nudity, but because it deals with the themes of bisexuality, transvestite lifestyle and jokes that adults could understand but are lost to minors. Also, the age of this film shows when compared to comedies of today. It's a classic that is still beloved by many who still flock to midnight showings.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
80,tomimt,A true cult classic,8,24 March 2005,"""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is not one of the most greatly directed movies ever. Actually it is, by the merits of direction, mostly mediocre. But, unlike most mediocre films, TRHPS is not a mediocre film. It is quite interesting.For me, the savior of this film is, and probably always will be Tim Curry (Dr. Frank-N-Furter), who is one of the most underrated movie actors ever: He overacts, but he is one of those actors who can over act very well, actually brilliantly. He has charisma. But from some reason he never actually become a big star. Also Susan Sarandon (Janet Weiss) is absolutely fantastic, and what surprises me the most, she is still as beautiful as she was back then in 1975.So quick plot: newly engaged Janet and Brad (Barry Bostwick) go in the mansion of Frank-N-Furter because they suffer a flat tire. At the mansion they encounter a punch of weird transsexuals from planet Transylvania. The movie is narrated by The Criminologist (Charles Gray), which has never actually made any sense for me, but it does work in the wacky atmosphere of whole film. Besides it's not about the plot, it's about the music. The movie is a musical after all.Also there is a lot of references in older RKO horror and sci-fi films. The whole plot is actually just a huge change to make fun of old horror clichés.But as I said, the flick is a musical, so the music does play important part in the film: so if you don't like rock'n'roll you might have hard time liking this film. But if you do, there are some great tunes in the film. My personal favorites are Time Warp song and the introduction song of Frank-N-Furter. But there is lots of tracks to choose from.And for a note, this is a cult movie, probably the only real cult movie in the world, in the sense that people gather around in theaters, dressed up in their favorite characters, sign along with the film and know exactly how to behave with certain characters. You might not like it, but it is forth seeing for anyone who considers himself to be a movie fan. And who knows... maybe you'll even like it. I know I did. But I wouldn't dress up as Frank-N-Furter. I'm not tall enough.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
81,DonFishies,"There's no way to explain it, just watch it!",8,9 March 2006,"Bizarre, strange, other-worldly. There's really no way to explain the movie, but it has kick-ass music at least! This is a movie that everyone should find time to watch at least twice at some point in their lives. I had watched it before, but had not extracted nearly as much amusement out of it the first time as I did the second. It's over-the-top, and totally silly, but that's what makes the movie fun. The whole idea of using loose genders, and having all sorts of ""gender bending"" antics just can't be anything else.As said, the music is top-notch, as is the choreography. It shows that this was a Broadway show before it became a cult film musical. Some of the lines that are used within the music, and even the beats, are just catchy and have translated well into the film 2006 film realm. This film could take the likes of modern musicals like Chicago and The Phantom of the Opera any day.The acting performances are all great in their own little way, even if everyone is shown up by Tim Curry, who spends most of the film wearing female clothing. It is amusing even more so to see Susan Surandon and Barry Boswick's acting well before their time.If there is anything I can say against it, it's the fact that not much happens in the middle of the film, and before you know it, it kinda just fizzles right out. In that way, it just seems like someone came up with such a brilliantly bizarre idea, and just didn't know how to keep it going until its conclusion.But that's just a small quip in an otherwise excellent film with cult written all over it. I just only wish I could see it with a live audience. Now why hasn't the soundtrack come in for me yet?8/10.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

It's a clichéd idea of a newly-engaged couple who are forced to enter a strange house and see all sorts of weird things and people. It's campy and meant to be so. It has had a significant cult following since it came out. So how is it, as entertainment? I don't know if this was originally a movie and the stage version followed it, or vice versa. But this is clearly a stage-type musical on a video screen. It's silly, flashy, and breaks into song and the movie has no real plot.This would be greatly suited for the stage; loud music, a large cast of dancers, lots of flash and glam. But on a small video screen ""Rocky Horror"" doesn't really work, any more than stage magic works if you don't see it in person.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

87,oOoBarracuda,"""And crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race""",10,22 August 2016,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show was one of those glorious films I began watching with no preconceived notions about it or any clue what it was about. I knew that there was a cult status that had followed this film since it was first released in 1975, but I knew little else about it. So rarely does one get the chance to go blind into a film, and I took that chance and could not be any happier with the result. Directed by Jim Sharman and starring Tim Curry in his film debut, along with the film's writer Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell reprising their stage roles, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has exploded into a phenomenon filled with audience participation, props and shadow casts making a viewing of the film a rite of passage for young people. Beginning as a stage production before being made into the film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has withstood the test of time, crowned as the longest constantly running film in movie theatre history.The film opens at a wedding outside of a church in the idyllic city of Denton Ohio. Friends of Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) have just tied the knot, and Janet has caught the bouquet. Taking his cue, Brad proposes to Janet and the two decide they must travel to see their former science teacher, now friend and mentor, to share the good news. Along the way, the two experience car trouble and wander upon a mysterious castle to ask for help and use a telephone. What Brad and Janet have come upon disturbs them as they meet a peculiar group of people who have come to see an affair of a transvestite scientist. Brad and Janet are undressed by the domestic of the home, Magenta (Patricia Quinn) and the handyman Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) and taken up to the master's laboratory. Once they formally meet Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) they begin to learn that he is a scientist interested in reanimation and has the secret to human life. The affair that they happened upon is one in which Dr. Frank-N- Furter is going to reveal the muscle man he has created. After the reveal of Rocky (Peter Hinwood), things take a turn for the strange, and everyone is escorted to bed as Frank and Rocky get better acquainted. After a night of trysts, it is unsure whom should be paired with whom anymore and everyone, including rival scientist, and friend to Brad and Janet, Dr. Everett V. Scott (Jonathan Adams), who happened upon the night's activities, is invited to dinner. After a raucous dinner reveal/birthday party more sexual liberation occurs and everyone participates in Dr. Frank N-Furter's floor show in full formal attire. After spending time in Frank-N-Furter's palace and submitting to his plans, Brad and Janet definitely don't leave the same way they came in. From the opening sequence of Patricia Quinn's infamous red lips singing to the audience, one knows they are in for a wild ride. The beginning of the film is filled with fun nods to classic cinema, including The Wizard of Oz as the same characters that are at the wedding will also appear in Transylvania. There are also tons of nods to B-horror movies of the early days of Hollywood making The Rocky Horror Picture Show a treat for fans of classic films. My first experience with a rock musical did not disappoint. Since I first saw this movie just two months ago, I have bought the soundtrack in two different mediums so I can listen to the music anytime I please, yeah, it's that good. Speaking of the music, am I the only one that thinks that, as cute as Time Warp is, Sweet Transvestite is the song that really steals the show? Although, to be fair, any scene with Tim Curry stole the show. It's unbelievable to think that this film was Tim Curry's film debut; what an introduction! He was extraordinary in this role and proved that if he can do Dr. Frank-N-Furter, he can do anything. It's truly unfortunate that he has been so underutilized in Hollywood, with acting ability and a voice like his you would expect him to be in just about everything, alas, this did not turn out to be, although he has an extensive filmography of voice work to his credit. I suppose such is the life of a character actor, it's just so disheartening to see how great he can be (If you need any further evidence check out Three Men in a Boat or Blue Money) and to see him act in the worst American movies imaginable. I wonder if Tim Curry's entrance coming out of the elevator in The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't the best on film. The Rocky Horror Picture Show does many things that are hard to do well on film. Not only does the film use a narrator which can bog down the story line and come off clunky and often disjointed, but several of the characters also broke the fourth wall as well. This device is almost never done well but executed flawlessly in this film. What's more, however, is that The Rocky Horror Picture Show encourages rebellion of expectations, tolerance of differences, and acceptance of our own individuality. Of course, sexual freedom is explored in the film but so was rebellion from a meaningless middle-class existence where a new wife is praised for her cooking or a new husband is commended because he has a promotion on the way. The Rocky Horror Picture Show offers viewers the message of sexual freedom, but that's not all. Being true to yourself if the heart of the film, and to go after what you want no matter what it is; don't dream it, be it.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

As The Timewarp kicks in she declares ""If I ever get a mansion, I'm doing this!"" She's onboard. Tim Curry's not even appeared yet. Frank-N-Furter's entrance has to be one of the greatest in cinematic history and as he belts out 'Sweet Transvestite' I'm singing along too. The singing of course is marvellous, but I always forget how magnificent Curry's voice is. Sarandon too. Even Meatloaf is great! Is there any point trying to explain the plot? Two all American innocent kids break down in a storm, stumble on a castle filled with sex crazed deviants, aliens and a mad scientist, who's created his own fantasy companion.

There are an awful lot of bad films, B films, underground films, all the works of either the amateurs or the lazy, or the untalented, and RHPS could easily be included in this group, but the one genius thing it does is it takes tired old genres that have been played out and puts a fresh spin on them. Mel Brooks accomplished this by mocking westerns and the result was Blazing Saddles. Richard O'Brian took corny old sci-fi films and set them to rock music, so the fundamental concept really could have held up no matter how campy or ridiculous the story gets, and it pushes the envelope on those two parameters. It helps that the music is pretty good and the lyrics are catchy and memorable, one that has always particularly struck a chord with me is ""don't dream it, be it"". I have always loved this film and I always will, from the first time I heard Time Warp on a scratchy car radio in 1975 and had no idea it was from a film that I wouldn't see until years later.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

There are some songs which aren't too fantastic and really seem to drag on, but there are some real gems.

91,baileycrawly,One of my Favorites,10,4 December 2019,"It's easy in our current culture and society to forget exactly how big the Rocky Horror Show was at the time it was first released. It's perhaps even harder to imagine how controversial it would've been to see Tim Curry, an adult man, in fishnet stockings, high heals and full makeup under a cape whisked away as he sings ""Sweet Transvestite"" in a film funded and released by a mainstream film distributor, too.The movie is good. Tim Curry absolutely shines in his Frank N. Furter performance (something he had been doing on stage for some time prior to the film). The sets are beautiful, the acting is fun and campy, the story easy enough to follow, and the music is to DIE for.I can't help but be thankful that Richard O'Brien had the courage to produce such a product in the 70s, when homophobia was much more prevalent than it is today. To make a musical steeped in ""sins of the flesh"" with major homosexual undertones, it was a ballsy move that produced a film that stood the test of time and is still every bit as enjoyable as it was the day it first came out.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Its gleeful projections of sexual liberation remain watershed, and are propelled to dizzying heights by an improbable convergence of knife-sharp dialogue, over-the-top musical convention, and a perverse homage to 1950's sci-fi and horror films.Movie landmarks tend to be fronted by an indelible face, and it's provided here by an alien transvestite from the Transylvania galaxy -- one Dr. Frank N. Furter, played with magnetic chutzpah and otherworldly swagger by the remarkable Tim Curry. Two stranded newlyweds visit our doctor's castle, where's he patching together a Frankensteinian beefcake by the name of Rocky Horror. Curry inhabits the character with the grinning, campy eroticism of an out-of-this-world rock front man, propelling the doctor into the stratospheric pantheon of truly iconic film characters.Beyond the sum of its parts, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is a reminder of the towering creative heights a movie can reach when it insists on being everything it can imagine itself to be. This legendary slab of rock 'n' roll cinema is a mile marker for counterculture's rare insurgence into the wider cultural zeitgeist, and presents itself as a strong candidate for greatest rock film ever. - (Was this review of use to you?

The plot is a strange mish-mash of horror, sci-fi, comedy, and gay musical, and it doesn't always fit together. In particular, the alien stuff at the end has always been one step too far for me. The songs are good for the most part, except for the ones at the end. So really, I like everything about this film up until about the dinner scene, and then it's all downhill from there.

RKO Hollywood is turned into a personal twisted extravaganza while the supporting cast and tacky set weigh it down.

So I watched the movie again. And I'm honestly glad I did.Let's get one thing perfectly clear. This is not a movie for sane people. If you're expecting anything that even comes remotely in the vicinity of normal, you really shouldn't watch it. It's a story that involves many things. Those things include: a transvestite alien, a pair of incestuous household hands, a flat tire, a radio broadcast of Nixon's resignation speech, and a group of very, very weird and strangely-dressed individuals randomly bursting into song and dance. Plus there's a lobotomized former delivery boy (played by Meatloaf), a monster, and a jealous, whiny tramp (played to perfection by Little Nell Campbell). And it all unfolds to a very unusual rock-and-roll soundtrack written by Richard O'Brien (who appears in the movie as Riff Raff).Oh, and let me tell you something. The sight of Tim Curry throwing off a shiny cape to reveal the lingerie he's wearing is one of the most jarring events of my entire life.

A few in the middle, which is where I am with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I watched this some years ago, how I watched it has no bearing on my rating and makes no difference. Watching a movie is just that, 'watching'.Whether it's a crowded theater with people enjoying things the way they like too or seeing at home. (Although I do like seeing more standard types of movies on the big screen.) I watched the movie and I did like the songs, they're very well performed. ""Time Warp"" is an unmistakably catchy song and some of the others are good too but not as memorable. As for the story, well it's simple Janet & boyfriend are typical straight-laced boy & girl in love, whose car breaks down in the worst possible place. They're let into this already creepy place and find even creepier and/or insane people / creatures. That particular segment was played many times on a local music video station here in Phoenix on Halloween in 1983 and '84. I liked that much of it then but what I saw later...kind of like ""why the cruelty & harshness?""I'm not saying there are not bad things in the world or that filmmakers should ""never"" be predictable,but like one person said here,""this movie isn't for everyone."" I just feel that some of the more disturbing things in the film just really weren't called for. Janet,boyfriend & the Dr. (It's just a jump to the left) are basically humiliated for no reason. The ending was no surprise to me but I was hoping those three would escape in time. In short,I'm no prude but just a good guy who lives & lets live. I'm not one to look down on others for things they enjoy,as long as it harms no one else or themselves. However,Rocky Horror is just not really my taste when it comes to movies. I like the dancing and singing and some of the comedy but the rest is just not as appealing. For those who cherish it,more power to you.

After dealing with an evening of debauchery,as only Frank & company can delver,their lives are forever changed. This is a movie/experience that is intended for audience participation (the audience at the proper cues,tosses rice,water,toast,etc & shouts out a series of ""cat calls"",mostly all of which are down right funny,and most of them are pretty vulgar & crude). At some screenings,audience members are known to dress up as their favourite characters in the film,and at most screenings,there is a shadow cast acting out the film as it is being screened,just to add to the deranged fun on screen. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is guaranteed for an evening of fun & outrage (the good kind,of course). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for some strong sexual content,violence,drug related material & brief strong language. Not for the little ones.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is about the weirdest one that I've seen.  It combines the music with sex and humor that is extremely bizarre.A criminologist (Charles Gray) tells the story of two straight (and I mean ""straight"") American ordinary people, Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon), who make the mistake of spending the night at the home of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a man who thinks of himself as transvestite and is throwing a party for some friends of his (I assume).The movie is a bit baffling at times, but it's still highly entertaining. Bostwick and Sarandon are both okay, but Curry and Richard O'Brien are fun to watch and give very good performances.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
105,werefox08,This Will Probably ........Keep Rocking,5,6 January 2013,"The first half of this strange and camp movie is much better than the second. By that time...it is becoming tiresome...Tim Curry no longer looks astonishing, and the songs are getting weaker. The millions who see this as a cult film would disagree. Indeed this movie has brought great joy and happiness --probably to more people than most ""Blockbusters"". Curry does a great job as Frankfurter, and is easily the one who carries this. The actual story is so bizarre, fans (when it was released in 1975)...simply went along with it. No one had ever seen anything like it before...or since. The humour is feeble, but its the whole ""spectacle"" that the cultists appear to enjoy...and of course dressing up like there heroes...and having a jolly good time",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
106,squirrel_burst,I wish I could put an asterisk next to my rating...,10,1 December 2014,"""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is a strange film not only because of its content, but because of the way it needs to be seen to be appreciated. You have probably heard of this film and how it is often shown at midnight with an audience dressing up, singing along and shouting non-stop at the screen. That's exactly how you should see the movie because at home, by yourself it really isn't anything special. This broad musical follows Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) who find themselves stranded in a rainstorm on a strange road after getting engaged. Seeking a telephone, the couple decide to get out of the car and travel a creepy castle spotted earlier in the road. When they arrive, they find that the Annual Transylvanian Convention is being held. Bizarre-looking characters are singing, dancing and being extremely frank about their sexuality, much to Brad and Janet's shock. Things become even stranger when the head of the convention, Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) arrives. He is dressed in a corset, fishnets, wears bright lipstick and strips the couple of their clothes before bringing them and the rest of the convention to his laboratory where he presents his creation, a perfect man named Rocky (Peter Hinwood). After witnessing Frank N. Furter's depravity, Frank and Janet are sent to bed, but the Dr.'s influence is already starting to affect them...Technically, this is not a very well made movie. The acting isn't particularly good, the plot is often barely intelligible, there are wardrobe malfunctions (Magenta before being turned to stone, Dr. Frank during the end of the film), badly choreographed dance numbers, scenes where characters don't act like human beings at all (like when Janet puts on her robe, takes three steps then takes it off again), scenes where the low production really shows (when getting wet, Dr. Frank's tattoo can be seen running). If you're watching the movie just by yourself, not knowing what you're getting into you'll just be wondering what the big deal is about. This is where the audience participation comes in. Despite its flaws, the film is very memorable and features many catchy songs. It's got a lot of iconic imagery and the dialogue lends itself well to ridicule. It's likely that there's a theatre somewhere near where you live that will at some point show the film and let the audience participate. If you're curious at all about the movie, that's the way to see it. Depending on how obsessive the fans are and how crowded the theatre is, if you're a newcomer (or ""virgin"") you might find yourself getting hazed. If you're lucky, the worst that will happen to you while the film is playing is getting pelted by rice and confetti but you might end up getting soaked or get hit upside the head by toast. Ideally, at least one person will know the ""scripted"" lines to appropriately riff on the movie and will have just as much dialogue as all of the characters put together. That's really the only way to see the film: barely being able to hear what is going on unless the characters are singing, not really caring about what the plot is unless Tim Curry is on the screen and gleefully pointing out all of the flaws in the production.Reviewing the film really feels kind of pointless. The fans of the film are die-hard fans and would gleefully come at me with an ice pick if I recommend that you don't watch the movie. Unless you've seen the movie with an audience and know what the experience is like, there's no sense in watching the movie at home. I like to think of ""The Rocky Horror Picture"" as one of those indoor roller-coasters where a screen shows graphics while your seat rumbles and swings back and forth. The video by itself is pointless to watch on its own and if you did, you would be very disappointed. You would be missing the point though, it isn't even meant to be seen on its own. It's meant to be seen with all of those people screaming and throwing stuff in the air. Having seen the movie by itself at home, I'd give it a middling 2,5/5; nothing special. This is where that asterisk comes in though. With an audience that knows what it's doing, an MC and people dressing up, it's a blast and easily comes up to a 5/5, if only because it's an experience you will never forget.

107,Jacques98,Any movie that makes me contradict myself this much must be at least decent.,5,23 January 2009,"As of 2009, it's official that there have been more classic horror rehashes/remakes/homage films than actual classic horror films. It's almost humorous when a movie like Hatchet or Wrong Turn will come around and proclaim to the masses that it's here to bring back oldschool horror . . . for literally the 500th time. Obviously, there is something about nostalgia of overtly bad movies that captivates directors and audiences alike. In modern cinema, nostalgia has become such a driving force that things like originality, intelligence, and quality have been discarded. So, looking back on The Rocky Horror Picture Show from a modern viewpoint, I can't help but find it refreshing to say the least. Instead of just wholesale copy/pasting past films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show relives nostalgia through semi-original ideas. If more modern homage films must be madeand I really wish they weren't, but it's inevitableand if they have to copy/paste anything, then they should copy/paste The Rocky Horror Picture Show's formula.It's always hard to review a film that everyone loves but you've just seen for the first time. Very few movies mean the same to the modern viewer what they are to those who saw it at midnight on the day it was released. I watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show for the first time last night, and it simply failed to awe me. Do not misunderstand me: I'm not saying it's a bad movie by any stretch of my words, but it was just a little dull. I can't put my finger on why, exactlyit just was. I guess it could have been due to the overhype it receives. I was expecting some god-awesome transvestite musical with a plot like none other and characters that I'd never forget. In reality, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was just average, even for its time. It's creative, but it's not original. The characters are memorable, but they're not wholesale unforgettable. The jokes are funny, but they're a lot more typical than I thought they'd be. The entire movie is intentionally pumped with clichés, but that dulls it all rather than creates obvious homage. Maybe I'm being overly critical, but I'd go as far as to say I was very disappointed.What I'm trying to say is this: The Rocky Horror Picture show isn't as amazing to the first-time viewer as it's hyped to be.All the actors play their roles perfectly. Tim Curry certainly does not disappoint. But a lot of the supporting characters are all just clichés-with-legs, and that really dulls the movie further. It's as if they were rejected by The Munsters and The Adam's Family and decided to get together and make a movie with the exact same exact character profiles. It's sad to see such a lack of imagination on less important details.The story itself primarily unfolds in a single room, and that gets boring quickly. Though there is a lot of homage to sci-fi/horror films, there isn't enough of it. The writers incorporate a few over-the-top 40s moments, but they're few and far between. The story itself is mostly a long, linier cliché, and I do not think that was intentional. Even if it was, it's boring. It's predictable. It doesn't hold your attention. Once your mind can get past the awesome-creepy Tim Curry character, everything just falls into predictability.So, as you can hopefully tell, my review contradicts itself more than once. One paragraph I call The Rocky Horror Picture Show a great movie, then the next I call it pathetic. But those contradictory statements represent how I feel about the overall movie. It's both semi-original and painfully predictable. It's certainly not everything that the hype says it is, but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve that hype. AHH! Okay, before I contradict myself again . . .Overall: The Rocky Horror Picture show is an essential piece of cinema. It demands at least one viewing. However, it isn't as imaginative as it appears to be.5/10",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I suspect some of them actually don't like it, but feel they can't say so because well, it's cool to like this film, isn't it?

Obviously not my kind of film, but I honestly cannot understand why so many people like it, or SAY they do.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
114,galensaysyes,Just people clomping around,5,25 December 2009,"This movie presents itself as wild and outrageous, but now seems about as far-out as ""The Munsters,"" and old-hat besides. With one exception: the scene in which the mad doctor seduces the husband. This is still startling, and surprisingly erotic (especially considering how sterile the movie is in general, notwithstanding its drag queen trappings); it also seems to be the central scene, since it conveys the movie's message: a plea on behalf of sexuality--not homosexuality, as might have been expected, but bi- or pan-sexuality. Its proselytizing quality makes it seem slightly offensive; but maybe I was just responding to it by the standards of its period.Although the music is obviously a pastiche (it sounded to me like Kurt Weill by way of The Who, with borrowings from the Stones, but this is strictly a guess), it is by far the strongest element of the work, and seemingly what the work was built around. The form, to the extent there is one, is that of a cabaret show. And here I must pause to point out, in old-fogeyish fashion, that in some circles in the early '70s the true cult item was not the film but the stage play, whose adherents unanimously agreed that the movie didn't measure up. I can easily believe that, since it looks like a stage play amateurishly transferred to film. On stage the physical detail of the production may well have provided a kind of subtext; the theatre can do that in a way film can't. In the absence of a substitute, the work becomes incoherent. It isn't an accurate parody of the type of movie being parodied; even the logo behind one of the dance numbers belongs to a studio that didn't make those movies. But all the movie-buff paraphernalia is really a red herring; the atmosphere isn't Hollywood but Underground, not faux Whale but faux Warhol.As for Tim Curry in the lead: was he the performer who created the role? He seems like an understudy filling in for Lou Reed or David Bowie, and he's neither very camp nor very tranny. The two cast members who stand out are Susan Sarandon, whose talent couldn't help showing through even then, and Meat Loaf, who in his one number brings the show to life (as Queen Latifah did ""Chicago"" in analogous circumstances): at last, someone who can channel the music! He is perhaps not very graceful, but he's plainly musical, and getting a charge out of the music, and this informs his every move. By comparison the rest of the cast is just people clomping around on a cluttered set.However, I can say one thing for the movie: I didn't hate it. I had expected to, since I dislike camp, female impersonation, and that whole side of gay male culture which I perceive as woman-demeaning. (However, I quite liked ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" which, if it's about anything, is about that; and so perhaps I don't dislike it as much as I think.) The way I could tell I didn't hate ""Rocky Horror"" was that the DVD contained something else I did hate, or a simulation of it: the audience response (which the user can choose to mix in or not). Hearing it on a recording is obviously not the same as being there, but it enabled me to imagine closely enough what that would have been like--which would be close to my idea of Hell. I had expected that the spectators' comebacks would make the time pass faster, but they were just irritating, fannishness at its most conformist. The audience talks back to the movie, but the backtalk isn't clever or original; it's a received catechism of obvious, unfunny responses, whose ritual inanity set my teeth on edge and made me cringe for any similar offenses I might have committed, in my salad days.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

At least I wasn't the virgin who had to lick whipped cream off the tip of a gigantic blow-up cock! At the screening, they had a movie screen showing the movie and a stage with a cast acting the whole thing out. It was so much fun, and this is the best way to see this film.

You will never be the same! For props, get rice (for the wedding), spray bottles (for rain), newspaper (to put over your head during the rain), flashlights (for the ""There's a Light"" musical number), noisemakers (for the operation scene), toast (for when Frankie proposes a toast), and a party hat (for Rocky's birthday song).

117,TuckMN,"Oh Brad, Oh Janet!",10,20 February 2004,"I was lucky enough to see this film in a test audience WAY back when it was first released...I loved it then and I love it now.I knew that it was a filmed version of a stage play and that made it all the more fascinating; simply because filming something that has been on the stage and making it work is always a challenge and is very rarely successful... but it certainly worked this time.No one knew who Susan Sarandon or Barry Bostwick were; now of course they are both major forces in film and television.I wonder if now they are embarrassed by this small but important film.Even to this day, when I hear or see ""Rocky"" I am impelled to get up and dance or sing along with the film -- something that did not happen when I first viewed it. But shortly after my first viewing -- when it was still a fairly unknown film -- people started reacting to what they saw on the screen...The first hint that this was a very special film came when a woman in the audience clicked finger cymbals together at an entirely appropriate moment -- I was enchanted and amazed -- this was audience participation on a level I had never experienced before.As time went one -- as it seems to do -- audience participation grew and grew; until what was happening in front of the screen was as important was what was actually on the screen.This is probably the first film where audience participation grew to be as important as the film itself.I must admit that I do miss the quiet nights where a person could sit in the dark and just watch an amazing film without someone with a squirt gun or toast or cards is compelled to 'add' to an already brilliant film.See this one at home and be amazed -- then see it in a public venue and be even more amazed.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
118,LanceBrave,2012's Rocky Horror Midnight Experience,8,8 November 2013,"In 2012, the weekend before Halloween, The east coast was threatened with a devastating hurricane, an appropriately named ""Frankenstorm."" This ended up pulling a tree down in my yard and leaving me without power for a week. So where was I that Saturday? Standing out in line in front of our local theater for a midnight screening of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" This was the third year I had done the Rocky Horror Midnight Experience. The theater was less crowded then in the previous years, only a little more then half-full. The crowd was still decent, shouting along, dancing, having a lot of fun, as you'd expect. However, maybe it was just me and my lack of sleep, but it seems the excitement peaked a little early. The oddly poetic image of toilet paper and toast filling the air above us, silhouetted against the screen, a little pass the hour point, seemed the natural conclusion to the night. It's also fair to say the shadow cast this year wasn't as good as 2010's. They weren't bad. Everyone was enthusiastic and in the spirit. Janet was very busty, which I didn't mind, and the actor playing Rocky was very popular with the ladies. (And seemed to be smuggling a roll of quarters in his speedo.) Overall, everyone just seemed a little less in to it. Anyway: The movie itself. Is it actually any good? That's an important question. From a critical perspective, it remains divisive. I found myself feeling a little bored with the picture this year. It's certainly an entertaining film. The music is roundly excellent. The cast is extremely good, with everyone inhabiting their roles fully, to the point were this film has defined most of the cast's careers. Tim Curry is obviously the stand-out performances but this year I found myself admiring Barry Boswick's comedic timing. The production values are actually pretty good too. Most of the jokes land successfully. In particularly I love Charles Gray's deadpan framing device and the long sequence of name-calling. There's enough general weirdness in the performances and delivery to add some appeal. But from a writing perspective, I found myself wondering. The pace meanders quite a bit and several of the songs don't actually contribute to the plot. The latter half of the second act basically lumbers around until we get to the floor show at the end. Dr. Scott doesn't actually contribute much to the story. Frank is the most popular character in the film even though, you know, he's actually a textbook psychopath, right down to the charisma. He doesn't care about anyone but himself, manipulates and hurts the people around without pausing, not to mention murdering someone with a pickaxe because they glanced at his boyfriend. The rule clue that he's an asshole is that, despite doing all this awful stuff, he still considers himself the hero of the movie. ""I'm Going Home"" is basically Frank telling us that he's the victim, of an uncaring world where he doesn't fit in. He imagines an audience cheering and applauding for him, in a blatant act of self-deluded narcissism. The movie acknowledges this by killing him off at the end. The ending, which leaves our lead trio collapsed on the ground, worn out by their embrace of hedonism, says that attitude of sexual wantonness is bad. Even though the rest of the movie basically goes on about how this is awesome and you squares need to be less uptight, maaaan. The themes are jumbled and uncertain is what I'm saying.It's possible the people who made the movie were too high to notice this disparity. And, considering the general mood of the midnight screenings, maybe the viewer is suppose to be as high. Perhaps Richard O'Brian is saying that you should accept yourself and be open with your sexuality but don't go overboard with it. Anyway, I enjoy the movie, flaws and all. It's certainly an intriguing mess of pop culture references, rock music, and sexual confusion.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
119,budmassey,A tribute to the accumulated genius that made it.,10,10 June 2001,"Here I am, fresh out of high school in Toledo, Ohio, and already an unabashed movie nut.  Then one day I hear a radio commercial for a film that combines Rock and Roll, Horror, and Sci-Fi into the film to end all films. Strange, it only shows at midnight, but why not?The costumes outside didn't tip me off, after all, it was midnight.  But the NOISE!  Didn't anyone come to watch the movie?  I mean, nobody in it was anybody yet, but even then you could see that Susan Sarandon had something. In fact you could see exactly what she had, and that ain't bad.Then, with just a jump to the left, it hit me.  This wasn't a movie.  It was a phenomenon, and I wanted to be a part of it.  In the countless midnights afterward when I left behind my real life, and bonded with a rolling crowd of strangers being their real selves, this movie etched itself in my psyche. Oh yeah, the movie.  It's about some aliens who conduct experiments on Earth, and throw wild parties to celebrate their work.  Yadda yadda yadda. Meatloaf does a great sax number!  Sarandon and Barry Bostwick look great in their underwear, and Richard O'Brien, who wrote this masterpiece, is magnificent as the henchman.Most people have a hard time taking this movies seriously, but consider a few facts.  Sarandon has been nominated for four academy awards, and won Best Actress for Dead Man Walking.  Tim Curry is one of the most sought after voice talents in the business.  Peter Robb-King, the film's makeup artist, is the exclusive makeup man for nearly every major film with Sean Connery (Entrapment, The Rock) Harrison Ford (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) not to mention Tommy, Aliens, The Princess Bride and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Ian Whittaker, set decorator, also gave us Sense and Sensibility, Anna and the King and Remains of the Day. And cinematographer Peter Suschitzky filmed The Empire Strikes Back, Immortal Beloved, Red Planet, Man in the Iron Mask, Mars Attacks! and Naked Lunch. Many alumni from this historic work went on to greatness.  Others, like Peter Hinwood have disavowed the film entirely.  But the greatness of this film transcends it contributors.  It is timeless and wonderous, and a tribute to the accumulated genius that made it.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

121,tequila101,I'm just a sweet Transvestite!!!,8,24 October 2012,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film many times and also hearing about how great this horror film was. I oddly put it off so much and then decided that one day, where I had nothing else to do, I decided to pick up ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and give it a good shot. I thought to myself at the time, if I don't like this film, I'm glad I would've given it a try. I had put it off for so long, but I found that after I viewed this well crafted, colorful 1975 masterpiece, my views totally changed.The story is quite simple and it contrasts very well with the songs and strong cast. The entire film round was not a creepy, scary or cliché'd horror film. It never intended to be a dark, gory or sad horror film which depicted disturbance or shock. Instead, for me, it was a massive change that I have ever encountered when watching a horror film. This film was oddly bizarre and crazy. It had the typical themes of musicals and horror aspects going for it, but it overall produced and presented a light hearted value which I had never seen before in many horror films.Sure there were killings, but the crazy chase scenes, the bizarre acting from the cast (especially Susan Sarandon and most notably Tim Curry) and the fantastic musical scores kept this horror film on the lighter side of things. I was never afraid of it.I have to strongly point out that Tim Curry as the wickedly posh/stylish doc was really impressive. As a kid, I first saw him in Muppet Treasure Island where he didn't do to badly with the script he was given. Then the 2nd film I saw him in was Stephen King's IT where to me his performance was a great improvement from the last as he was able to pull off a very scary and sadistically insane clown which showed much humor. But in this, my gosh... it was the best acting I have ever seen in his films.His character was fascinating as I watched the way he did his moves and actions on screen. He truly brang a memorable horror character to the table. The make-up, attire and light-hearted accents also gave a chime of great contrast to the way he started to sing songs.Many of the other cast were strong including Susan Sarandon who I had never seen in a roll like this. I first saw her in The Lovely Bones where she didn't do a bad job, with the little amount of time she had on screen. Then in Dead Man Walking, she did an excellent job and it was a powerful and very provoking performance. In this, I just didn't expect her to play such an out-going roll, where she would prance and 'let the guilt go'. Even if she was excellent here, I just found it so odd to see her in a role like this one.Lastly, the musicals were excellent. Many musicals don't work, but this one kicks the nut out of the shell. Tim Curry especially is the pioneer in mastering the skills and techniques of the way the musicals were shown, contrasted and revealed.Overall, it a classic but very unusual horror film which shows a lot more than your average dark, gory film. Most of the 1970's films were excellent, but the age they were made in were so grim and bleak. Especially films like TCM, Halloween, Wickerman, The Omen or Dawn of the Dead. This film really caught me by surprise with its musicals contrasting with acting and scenarios.Its a good ol' Trabsvestite! 8/10",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
122,spacemonkey_fg,Excellent sci/if horror spoof with catchy tunes!,10,3 March 2005,"Title: Rocky Horror Picture Show Director: Jim Sharman Cast: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Meatloaf, Richard O Brian Review: Its a cult phenomenon, people go to special midnight showings of this film and have audience participation which includes throwing everything from rice and water to screaming ""Asshole"" and ""Slut!"" in certain parts of the movie. So having heard all this I had to finally find out exactly what the heck the big deal was about and I was pleasantly surprised.Brad and Janet are a couple who are very much in love and have plans of getting married soon. On their way to a hotel, their car breaks down in the middle of rain storm so they try and look for a place to stay. They find Dr. Frankenfurters castle and decide that its the best place for them to maybe use a phone. What they don't know is that there's a bunch of cooked up loons waiting inside having the craziest party ever.Well, what can I say I'm a sucker for musicals, and as far as musicals go this is a very good one. The songs are fun, the characters are crazy and the story line is whacked as it could ever be! I devoured every song of this film! I must have re winded ""The Time Warp"" about 500 times and ""Science Fiction/ Double Feature"" is just as catchy. All the songs have this sleazy sci/if, horror, lusty, slutty vibe to them that is very entertaining.As for the horror element of this film well, its there. Its not as abundant as the title might suggest but its there. Lets see, there's the helpless couple coming to stay in a spooky castle in the middle of a lightning storm. There's the butler dude that looks like he was Igors long lost causing, there's an evil doctor trying to create the perfect man which is an obvious nudge to Frankenstein right down to naming the main character ""Dr. Frankenfurter"" and then there's the aliens and zombies. As you can see this flick has many horror elements to it, so that might attract a few horror fans. But of course this is first and foremost a musical and a comedy, so be aware of that. If you cant take people braking into song every 10 minutes, then stay away.Then there's Tim Curry as Dr. Frankenfurter. After seeing him on this film I have to say that I respect they guy. I don't know if he is gay or not, but damn it takes balls to do a role like that. To know that people will remember you for all eternity as a ""sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania"" who walks around in high heels and make up...well it just takes gut to do that. And he did it very well. This character is so incredibly memorable, he is evil, he is selfish and lustful. He goes for pleasure and desire and the pursuit to fulfill them. He is kind of repulsive to look at...but at the same time you cant take your eyes off cause he is just so entertaining! I enjoyed every second he was on the screen. Memorable in deed.There's many more memorable characters on this film like Richard O Brian as Riff Raff, the bony hunch back of a butler and my favorite of all...Columbia and Magenta. I love those two gals! They are demented! My favorite of course is Nell Campbell as Columbia! Her squeaky voice and seeing her tap dancing is a special highlight for me, I think I kind of fell in love with that actress while watching this flick. There's also Meatloaf as Eddie. I got a kick out watching him playing the saxophone to ""hot patootie"". He was like a fat Frankensteins monster.And of course there's the beautiful Susan Sarandon. She actually looked hot back in the seventies! I would never have pictured her in a movie like this one, but heck, there she is dancing in her underwear and making out with Tim Curry.Anyhows all in all it was an entertaining ride. The movie just has this really strange aura about it, you feel like you are watching something thats coming from another dimension and time, crazy, demented...surreal. But like watching an Almodovar flick, if you are a homophobe then don't even get close to this one! Its a movie that makes obvious references to the gay way of life and sexual liberation (so seventies!) so if those themes don't sit well with you don't rent or buy this one. But if your open minded about these things you'll find yourself enjoying what is a great musical and a weird, intoxicating fun film, with memorable characters and songs.I'm certainly going to be doing the time warp again and again!Rating: 5 out of 5",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I normally wait to see all of a films installments if I can and that is one reason I took so long to watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Another reason is because I felt if I was going to watch this I was going to watch it the way it was meant to be watched and that is with a group of people who love. Since I live in a small town this was never going to happen, but recently they released this with it's follow up Shock Treatment and I just had to watch it. As I watched I found that most of the film is just Okay. The story moves about like any other movie. The garbage in this movie was the pool number, that should have been cut as it holds the film back from it's ending and makes the pacing awkward. The things that make this film a masterpiece are the songs Time Warp and Double Feature. I also like the Meatloaf segment and the gay themes that ran throughout the film as that was risky back then and I love that they tried to push the envelope. Tim Curry is the reason to see this if you do. He is great as always and I wish he would come back to this character although I know that that is quite impossible with the ending, but others can be brought back to life and so should he.

127,rcolgan,Still amongst the greatest cult classics,8,22 May 2014,"This is often considered to be one of the ultimate cult films. Whenever you go to any screening of the film you'll always find many people dressed in drag, singing the songs and of course dancing the time warp. Part of the reason for the films great success is that it's a parody of many of the things that are popular in culture. Everything from cheesy romances to gory horror is mashed together in this bizarre film of insanity that is The Rocky Horror Picture Show.It all begins when our heroine and hero get caught with a flat (how bout that?) so they go in to a nearby mansion to use their phone. Little do they know that there are strange people to occupy that occupy that house with a night filled with monsters, aliens and Transylvania Transvestites to follow. The plot is silly, wacky and makes little sense, making it just right for all the absurdity that happens over the course of the night. Even when the laws of physics are broken, we just shove it off because in this weird world it actually makes sense.But more importantly than that, this weird world allows for some of the best songs in musicals to come out of nowhere. Just like many of the classic musicals, there's never much reason for the music, with the simple act of someone entering a room being cause for a dance number. Certainty these songs are the most memorable moments in the film as well and the main reason that it has become such a cultural hit as each song has a unique style and catchy lyrics which mocks other musical styles in gorgeous fashion, ranging from an Elvis inspired Eddie to the stereotypical musical numbers in the time warp the songs are always original and entertaining.Through this music the film successfully allows viewers to fully embrace the film, with entire audiences getting up to do the dances and sing the lyrics. The most memorable of these tends to be the time warp and sweet transvestite with every lyric in each being both memorable and hilarious. Beyond that, the time warp even tells you exactly what dance you should be doing, meaning there are no excuses for those who say they don't know the dance. Whilst the entire soundtrack is also incredible, these are definitely the leading songs that will get people singing along in any screening.Also I think the film chooses what is probably the perfect cast for their characters. Firstly you have Meatloaf, who whilst only has a short time on screen makes his impact in that time with his fast paced style and legendary singing voice to ensure that we remember his short time on screen. Then there's Richard O'Brien (who is also the writer of the film) playing the handyman and is the lead voice in the now iconic time warp. It's a tough thing for anyone to do his song simply because it's tough for any other singer to match his voice with its ever changing style and impressive vocal range. Brad and Jaret are also perfect as the leads because of how typical they seem at the beginning of the film for a romantic couple. This makes their entry in to the world of insanity far more entertaining.And most importantly lets not forget the legendary Tim Curry. Any moment Frank-N-Furter is on screen, you're damn sure that he dominates the show with his brilliant over the top style perfectly personifying the nature of such an insane character. Certainly if there is any character who anyone can instantly recognise from the film it is Furter. Everything about him makes him stand out amongst an already insane cast, with his ridiculous costume (becoming regular dress for fans) and even more ridiculous voice carrying the perfect tone for such a memorable character.There's been some talk of doing a remake of this film in recent years, though personally I don't think that there should ever be another version. Sure, you can do different versions at the theatre, but this is the definitive version of the film simply because there is nothing that a new film version could add to it. This version carries with it all the charm and humour that no remake could ever recreate with this film standing alone as a unique film in the musical genre.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
128,anthonyf94,Scandalous life against boring normality,8,3 November 2019,"Nowadays a cult movie, ""The Rocky horror picture show"" didn't get popularity since the first moment. This because it is thought as a work that have to scandalise the audience - especially if the audience is bourgeois and dead in its appearent reassuring ""normal"" life - both on the plot level and the general movie's aim level. In fact, the main characters of the story are two guys that comes from ""normal"" life, with a good family and an ordinary existence: the fact that Brad has always to say his name and the name of his girlfriend, with surnames, its remarkable in this sense. After different adventures they are initiated to a different world in which extravagant sexuality and unpredictable events make life something more fluid and without all the obstacles that ""normal"" life impose to body and mind creativity. The ambientation in a remote castle works well in this direction: it is a narrative mechanism to isolate the main characters and constrict them to a kind of catabasis in a different, ""infernal"" universe. Full of references, parodies of b-movie, sci-fi, macho movies, road movies etc, with a wonderful soundtrack and an amazing Tim Curry, TRHPC is really a must, and not just for musical-lovers.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
129,PassPopcorn,PassPopcorn Review,9,2 May 2013,"Probably the most famous cult movie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (RHPS) holds the record for the longest theatrical run in movie history – it has been shown continually since its release in 1975, and even though initially it wasn't very popular, it gained a cult following after its midnight screenings. Tim Curry, who plays Dr. Frank-N-Furter, even got to meet Prince Charles and Princess Diana because she loved his role in the movie.Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) proposes to his girlfriend Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) at their friends' wedding. She happily accepts and they decide to go visit Dr. Everett V. Scott (Jonathan Adams), their college professor, to tell him the good news. During the travel, they get a flat tire and go look for help. They get to a castle where they are greeted by a butler who tells them his master is having a party, and they are forced to stay.Not only is the movie extremely funny with never a dull moment, but if you go see the play or a midnight screening, you're guaranteed to have an even greater time. In fact, it is tradition to bring props, like for example rice, that has to be thrown during the wedding scene. But as it may get noisy and confusing, I'd suggest to watch it at home first. Apart from this, RHPS is a mix of everything: sci-fi, horror, trash, comedy and, of course, musical. Therefore, it can't be enjoyed by everybody, as it can seem chaotic and pointless from time to time. But there's no need to take it too seriously, since it's also a parody – you can just sit back, relax and especially sing along since the songs are absolutely wonderful and help the story go on. The don't stop the action, they are the action, and fit the movie perfectly.The actors flawlessly play their roles, especially Tim Curry as Dr. Frank-n-Furter. I really can't explain how he, a man in drag, manages to be so sexy that it confuses straight people, but I love it. He also proves to be a great singer, and the movie received good reviews mostly thanks to his performance. But the rest of the cast is very good too, they are really into their characters. I said before that this is, among other things, a comedy. The fact is, it only makes you laugh the first time. After you've seen it more times, and thought about it, you notice it's really tragic. You can't be mad at Dr. Frank-n-Furter even though he's evil – he just seeks approval and love, but finds (and gives) only sex, which leaves him, Brad and Janet ultimately empty and unhappy. And there is no happy ending for such an uplifting musical that has more to offer than meets the eye. A must see.Rating: 9/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

A lot of performers come straight from the musical and you can tell they have a great time doing this show.The story might be the most confusing, pointless, manic story ever but it still works somehow.

132,glenn-aylett,An acquired taste,5,10 May 2014,"My ex dragged me along to a cinema showing of this three years ago, where the audience largely sit in fancy dress and an MC gave out prizes in the intermission for the best dressed characters. For those who haven't seen it, Rocky Horror is a story about a couple whose car break down outside a mansion and ask for help, only to be drawn into the weird world of Frank N Furter and his friends.Rocky Horror works OK as a musical for students to perform in fancy dress, but as a film I wasn't struck. Yes Timewarp is an excellent party song, Tim Curry as ever was on top form as the transvestite Frank N Furter, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick were good as the newlyweds Janet and Brad, and the scene where Eddie the servant( played quite well by a young Meatloaf) is eaten at a banquet is quite amusing. Also good is Charles Gray as the narrator, although seemingly committed fans of the film start chanting abuse whenever he appears.However, Rocky Horror to me was just one long, dull exercise in camp and shock horror that while quite daring 40 years ago, just looks dull and dated now. I suppose you have to be like my ex, a fan for decades, and an enthusiast, but this is one film I didn't get and has always divided opinion.

I saw the poster for Eraserhead in the theater window and thought that the haircut was real cool, so I bought a ticket and went in. Six hours later I emerged from the theater in a daze that was way more intense than any drugs I've ever taken. Rocky Horror is actually a very old fashioned musical. That's why its survived for so long. That is why millions of people know all the words to all of the songs. At the age of fourteen, i found the cross-dressing to be shocking and kind of scary. But in the context of the story it was so believable. This movie is very similar to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Facory in that the director create a 'complete' world. Everything is plausible and anything is possible. This film is not self-indulgent like Warhol's Frankenstein. This film welcomes the audience into its world and takes them on a journey like Alice down the Rabbit Hole or Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road. This film changed the way that I saw movies.

I'm here to talk about the movie.Part Sci-fi, part musical, part comedy, part B-movie sex flick.  It's so bad, it's good.  It's silly, but you can't help but be endeared by the thing.  Straight-laced couple Brad and Janet, through an unfortunate twist of fate, end up in a party house from the flip-side, and end up sex prisoners.  Hearing it without audience participation loses half the fun of the film, but even then, it still has its memorable one liners, and some undeniably catchy songs.  And how could one even comment on this movie without a mention of Tim Curry's outrageous performance as Dr. Frank N.

There's a bronze statue of Richard O'Brien as Riff Raff in Hamilton; he lived up that way between 1951 and 1964, and we claim him and Rocky Horror as national icons. Anyway, watched this one (again) on TV the other night and realised that it really is best viewed with other people, even if they aren't actually there in the room with you. It's knowingly cheesy, definitively camp and so utterly daft that you'd have to be a completely tone-deaf homophobe to dislike it. If the spot-on characterisations don't get you (the cast is mostly drawn the well-oiled British stage version, which had been running for almost two years), then the plethora of addictively catchy three-chord singalongs will. If you're of a certain age, these songs are probably tattooed on your DNA. The acting is perfectly-nuanced all round, but a sublimely innocent/sexy Susan Sarandon (who'd have thought?) and an entertainingly louche Tim Curry are excellent. As a cinematic exercise it's neither technically brilliant nor totally sound script-wise (the narrative gets a mite confusing toward the end with the puzzling 'floor show' sequence), but 'TRHPS' is way more than the sum of its parts.

Especially lightly with the musical numbers they take away the fact of thinking about that knot that this film is about.Maybe if it is seen today many will say and why it is so iconic, but at that time, it made a very big difference in queer culture. Frank is a character that invites us to accept and liberate himself, accepting as you are, this shows us that the freedom of decision and how by accepting it you can really bring out your true self.Actually this musical is a very good satire on several films from the 30s to the 60s, in itself it is not to put a lot of logic to the film, rather it is to enjoy it because it is illogical and chaotic.THE WHOLE PINT OF THIS PICTURE IS TO HAVE FUN WATCHING IT, DONT PUT LOT OF MIND IN THE PLOT.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I eventually checked it out and found the songs and story were not that horrifying after the initial shock of seeing five people cross-dressing on screen had worn off.

144,johnny-burgundy,it remains a cultural phenomenon,8,22 January 2018,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)
This is a musical science fiction comedy horror film. The screenplay was based on the 1973 musical stage production. It is a satirical tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through the early 1970s. The film stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick. The tale centers on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. Although largely critically panned on initial release, it remains a cultural phenomenon in both the U.S. and U.K.
The movie maintains a limited release four decades after its premiere. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is the longest-running theatrical release in motion picture history. In 2005, It was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress. FOX would air a modern-day reimagining of the film, that premiered on Fox in October 2016. Although this was a decent homage, nothing can compare to the original. Even if you've never experienced it, it's almost impossible not to recognize the music, when you hear it.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

The Rocky Horror Picture Show has become the most popular cult hit ever. People would go see the movie and say things to the action on the screen. Is the movie entertaining on its own? It certainly is worth watching on its own. I have never seen this movie with audience of fans that know every line in the movie. I think the film is very entertaining and twisted. Great performances from the cast especially Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N Furter. The songs are excellent and funny especially the songs Time Warp, Sweet Transvestite and Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me. Said to be the King of bad movies it has out lived any critic smashing. I have seen this movie many times and it's still quite entertaining. I have the special edition version, which features two never seen before songs ""Once In A While"" and ""Superheroes"". 10/10 An excellent musical tribute to bad movies.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
146,padiyark,"Campy and fun in the beginning, and then just blows from there",4,21 January 2002,"I saw this film about the second year in college, BUT not in the movie theatre, but on video.  I had heard so much about it that I decided to finally watch it.  Can't say I was impressed at that time.Well, I'm a little older now, and I did have a second viewing of the film. This time, I was more impressed with the first 1/4 of the film, but then I felt that the rest of the movie just bombed.  Oh, I wasn't expecting Oscar-Caliber performances, but I was wanting to see entertainment.  And let's face it, the first 1/4th of the movie is just that.  With ""Time Warp"", ""The Sweet Transvestite Transexual from Transylvania"", Rocky's Song, and Meatloaf's song, it was great.  But then everything just starts to blur from there. I actually was hoping for more of the ensemble campiness.  By the end, it just swirls into an incoherent plot that leaves you tired and wasted.Now, I'm not saying don't go and see it in the movie theatre.  That's another experience in itself, and I think every person should have at least one go at it.  But strictly from a movie going person's perspective, it sucks.  A much better musical about a transexual rocker is ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"", which makes far more sense and is indeed more fun.  Heck, they could make that into a theatre experience in itself!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

LOLThis film is simply like a good ol' red wine (i've been told) unlike the actors, this film simply gets better with age and i don't think that there could be anyone who plays Dr Frank-n-furter than Tim Curry! He looks just FAB! in that movie and also Susan Sarandon also looks great! The scenes in this movie aren't very well made in my opinon but the characters and the story line more than make up for any problems with the settings!
One of my most favourite characters in this movie was Patricia Quinn, she looked FAB! (again) in this movie! I personally think that the acting on all parts was great, actually beyond great because it was soo real, in most musicals the acting is never really the song point in my opinion, but this was no ordinary musical! Ok, some of the things i don't really agree with, like putting Barry Bostwick in nylon tights, but i did like the music!All in all, i liked this movie alot, altho i'm not such a big fan in seeing a grown man in tights, this movie was something of a revalation for me!

Although I'm in my 40s, I saw THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW for the first time last year, at the Queen Mary Theater in Long Beach, California. Performed with a local ensemble cast and all the usual lunatic fringe that this cult classic is famous for attracting.I was also delighted and surprised at Susan Sarandon's charming vocal talents. She also did a first-class acting job at bringing Janet to life.The faithful handyman is also unforgettable and another fine example of perfect casting and directing and acting.But above all, it's Tim Curry who completely steals the show. When any other scene was on the screen, I found myself willing to look away, to watch the local actors playing along on the stage below the big screen, to look at the crazies in the audience doing their bit. When Frank (Tim Curry) was on the screen, I could not take my eyes off him. His every little move, gesture, facial expression, inflection - he's a joy to watch! I've enjoyed him in other movies and TV shows as well.This movie is a phenomenon and wildly entertaining - a sexual horror - a spectacle! It should never be remade. The campiness of this version is a perfect fit. Trying to improve it with better technology will only be taking it too seriously and will spoil the charm.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Whoever said Rocky Horror Picture Show was bad, didn't like the music, or missed the point is really uptight.  The whole point of going to those late night showings is so you're wild side can let go a little. I ask these people are you a Rocky Horror virgin*?  Cause if you are, how can you judge? All I can say is when you jump up and do the time warp, something comes over you, your other half takes over and you feel amazing. The music is the greatest, very original, and it helps you escape into that freer world. It has got to be one of the musicals with the most original casting, and adding the writer as one of the actors was pure genious!  Have you noticed that if you listen closely everyone has a different accent?  For instance, Columbia has an Austrailian accent, Frank's got a pure Brit's accent, and Magenta's got a Romainian one.

The film experience, even with live action cast playing along, does not equal the brilliance of seeing it totally live (Jason Donovan as Frank 'N' Furter has to be one of the most surreal and heart warming sights in the world) BUT it is the next best thing and livens up a dull Saturday night no end. It is a totally different viewing experience from the usual - talking back at the screen is positively encouraged, and dancing in the aisles too. It does lose it a bit at the end BUT 1) Susan Sarandon - marvellous Janet (slut!) 2) Richard O'Brien - sets up that campy persona that also worked brilliantly on the long lamented Crystal Maze (Channel 4 TV show from the 80s) 3) Tim Curry!

Sexuality as a whole is so ridiculously overplayed it loses it's edge after the 3rd musical number featuring what must be the take on cross-dressing/homo- and bisexuality of a horny and confused teenager.Again, it may have been relevant in the mid-70s, but for today's standards it just looks, sounds and feels lame and painfully outdated, something you'd expect to see in Austin Powers as a throwaway gag.Maybe even the fans don't take it seriously, and the whole ""cosplay"" thing is the parody of a parody, but it's hard to tell where the line between ironic fandom and bona-fide support lies.Either way, to me RHPS is still a terrible movie and a mediocre musical with an incredibly outdated feel to it.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
161,mrtimlarabee,Let there be lips!,9,14 April 2008,"Rocky Horror Picture Show is a strange sort of film. This is not because one of the main characters is a transvestite from outer space or because it has inspired a following that congregates on Fridays or Saturdays at midnight or even because the highly regarded Susan Sarandon got her start here. It's strange because in all it's oddness, it's actually good. It's also achieved a certain fan base that has worked Rocky Horror into modern culture. Dare I say, it's a classic.A classic does not necessarily mean it was better than the rest of the films that came out that year. It's a classic because it is something that was so different and memorable that it sticks with you over time. It's not just because of the audience participation midnight shows either. Rocky Horror Picture is campy fun with a good soundtrack to boot.The film (and the play it's based on) is both a send up and tribute to horror films. At the same time, it seems inspired by the sexual exploration of the day. While it dwells on sexuality on a larger than life scale, the film's openness of this exploration is a sign of the time it was made. The characters of Brad and Janet seem like they are ripped out of the opening scene of Night of the Living Dead. Brad has those glasses and never does seem to get the right words out, looking bound to stumble into trouble. Janet, meanwhile, is the lovey dovey blonde. Their weaknesses allow them to stumble into temptation quite easily.But the star, of course, is Tim Curry, who shamelessly prances around the screen as Dr. Frank N. Furter, singing such classics as ""Sweet Transvestite"" and ""Rose Tint My World"" with impeccable quality. He's never had a sweeter role that utilized his musical talent. The rest of the cast is rounded out by a lovely ensemble, including Meat Loaf's memorable cameo as Eddie belting out the rockabilly inspired ""Hot Patootie."" The music, by Richard O' Brien, is brilliant. Although funny, this was a musical that broke conventions by fusing it's naughty dialogue with a non traditional mostly rock n' roll soundtrack. It's not without sentiment either. ""Dammit Janet"" is funny and a cute profession of love, while ""There is A Light"" merges ironic hope to a tearful lament. Then there's the dance number. You know - ""The Time Warp."" It's a classic that even people who don't know Rocky Horror know this one.Then would you believe the film has a moral? In all it's sick brilliance, it still manages to churn out a theme about lost innocence and temptation. Watch the movie again - laugh as you always do. Yell at the screen. But remember, there is a work of art here. Oft referenced, parodied, and played every Friday and Saturday night somewhere, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has become part of our culture.

While seeing this movie in a theatre with a participating audience is a lot of fun, I disagree that this is the only way to really enjoy it: in fact you'd be well advised to watch it at home first, because otherwise you'll find it hard to follow the story with a noisy audience throwing rice and toast at the screen. Even without such distractions, the plot can be a bit hard to follow at times, what with the (wonderful) distractions of songs such as ""The Time Warp"" and ""Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?"" but in a nutshell it involves a sweet but uptight young couple who learn to loosen up one rainy night when they end up at the castle of a Transylvanian, transvestite scientist and his kinky entourage of servants, old and new lovers and hangers-on. To say as others have suggested that the film is a celebration of bisexuality seems accurate enough, but it also makes the film seem more earnest than it isbesides, half of the happily bisexual cast ends up dead! If I had to chose stand-out moments, besides the aforementioned songs I'd pick Frankenfurter's near simultaneous seductions of Brad and Janet, Dr. Scott's first enraptured gaze at his fishnet stocking-clad leg, and Richard O'Brien's sly, sexy turn as the butler Riff Raff (perhaps because everyone else is so over the top, the scenes in which he subtly flirts with his lover--and sister--Magenta are among the most genuinely erotic in the film).A must-see for anyone who likes offbeat films.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
170,solidgameboy12-1,Normally different.,9,1 September 2005,"The term ""Never judge a book by it's cover"" could easily be used for this film. To some, it just a bunch of homosexual content just because of Tim Curry being a sweet Tranvestite, but to viewers who give it a chance, they may find a film that's normally different.The film starts off at a wedding, goes into the first song almost immediately after the theme song, and then it goes into what could clearly be the most predictable idea in the movie. From the beginning sequence to that time, you may almost want to shut the movie off, but it gets better. After Brad and Janet head to the big manor, and engaging into yet another song, they finally get into the old mansion and soon experience a group of people who are weirder than the extras of a Marilyn Manson music video, then they meet the head master, Dr. Frank N. Furter (Played by the brilliant Tim Curry) and find out about his new invention, but that's just the beginning, to anyone reading this, I'll leave the rest to your mind, or rent the movie and see for yourself.I saw this movie on a movie channel not to long ago, of course, I had never seen it before, I had heard of it from a friend of mine, but never seen it before, when I saw it, I wondered why I hadn't seen it sooner.The film does come off as weird, very musical, a bit disturbing, colorful, and with lyrics that are as great as they are funny, it's a laugh fest for the rest of the film. Some may look at Tim Curry as being extremely weird, and like I said, almost the whole movie comes off that way, but when it gets to the second to last song ""I'm going home"" preformed by Tim Curry yet again, it almost feels like the whole film is human, even though it's rather sci-fi, with the slow sad or love songs in the film, you feel a little bit of sorrow towards these characters who are trapped in this place and are in a predicament unlike any other.with songs like: ""Sweet Transvestite"", ""Dammit Janet"", ""Hot Patootie"", ""wise up Janet Weiss"" and many more, there's nothing to dislike, better than all the musicals I've ever seen.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

So, I decided, with nothing better to do, I'd put the DVD back in for one last spin before it went back to Netflix. I watched it again, and absolutely loved it!

So, with no car, they decide to go back and see if they can find a phone at the castle they passed earlier. Once they enter the castle, you enter a wild ride as you encounter transvestites, handmade humans, and even aliens. The movies a blast, and the music is some of the best I've ever heard in a movie.

One stormy night in Denton, Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and his fiancée, Janet Weiss (Susan Surandon), are in their car off to visit their good friend, Dr Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams). However, they get ""caught with a flat"" and have a spare tire badly in need of air, so therefore stop off at the castle they passed a while back for use of a telephone. What they don't know is that within the castle resides Dr Frank-n-Furter (Tim Currey), a Transvestite, his domestics that practice incest (Richard O'Brian and Patricia Quinn), and his groupie (Little Nell) who's in love with a motorcycle bad boy (Meat Loaf). Brad and Janet are soon invited up to Frank's laboratory, where they witness the creation of his newest sexual playmate, muscle-man Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). Despite their protests, the couple are invited to stay the night, and so begins the craziest sleepover the world has ever seen. Based on a premise that is reminiscent of B movies, ""Rocky Horror"" is absolutely brilliant. It is full of laughs, sex, and some really magnificent musical numbers. There is, I think, nothing more enticing and amazing than Tim Currey's brilliant portrayal of Dr Frank-n-Furter, who he makes incredibly sexy and yet repulsive at the same time. And, again, surprisingly enough, ALL OF THESE ACTORS CAN SING WONDERFULLY! I can see why people don't like it, I can Definitely see why people do. What I can't see is why anybody wouldn't find at least one thing in there to love; there's romance, there's raunch, there's comedy, there's drama (although it's highly satirical), and there's music.

The thing that strikes me the most about this movie is the parody involved.  It's a wonderful parody of the monster and rock 'n' roll movies from the 50's and 60's, thrown together with the burgeoning sexual revolution that was growing in the movies during the early 70's.  It also makes a statement about how things aren't always as black and white as many people would like to believe.  Richard O'Brien's music and script are inspired lunacy, and the cast give memorable performances, especially Tim Curry.  His facial expressions are simply amazing and help add dimension (dementia?) to everybody's favorite transvestite.  One of my favorite overall scenes from a movie appears in RHPS:  during the close of ""I'm Going Home"", when Frank steps between the kleig light and the camera, so that he's in silhouette, singing the final line.

The first one came in.1962.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
176,Klaatu-18,The perfect parody,9,23 September 2000,"The first time that I saw RHPS was at the World Science Fiction Convention, in 1976. It had been out just a year, but I had never heard of it. But when I checked it out, there was someone next to me singing along.The program book mentioned the references and parodies of horror and SF films.  It also mentioned the ""toe-tapping"" soundtrack. But it didn't mention that it would steal my soul.I am a long-time film nut, and I loved the fact that I could watch this film ten or fifteen times and still find another cinematic reference. Like when I was reading Stephen King's ""Danse Macabre"" and found that Eddie's LOVE/HATE tattoos on his fingers are a reference to ""The Night of the Hunter"".By the time that the Village theatre showed the first of their midnight showings, I had seen the film a couple of more times in a regular theatre and acquired a soundtrack from the Roxy stage show.Over the years, I've attended dozens of midnight showings of the film as well as seeing the play in London and down here in Dallas (They tried to bring my handicapped friend up on stage, unaware that he really uses that wheelchair)During my trip to England I also got to meet Richard O'brien, who was talking up the sequel to RHPS.  As with most sequels, it was interesting, not great.This movie succeeds: as a parody, as science fiction, and as a musical. Nine Stars.  Uncle Steve says check it out.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
177,lostcinematheq,This is the epitome of cult cinema,8,14 March 2021,"It's so dedicated to its own unique aesthetic and pulls it off in an amazing way. The entire cast was immersed in their characters and you really felt like you were there. As with any musical, it relies heavily on the strength of its songs, and this soundtrack has great songs in spades, from the opener (Science Fiction/Double Feature) to The Time Warp and the closer (I'm Going Home). There were plenty of great comedic moments throughout, mainly shock humor for me, since I had no idea what I was getting myself into with this movie. The rock and roll style could sometimes get repetitive, and the effects could feel cheap at times, but overall this film's charms far outweigh its flaws. All in all, this was a very memorable experience.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I have the sound track and listen to it constantly.  Another great thing about it is Tim Curry.  He is so fun to watch as Dr. Frank-n-furter.  Nobody has ever done drag better and I can't imagine anyone ever will.  And to see Susan Sarandon, when she was a young uknown, singing.  It is all great fun.

179,ChrisKleinFangirl,Moulin Rouge on crack.,4,6 September 2016,"After years of witnessing people obsess over this Horror/Comedy//Sci-fi Musical spectacle. I thought it was about time I watched it to see what all the fuss was about. I was promised to watch a mesmerising 'wonderfully weird' film, filled with catchy numbers and lovable characters. All I can see is this is the epiphany of 'acquired taste'.It's certainly one of a kind, and I'm sure in 1975 their were very few films like this. You never really know what will happen next which draws you into watching it. That doesn't however, make it enjoyable.Their is no specific story line here, just a lot of small story lines that (attempt to) weave themselves into each other.A newly married couple visit a strange manor, where a transvestite alien scientist (yep!) lives with a hunchback vampire and a huge array of eccentric characters. What happens next is...well...1hr 20mins of mayhem featuring Aliens, vampires, Cabaret stars, Bad 70's dancing, Gay sex, straight sex, sex with artificial humans, motorcycles, murder and general debauchery.It isn't all bad, the acting, particularly Tim Curry is incredible, the songs are catchy and no matter how much you hate it you do keep watching, I've seen worse. But I really don't see how this movie has such a huge cult following. Maybe their is a deep hidden message between all those innuendos, maybe it's a deep film about politics, gender dysphoria and mental health (like some people believe) or maybe it's just evidence that the 70's should never have happened make up your own minds...",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
180,Momcat_of_Lomita,How do you review a movie that's become a cultural icon?,7,30 May 2011,"Is there a soul alive nowadays who doesn't know about this movie? Given that, it's difficult to do a straightforward review. Almost everybody knows, or thinks they know, what it's all about.If you don't know what it's all about, here are some hints: Transvestites. Cannibalism. House of horrors. Pure unadulterated 200-proof camp. Singing and dancing. Zombies. Over the top.It stars Tim Curry. And let me right here disabuse people of a common misconception: Curry is NOT Rocky Horror. He is Dr. Frank N. Furter. (Peter Hinwood has the title role, and a surprisingly small role it is.) It also has Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Meat Loaf, Nell Campbell, and Richard O' Brien. And a bunch of other people.If you go get a DVD of this movie and spool it up on your TV and just sit down to watch it cold, you'll find that the first part is campy fun, but that in the end it dissolves into a mess that goes on forever too long. As a straight entertainment movie, it would rate maybe 3 stars out of ten.But it isn't a straight entertainment movie, and that's the point, and you shouldn't sit down to watch it cold.I was lucky: I saw this movie in the best of all possible circumstances, in fall of 1976, at a midnight showing at the Nuart Theater in Venice, California. Ladies and gents, viewing ""Rocky Horror"" doesn't get any better than that. I was as innocent and clueless as Janet is at the beginning of the movie. My then-boyfriend, now husband, took me there on our third date ever. Good thing it was our third date, I was ready to give him benefit of the doubt; had this been our first date, there wouldn't have been a second.""You HAVE to see this,"" my boyfriend told me. ""So what's it about?"" I asked. He wouldn't tell me. That should have been my first clue.So we went, and I noted that a lot of the people queuing up at the Nuart were dressed...oddly. Oddly even for Venice, California, in 1976, near midnight. That should have been my second clue.And then the movie started, and that's when the show REALLY started.People throwing rice during the wedding scene. People spraying the rest of the audience with water-pistols during the storm scene. People who got up on stage, and danced along with the actors in the movie, during the dance scenes. And that's just the stuff I can mention in a review that might be read by kids.It wasn't a movie, it was an EVENT. No mistake about it. I emerged stunned and drop-jawed, at this glimpse of a culture and a gestalt that I'd never known existed before. ""Did you like it?"" my boyfriend asked anxiously as we walked out, past people in drag and wedding attire who were acting out their own bits of the movie.And he wasn't talking about just a movie, he was talking about an event, a scene, a shared experience. And I really think that's how you have to deal with ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"": you can't take it out of cultural context as a movie you sit down to watch cold. If you want to really understand it, you have to try to experience it as an event in a theater (or a party at home) with people who aren't just watching it, but who are BEING it, to paraphrase the chorus from one of the songs.I'm 35 years on down the road from my initial viewing of this movie at the Nuart, but it's an experience that has stood out more strongly for me as time has gone by. There aren't more than a handful of movies that have done that for me, but it wasn't this movie just by itself. It was the totality of the experience: the movie, the time, the theater, the person I was with, and most of all the crowd. All coming together to make something greater than the sum of the parts.I was very, very lucky to experience ""Rocky Horror"" in that way.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
181,Nahret,Aahhh...,10,16 April 2002,"There are a chosen few movies that defy description and split people into two uncompromising factions: those who absolutely love them and those who hate them with equal passion. This is one of these pictures, and, consequently, I have no other choice than to give it ten out of ten. The profound impression it made on me was largely due, of course, to my first love (at the age of five): Frank-N-Furter. Ah... Tim Curry. As Richard O'Brien says, Tim IS Frank. And the show's main attraction. I still get goose-bumps every time I hear him sing ""Sweet Transvestite"". When he's on screen, the air crackles with energy - and sexuality. It may seem tame now, but back in 1975, this movie was shockingly explicit (and got the mandatory R rating in the States). In more than this aspect, it is one of the most daring productions ever made for the big screen, and maybe that's why it flopped the first time it was released.

I only just watched this and I have to say it was crazy and out of control but it was very funny. This movie doesn't really have a plot to it, just about an engaged couple that have a breakdown and must visit the residence of Dr. Frank-N-Furter. After that, they just sing songs and do a whole lot of crazy stuff. It is really good fun to watch. And when you do watch it, you will find yourself doing the time warp and singing the Hot Patootie. The ""Sweet Transvestites"" song was disturbing.I really hope this comes back into the theaters because it will be even better at the theaters. This has taken place as one of my favourite comedies.

183,a-moss,"Everything Is In Readyness, we merely await your selection",9,4 April 2005,"Scrolling through the ""hated it""-comments of this movie was actually quite funny. As fun as the movie itself I'd dare to say. To find it too silly or too crazy I can understand, but to hate it? You have to see things in life quite uptight. But yes, this movie pretty far out there. Actually its plain crazy. If you want to find out if you would like this movie, here's a test for you: What would you think about the idea of a movie about a rock'n'roll zombie cabdriver singing opera while killing vampire prostitutes from Venus with an X-ray gun with a rainbow colored beam? Rocky Picture Horror Show is kind of a movie in THAT theme, though a different tale of course. If you think that sounds like barrels of barrels with fun, go for the movie. Or if you would like to see how a movie like that would be, because you can't picture it in your head. (That was kind of what I did) If you on the other hands find that too crazy or too far out for your taste, think twice before seeing it. It might not be for you. Still this movie has been shown to be a huge success, being one the longest played movie in theaters, and along with Eraserhead actually invented the term ""cult-movie"". The strength of this movie is not only the crazy and nihil plot, but also that it is so well done on every other level too. Every character is memorable and the spaced-out songs very catchy. On the technical level it is actually striking, which is a rare find when it comes to these kinds of movies. So that is has been successful is actually no wonder. What makes you hate this movie is beyond me, but feel free to explain.This is a movie for you if you like some far our, non-serious, incoherent crazy fun from outer space.

I had no idea that ""Time Warp"" came from this movie.I understand that at the time, this was a huge achievement for homosexuals and trans-genders, but now in 2014, this movie holds no relevance, nor does it entice the viewer. So dear readers, feel free and watch this film, you yourself may enjoy it.

If I rated it solely on that, no doubt....solid 10BUT....When it comes right down to it, this is really a horrible (and horribly made) movie. The script is bad, the music is bad, the story is bad, the special effects are BAD, All the ""artistic"" aspects of a movie are, for the most part, bad and even the moments that are good are done in such a cheap, amateurish way that it is difficult to compliment them. And no, I'm not going to concede that it is all intentional.The acting is really bad (perhaps this part actually is intentional) with the only performance of any note being Tim Curry and that is only because he completely invests himself in it.I also realize that we're talking 45 years ago, when it was still quite common for studios to produce crap - see Bog (1979) - but I have to ask how this ever got green-lit as a theatrical production. No, I never have seen a stage production, but I can't help but wonder why anyone would have thought it would make a good adaptation to film.Nevertheless, that this is a culturally significant movie cannot be ignored. After 45 years of nightly midnight showings across the globe and countless home video viewings as well, its impact is incalculable. Not bad for a lousy film.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I've never seen a movie like this one before, that's why I love it so much. It stands out from the other movies and just doesn't care about manors. This movie have actors that knows how to make fun of themselves for not getting scared of embarrass themselves. Tim Curry is best on that. The plot is original. They make fun of science fiction movies back from 30s up to 50s and becomes their own plot out of that. The music is hilarious. You hear the songs once and somehow you just remember them. Especially Time Warp. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 14 but I hated it 'cause I just didn't get it. But I saw it again about two years ago and I just fell in love with it.

The film holds a very special meaning, which in 1975 wouldn't have been accepted, you could say it's revolution. It was something that people could watch and feel accepted and then express themselves. I've got to say though, the story was really crazy, like if I was to explain it you'd think I was joking.You could tell it was very cheap, but I was surprised to see some really interesting shots that were very experimental, in fact there was a lot of technical aspects that were very experimental. I thought it was really cool how the narrator was telling the story directly to us, breaking the fourth wall. The music was really fun, and I'm glad I finally got to see the ""Time Warp"" song. I didn't even know it was in this film, so I had a lot of surprises in this viewing.Definitely go into this knowing nothing like how I did thinking it was a horror.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Before they make it, however, their car breaks down and they try to find help. They find a mysterious castle and enter, to meet Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite who has created a beautiful man (Peter Hinwood) out of lifeless body parts, his servants (Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn) who have a dark secret to hide, and his quirky guests (Little Nell and Meatloaf).my thoughts: This is my favorite musical of all time, for many reasons.The performances are perfect. No one can beat Tim Curry as the transvestite version of Dr. Frankenstein, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick are great as the suburban virginal couple, while Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, Peter Hinwood, and Meatloaf perfectly portray quirky characters and Jonathan Adams and Charles Gray lend their professional presences as older but equally great characters.I also love the music. The classic 'Science Fiction Double Feature', the fun 'Time Warp' and the entire 'Floor Show' sequence happen to be my favorite songs, while the rest are great as well. They all provide to the campy nature of the film.The plot is also a great tribute to horror and science fiction movies, which mixing musical and transsexual elements into the mix.

This musical has amazing, talented actors that can keep a straight face. This movie deals with being different in society, from sexuality to the way people look. The directing was good, and the scenery and lighting gave the story that takes place in this big house believable for the movie. This also helped keep the audience interested. It made people think of things like ""What's going to happen to Brad and Janet?"" ""Will they ever get out of this house?"" ""How is this movie going to end?"" Although the story was very different then from what I'm used to watching, it was still great nonetheless.The story was hard to follow towards the end.

197,polos_are_minty,Rocky Horror,5,28 March 2010,"To me, the most telling part of the films title is the word 'Horror'. I found sitting through an hour and forty minutes of it close to unbearable. It's not that there aren't some funny scenes, there are. It's just mainly I find the whole thing to be too excessive, too over the top and extremely over acted.It's trying to raise issues about Gender equality and Transexualism, it does raise these issues, but I felt a lot of the time it was doing so in a stereotypical and obvious way. People have claimed this is done in a satirical way, but I really can't see this. I think the film is obvious, over acted, and poorly directed. I would say that if anything it is not a weapon against prejudice it in fact encourages it. Everyone has a stereotype of what Transexuals and Transvesties are, and this does nothing to challenge it, it simply confirms peoples stereotyping. If you have actually met someone who is transgender, you will realise that they act nothing like the ridiculous Curry, in fact they usually tend to be down to earth normal people.Nothing but an over the top, silly and over acted piece of cinematic junk. It is to caught up in blowing it's own over sized trumpet, and doesn't stop for a moment to consider what stereotypes it is pushing into the mindset of the people who watch it. 3/10",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

They drive along the road and low and behold, the car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.  There is one lonely house nearby and they decide to go to the house, seeking a telephone.  They are greeted by Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) who invites them into the house and proceeds to tell them about a gathering, being hosted by the master.  They also meet a wild maid called Magenta (Patricia Queen).  Together, Magenta and Riff Raff sing them a song that will probably be loved by every generation. Yes it is of course, the Time Warp.After a while, a little excitement fills the air, someone is coming.  The elevator is coming down to the ground floor.  In it we can see a tall, long legged person, tapping their feet to the rhythm of the music.  It reaches the bottom, the doors open and out steps Dr. Frank N Furter (Tim Curry). Wonderfully dressed, he (or she) greets everybody with yet another song (Sweet Transvestite).  It is clear that Janet and Brad are not comfortable however, at the end of the show they have their clothes removed and are invited to the lab to see whatever is going on.Once in the lab, they see that Frank N Furter has created a life form, in the shape of a very well toned, muscular man named Rocky (Peter Hinwood). The rest of the film/show is just a series of crazy events, all orchestrated by the mad doctor and his gang of nutters, including an appearance and a song from the legendary Meatloaf.  Another one of the very few stage shows which has been taken off the stage and transformed into a Hollywood blockbuster movie.  This film has seen many ups and downs.  It flopped many times before finally becoming one of the biggest cult movies of all time.  The best thing about this movie is that it has kept most of the original cast members from when it was first put on stage in London.  Tim Curry began his career playing Frank N Furter on a tiny stage in London, a few nights a week and he has gone on to be one of Hollywood's most successful actors.The music is fantastic, the dance routines are mad, the characters are brilliant and the storyline is warped; the perfect ingredients for cult madness.

199,RockytheBear,And this movie is a classic becauseeee......?,6,6 July 2003,"ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.No plot, boring characters, and crappy music make up the world's largest cult movie.  Why the planet chose this as the movie to follow lets me know mankind is in trouble.  Serious, cross dressing trouble.  This movie wanders around aimlessly for 2 hours, with no pacing and no direction.  An hour into it, I didn't even know what I was watching anymore.  Sex, drugs, and violence I can understand.  But when did homo eroticism, incest, and adultery with aliens become entertainment?The movie opens with some big ass lips singing a song during the opening credit sequence.  Once that part ends, it's all downhill from there.  We then see Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon playing Brad and Janet, two 30 year-old college kids.  Brad proposes to Janet with the world's stupidest song and then they are off to God knows where and God knows why.  During a dark and stormy night, (never trust a movie that takes place on a dark and stormy night) they get a flat tire and go into a haunted mansion filled with a bunch of gay Chorus Line rejects.  Here's where the movie truly becomes idiotic, and Dr. Frank-N-furter is introduced as the owner of the mansion. Frank-N-furter is played by a very young Tim Curry, before he discovered the powers of the pastry section.After Frank-N-furter sings his ""I'm here and queer!!!"" song, he shows us the man he has created, in homage to Frankenstein.  This is where the movie slows down to a screeching halt, and nothing happens for the duration of its running time.  I repeat-- NOTHING.  What you get is a 2 hour crap fest filled with wall to wall sh*t bombs and a bunch of men running around in fishnet stockings and high heeled pumps.  Who does this appeal to?  The queer!  Ohhhh!  No wonder I didn't like it.  No man is straighter than me, so I guess this flick just aint my bag, baby.  How dare this movie even have my name in the title.People actually line up every night to see this garbage.  Lines that go around the corner.  For a 30 year old movie that they know every line to! There are people who have seen this flick hundreds of times!  Like it's D.C. Cab or something.  Don't believe me?  See for yourself.  Every big city has a Weirdoville and I ask you, reader, to go visit yours at about 11:30 p.m. on any given night.  You'll see a long line of people dressed like gay mimes, ready to do the same ritual they've been doing for the past 30 years. 30 years!  Talk about not having a life!  They say the ""fun"" of the movie is throwing toast at the screen.  Well, I don't know about you people, but I eat my toast.  And making food just to throw it at a screen is a sin worse than gluttony and for that, you toast tossers should all understandably burn in hell.And if I go to the movie theater and someone squirts water on me, be prepared for a fight.

200,Fielga,The original cult classic,9,25 May 2012,"For those who ""don't understand why people like this movie,"" remember its earliest days and remember that this is more than just something to sit back and watch, it's become an interactive experience, it's a common ground where the outcasts of society can meet and feel as if they belong.That being said, this is low budget cheese at its finest! I love looking back and seeing all these huge stars back when they were young at the beginning of their careers. The music is fun and often just outright ridiculous (in a good way, of course), the plot is hilariously so bad it's good, this is the ideal movie to pop in when you have friends over.I wasn't born yet when this movie was made, but I understand it's significance in social cinematic history and I've grown to love it as one of the best classics out there. You need to approach it with a fun attitude and no specific expectations, but once you give it a try, most people I know have been hooked for life. Happy viewing!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
201,naillon-2,Incredible!,10,13 February 2008,"The first time I saw this movie, it was on tape. No, I didn't go to any midnight screenings. And you know what? I loved it anyway! I'm a huge film buff, and even I missed quite a few of the classic film references that are used so liberally throughout the movie. You really have to watch, and listen, to get them. O'Brien's songs are exactly the sort of high-energy, get-down music that is needed to pull off this wildly imaginative spoof of horror/sci-fi/crime film.It's a hoot to see future Oscar winner Susan Sarandon as an uptight, recently engaged, virginal Janet (with pink dress, of course), having a night with her fiancé, the equally uptight Brad, that neither of them could ever have imagined.Every now and then, a poll is taken to list the best film performances of all time. This one has never made the list, but for my money, one of the top ten performances in the history of film belongs to the ""Sweet Transvestite"" himself, Tim Curry. He inhabits the role with such verve and engaging weirdness that you WANT him to win out, even though you know that (among other things) he's a murderer and a cannibal. You even try to tell yourself that hey, what he did wasn't THAT bad.In every scene, the eye is drawn inexorably to Curry (no mean feat, with Sarandon as costar). Everything he does, whether drooling over his latest creation, using an electric knife to slice a ""turkey"", or merely raising an eyebrow, is magnetic; it's impossible to look away. He's funny, he's frightening, he's amazingly sexy, and his performance is sheer genius. He makes full use not only of his body, but of his powerful, full-throated voice, a voice of black velvet and thick cream. This is a performance that deserves its own special place in film.

As a virgin I was amazed to see my boss' boss in tights and his wife (who was also a work colleague) displaying her over large breasts at the stage door. Later another colleague appeared in full Frank costume, beard gone for this special event. The sight of him in suspenders is not easily forgotten. And god, I've tried to forget. Although some are offended by Trans-whatever story line, there is more to it than just the that. Allow yourself a couple of hours lunacy. Just don't forget your sense of the ridiculous. The film is as good a version of the stage play as is possible in my opinion. The cast know how to play it and do so to the hilt (as it were). I hope nobody ever tries a remake, IT WILL NOT WORK, and there is no point.It's very much a social thing this, so if the local theatre isn't showing it. Invite all your friends over, costume only of cause.

Inside the theater we experienced more fun with the sale of  ""Virgins"".  The sale refers to new viewers to Rocky Horror Picture Show.   When the movie started there were people in the front next to the screen acting alongside.  People in the audience were yelling back in unison to the actors dialogue on the screen.   Water, toast, rice and various other inanimate items were used to enhance the experience of the movie.  The people with me were laughing as hard as I was through all the stuff going on.   I loved it.  I had seen it a few more times at various midnight shows throughout the years.  Most of the time it was wonderful. But when I saw it at home a year ago I did not have that same feeling,  I saw it for the first time with out all the outside enhancements.

The music, the performers (as hokey as they might seem), the hilarious story, and everything else about the movie are just unparalleled. How can you disagree that the moment when Tim Curry takes off his cloak during ""Sweet Transvestite"" is the most electric moment in theatre history?

Tim Curry is excellent in this film and the time warp is probably the best dance from a movie ever!! A lot of people i have spoken to did not enjoy this film. They said watching Tim Curry run around in a suspender belt is not entertainment. I beg to differ. They also slate the plot. Can i just say that anyone who takes the plot too seriously are morons, to be honest. Come on! Take it as a laugh, if a disturbing one. How many rocky haters can really justify their reasons for not liking the time warp??! I like the plot. It's none too believable, but it's a lot of fun. Also, Meatloafs appearance is fabulous.

206,Jonny-ironica,My All-time favorite movie & The Queen of Cult Classics,10,28 July 2008,"Seriously now. The very first time I saw this movie was on Comedy Central back in 2001 and I caught it halfway through. I honestly had no idea what it was about, but I loved the music. I'd honestly forgotten about it until several months later when my friend pulled it out and suggested we watch it. After watching the movie all the way through for the first time, I concluded that it was my new favorite movie. Of course, that was back when my favorite movie would change every once in awhile, but seven years later, it still holds strong as my all time favorite movie! I have to confess, I am a Rocky Horror Virgin. I have never had the exhilarating and liberating experience of seeing it in theaters, but I will as soon as I can find the nearest showing.Anyway, now that I've explained how I've come to love the movie, let me explain the movie itself.It all stemmed from a play that I believe debuted in 1973 in London, written by Richard O'Brien. The play was transformed into this movie and released in 1975. Although UK audiences accepted it well enough, the US rejected it. Critics panned it, no one went to see it and the film was dubbed a bomb. After some time, a theater started playing it at midnight and soon people were lining up to see it at midnight, dressed crazily or as their favorite characters or both. Audience participation, funny games and acting it out on a stage in front of the screen also became a huge part of it and the film has become the queen of all cult classics in my opinion. You can still find midnight showings today.For those of you who couldn't guess, it's a musical. And it opens with what has become perhaps one of it's most trademark images, the big red lips on the screen singing the opening song which is most an ode to old Science Fiction movies (hence the title of the song ""Science Fiction/Double Feature"".It then moves in to a wedding where we meet two of our protagonists, Brad and Janet. Brad pops the question and the two set out to meet their old professor who introduced them. Along the way, they get a flat and decide to check for a phone at a nearby castle.Once inside the castle, they come to realize they've stumbled upon something of a nightmare and a freakshow. A mad scientist, a creepy butler, a deranged maid, a groupie, the mad scientist's creation, a party of guests and they all refer to them as Transylvanians. For those who think they mean the country, you are sadly mistaken.After a weird string of sexual escapades and shocking revelations, who shows up but Dr. Scott(the professor Brad and Janet were on their way to see). It is revealed he works for the FBI, investigating UFO's. However, he claims he is there because he is looking for his nephew Eddie. Eddie was a victim of Frank-N-Furter, the mad scientist, who used half of Eddie's brain to bring his creation to life.After they've all discovered they've been eating Eddie for dinner, Frank turns them into stone and dresses them for the random-yet-genius Floor Show.Ready for the final twist? The butler and the maid have had enough of Frank running around and doing whatever he wants. They kill Frank and his creation before telling the guests to leave and blasting the castle, which ends up being a space-ship back to their home planet, leaving Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott dazed and rolling around in the front yard where the castle blasted off from.Confused? Maybe The Criminologist who narrates along the way can help you understand. Just watch the movie! Still confused? There are many website devoted to explaining everything out. And even though some of them are so thorough, you would have to believe them, they are all theories.Want more? A follow-up called ""Rocky Horror Shows His Heels"" was planned, but after extensive rewrites and budget cuts, the movie ""Shock Treatment"" was made. Is it a sequel? Sort of. A lot of fans call it an equal and don't hold it as high as they do this movie. There are also a lot of RHPS fans who disown the movie altogether and ignore it. If you plan on seeing it, I suggest listening to the soundtrack thoroughly because if you don't know the music enough to help you into the story, it may slightly bore you.However, this movie is my all-time favorite movie and I highly recommend it. 100 out of 10.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
207,moviemonster92,"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""",7,29 July 2006,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show has become on of the greatest Midnight Movies of all time (number first place for me, second place being Night of the Living Dead). The story is plain and simple and spoofs all the dumb science fiction movies of the 1950's. It works wonders ans a musical, with songs like Double Feature, Dammit Janet, There's a Light, Time Warp, Sweet TTransvestite, I can make you a man, Hot Patootie, Bless My Soul, Toucha, Toucha, Toucha, Touch Me, Eddie, Wise up, Don't Dream it, Be it, and I'm going Home. The movie starts with Brad Majors and Janet Weiss are caught in the rain with a flat tire and decide to go a couple miles back up the road to see if they can get help from the castle they passed. They shouldn't have done that. At the castle the y meet Riff Raff, a faithful handyman, Magenta, the maid, and Columbia, the Mistress. Then we meet the one and only Dr. Frank N Furter, a transvestite who is very open about his sexuality and Frank has just finished a creation AKA monster that he names Rocky Horror who looks just like a muscle man. Brad and Janet lose sight of their sexualities that night but something cosmic definitely happened. The cast is fantastic with Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarrandon as Brad and Janet, Peter Hinwood as Rocky Horror, Patricia Qinn and Richard o' Brien (the writer of the original story) as Brother and Sister Magenta and Riff Raff, Meatloaf and Little Nell as Eddie and Columbia and Tim Curry as Dr Frank N Furter.

If viewed with an open mind & a sense of fun, one can lose all sense of self & worries. You have to allow yourself to feel the joi de vivre which Richard O'Brien intended. He encompasses a nostalgic journey through 1930-50's sci-fi with the philosophy of ""don't dream it, be it"", in other words, realise life & live it to maximum enjoyment. Enhanced by powerful, life affirming music & dialogue. If you can understand this, then it is obvious why audiences have embraced this film & want to physically interact with it.

They wander into a strange castle where a party is being held. I will not reveal any more, but all i can say now is that the events which occur will be remember for a long, long time.      Now, to the review. This movie is an excellant exploration film. It pushed to limits that where unheard of back in the 70's. It bombed at the boxoffice. Evenwith strong songs, it was the worst bomb of the 70's, perhaps of all time. ( I can't back that up) in all aspects, the movie sucked. Some awful performences by a few cast memebers and an offbeat plot make due for a bad movie.     That's the normal Vhs version. The new DVD is an excellant buy for anyone interested in the film.

212,busterbuff61,"Great spoofery, rock music, and Susan Sarandon's breasts",10,10 January 2013,"The line for critical objectivity ends at ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Either you love this one, or you just don't get it. (Count me among the former.) The story centers around super-square high-schoolers Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon, most definitely in her pre-Oscar days). They get engaged and prepare to meet up with an old professors of theirs, when their car gets a flat tire. The only place for help is a nearby castle run by a demented doctor named Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry)--and brother, the kind of help he offers.The movie's legend has long been part of modern film folklore: how rock impresario Lou Adler picked up an obscure stage show from L.A. and had it made into a movie; how the movie was considered a flop because it only attracted about 50 people per showing, until someone realized that it was always the *same* 50 people; how it was moved to midnight screenings and became an established cult classic.And of course, part of the legend is the show-within-a-show, where moviegoers come dressed as their favorite ""Rocky Horror"" characters, bring their own props to the theater (such as waterguns to shoot during a storm scene in the movie), and shout dialogue cues at the screen. (When an audience member yells out, ""What's white and sells hamburgers?"", a screen character says, ""Didn't we pass a castle down the road?"") The movie is still best seen at a full-participation public theater. But if you strip away the midnight extras and watch it on DVD, the movie still has much to offer, such as: * Gloriously trashy sets and color--it's a treat just to look at.* References to seemingly every movie ever made. Just for starters, check out all the sci-fi film reference in the movie's opening theme. And of course, there are the obvious references to ""Frankenstein,"" with the spooky castle, the mad scientist, and his unique creation.* A terrific soundtrack of rock songs, all composed by Richard O'Brien (who plays Frank's flunkie, Riff Raff, and who also wrote the original play and its screen version).* Wonderful performances, from everyone from Bostwick and Sarandon to heavyweight rock star Meat Loaf (in an all-too-brief turn). And then there's Tim Curry, whose fishnet-stockinged Frank made an indelible mark upon pop culture with the first swish of his satin cape.The DVD version includes the film's concluding song ""Superheroes"" (formerly available only in the British movie version) and an alternate soundtrack where you can learn the participation ""script"" without having to go out at midnight.Whether you're a ""virgin"" (the cultists' term for ""Rocky Horror"" first-timers) or veteran, it's definitely worth the time warp.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

But the loyal fans who watch it over and over gave it life. The idea is you have the VHS/DVD at home to ""dream it"", then go to the midnight showing to ""be it"". RHPS has everything. Catchy music, dance routines which are taught to you (""Time Warp"" literally walks you through it), great characters, and a little ""naughtiness"". Those with the deluxe DVD can learn about interacting with the film (such as throwing toast, wearing newspaper hats, tossing toilet paper). I have watched this movie so many times, I could quote it word for word. I have gone to midnight showings. I usually dress like one of the Transylvanians (which is basically an ill-fitting tuxedo, wild sunglasses and party hat).

The movie has a cult following and still airs in theaters in certain cities. The movie is known for doing something new and the songs. The songs include ""Time Warp"", ""Sweet Transvestite"", and others. This movie has a bunch of transvestite characters which makes people assume that it's not for heterosexuals. That is obviously not true. If it was true, there wouldn't be such a huge cult following and the movie wouldn't still be airing in theaters after 35 years. The plot is about a couple that wants to visit a doctor that they know. Their car breaks down so they walk to the nearest house which just so happens to be the transvestite Dr. Frank-N-Furter's house. They are first introduced to the butler Riff-Raff who guides them into a room in the house. The room is full of people doing a performance of the well known song ""Time Warp"". After that song, Dr. Frank-N-Furter appears and sings ""Sweet Transvestite"". The end of the movie parodies science fiction movies. This movie started the beginning of Tim Curry's acting career.As you can tell by the description, the movie is not meant for kids. This is a movie where you especially have to pay attention to the R rating. Kids may want to see it because it is a cult classic and they may have read great reviews about it, but they shouldn't watch it. This movie is good for older teens and above. Despite the three family friendly songs in the beginning, the rest has sexual undertones.I wasn't sure if this movie would be good because of the plot, but I was surprised. There is two versions of this movie. The original United Kingdom version and the edited United States version. The only difference between the two is that the United States version removed one of the songs to make the movie end at a lighter note. The DVD release has both versions.The DVD that I have only says rated R and not what it is rated R for. I think that it is rated R for sexual undertones and violence.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

223,mercuryix-1,The Mother of All Cult Films,10,14 September 2005,"Or I should say, the Sweet Transvestite of all cult films!To those who haven't seen Rocky Horror, don't bother reading reviews about it. It won't mean anything. Don't rent it on DVD which it recently came out on. It also won't mean anything, because it's missing the thing that gave it and the stage play that preceded it life... the audience. By definition, a cult film is meant to be seen by a group. Preferably, a large one. I saw Rocky Horror 20-something years ago, and wound up playing ""Brad"" with the players next to the stage. Something I would normally never do. Why? The show's energy sucked me in. More accurately, the audience's energy sucked me in. The show, with a revved-up audience, is almost like a dialogue between the movie and the people watching it. It celebrates sex, hedonism, even while playing out the danger, violence, and tragedy it can result in. It allows the audience of mostly young kids to exude and rejoice in their sexuality, whatever it is. And without ever taking their clothes off. I think that is the real appeal of the show. There's a joyousness, and a strange innocence, in throwing raunchy comments at the screen, watching the live performers on-stage act out the scenes in racy costumes, and sharing the energy anonymously in the dark with strangers. The live show with the original actors must have been electrifying. Plays always have more energy than films because of the immediacy of the live actors, and the energy must have been even more intense. I'll always regret not having the chance to have seen it. The movie itself has been described too many times for me to give a synopsis. I will however say that it is really a collage of feelings, ranging from fear, trepidation, excitement, lust, joyous sexual fulfillment, more lust, tragedy, and a strange sadness at the end. Basically, all the emotions that make life worth living, in an hour and a half. However, the visceral enjoyment of this film, and the emotions it brings, will only be experienced with a large, highly energized audience. If you get a chance, and if you can get your reserved ego out of the way, go to a midnight showing in your area when you know there's going to be a big showing. Don't go expecting a logical, coherent storyline. Its about experience, not narrative. You'll get an experience that you've been missing your whole life. At the end, there is a message here, hidden under all the seemingly blissful hedonism. It takes a long time for it to become clear, however.I wonder if O'Brian, its creator, was clever enough to have put it there all along? By the way, there is no nudity or actual sex in the entire movie. For a movie with its reputation, that's pretty amazing. Compared to the slasher/gore fests passing themselves off as film these days, the movie is strangely quaint and innocent. But then, that's what true enjoyment of sensuality should be.

A few years later I worked at a movie theatre which rescued itself for a short time from the inevitable obliteration of the old fashioned single screen movie house via twice weekly (!) midnight showings of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" It changed me forever and I shall always be thankful for that. An awkward, bi-spectacled dork, I was shocked to see my high school classmates give themselves over to absolute pleasure in a way I'd never suspected as I tried to blend in with them for those years. I quit that job a few months later (trying to go to college while working until 3:30 AM every Friday and Saturday proved to be a Sword of Damocles however exhilarating it was viscerally). But I never forgot the fresh faces of my classmates in throes of that rush of lust from the pelvic thrust. I realized no matter who you are or where you go, you can always be seduced by the sonic transducer. So I shook off the nice guy pathology of Brad and determined to never dream it, always be it. Just went to see the way they do it now a few weeks ago with the Sins O' The Flesh cast at the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles.

226,KirstenJackson,My Number 1 Favorite..... A True Classic,10,31 August 2005,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a cult classic made in 1975, written by Richard O'Brien (who also stars in the film). It is a comical musical featuring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, Charles Gray and Jonathan Adams. The film begins with Brad asking his girlfriend Janet to marry him. They drive off, leaving Denton, Ohio, only to have a car breakdown in the middle of the pouring rain. They notice a castle, so they decide to knock on the door and ask if they can use the phone. Little did they know this stop would be much more than they bargained for! The castle belongs to Dr. Frank-N-Furter, the ""sweet transvestite"" from planet Transsexual, Transylvania! He is holding an annual convention of all the visitors from the planet. The night Brad and Janet arrive is also the night Dr. Frank-N-Furter plans on revealing his new creation named Rocky Horror, created to relieve the doctors' sexual ""tensions"". But Rocky Horror fears the doctor and does not want to get sexual with him. Dr. Frank-N-Furter decides he is going back to Transylvania, but little did he know Riff Raff (the butler) and Magenta (the maid) had a different agenda... This movie has hilarious lines and situations, most delivered by Tim Curry, who does a fantastic, hysterical job as the transvestite! He is perfect for the role and had me cracking up! And needless to say, he is absolutely gorgeous in this film, you can't take your eyes off him, he is greatly entertaining! The others are fantastic, too, and everyone fits in the film so well, each holding their own place as a great character. All the actors fit their parts perfectly and by the sets, the dialogue, the actors and the singing, your eyes will be drawn to the screen. As a musical, it has some catchy tunes such as ""Sweet Transvestite"", ""Dammit Janet"", ""The Time Warp"", ""Rose Tint My World"" and ""Toucha, Toucha, Toucha Touch Me"". If you didn't know already, Rocky Horror has been playing in the theater for over 30 years! It still manages to attract a major audience of all ages. Young fans find themselves drawn to it and older fans find themselves feeling nostalgic with memories. You toss rice, hold newspapers, squirt water-pistols, throw confetti, throw toilet-paper and call out comical lines back to the screen... after experiencing it at a theater, I can honestly say it is the definition of a good time. What I find amazing is how this film has never managed to go out of style. It always has this amazing, fresh feel to it that makes you want more! I think it's safe to say The Rocky Horror Picture Show will never die. So see it home, see it at the theater, but however you do it, just make sure you see it! Love it, hate it, you're never gonna forget it. Long live Rocky Horror",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
227,isaacbbabcock,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,2,22 July 2007,"If you enjoy disjointed plots that make no sense, comedy that falls flat on its face behind garbled lyrics and bad sound editing, and if you think that weird for the sake of weird is funny, you'll love this movie.For those former theater majors who go giddy over the mere sight of stage singing cross dressers, this movie will be a visual delight.If you're looking for a movie that's anything beyond a demented, kaleidoscopic blur of random thoughts and inside jokes between the writer and himself, shat into screenplay form and brought tragically to life by a largely career-suicidal cast, spare your brain from the nightmare that will echo through it for decades. This movie is not for you.It bounces interminably between inexplicable, downright awkward and frequently painful scenes that range between unintelligible psychotic bisexual rantings and drug-induced musical numbers seemingly written during the filming of the scene.For those who understand the value of entertainment and think actively melting their brain is a negative instead of a positive, every scene is horrific. I have plenty of gay friends, but many scenes in this movie were so slathered in useless, preachy sexual androgyny that it made me practically turn my head away in disgust.If you haven't shot your DVD player or thrown it off a balcony by the one hour mark, spare yourself any additional emotional drama of panning your eyes between the screen and the nearest clock and just shut it off. The final hour of the film is almost entirely superfluous.Only in the final five minutes of the film do gaping holes or just plain missing pages from the plot become hastily written into the accidental trick ending. It turns out that the horrific mess you've endured through your now bleeding eyeballs was all just a farce of a farce of a farce that you frankly shouldn't have given a damn about in the first place.Some movies make you laugh. Others make you cry. The better ones do both, and send you out of the theater fulfilled and with maybe a sense of greater purpose in life. This one makes you wish you'd died before your soul got its first glimpse of hell, burned though your retinas onto the back of your skull forever.I gave this movie two stars simply on the merits of my girlfriend somehow liking it, and I like most movies she does. Maybe there's something I'm just completely missing here, like my IQ is too high or I'm handicapped by not having taken drama class for four years in high school. With my possible fallacies taken into account, I have no idea why she not only can endure this, but thinks it's harmless enough to force upon unwitting victims.People call this movie ""the ultimate cult classic."" There's a reason it's a cult classic. Cults tend to be full of nutcases. I like a ton of crazy, nutty movies - even campy B movie comedies like ""Cannibal! The Musical"" - but this film is flat out atrocious.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Even though it was very Wierd, very hard to understand and in some places, completly outthere....it was a well made spectical. The Soundtrack and acting was excellent. I mean, who didnt like Meatloaf bellowing his mucial Tunes and Saradon singing,""oh Dirty dirty...touch me touch me"".  Tim curry puts up one of the best performances i have ever seen. Saradon was very Tight and Sexy giving the part of the film that Sexy edge it needs. And in the Spoof catogory, its a top 3 no doubt. It however dosen't fullfill all my pleasures. Even though the plot is clever..its still a little uneven and at times..your wondering why did he do that...and you have to wait a while for the answer.

236,moshomaniac,"Science Fiction, double feature--the insane midnight movie madness all started here!",9,7 March 2018,"The story of a clean-cut bunch of kids who embark on a night out after getting engaged, only to end up breaking down and seeking refuge in the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a bisexual, transvestite mad scientist from outer space(you read that right). Frank is creating a man ala Frankenstein: the buff, blonde-haired Rocky Horror, who has been created as a means of relieving the doctor's sexual tension. Only the monster is straight. Before the night is over, Rocky Horror and the Doctor will be dead, the servants will leave for another planet, beaming up the whole house in their wake, and Brad and Janet will both lose their virginity and their own personal values.Richard O'Brien's madcap spoof of Sci-fi, B-movies, Horror, Rock Music, and sexuality first made its mark in 1973 as ""The Rocky Horror Show"", before it made its silver screen debut in 1975. The bizarre, genre defying, hilariously twisted film initially bombed in theatres before they realized that it needed to be played in the midnight circuits, then it soon became a cult phenomenon.To call the movie offbeat is an understatement. It is literally 2 hours of insanity, crazy, fitfully amusing insanity perhaps, but still insanity. Tim Curry's classic gender-bending role as the mad Dr. Furter has become his signature role, and the film has become less of a movie, and more of a full-blown ritual with its legions of fans. This film is best viewed with a audience, as the participation is the key to its full enjoyment. The songs and settings have become iconic, household tunes, and the film spawned a sequel, ""Shock Treament"", in 1981. Though the sequel didn't do very well, the original RHPS still enjoys success to this day, with over 40 years of midnight movie madness. Check it out.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

This movie is a lot of fun to watch.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
238,FFour,Historical For Impact on A Revolution,10,24 August 2013,"The story behind this musical can't be spoiled very much. This film was a major, groundbreaking film during the late 70's and early 80's. MANY people hated it passionately, while many of us that were young and rebellious heralded it. As you likely already know, it was an adaptation for film from the musical, ""The Rocky Horror Show,"" but little was changed of significance during adaptation. For nothing else, this film deserves full stars for audience interaction like none other. It was and remains as the supreme cult classic. Today, one can watch similar risqué material on a cartoon channel, without being surprised. But back then, we didn't have nearly as much of the outrageous in our entertainment that we have today. Sure, 'Jesus Christ Superstar' and 'Hair' pushed some boundaries, but we didn't have the amount of competing stimulus as is present today. The media was very tightly controlled, and we were inhibited and repressed by this as to what was acceptable. This musical would not have been possible without the influences of the narrated Sci-Fi B movies (and the humor of how ridiculous they were), British programming of shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the hippies and musicians of the late 60's & early 70's.I had long hair back then, and that was a radical thing to do, because family fought over such matters. Seriously, the television shows of our youth would not even show a husband and wife in the same bed without them having to keep at least one foot on the ground. We were raised to believe that sex was a ""dirty"" thing by our government and many of the social customs that seemed left over from the decisions made by the Council of Trent and the Inquisition of the Dark Ages.I admit that I tried my only hit of LSD in my life on the day of my first viewing of this film in a theater back in 1978. When those red lips came on the big screen singing, it blew my mind, because it was so novel. Then, the story continued to work away further at the constructs in my mind. When it transitioned us from a wedding in a conservative, rural setting, to entering the Frankenstein place with Dr Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite from the planet transsexual of the galaxy Transylvania, in a hot drag outfit, pushing boundaries about sexuality, music & dance styles, some of the mind-fabrications from our culture that needed to be questioned, were falling down. When the audience began shouting phrases, holding up umbrellas, throwing toast, carrying around ""virgins,"" it occurred to me that this was a profound moment in my life. We were up dancing together, as a community, to ""Let's Do the Time Warp Again,"" and I had never experienced anything close to it. Wouldn't it be grand if a new production had the ability to get people to unite together dancing in a movie theater?The scene where Janet wants to get dirty with Rocky, singing, ""Toucha Toucha Toucha Touch Me,"" tells much of the story on its own. She was overly repressed, and viewed sex as dirty due to her upbringing, and wanted to be dirty. She and Brad were exposed to events and people they could never have even imagined based on their upbringing. In some ways, we were rebelling and being dirty to a degree by just being at the show.The musical gets more ludicrous in the Sci-Fi, B movie style. I don't think the particulars of the story matter much, so don't be upset that you may miss some of the story due to the audience being radical. I am a major fan of both Sci-Fi and musicals, as that was what our generation had available: Elvis, Bing Cosby, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz, etc. I acted & sang my heart out in musicals. Plus, I grew up cultured by my parents with theater. But, the musicals were mostly wholesome. This musical was turning our definition of wholesome on its head. Now, when I watch it, it seems strange to me that it doesn't really contain anything I wouldn't want my grand-children to see. Similar risqué material is shown during regular family watching hours now. It really does not contain anything shocking for today, but back then, the shockwaves ran deep and long. If you are a Rocky Horror Picture Show virgin: I read one of the top reviews that suggested that it should be watched on video first. I dissent with this, as I tried that approach with a RHPS virgin back in the 80's, shortly after I was married. I watched this film with my then wife (and current friend) on VHS. Seeing it for the first time on our television, without the audience, seemed lame to her. I tried to add to the experience with my shouts in the living-room, but no props in the house. It just fell flat. My suggestion for virgins to this show is to go to the theater, without reading any further reviews, and make certain everyone knows you are a RHPS virgin, so they can take care of you. Don't mind if you get carried around with your legs spread open, as happens in some places. You are in for a treat! DRUG DISCLAIMER: Just because my LSD experience was profound with this picture, I am not promoting you to take any hallucinogens before you watch it. My only reason for mentioning it is due to the cultural significance of hallucinogens back then. Very shortly after my first viewing of this picture, I had a very bad trip when someone snuck some Angel-Dust into a bowl of weed we were smoking, and it messed me up for several very scary days that you would not wish to endure.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

241,Prestige_Never_Pride,"""Let's do The Time Warp again!""",8,15 October 2008,"When I think of musicals, I immediately think of 'Grease': a romantic, progressive, light-hearted comedy that explains itself in one screening. Not that 'Grease' isn't bad, however. But, this film definitely redefines the ""musical"" category! Tim Curry was sensational! How could you not give credit to such a hilarious (and certainly brave) actor like him? His performance was so sweet and funny that it's impossible not to like him, despite his character's dirty and sensual antics :) His transvestite performance was truly memorable. Susan Sarandon, who in my opinion isn't a bad actress, performed her role admirably as well. What really sold the movie, and made it truly enjoyable however, were Patricia Quinn and Richard O'Brien (forgive my spelling). Who better to play the crazy yet creepy Riff-Raff than the Rocky Horror creator himself! A wonderful touch, Mr. O'Brien! Patricia Quinn was an awesome Magenta, so creepy, yet sensational and wacky. She portrayed every kind of emotion imaginable for her character, from flirty to disgusted, and annoyed to outgoing. Those two have to be my favorite characters!The music was great! I was singing ""The Time Warp"" for seven days afterward! It's one of the only musical numbers that actually teaches you the dance while you enjoy it (believe me, being in a musical is not as easy as it looks)! The Transylvanians were awesome! ""Hot Patootie"" (sung by the cool Meatloaf) was sweet and sexy, and a great song to sing to! I will definitely go to future midnight screenings. Though its also good to own this musical masterpiece on DVD, as a previous member noted the rowdiness of audiences at midnight screenings. Mr. O'Brien, you have truly changed musicals forever!

But why don't I like 'Rocky Horror'? Well, it's pretty easy to explain. So easy in fact, that those of you who are raging just because I don't like this oversexualized piece of crap should understand. And here it is; Sex is the only thing they focus on. I'm not going to say that if you choose to live that way your a bad person, but in movies, often sexualizing people has two outcomes. 1.) It's a porno and that's the point, (and I couldn't care LESS about those) or 2.) A man in a hockey mask, or a fedora and a razor- glove hand, or with a mask made of human skin and a chainsaw shows up and kills you. In this, sex is just shown as ""Hey, do it with everyone. (And I mean EVERYONE) and nothing bad will happen."" Sure, I get it. it was the 70's, everyone was high off their asses but today... It's just uncomfortable. I really struggled to watch the movie and that sucks, because the music (mostly) is amazing and the story has a really cool premise! Yet the whole thing is just utterly destroyed by the really disturbing sexual content which this movie focuses the last 30 minuets on! The acting is really good from everyone (except Little Neil, she was REALLY annoying.) and the music is FANTASTIC! (Aside from 'Rose Tint My World') even the song 'Sweet Transvestite' is catchy enough that I don't care about the lyrics. Probably the best songs are 'Time Warp' (obviously) 'Hot Patootie - Bless My Soul' and 'Eddie' (BTW Meatloaf is by far the best part of the movie.) The audio and video quality are surprisingly low for a blu-ray. But I guess they were trying to capture the feel of when this first came out. (Maybe...) Going into the movie, I really wanted to enjoy it, but no matter what I did. I just couldn't. this movie is just BAD. It's not enjoyably bad, and even if it was I would still have a hard time recommending it because of the f**ked up content. Also, just to be clear, I enjoyed 'Fritz the Cat' more than this. And that was rated 'X'. It had great ideas, but a terrible execution and unlikable characters and really left me questioning why I bothered to watch the damn thing.

243,udrivemenutty,I'm sure you're not spent.....yet.,9,29 December 2014,"""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is a truly funny musical, and if you haven't seen it (even if you hate musicals) you should watch this at least once; probably at home. I must be one of the few Rocky Horror fans that hate the whole ""audience participation"" deal. If you have to throw toilet paper and hotdogs and shout obscenities to make a movie fun then you obviously aren't fulfilled by the movie itself.This musical parodies those cheesy B-movies where the typical wholesome all-American couple gets a flat tire and goes to a spooky house for a phone...though in this case it's the house of a transvestite doctor. This going to be FUN! Reprising their roles from the 1973 Original London Cast of ""The Rocky Horror Show"" are Tim Curry, Richard O'Brien (also the creator), Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, as well as Jonathan Adams (though in the role of Dr. Scott instead of the Narrator). Meatloaf also reprises his role as Eddie from the 1974 Los Angeles production. I appreciate how instead of getting all big-names and a big fat budget they opted for lower budget with a cast formed of previous RHS actors. How would you parody a low-budget B-movie with a high budget anyway? Susan Sarandon makes a great Janet, though Barry Bostwick is slightly lacking (his version of ""Once In A While"" was so slow; I could see why they DID cut it out from the movie).Three things I rather hate about the movie is the song pacing, Charles Gray, and the elimination of Rocky's dialogue. Every song in the movie is performed much slower than they were in the original productions, which in turn slows the action of the movie down; the only songs that worked at a slower pace were ""I'm Going Home"" and ""Superheroes"". Charles Gray talks at the pace of a dying mule and puts nowhere near as much energy as Jonathan Adams or Graham Jarvis did (nor as much ominousness as Arthur Dignam). In the play Rocky actually talks; he never actually talks in this movie. This makes sense going the Frankenstein route, because the monster couldn't speak fluent sentences until he went to the man at the cottage. What DOESN'T make sense is that he can still SING. This thwarts that logic, huh? One thing I like that the movie adds is the awkward dinner scene.....that's always a hoot to watch.I suppose I should wrap things up. WATCH IT! Clever, catchy songwriting. Great cast of actors (closest thing you'll get to seeing the original 1973 London cast.....unless a bootleg of THAT shows up). And just an overall good time.

My father had purchased the video tape having never seen it either but had heard that it was a realy great film.  The family sat around the living room and watched it not knowning what this film was about even when it had finished.  The version that he had was just the film and mentioned nothing about the audience participation aspect of the film.  A few years later I went to see it in the theater as the halloween midnight movie.  I had originaly gone only because they were showing the movie ""Scream"" for free and I hadn't planed to stick around to watch ""RHPS.""  After scream was over I was about to leave when a friend of mine spotted me (not an easy task since I was in costume) and invited me to sit with her during the showing of ""RHPS.""  I told her that I had seen it before and hadn't thought much of it.  She got a confused look on her face and asked me ""why didn't you like it?  I thought it would be exactly your style?""  At first I thought that she was making a joke that that I was into cross dressing or bisexuality or one of the other non-mainstream moral activities celebrated in the film.  But she went on to explain that she thought that I would have loved the audience participation and heckeling in it.  I told her that I had only seen in on VHS and that I had never seen it in the theater.  After having a red V painted on my forhead to mark me as a virgin I sat and watched ""RHPS"" the way that it was ment to be seen.  I laughed, I cried, I danced the Time Warp, and I had the best time ever.

What they don't realise is that these are no ordinary residents: Dr. Frank N Furter (Tim Curry), with assistance from his servants Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien), Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and their ragtag bunch of fellow Transylvanians, has his own diabolical plans for the evening, set against a kick-butt rock 'n' roll music score....Call me a twisted ""Rocky Horror"" fan, but I actually prefer to watch this cult classic movie-musical in the comfort of my own home, rather than going out to one of those midnight theatrical screenings that have made this 1975 film so popular. Oh, I'm sure there's great fun to be had at a midnight showing, but the fact is, you're not going to see or hear very much of the movie itself, what with the audience shouting & throwing stuff at the screen literally every two seconds (think of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" on speed), as well as the live cast performing in front of the movie screen! If you want to really *see and hear* ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as you would any other film, watch it on video first. Then, when you've got the movie firmly etched in your head, head out to the theater. But NOT before!Having said that, this movie version of the hit stage musical written by Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff himself), is a ton of great, naughty fun. It wonderfully sends up B-movie sci-fi/horror flicks, with a playful, healthy dose of blatant sexual innuendo thrown in for good measure. Classic, memorable rock 'n' roll tunes written by O'Brien throughout, including ""The Time Warp,"" ""Sweet Transvestite,"" ""Hot Patootie""....the list goes on and on. And, of course, you have a spectacular cast, led by Tim Curry, who IS the larger-than-life Dr. Frank N Furter, and a young, attractive Susan Sarandon, who simply lights up the screen as Janet. But everyone else, including Barry Bostwick, Meatloaf, Little Nell, Patricia Quinn, and Charles Gray all make excellent contributons, too.I love ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"": it's very funny, sexy, and brilliantly performed, with great rock 'n' roll music t'boot. But I, personally, still prefer to watch it at home, where I can see the film in peace & quiet without being yelled in my ear, getting soaked, or having rice & toast tossed all around me!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
249,JR1400,A nice way to spend a Saturday night.,8,25 November 2001,"I started taking in this flick in '82. 800 screenings later, I've finally retired from the weekly shows. But for a great way to let it all hang out in public and not get yourself arrested, by all means, catch this one in a theatre. It's very '70's and today's viewers may not get all the jokes, but it's still a lot of fun. With all the friends I've made over the years watching Rocky, it's another aspect of the film that makes it uniquely enjoyable. I'm still amazed it's lasted this long. It's definitely earned itself a niche in kitsch. To all the fans past and present, and to Sal Piro, thanks! Give yourselves a Rocky cheer. If you haven't yet discovered it, take a Saturday night and enjoy. Better bring the newspaper!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Getting to act out various aspects of my own persona by playing different characters from the film helped me figure out who I am. Indeed, one could say that I became at RHPS, that in many ways I was born there. God knows it certainly got me laid a lot. And winning 3 (count 'em, 3) lifetime passes didn't hurt when it came time to deal with the box office. At one of the theatres we used, the manager even let me have the area behind the screen as an office. I thinks RHPS's glory days may be past, but for the best possible reason... In this day and age, the doors are blown off of most of the closets. Even if you can't come out about whatever makes you feel alienated publicly, there's a Yahoo Club for you. The internet provides a level of fellowship while allowing anonymity so that you can let it all hang out without getting hanged out to dry. But for some of us, the illegitimate children of the damned who came of age in Richard O'Brien's rose-tinted world, the glory of the horror will never fade to black.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I would be one of them. Actualy, best movie ever. Now just a warning, if you are homophobic or have any problems with gay people or transvestites or incest, don`t even bother picking up this movie. Also steer clear if you are adverse to pelvic thrusting, drugs, singing (good or otherwise), partial nudity or swearing of any kind. Everyone knows the story, and everyone who has seen the movie will know all that goes on. You either like it or you don`t.

253,sebrat,THE hard-out music of the century,8,25 March 2005,"The most insane box-office top ever created is one of the few musicals I would deem acceptable to the delicate ears of music-lovers. However, there are problems. Why does this movie randomly change from a Frankenstein parody to an attempt at 70s science fiction halfway through? You do not change the genre of a movie halfway through, it is a crime! However, this can be forgotten once you listen to (or sing yourself) the words of the fantastic songs, featured as with most good musicals at regular intervals, but not so often that you get bored or misinterpret the story. When most of us think of musicals, our mind jumps to cheesy claptrap such as 'A Streetcar Named Desire', musicals made back in the days when corny group-singing was not a tiresome cliché. However, in THIS instance, one can sit and watch the insane action on screen and fit it perfectly with the genre of the songs, a hard genre to describe. I suppose one must call it rock, but it contains a kind of weirdness, a combination between group-singing and rock, making it fall under the musical genre but also providing engaging music for the lovers of rock in the wild 70s. The characters themselves are fantastic. Frank N. Furter (played by the unexpected Tim Curry) has to be the best, his curly wig, his fishnets, his pearls and his corset (but especially his makeup) make him a piece of cinematic history. Also, Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) is wonderfully weird with his creepy sister Magenta (Patricia Quinn) who retains her position as creepiest actress I have ever seen on the big screen. The instruments used in the music also make the genre lean more towards rock, electric keyboards and guitars, saxophones et cetera. Most people love the Rocky Horror Picture Show for its wackiness, though I was more interested in the quality of the production (especially for a low budget 1975 creation) and the SONGS.The Time Warp, Hot Patootie, Sweet Transvestite, Touch-a-touch-a-touch-a-touch Me, The Sword of Damocles and the rest are all memorable and bring back the life and energy of the REAL musical. So what will it be? 'Let's Do the Time Warp Again' or 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'?",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
254,LallaHolti,An unimaginable great movie!!!,10,1 January 2007,"Imagine a young couple in the mid-seventies, which just got engaged and takes now a journey to tell their closest friends about their future-plans. This is what Brad and Janet do on rainy and cloudy night. As of course in every horror movie, no matter if comedy or not, they have a blow-out. To find help they go to a castle, where they meet rather strange characters, such as Columbia, Magenta, Riff Raff and of course Dr.Frank'N Furter. This is the stuff that makes a great and enormously funny movie. Totally weird and so unexpected that all the while you really can have no idea what is about to happen next. Even if you would expect the craziest things you can imagine, you would still be wrong. Next to that the amazing set just makes someone believe the entire story, even though it is more than, as already said, crazy. The set and costumes are colorful and beautifully happy! The cast as well gives you the thrills! There is of course Tim Curry, who is just stunning and has the greatest mimic of all actors ever been on screen. There is the wonderful Susan Sarandon, who plays the shy little Janet makes everything the character does really believable. Everyone else who was also part of this great cast just gives his or her parts to make this movie a cult-classic-must-see-movie!!!!SO WATCH IT!!!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

At first it seemed like a campy musical but as the story progressed it began to grow on me it's got everything from great musical numbers to excellent costumes, memorable scenes and wacky characters like Dr. Frank-n- Furter, Eddie a delivery boy and a whole variety of other strange individuals Some of my favourite songs from the movie include Hot Patootie (Bless My Soul), Damn It Janet, Sweet Transvestite and Touch- A- Touch-A-Touch-A- Touch Me.

256,Alfredo_Griselda,A Classic Among Classics ... Only Crazier,9,2 October 2009,"If one were to ask a film critic what they consider to be the greatest movie ever made, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" would most likely not be a popular answer. If you look at this madcap rock 'n' roll musical from a purely cinematic point of view, it's easy to understand why: an amateurish attempt at a story, less than stellar performances, virtually nonexistent production values, and some of the cheapest special effects ever captured on film (even for the year 1975). When caught up in technicalities and a longing for mainstream purity, then one would have a perfectly good argument for ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" being one of the worst movies ever made. But if one were to ask a fan of the film why they love it so much, I guarantee you that their reason has nothing to do with production values or mainstream desirability. Quite the opposite--it's a film that's shunned by most audiences. This hasn't stopped it from becoming one of the most successful cult films ever made, grossing to date over $100 million (this is over a thirty year period, mind you; it's initial release was a disaster). This is because ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is not just a motion picture. It's a pure social and cultural experience, one that has liberated numerous people labeled by society as ""misfits"" or ""outcasts"" with its message of, ""Don't dream it, be it."" It's also a ritual that warrants midnight gatherings on Fridays and Saturdays dressed as one of the film's characters. The fun is enhanced through the use of props (such as rice, water pistols, and toilet paper, all of which are used on cue) as well as by the act of shouting vulgar lines back to the screen. This trend of audience participation has remained a staple in ""Rocky Horror""'s successful history and only adds to its appeal. Can you imagine how uninteresting it would be to view this film in the privacy of your own home? Above all else, it's an opportunity to have fun, allowing for (and often encouraging) the release of the party animal within us all. Only at a ""Rocky Horror"" showing would no one blink when seeing an audience decked out in fishnet stockings, glittering corsets, and pasty makeup plastered on their faces. Everyone is uninhibited and no one cares what others may think. What a great excuse for a year round Halloween party. ""Rocky Horror"" is also about the music, with some of the most classic songs ever recorded, including the show stopping ""Sweet Transvestite,"" the delightfully sappy ""Dammit Janet,"" and ""The Time Warp,"" the film's signature song (which prompts the audience to get up and dance along with it). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the very fabric of the film's greatness depends on the music. And why not? The oddball mix of science fiction, horror, sex, and comedy just aren't enough; all that can be seen in plenty of other cult films. Give us something more, something that would leave a lasting impression on the ones who took the time to see what this movie was all about. Through music, ""Rocky Horror"" does that, and does that well. Of all the performances in this film, Tim Curry as the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter is the most memorable. His decadence and sexual overdrive hits us like a ton of bricks and never lets up. (And who really wants it to?) In the tradition of Frankenstein's Monster (who has just come out of the closet), Frank actually creates a muscle man named Rocky for the sole purpose of ""relieving his tension."" The Middle American, wholesome young couple Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) couldn't be more out of place in the world Frank lives in, which makes the situation they're in all the more entertaining. Things only get weirder when you throw in a houseful of servants with quirks of their own, such as hunchbacked butler, a voyeuristic maid, and a tap dancing groupie. Top that off with the film's sinfully twisted story about the night that Brad and Janet spend in Frank's castle, and you have all the ingredients for a cult classic. Like such offbeat films as ""Forbidden Zone"" and ""Pink Flamingos,"" ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is a film that is experienced, not seen. From its humble beginnings as a London stage play to the creation (and initial failure) of the movie we all know today, ""Rocky Horror"" has given story creator and Riff Raff portrayer Richard O'Brien a godlike status among fans. The film is pure camp from start to finish: fun, cheesy, and entertaining. Whether you've seen it 1,000 times (some have actually seen it more than that) or are seeing it for the first time (which would label you as a ""virgin""), it remains to this day a very unique piece of celluloid history. Well, what are you waiting for? Pop in the DVD. Don your garter belt, spiked heels, and party hat. Get your water pistols, newspapers, and lighters. And above all else, let's do the Time Warp again!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

There was nothing great about those films other than that there was no cgi or advanced editing techniques that we have today.All of the ""effects"" were done manually, and they still managed to freak the hell out of their audiences.Rocky Horror is an ode to all of those movies made with low budgets and big hearts.

A decidedly more perverted and insane person, but new nonetheless.At seven bucks a pop, it's hardly a huge investment.

Until about last night, when I was frantically flipping channels to keep my parents from seeing what I was watching.This movie is the best musical ever made. It tops The Sound Of Music, Chicago, and (as a purist it hurts me to say it) even Moulin Rouge. It's crazy and dirty, and it's still great, for a movie made in 1975. I can see why it became a classic. After watching it, I find myself singing the songs (Touch- a touch- a touch me and Sweet Transvestite the most) over and over. It's a movie you watch, and get woken up.I watched Moulin Rouge when I was twelve, and that jazzed me. It's all I thought about, and really became and obsession. At Fourteen, I watched this, and I felt the same way. It's so nuts and dirty that it's charming. Everyone should watch this movie once, and even if you say you hated it, you know you loved it. It's essential to watch.As for the performances, everyone did a great job bringing to life the colorful characters in the movie. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick make the ultimate squeaky clean couple, and Patricia Quinn, Richard O' Brian, and Nell Campell make the oddest henchmen. I got a kick out of the Translyvanians, they where so weird. Now, last but not at all least, Tim Curry. Tim Curry is SO bizarre, and crazy. He's doesn't make an ugly man, or an ugly women. I must say, he has great legs. I'll have to buy the DVD for this and pull out my fishnet stockings next time I'm feeling down, because if this does'nt make you feel good about your sex life, nothing will.

Some of the tunes aren't too good like the Sword of Damocles but there are certainly more good songs in it than bad.Also the main thing that makes the Rocky Horror special is going to see it in a theatre or cinema. If you've never done this - do it! the film is only just about all right when you watch it in your own home.But turning up to a theatre or cinema and finding most people in some kind of cos-play dress from the show - loads of frank-n-furters in stockings and suspenders, people dressed as Brad and Janet, and many others. It really does add to the effect.The whole show is geared around audience participation, which there isn't any other film I know of that expects the audience to shout words out at the characters, or decorate the theatre in rice, confetti, water. Forget Dolby 5.1 in the theatre when you see this you get full interaction, the feeling of rice going over you at the wedding scene, the rain and the newspaper to protect you, the noisemakers when Frank is about to unleash his creation, the party poppers for when Frank-n-furter is coming, and of course the chance to get up and dance around to the Time Warp.It really does make this film unique.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

First on the list was Rocky Horror. I had never heard of the movie, and had no idea that it would turn out to be a cross-dressing musical.  However, I was highly entertained by this picture, thanks mostly to the musical numbers.  If not for songs like ""Hot Patootie"" and ""Eddie's Teddy,"" I doubt I would have even finished watching it.   I have to divide this into 2 halves: the good half and bad half.  The movie is awesome up until the Transylvanians leave.  The script is pretty good.  But when Brad and Janet retire to their separate quarters, things begin unraveling.I have to admit that watching this around friends and family is embarassing, probably because they don't appreciate the music and think that I'm watching it for the cross-dressing aspect.

You can't beat a young, toothy, (and most cheeky) Tim Curry in garter belts and torn stockings; or a fresh-faced (and at her most demure) Susan Sarandon. This movie is a classic-- glam rock at it's bi-sexual peak; with memorable songs that morph Caberet-esque with the Thing from Outer Space. After you see this movie, you will never again relate ""Franknfurter"" to a hotdog; and will practice daily to perfect the steps of the ""Time Warp"". Prepare yourself-- you're in for quite a celluloid ride.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
277,Slick-50,A classic of the campy genre,10,29 April 2001,The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Even the name is right. I first saw this film early in 2000 and have seen it somewhere between 50 & 100 times since.

It's got everything and it's just so much fun to watch. And if you can see it where they have a live audience you'll completely have a ball.The story itself isn't really the strongest part but the it doesn't matter because the acting and the level of fun makes up for it. I also like films that don't need to explain everything to their audience, a little guessing and mystery is more than okay.There is a bit of sex but it's tame so I think kids older than 13 can watch it but if you're a parent you may want to watch it without them first to decide that.It's a lot of fun, the songs are great and set design is also fun to look at.

It's a movie filled with catchy songs, fantastic actors and a huge sense of humor.If I could choose, I would give an Oscar for Tim Curry as the ""Sweet Transvestite"".It is, and will continue to be the #1 cult movie ever!Science Fiction, Comedy, Horror and Musical, you name it!The rocky horror picture show has it!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
281,jimwhittaker02,A Musical Dream Come True,10,1 January 2005,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show is the greatest rock musical of all time. It succeeds on every aesthetic level; the cast is a wonderful collection of cartoonish eccentrics, the premise combines the adventurousness of experimental theatre (The Rocky Horror Show) with the fun of film and musical popular culture, the songs are all catchy and beautifully arranged, and the costumes and sets are inventively quirky.The overwhelming creativity of the film has its roots in the hit London stage musical, Richard O'Brien's exuberant first work. After quitting the cast of Jesus Christ Superstar over creative differences, O'Brien set out to write a rock musical that would combine all the things that ""give you a buzz,"" from science-fiction and horror films to comedy and glam rock. Impressed by Alice Cooper's recent concert assaults on London, O'Brien created what he originally called an ""Alice Cooper type Frankenstein"" character named Dr. Frank-N-Furter, who would build a blond muscleman for his own pleasure. Tim Curry assumed the role in the 1973 London play, sharing the stage with O'Brien, Little Nell, Patricia Quinn and Jonathan Adams. Behind the scenes were director Jim Sharman, production designer Brian Thomson, musical arranger Richard Hartley and costume designer Sue Blane, all of whom brought their considerable creativity to the production. The core members of the Rocky Horror stage family went on to create the film, building on a year's worth of theatrical innovation.Transferring Rocky Horror to the medium of film allowed the concept to take on a dreamlike quality. The film's tone is satire; Richard O'Brien enjoyed the dialogue of classic science-fiction films, where actors were called on to say outlandish lines with straight faces. The songs are integrated (not ""backstage"") musical numbers, which advance the plot. All of the characters are seduced or controlled by Frank, but his influence does not end with them. The film is at its most subversive when Frank talks and sings directly to the camera; the technique is a tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Jim Sharman's favorite director.In the film, ""Sweet Transvestite"" Frank is given a glamorous, Joan Crawford-like film star appearance, and speaks in a feminine voice (with an upper-class Knightsbridge accent). When he/she gazes into the camera and beckons ""Give yourself over to absolute pleasure,"" his message is not meant only for his poolside partners, but for us. As the bisexual mad doctor commences his final descent into decadence, his ""moral"" subduers are portrayed as similarly decadent hypocrites, offering up Frank as a sexual martyr. We are left in the swirling mists with Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott, forced to reconsider our own inhibitions. But first, Let's do the Time Warp again!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

283,fussd-1,When a movie becomes part of culture.,10,1 July 2006,"Rocky Horror, what can I say. It has lasted 30 years as a cult movie. I remember the first time I saw it when I was at Uni about 25 years ago, since then I guess I have seen it at least 15 times. It is always viewable and enjoyable, brings back memories of people around me at the time that I have lost contact with and the 3rd grade theaters that it used to show in twice a week. I think most of the enjoyment came from the audience participation more so than the movie itself but it was the cause. The few ""Sweet Transvestities"" that would get dressed up and the more normal crowd that would take along newspapers, rice, water pistols etc to shower the crowd with. What other movie has created such a following? It became a participation movie, whether designed or not - it did. Also it opened a few eyes to what is normal, gay, or other without ramming it down your throat. Live, love and be who you want to be..... 15 out of 10.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
284,pcgness,Not a movie to take seriously,8,5 November 2021,"I usually loathe musicals, but The Rocky Horror Picture Show won me over. I didn't see it until just last year cause my godmother kept on insisting I watch it. You don't have to be LGBT to enjoy it.I mean, she wasn't wrong. If you're someone who takes everything especially movies seriously The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't for you. But I love this movie. When people think of movies from the 1970s they usually name Star Wars, Jaws, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, or Rocky. The 70s was the dawn of cinema blockbusters. Rocky Horror flopped horribly in a time where people wouldn't tolerate something like this even in the slightest. But this movie developed a cult following within the misunderstood groups of people, primarily the LGBT community. This movie brought them together for decades for midnight showings, making it the film to be in theatres for the longest time.Lemme be honest. The music, and the performances are what make this movie shine. It's surprising to me that the Broadway musical was a success but the film was not for the first few years since its release.The OG: The Rocky Horror Show was something a man named Richard O'Brien (who plays Riff Raff in the film) had written out of pure boredom yet became a cult masterpiece in later years. For a world lost in time, we needed the message, ""don't dream it, be it"".You don't have to like this movie but appreciate the impact its made on the people who couldn't fit into their cultural norms and be themselves. The 2016 reboot did no justice.There's no Dr. Frank-N-Furter other than Tim Curry, who pulled off a fantastic performance because he had been living and breathing the role ever since he obtained it for the British version of the original musical.For me the real star was Richard O'Brien, not only because he is the creator but his vocal performances for ""Science Fiction"" and ""Over At The Frankenstein Place"" were phenomenal. Dude could've been a great frontman in a rock band.This movie is great just go see it.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

So if you haven't seen it, WATCH IT!. I promise, you will like it. The movie takes place in Denton, C.A. where a couple goes through strange events in a castle that is owned by a very peculiar scientist and kept tidy by a weirdo butler and his ""sister"".

Well about one year later i finally rented it again and told myself i was going to watch it all the way through no matter what. Well i did, and i am so happy that i did, i don't regret one minute of watching it and now The Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of my favorite movies. I love to dance and sing along with the songs, and i practically know every line and every word by heart. It truly is a classic and it is always going to be one of my favorites, the acting was great and i don't think they could have gotten a better person other than Tim Curry to play the part as the head transvestite.

Watched the movie version, and had friends who had the soundtrack album lying around so I was subjected to that a number of times.Every aspect of this movie is badly acted, badly sung, badly performed and goes on too LONG. Honestly, the ""great"" songs like Time Warp are not good songs at all. They are over-hyped Broadway ""show tunes"", only not that good. The backing band for all the songs sounds like a high school level garage band.The ""freak"" was never very freaky. The sex was never very sexy.

I know there are a lot of people out there how completely detest this flick, but, when I come across these people, I hold my ground.  This is because, when I first saw the movie, I didn't like it much.  I was a little entertained by the openness toward controversial issues, but felt little else.  However, I came home from work late one night and had an overwhelming urge to see it again. I watched it, studied it, and found that this was one of the best pictures of all times.  But the thing is, the more I watch it, the more I like it. There is just so much under the surface of this movie.For example, the number 7 keeps coming up (# of Transylvanians, cards Frank deals during his schtick at the end) and I don't find it a coincidence that there are the same amount of ""Deadly Sins"".

298,johnsw,Give yourself over to absolute pleasure,9,29 August 2004,"The first time I watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show was a real let-down. This was in 1975, after having had my fill of The Rocky Horror Show in the King's Road Theatre. Goodness knows, I had seen the stage show so many times and knew every nuance of every actor, from Tim Curry and Meatloaf, to Little Nell, and, of course Richard O'Brien himself.As each actor changed (the stage show ran and ran) so did the performances. Little did I know that I was caught up in the making of a cult. We would dine at the trendy Borsch & Tears if we had time before the show, and scoff Donner Kebabs on the way home, often rubbing shoulders with the cast and crew. On the final night in the King's Road, Richard O'Brian threw a party. Johnny Rotten wore his Suzuki Sweater inside out (ooh  the little rebel) and we all had a fine time. Stage props, including the ushers' transparent masks, Rocky's black knickers, suspender belt and stockings, and Dr. Everett Scott's wheelchair all ended up at my house!So what was the problem with the film? Well, nothing, but I guess, at the time, the stage show was so exceptionally good; filled with atmosphere and unexpected interpretation by the cast, that it made the film seem second best! Now when I watch the picture show it brings back the glow of my misspent youth, and the great times we had; Hot patootie, bless my soul! I really love that rock n' roll!The scene is set when Brad Majors, and his fiancée, Janet Weiss (a couple of ordinary college kids) get a flat tyre on a dark, wet, lightening-filled night and go to the nearest house to use the phone.The door of the Gothic Transylvanian-style mansion is answered by Dr. Frank n Furter's butler/handyman  a punk rocker named Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien).On entering the house they are subjected to an internecine night of deceit, and sexual trickery that introduces them both to carnal knowledge  not of each other, but of Dr. Frank n Furter (Tim Curry), the bisexual scientist who is making Rocky ""a man, with blond hair and a tan'.The film cleverly blends references to the American Movie Theater of the late 1930's with sci-fi, monster, horror flicks and musicals! Performances by the maids Little Nell (Columbia) and Patricia Quinn (Magenta) stand up well against the overwhelming presence of Tim Curry. Richard O'Brien (who wrote the play, music and lyrics) brings his own personality to the film.Susan Sarandon (later famed for her superb performance in another cult film, Thelma & Louise) plays excellently as the virgin fiancée who is a little more willing to experiment than her geeky partner Brad (Barry Bostwick). Meatloaf is Eddy  ex delivery boy who is the Geezer from the Freezer, one of Dr. Frank n Furter's failed experiments.There is an uncreditied appearance by Koo Stark, and even Christopher Biggins sneaks into the cast as a Transylvanian!The Rocky Horror Picture is destined to run and run  the 25th anniversary DVD has been released, and in 25 years from now we will all be going out to buy the 50th Anniversary version with 3D and Smell-o-Vision!Maybe not a film to watch with the family, but if you like it, you will want to watch it again and again; if you don't like it, well at least you won't forget it!'It's not easy having a good time!

So what if after watching this film you might consider wearing stockings, make up, do some dancing or maybe do someone, it's all right in transsexual Transylvania.

300,ovidijusburokas,Didn't think it was great but I understand why it's a cult classic,7,7 August 2017,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show is regarded as a cult classic movie. It was directed by Jim Sharman and it stars Tim Curry. The movie has many genres. First of all, you have to call it a musical because it is a platform that this movie relies on. Other than that, you can call it a comedy, drama, romance and some say even a horror movie. I think that has something to do with the fact that the word 'horror' is in the title of the movie. Of course, it has some horror-ish moments but I wouldn't call it a horror movie or even recommend this movie to hardcore horror fans. Although, I think that watching The Rocky Horror Picture Show was very interesting but I have some mixed feelings about it.To begin with, I want to say that I have never seen a movie like this before. That is a plus for the movie because I understand how hard it is to achieve something original in film. Obviously, originality is not always a plus, but in The Rocky Horror Picture Show's case, it has definitely worked in movie's advantage. I believe that this is of the main reasons why this movie has such a cult following.To be honest, I don't really like musicals. In my opinion, they are much more suited for theatre than film. However, this film is one of the examples which can argue against this statement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show has some great tracks which obviously makes the movie better. My favorite song was Don't Dream It, Be It which featured towards the end of the movie. I think it perfectly describes the message of the film.One of the things I did not like was that there was too much music. I understand that this is a musical but one of my favorite scenes in the movie were the ones where the characters didn't sing. For example, the scenes where Dr. Frank is making love with Janet, and later with Brad were very hilarious. Maybe, it is just me but overlong singing scenes in movies often take me out of the film.Anyway, you have to praise The Rocky Horror Picture Show for the things it shows. It is hard to imagine how the movie about transvestite was released in 1975. Even nowadays, you don't see these kinds of things in movies. It is really amazing how 40 years ago Jim Sharman managed to pull off the film like this.All in all, as I said I have mixed feelings about the film. I am not the biggest fan of musicals but this one really deserves the appreciation it gets. It is not my kind of movie but I understand why people love it. I don't hate it either and I had a really interesting time with it. Probably, I won't be revisiting The Rocky Horror Picture Show any time soon but I am glad I have finally seen it because it has been in my watchlist for a very long time.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
301,lonevector2000,"""Dammit Janet, Again!""",10,2 June 2005,"A fun, vigorously entertaining romp that never gets old. Jim Sharman's take on the Richard O'Brien stage play is filled with wonderful, bizarre characters, a memorable score, and splendid set designs by Brian Thomson. Tim Curry contributes one of his most memorable performances as the beloved, outrageous, and ultimately tragic figure 'Dr. Frank'N'Furter', while Pat Quinn, Ritz O'., and the other cast members rise to the occasion, turning in equally stellar work. From Bostwick and Sarandon, to the delectable Little Nell, everyone shines. The score, written by O'Brien, is as relevant a player in the film as the actors are, and is one of the key ingredients to the piece's continued success. It is difficult, now, to refer to, or to even consider this work as a 'cult' hit, or chic phenomenon. It really is too good of a movie and nearly everyone who has access to the home video market has seen it. I only hope that the real triumph of the film, which is it's message, isn't discarded, or eclipsed by it's more apparent offerings of camp dialog, and witty, off-beat humor. The central theme of the film being that there are no real 'freaks' in the clinical sense of the word, that genitalia doesn't necessarily specify gender, and that we are all capable of turning our innermost desires and fantasies into flesh and blood reality. A glorious treat for the senses! As genuinely moving, as it is clever and well-made.

A week after watching it in that cold damp field, I had bought the film, the soundtrack and believe it or not, the T-shirt. It had certainly become my ""favourite obsession"". From the very beginning of the film (Science Fiction/Double Feature)I was enthralled. It was such an amazing song, and the single red lips on the screen were so effective. The credits began to roll over the teeth. First Tim Curry (a fantastic actor, in maybe his best role) followed by other fab actors (in equally fab performances) such as Susan Sarandon, Richard O'Brien, Jonathon Adams, Peter Hinwood and even Meatloaf! How could this not gain my attention? Within the following 1 1/2 hours I was truly taken on a horrific, gender-bending, camp, clever, beautiful yet ridiculous journey of music and mayhem. The songs kept on coming, from the toe-tapping 'Time Warp' to the fantastic 'Sweet Transvestite' to the raunchy 'Toucha Toucha Toucha Touch me' to the glamourous and emotional 'I'm going home'. Of course the film is a cult phenomenon - it gives people the excuse to dress up, sing out loud and have fun. The film is funny, ironic, beautiful and brilliant. It's a p**s take of so many genres and a homage to so many others. The music is great, and the acting is genius. Just to see the likes of Susan Sarandon in suspenders is enough, surely? Well done Richard, you've certainly created something very special here - and folks, if you haven't watched it before, go ahead. If you don't enjoy it - you'll be lying!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
309,LeakyP,Cult Classic!,10,20 April 2021,"Rocky Horror is the absolute definition of a cult classic! ""popular or fashionable among a particular group or section of society."" Rocky Horror has everything, phenomenal acting, brilliant writing that keeps the audience's attention the entire time and a fantastic soundtrack. Truly a film I could watch over and over. Tim Curry excels in the role of Frank N. Furter. On paper, this movie shouldn't work the wacky sci-fi/musical that has it all. Somehow beautifully, this film became a masterpiece in cinema, enchanting an audience continuously. I'd like to mention the stage performance because it feels wrong not to; the stage performance is an entirely immersive experience unlike no other. Let's do the time warp again.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

A newlywed couple, Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) go to meet their old science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams). They take a wrong turn and end up at a castle to see if they can use their phone. They are greeted by Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) one of the servants. He shows them his sister Magenta (Patricia Quinn) and then shocks them by bringing them into a ballroom type convention. It is one of the masters affairs and so there are many Transylvanians there for the conference. Unlike a conference, they end up dancing something called The Time Warp where we are introduced to Columbia (Nell Campbell). Brad and Janet want to leave but are greeted by Dr. Frank'n'furter (Tim Curry). He invites them up to the lab to see his new creation Rocky (Peter Hinwood). While Rocky is being shown off, a freezer door opens revealing Eddie (Meatloaf). Eddie was Frank'n'furter's old ""toy"" so to speak, but is now replaced by Rocky with Frank splitting Eddies brain between the two. Frank murders Eddie and shows Brand and Janet to seperate rooms. Frank tricks Janet into having an affair with him. He also tricks Brad into having an affair with him. Janet gets scared and goes to the lab and has an affair with Rocky. Frank hears a knock at the door and notices it's his rival, Dr. Everett Scott. He also discovers Janet and Rocky and demands to have dinner. Dr. Scott reveals Eddie is his nephew. But then Frank shows they have been eating Eddie all along and freezes them all. He then turns Janet, Brad, Rocky, Dr. Scott and Columbia into stone while Magenta and Riff Raff temporarily disappear. He gets Brad, Janet, Rocky and Columbia ready for a floor show where they sing and dance and Dr. Scott manages to turn himself out of stone. Riff Raff and Magenta come in, sick of Frank using them as slaves, and kill Frank, Rocky and Columbia. Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott escape and then the Narrator (Charles Gray) signs off.Cast 10/10 AMAZING!This cast is the best I have seen in my eleven years of living!Music 10/10 CATCHY!Amazingly catchy songs!Age rating....

""In another dimension, with voyeuristic intentions"".Whilst some describe it merely as a twisted version of Frankenstein, I'd say it's a totally new film concept. It's lack of common sense and morals is replaced with erotism and sexiness. You should understand American sarcasm to live the Rocky Horror experience to its fullest!Irreverent, irrelevant and irrational, this film's voyeuristic intentions will absolutely fascinate anyone who's sick of rubbish Hollywood movies and looking for some good laughs. I strongly recommend you have a lighted joint on each hand, though.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
312,AnotherSideToYou,Are You Tingling With Antici...pation?,10,14 July 2008,"This movie was positively exquisite. I originally watched it with my two closest friends during a sleep over because one of the two said it was the perfect sleep over movie. At first, I was totally apprehensive. I didn't know a thing about the movie, had heard it was relatively stupid, and had been told there was some sort of ""pelvic thrust"" dance which appeared really weird when performed by my friend.I couldn't have been any more wrong. The movie was excellent. I fell in love with it from the start. Brad and Janet made me laugh my head off, Tim Curry made me lick my lips with antici...pation, and Riff Raff and Magenta gave me a taste of one of my favorite love pairings (incest). My friends and I couldn't stop doing the Time Warp dance, and we now have ""Sweet Transvestite"" and ""Time Warp"" on our iPods/MP3 players. You could call us Rocky Horror Picture Junkies.The thing about Rocky Horror is that either you're going to love it or you're going to hate it. There really isn't a gray area. It's just one of those movies. It's a musical, which most people either like or they don't. Lots of yummy transvestites, which can conflict with religion, principles, morals, etc. (which normally I wouldn't care for but in this movie it works). Also, it has a wonderfully sci-fi subplot, and normally people either spring for that stuff or they don't. Like I said, either you love and become a junkie, or you don't and consider it a tremendous waste of your time.In reality, this isn't a good movie for kids or really even pre-teens. Lots of nudity, lots of lewdness.... However, it's excellent if you're a cult fan. I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a golden sense of humor and a love for audience participation and/or songs that get stuck in your head.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

314,madisonhenuset,The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a musical film written by Richard O'Brien that was released in 1975 and is still today recognized as a classic.,10,1 March 2012,"It is the abstract story of a well-balanced newlywed couple that are forced to visit a mysterious castle and persuaded into staying the night. Over the duration of the stay Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) have experiences they would have never thought possible. The film has a variety of colorful songs that provide an explanation of the plot making the movie sometimes difficult to follow, but if watched carefully the story line falls into place. Tim Curry plays the character Frank N Furter who is a transvestite scientist who has obtained the knowledge to recreate a human being. He stepped up his performance considerably for this role, doing a flawless job at entertaining. The film is packed with glamor, madness, and rock n roll attitude, causing it to become a cult favorite and is still played in many interactive theaters.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I thought it campy and corny, with a lot of puns, sight gags and prop humor that was not permitted on TV at the time but not any more clever than a mediocre sitcom or sketch. I was amused, but my wife became obsessed. She and I went to midnight showings more often that I would have preferred. My opinion dropped with each viewing and eventually I just gave up on both the marriage and the film.The screenplay is juvenile, the acting amateurish, and the props are annoying.

Over and over and over. I was about thirteen when the Rocky Horror h it the Roxy on Bloor Street in Toronto. It was a surrealistic experience, (still is more than twenty five years later) with everyone decked out ala Frank'n'furter, Brad & Janet, Rocky Horror (you didn't see too many of those in the winter!), Magenta, etc... all of them. Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, that you can bestow upon anyone;(particularly with this cast of considerable nobodies, four of whom grew into very famous people - I don't know about the rest). Even though and especially since it was outlandish, tacky,harmless, fun, made it all the more memorable. Throwing toast all over a theatre is something you wouldn't ordinarily do ANYWHERE you were, but it was okay to do it at the Roxy. I've seen the movie and heard my CD thousands of times, but it only continues to top my list of favorites. We salute those who hung out at the Frankenstein Place.

The plot revolves around Brad Major and Janet Weiss, who get a flat tire on their way to visit an old friend. They decide to ask if they could use a phone in a nearby castle. They are greeted by Riff- Raff, who tells them, it's a ""Very special occasion"". After some characters are introduced during ""The Time Warp"", Frank N.

Not only a cult classic, but this film shows how diverse and challenging British Culture has always been. Cross dressing, sexual ambiguity, great songs, satire and a helping of Christmas turkey (alongside a electric meat sharpener and a missing delivery boy) who could ask for more. Tim Curry in suspenders could seduce me (female) or a third of the population of straight men in an instance. A morality tale for the truly immoral. A pantomime festival in that great British tradition of Men wearing Frocks.

319,biglebowski7900,Interesting premise and great performances ruined by a messy plot,6,31 August 2016,"I recently watched this on TV, as a lover of cult films i expected a lot from this but i was left disappointed. while I understand why this film has acquired its cult status, its a bit overrated. Its not a bad film, its just not that great. It starts off promising as a recently engaged couple get stranded on a road and seek for help in a castle they passed by, only to find out its full of freaks. The beginning has some really good scenes and also the best songs in the film. It starts going down hill when DR. Franken- Furter unveils his Frankenstein's monster like creation and from there they seem to forget to add some plot in-between songs. The songs from there on are pretty mediocre. there not bad but i only watched the film a couple of days ago and I've forgotten them completely which isn't a good sign.My main issue with this movie is that for what are supposed to be a deeply in love couple they don't have much interaction. In fact from my memory they don't even talk to each other for the last 2/3 of the movie which is ridiculous. They both cheat on each other but there is absolutely no conflict/consequence because of it. Instead of addressing temptation in a relationship the film just acts like it never happened. The characters are also all over the place. They can go from mild mannered to angry for no apparent reason and you cant tell who's side the characters are on. DR. Franken-Furter starts off as the bad guy then becomes the good guy with no context. If the films excuse for that is that the couple has been driven mad then they must have been mentally unstable beforehand because it doesn't take much to push them over the edge. I get its supposed to be a parody but that doesn't excuse bad writing.The biggest redeeming feature of this film are the actors. Tim Curry is amazing as DR. Franken-Furter and the film is worth seeing for his performance alone.Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are also great (and it helps that she is half naked for the majority of the film). The whole cast does a great job. regardless the film is fun and worth a watch even if it is dumb.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

The movie is obviously very fantasy filled but who wouldn't like seeing Tim curry in fishnets? The cast of characters is a nice variety of fun, eccentric types all with good dance moves and voices. Shocking to see Susan Sarandon in her early years and being so risqué. This is by far the best musical and Tim Curry's enthusiasm is contagious. Since my first viewing, i have since seen it at least a dozen times, and will probably see it more. It overall is just a fun sing along, great for any get together. It really gets people excited.

""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is absolutely amazing!Granted, watching the movie as ""just a movie"" will make you hate it. The story doesn't make much sense, most of the characters are almost too far out and several of them are downright annoying. However, what makes this movie so great is the music, the costumes and last, but most certainly not least, Tim Curry. His performance as the transsexual Dr. Frankenstein-wannabe, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, is amazing and hilarious, to say the very least. I've always liked Tim Curry and I must say this is one of his best performances ever.If you can watch this movie and not have ""Time Warp"" and ""Sweet Transvestite"" playing in your head for days afterward, you are simply unable to appreciate good music. I actually managed to learn how to do the Time Warp myself, because I just couldn't help it - I have to do it everytime I hear it!I just wish I could've watched this movie in a theatre and experienced full audience participation, but nevertheless, I had a great time watching it on DVD.So, the final thought: If you like rock n' roll and Tim Curry, if you are not too homophobic and if you have a somewhat bizarre sense of humor, this movie is for you!

So my opinion is based on two very different experiences.What sticks in the mind after those two viewings how great the cast of this movie is. Tim Curry is just plain sexy. And thats very difficult for a hairy guy in high heels. If never much cared for him in any other films but here he is just dead on. The same does apply for the rest of the cast. Susan Sarandon with her big big scared eyes. Riff-Raff and Magenta are excellently played with their exchange of meaningful glances.The tunes are all very catchy, but don't look for a great story or any meaning in it. This is a comedy and a persiflage to all lot of trashy science-fiction and hammer-films.I had to realize that the fact that it's a persiflage can be overlooked by some younger viewers. The friend I took along to the viewing hat never heard of the RHPS and it wasn't until I told her during the break that they it's not a serious approach and that all those goofs and tacky special effects are there deliberately. However I must admit that it's a little bit dated. All the outrageous moments and actions in this movie are mostly not outrageous anymore.

And it didn't help one bit that I shared my dressing table with a friend who is obsessed, let me put it this way, she has ""Time Warp"" on her MySpace.I rented The Rocky Horror Picture Show a few years back because it was one of those cult classics among many of my friends, and I felt as though I should give it a shot; after all, I like horror, I like musicals, I like corsety goodness, and I like Tim Curry. But I didn't like it. Did I tell anyone? Of course not. If you were to even whisper you don't like The Rocky Horror Picture Show within even 50 feet of the Theatre, you would become an outcast before you could say ""Damn it, Janet"".So, while today at the library, I saw it. I sighed as I picked it up and Tim Curry stared back at me in those stockings and guarders while sitting in a pair of blood red lips. Give it another shot, I told myself. And I did.And, guess what...I still hate it. Like the quote says, ""Lost in...meaning"". Yes, that is exactly what The Rocky Horror Picture Show is. It has no meaning whatsoever. Brad and Janet don't even 1. get to a phone, or 2. talk to Dr. Everett Von Scott about whatever it was they had to talk to him about! Somewhere I heard that a musical is difficult to create, because you have to be able to insert songs during moments when talking simply isn't enough, and where it doesn't seem awkward. Most of the time it was just plain awkward. Not to mention, most of the events that happened had no explanation. Um, why was Eddie in a coffin which was the table? Just so we could have that stupidly ""dramatic"" reveal? And what was with the electric knife? Oh, and why were the Transylvanians there in the first place? Some movies I can sit back and not question things like this...but when a movie has nothing to offer but Plan Nine as a musical on crack topped with sparkles and wrapped in velvet, I'm going to wonder.What saves this film is Tim Curry, ""Time Warp"", and and some of its costumes. Tim Curry is one of the best actors who ever lived, and had he not been in the role of Frank, the film would have been lost. ""Time Warp"", while it doesn't make any sense (though what of the movie does?) is a very catchy song, and I actually like it. And hey, I can't resist stockings and guarder straps.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
342,mrpatch,Grab Your Tickets! The Shows About To Begin!,8,2 June 2016,"I watched this movie recently, and I'm sure I'll definitely be watching it again soon.This movie is everything you'd expect it to be; cheesy, hyper, and just over all, fun! Remember that word with this review: fun.The good is extremely good, of course! The plot is twisted, the characters are memorable, and the music numbers are practically contagious the way they make you want to jump up and dance with them.(Just the little touch of having characters dance and NOT be involved with the music number is actually a very nice move!)As much good as there is, there definitely are some bad things about this movie. Some characters (like Brad and Janet!) aren't as well developed as the others. The same goes for a couple of the music numbers; they're GOOD, just not really AS GOOD as the rest. And THAT ENDING! The last 10 to 15 of this movie comes literally out of nowhere. It involves aliens, deaths of the main cast that really didn't need to happen, and no real climax to speak of.But, over all, this movie is definitely something that is a must- watch for anyone! I'd especially recommend this movie as a party movie for friends who haven't seen it yet. And if you've seen this movie already, you'd know it's best to have that party on Valentine's with that certain someone. It'll be filled with laughs and maybe a dance or two!Take care, and we'll be ready to welcome you to the fandom any time soon!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
343,rhorrorp54,Something in there for everyone....,10,19 August 2008,"For a movie that's 33 years old, it's still being talked about. Which is still quite good for a movie that was branded a failure upon it's release. But I believe it was the midnight screenings that help make the movie what it is today(and a HUGE thank you to Sal. For all you fans, if y'all don't know about Sal, you are not a fan). While not everyone is aware of what goes on in movie theaters on a Saturday night, there is always at least one Rocky fan in the crowd. But let's shift it towards the film itself. The story is pretty simple. A happy go lucky couple get stuck in the middle of nowhere and find shelter in a environment that is different from their own. Soon they are wrapped up in this world and can't help but shed their former skins and give in to absolute pleasure. At the end of the film, they find themselves not knowing what happened or what to do or where to go(and it was genius of Richard O'Brien to leave it at that). Now it seems normal to toss rice, do the pelvic thrust and to deal cards for sorrow and cards of pain but when watching the film in the privacy of your own home, you realize that the film itself is quite innocent and that although we root for Frank and his crew, we also feel just as innocent as Brad and Janet themselves. Over the years it has shifted a way that films are seen. Any Rocky fan today can't help but go to a regular movie and wanting to shout at the screen, but unlike Rocky, we know that if we yell(often and loudly) we will get tossed out. But enough about my comments, it's time to slip into something less vulnerable and kick on a pair of stilettos and do the time warp. But all of this has me wondering, ""whatever happened to Saturday Night?"" (My screen name should tell you how much of a fan I am, as sad as that is.)",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Rocky Horror is truly made to be enjoyed with the screaming, and throwing, and dirty comments, as strange as that might sound to most movie-goers. Being rowdy is encouraged, and should be. Sal Piro is among many of those who've helped make this cult-classic a phenomenon. The songs are catchy, including Hot Patootie (which according to Richard O'Brien, only Meatloaf was able to sing at proper speed). The movie is about two recently graduated high-schoolers who after attending a friend's wedding get lost during a wrong turn and end up broke down by a castle.

352,SantyClz-2,The ultimate audience participation movie,9,1 January 2001,"""Let there be lips.""There are two, completely different, versions of _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_.  One is the movie that you will see if you watch RHPS at home, the other is the event you will witness (or participate in) if you see it in a theater.If you have never seen RHPS before and see it at a theater, expect to miss much of the dialog.  There are two reasons for this. One is that in many cases, noise from the audience will obscure or obliterate the sound from the film.  The other reason is that sometimes you may be paying so much attention to other goings-on in the theater that you ignore the movie.In order to avoid spoiling the experience for first time attendees, I won't go into any details of what may or may not occur, except that before the movie begins, there may be a call for ""virgins"" from the audience.  This refers only to whether or not you have attended an appropriate showing of RHPS before -- there are *no* other connotations.  If you have not attended one before, step up smartly when the call is made.I rated this movie as a 9 (a 10 would be the best movie ever made) for the theatrical version, as a video watched at home it is only about a 5.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

BUT the songs stuck in my head, I rented the video and watched it with two mates, we learnt the songs off by heart, and drove everyone we knew up the wall!I think this film IS a modern classic - it's fun, it's cheesy, it sets your fingers tappin' your feet a-dancin', and gets you humming 24/7. You shouldn't't take it seriously on ANY level; it's a blatant parody of 50's B-movies, with awful dialogue, wooden acting, wobbly sets... *sighs*... wonderful!Tim Curry in full drag is probably the sexiest sight ever on screen, and the movie, IMHO, is actually more erotic by implying sex than the blatant warts-and-all approach we are given in most adult films these days.This is a film to watch with friends, preferably nutty ones, and just have fun.

365,hammerbill,My Least Favorite Movie,1,4 May 2010,A cult flick with a huge following-hard to explain at first then easier to explain as one sees the following. I've never been a big fan of campy humor anyway but this one is too near the camp outhouse. It stinks. In the late 80's it came onto the scene as the rousing battle cry of sexual deviants and deviant wannabes as well. Once cult bound drones got caught up in the catchy hook filled musical selections even Dr Demento became obsolete for promotional fodder. Perhaps the biggest problem of this movie is the difficulty in avoiding it. However even nasty substances eventually rot and turn to compost. Any bad movie over time either gets easier to avoid or gets smothered with pungent doses of the affects of nostalgia. Just imagine this one without music. There would be no entertainment value at all. On the other hand the soundtrack without the movie would be somewhat a relief.,The Rocky Horror Picture Show

It saddens me to hear young adults talking about the movie being excellent. It would seem that weekly Rocky-goers from the 80s and 90s grew up, got married, and had kids. They felt the urge; the need to share Rocky with the kids. So this generation grew up seeing Rocky at home (how awful). Obviously their parents forgot to mention the only way to see it is with a live cast. Rocky bombed at the theatres initially. Of course, I will admit it made any appearance of Tim Curry in other films, utterly hilarious. But, always a fan, and as I spent more than three years as Brad in our local cast, I give Rocky Horror its well deserved 10 out of 10. This rating is wholly weighted on entertainment value with a talented live cast. So do your part. Find a Rocky virgin and get him or her to a theatre as soon as possible.

I've never seen the stage show or done the dancing or dressing up but I'd never argue with anyone who said that it was one of the best musical movie experiences ever.I'm sure it is not as jaw dropping for audiences now as it was back then, but every time I've seen it over the last 30 years it has left me with a smile on my face a tune bouncing around inside my head.
In it's day it was fun, shocking, exciting and innovative. Today it still has an edge that I guess makes some people uneasy. Some guys just can't handle finding Tim Curry ever so slightly appealing when he first appears in the lift.

OK, we get it, the guy is a transvestite. We don't need a four minute song illustrating that. And sure, a transvestite accomplishes the task of ""being weird"", but it does so in the same way that ""riding horses on the beach"" accomplishes romanticism. It's cliché, boring, and obvious. Complete the ""clichéd weirdness"" of transvestites with the laborious ""trifecta"" of aliens and vampires and you are left with a five minute ""hilariously random"" YouTube skit; draw it out for an hour and a half and you get Rocky Horror Picture Show, a movie I found boring.You might be a fan of this film because you find it ""charming"", however, I prefer the more psychological reason: because you like to buy in to peer-pressured cult followings where you disregard every shortcoming of the film just so you can think of your self as elitist and can pride yourself on being part of the in-group.

So basically, there's these two kids, Brad and Janet, who decide to get married. On a trip to see the professor in whose class they met, their car breaks down and they stumble onto a spooky castle. They go in, hoping to use the phone and leave peacefully. NO SUCH LUCK. They meet the diabolical transvestite, Dr. Frank N. Furter, who forces them to explore their deepest, darkest desires. I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for something unlike anything they've ever experienced. It's a great spoof of campy horror movies with some messages about sexuality and stuff... dissect and enjoy, and do the Time Warp gleefully with the scary actors...",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

This bizarre cult favorite is one of the best movies I have ever seen (and I have seen MANY movies). My other favs include anything with Cary Grant, Gene Kelly, The Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin & other classics. Anyway, RHPS is still popular in this generation and continues to play weekly in many theaters (usually at midnight). Fans often attend viewings dressed as characters from the film and respond ritualistically to certain events by throwing food, using props, yelling jokes, dancing, and cheering. This movie has a lot of memorable songs and moments. IF YOU Haven't SEEN IT, SEE IT. YOU MUST GIVE YOURSELF OVER TO THIS ABSOLUTE PLEASURE!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

The songs are great. Still, the movie by itself would not be very appealing to many people, especially those who watch it for the first time if they do it at home. 99% of the fun is in theatrical screenings (Yes, this movie has never been pulled out of theatrical run) - You get hardcore fans yelling what is known as audience participation lines at the screen, combining them with the movie lines to make fun of the characters, plot or even real-life stuff like celebs and current events (note: these lines are usually very explicit!). In most cases you also get a shadow-cast of live actors performing in front of the screen, who may be very screen accurate or very creative (can also be explicit). If you feel brave enough you can also join the shadow casts and go on stage yourself.My recommendation - it's generally worth watching only in theaters with a shadow cast or at least hardcore fans for audience participation. The only reason to watch this at home is if you've never seen the movie, so when you do go to the theater you won't have to have your eyes on the screen the whole time (remember though that the movie is only 1% of what you get in the theater, so even if you find it boring still go and see it in the theater). The only other reason to watch this at home is if you're a shadow-cast member and want to practice your part.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

I think not much people around the world can imagine that movie can be like think before this movie, but it appeared, like a super nova. It's strange and cult. If you like cult movie you may thought it's such a awesome movie like me but if you don't, you might think it sucks, it's awful. Maybe that's one of the character of cult movie, similar with art, perhaps only less people can really understand it and feel the feeling and that part of people become followers of these kind of art.Although the actor and the director in this movie are not that famous but they also did a very good job. Especially the acting of Tim Curry. Tim act Dr.x in the movie which become one of my favorite movie characters. He did a very awesome job from the acting of Dr.X to the singing and motion, even the clothes so that he create such a successful psycho.The music of this movie is great too.

I disagree. The performances, the music, the costumes, and the dead-on parodies of various horror/sci fi movie clichés are perfectly enjoyable on their own...but, of course, the film lends itself to collective experience in a way none others have before, or since.All the performers seem to have a sixth sense about how to play their roles - no small feat considering the rather offbeat material - but for me, it's all about Tim Curry. With the wrong actor playing Frank, the film would have crashed and burned (actually, with the wrong actor playing Frank, the original play would never have had a life past its initial run in London's Theatre Upstairs). He became a true film icon with this role, and it's easy to understand why. His performance is a delicate balancing act - feminine flounce with masculine power; outrageous but always controlled. His Frank is gorgeous and unbelievably sexy, with a voice from the gods - both speaking and singing.I think it's time to do the Time Warp again...",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

To start, it had a weak plot from the beginning with some of the most basic, bland main characters I've ever seen. Once you figure who the main characters are, we learn how unfocused this movie is. It never knows where it wants to go and is constantly getting too far from the story. We also see some ridiculous costumes that you would expect more out of a porno than a 7/10 star movie. One of the only redeeming qualities is Tim Curry. He was one of the only actors I know of that could pull of such an over the top role. Was he over-dramatic sometimes? Yes but that was what this role needed. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is an overrated, over the top movie with an unfocused plot and barely any redeeming qualities. This movie deserves a 3/10 rating.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

The movie starts out, which what seems to be a completely different movie. It seems like almost an hour before we see Tim Curry. The the movie continues with Susan Surranden in he bra, and the guy in his underpants. Then it starts on a weird, acid like trip, to a tribute to Frankenstien. This is where they make Rocky. Then the movie takes another twist, it turns out they're are all sex fiends. The movie seems to go down hill from here. And apparently it's a very long hill to the bottom. The movie is overlong, and very bizarre. Some cool things I found were the sets that were very stage like, so it was like the musical. And the bizarreness is sometimes very funny. Also Tim Curry is great This movie is definitely a colt movie. I know that a lot of people love this movie, but I just can't see what's the ""hubub.""

I know people went to see it in movie theaters late at night and acted it out while the action on screen played. I knew it was a little strange. I had no idea though. If you watch it once you can forget it. You have to see it multiple times to really get into it. It's not for the squeamish or those who like chick-slicks. For get it. This is hardcore camp and ironic fun. I love SciFi and music so I love the blend of the old fashioned science fiction with the old musical style soundtrack. You can listen to the soundtrack first and then watch the movie to enjoy it better. Also what can I say, it was the seventies and could only have come from the punk, alternative, dark, depression that overcame America at the time. Tim Curry is fantastic as Dr. Frank-N-Furter and Susan Surandon looks pretty hot in this roll. Barry Boswick was brilliantly understated and confused. Loved it all. Although it's campy I found it to be very layered as well with the sexuality, lyrics and madness. It was a movie that didn't take itself too seriously because it was all for fun but at the same time said something about the time it was made. Also who can forget Meatloaf on a Motorcycle! It's horror, it's science fiction, it's a love story, it's a social commentary, it's a musical! It's cult!

391,dinkaxd,The Rocky Horror Picture Show is Wacky and Silly.,10,6 February 2018,"Now I want to talk about the longest-running movie in the world 'Rocky Horror picture Show'. It is based on the worldwide popular musical. The story centers on a young couple and the inhabitats of a strange castle, reighed by the charismatic Dr.Frank-n-Furter and played by the famous Tim Currey. The film is directed by Jim Sharman and the film tells the story of wierdness and glam, love and murder, fake blood and mascara. Ok, ok I know you did not understand.
 The film begins as a couple enters a strange-looking castle with schizophrenical inhabitants. At first glance, the freaks are friendly and cute, but they are keeping a terrible misery quiet created by Dr.Frank-n-Furter, a sweet transvestite from the Transsexual planet in galactic Transylvania (as he calls himself). But can the human beings kill him and free all the freaks?
 For many fans,the best thing about ROCKY is the music and songs. I do not fully agree. I think that the lyrics are a bit stupid. 
 On the other hand , I found a character who does not run in front on your eyes, but goes straight to your heart - Colombia, the servant of Dr.Frank-n-Furter, a beautiful young girl with red hair, make-up and a broken heart. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes musicals and glam.

For me, it was a chance to live, to breathe free, as anything went; there was no need to conform to any narrow minded conventions, as I felt I had to  survive at home.  The first time I witnessed Tim Curry flinging open his cape, proudly proclaiming ""I'm just a sweet transvestite, from Transsexual Transylvania,"" I knew I'd found a place to be myself.  Even now, some 18 years later, that sight still gives me a thrill.  Sure, the plot is ridiculous (on second thought, it had more to offer than 80 percent of the crap coming out of Hollywood then and now) and it is loaded with technical flaws.  Still, I consider it the greatest film of all time. How many films draw a crowd of regulars weekly, create a sense of community, especially for people who, more than likely, felt as if they were not a part of any community, as I felt?  Over the years, I've seen the film 64 times, and when I'm 80 I plan on getting up on my arthritic legs and doing the ""Time Warp.""",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Three events for the price of one - the movie, the entertainers, the audience - and one single rule, everything that happens in the film is to happen in the room. My advice : go and see it, no matter where you are, but avoid New York - the entertainers don't involve the audience enough to make it real fun.

Richard was good in the role but I do not personally like the way he plays Riff Raff as it is rather dull. Raynor Burton is abysmal in the role of Rocky Horror, he didn't even sing his own songs and did not speak either. A good yet brief appearance from Meatloaf as Eddie too.

What makes this a perfect example of cult film, because the audience doesn't care how bad it's made or how poor the quality of the set, but they love how much fun you can have when watching it. How much you can get into everything that happens in it.I truly hate how people think that just because it's poorly made and quite random at times means that it's the worst movie ever made. A lot of people don't care about the quality. Otherwise, we wouldn't even have cult films (mostly because 95% of them are badly made) and we'd just be stuck with all serious movies.I give this movie a 7, because it's not fantastic, nor bad, nor completely awful, or even okay.

They were driving to see their friend, Dr. Scott when they get a flat tire on the way. Since they saw a castle on the way, they get out of their car and go to see if they can use their phone. Turns out that when they get there, there's a festival for Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a transsexual mad scientist, going on. He's created a man named Rocky and that was the night when he was to be completed. Brad and Janet stay at the castle overnight and are forced into exploring their own sexualities without even really knowing it. What goes on in the castle over their period of time?

It's about not waisting the opportunities of the present, and trying to live as fully as possible. It has a diverse cast, witty lines, fantastic music, and a fabulous spirit. The last line of the movie is one that will stay with me forever. I won't spoil it, but it is an incredible line.

Great Curry (I sow a lot of his movies, but none part as good as this) great O'Brien, not sure if his mad or beautifully mad, not to mention Bostwick and Sarandon.

The actors created a different world, they really became there characters and they were outstanding. Personally, I could watch this movie over and over again. I am only thirteen years old and i loved this movie but people of all ages could also love RHSP, even though it has some sexual moments. The Songs are catchy and you will soon be singing the songs over and over in your head, whether your driving to work or your sitting in a classroom. RHSP is loved by so many people and i don't think any other musical such movie could be as outstanding as this movie could.

The movie never gets old. Several reasons to love Rocky Horror Picture Show:-catchy songs -hot guys -wonderful acting -all out FUN!!!!To be honest with you, the real reason i wanted to see the movie once again, was for Tim Curry. He is absolutely amazing. You know from the beginning that he is the villain, yet you love him.With the Voice, the wildness, and the 6 in. heels, he is one of a kind.

At the same time, though, it is entertaining and amusing. You have to take into account that it was written by Richard O'Brien as a play, which took off in London long before it was filmed. When one just looks at the film itself and its plot, it is ridiculous. What makes it fun is the aura surrounding it. I must say that the only times I have seen it (which I can't count on both hands), there has been a second cast present, of local young adults performing along with the film. This increases audience participation and makes the experience worthwhile. Besides, I really enjoyed seeing Tim Curry running around in a teddy and high heels.

Tim Curry makes, what must be, his best part ever and Richard O'Brian has to get a BIG thank you for the writing of the script and the songs.It is a very bold movie for it's time with a lot of jokes about sex for example.

438,cjbartrip,Unexpectedly Genius (Must Watch),10,23 June 2009,"On paper The Rocky Horror Picture Show had everything that would suggest a poor movie. Small actors (Susan Sarandon became the massive A-lister after), low budget, niche target audience and what was then a crazy concept, a musical parody of 50's and 60's b-movies and horror films that didn't take itself seriously. This is quickly establish in the opening credits, featuring a dark background with blood red credits along with the track Science Fiction/Double Feature (which is reminiscent of the main theme from Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, suggesting TRHPS may have struck a chord with horror fans worldwide). Going into the film all I wanted to do was dislike it, expecting it to be a tacky, camp musical thats just agonising to watch. Sadly (or not on the other hand) this was not the case. All the factors for which it could be disliked blend together beautifully to create a masterpiece. Its hard not to sing-a-long (even if it is in your head, as in my case) to such upbeat perfect songs such as ""The Time Warp"" and ""Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me"" and Meat Loaf's ""Hot Patootie"". Throughout the film, you'll struggle to conceive what is going on and by the time Dr.Scott comes, along with the ending the film goes beyond silly. But that just makes you love the film even more, particularly the scene where Dr.Scott's wheelchair becomes attracted to a magnet operated by Frank N Furter(A rather convenient name, as its a phallic object and pokes fun at his androgynous look) and goes all around the house including Magenta in a bath tub twice, as she fails to bat an eyelid, furthering the comedy of the film. After the camp and kitsch ending where Riff-Raff kills Colombia and Frank N Furter with what is quite clearly a TV Ariel, you cant help but feel that the film was silly and ridiculous but also a comedy and masterpiece. For this reason, I'm going to have to agree that the film is worthy of it's cult classic status and is also quite possibly the greatest musical film ever (In my opinion Phantom Of The Opera (2004) and Mamma Mia are 2nd and 3rd respectively). This really is one film you have to see, its more than just a film, it's an experience!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
439,enalkariel,Delightful Cult Classic.,10,10 February 2004,"Richard O'Brien's 1975 ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is a delightful cult classic involving a couple in love, a man (well, this is arguable) and his creation, and a swarm of transvestites.  The story of Rocky Horror began on a stage in London, and has now evolved into a cult classic delighting audiences of a certain sort all over the world.  In this colorful musical comedy, the audience witnesses the adventures of the naive Brad and Janet as they spend the night in a castle due to some unfortunate circumstances. Dr. Frank-N-Furter is the head of the house, and his word goes.  Supported by an assortment of domestic staff, such as Magenta, Columbia, and Riff-Raff, Frank toys with Brad and Janet, sending them on a wild ride they never dreamed of riding.  The question is, will they make it through?
The great Barry Bostwick plays the character of Brad Major well, if a bit one-dimensional at times.  Bostwick does an acceptable job of playing the part of the young, headstrong, in-love hero.  He believes he can do anything, but usually ends up doing just the opposite.  Susan Sarandon is delightful as Janet Weiss, newly engaged to Brad.  She is a gem to watch as this charming, naive girl discovering things she never thought possible. Tim Curry is simply wonderful as the eccentric and outrageous Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a character dead set on song, sin, and sex.   A supporting cast including O'Brien as Riff-Raff, Patricia Quinn as Magenta, and Little Nell as Columbia, plus Jonathan Adams as Dr. Scott and Peter Hinwood as the title Rocky round out a magnificent group of actors.  There's also an unforgettable appearance by music legend Meatloaf, which you'll want to see.
One important thing to keep in mind while attending a viewing of RHPS is a suspension of disbelief.  Often, things will not make sense, and the movie will seem like a load of garbage.  Do not leave without seeing the entire thing; it will make more sense in the end.  However, one viewing is not nearly enough to understand all the nuances of Rocky Horror.  It is advisable to attend at least the first show with a RHPS veteran, as this person will be able to explain what the heck is going on.
Technically speaking, this film is no ""Star Wars,"" but it's definitely tries it's darndest.  The sets are large and colorful, well lit, and suit their purpose.  The sound, at times, appears random and not quite right, but it works here.  Any oddness in it only adds to the individuality this movie holds.  The special effects are a bit sketchy, but hey, it was 1975.  This movie is not meant to be taken seriously; it's meant to entertain.  RHPS's costumes are most enjoyable.  Each character has an average of two distinct costumes worn throughout the movie, ranging from suits to pajamas to underclothes.  Rocky Horror enthusiasts and Halloween celebrators alike have copied these costumes time and time again since the movie came out.   In fact, it's tradition for theatergoers to dress up like their favorite character when attending RHPS in theatres.In addition to dressing up as characters, participating with the movie is one of the main reasons Rocky Horror as survived as long as it has.  In theatres, it is standard practice for the audience to shout obscenities at the screen, get up and dance, and throw objects all over the place.  For many people, this is the best part of the movie.  Regardless, clean-up is not a desirable job after a showing of RHPS.  For the rest of the public, Rocky Horror is definitely worth the few bucks it costs to get in.  If the theatre has audience participation kits available, by all means, get one. It may feel a bit foolish at first to wear a newspaper over your head, but over time the oddness leaves.Rocky Horror is not for everyone.  Children, the elderly, and the more conservative types will probably not enjoy this film.  As for everyone else, it's bound to be an experience to remember.  Peppered with memorable songs, imaginative costumes and set, and containing more twists than you can count on one hand, The Rocky Horror Show is not a film to miss.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

First saw it at three in the morning as part of an all-nighter, and even given the late hour was left feeling totally cold and very confused.Saw it again with an audience who were familiar with the movie, and loved it to bits. The plot, far from being confusing, is a cross between innocents-in-peril and Frankenstein. Performances are larger than life, and songs perfectly acceptable in a warped way. Tim Curry is priceless, chewing up the scenery to great affect, and I still have a crush on Susan Sarandon's Janet.The audience participation makes a viewing more of a social occasion than any other movie, and can be a bit challenging for those expecting a normal passive viewing - I advise you to go with the flow, and, as Frank'n'furter says, ""Give yourself over to absolute pleasure"".",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
455,d372sp,A hard one to rate...,10,23 April 2006,"This movie is a hard one to vote on. I wasn't sure if I should rate it on it's own, or based on how I had seen it for the first 387 times. Had I seen this movie without the benefit of audience partici-(insert lengthy pause here)pation, I might not have given it more than a three or four, because even as a spoof of the genre it's kinda off the mark. It has all the necessary ingredients: young couple in love, stormy night, car trouble, creepy castle with eccentric host etc., but some things sailed over my head. With the audience in a theater though, it's an experience not to be missed (watching it at home yelling the lines at your TV just isn't the same). Don't rent it, go with friends and find a movie theater that shows it at midnight, and brace yourself!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
456,frankbc,A film like your favourite jacket!,10,12 February 2011,"This film, is like love, the song that gives you goose bumps or your favourite jacket. You don't need anyone to agree or accept it. It's there for you, and the other(s) who understand it - without intellectual reasoning, without analysis.It's like why you became a punk or go of to the grassy hill near the rubbish dump to wait for the sky to become turquoise and the sun to set slowly.(the following is added to fulfill the minimum line criteria of IMDb)In effect the Rocky Horror Picture Show melds burlesque, Sci-Fi B-movies, ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""I am a Camera"" into . . . well, . . . something new. Something youth culture of the mid-70's would subconsciously understand and appropriate. OK, it's a bit softer than punk, but something the later punk and fetish generation of the late 70's and 80's embodied. Directed between a decade of the outright drugs and peace perspective (i.e. Easy Rider), near the ominous bleakness of post-Vietnam madness (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest), and before the hedonistic and ominous, but brilliant ""Blue Velvet"", the Rocky Horror Picture Show is a true Goth Film - not meant to be understood by everyone, therefore remaining ominous and threatening to the establishment, but, nevertheless, nothing but emotional.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

So I guess I can say - ""I really love that rock'n'roll""!!!!!! The movie may be inappropriate for some viewers but it is still a one of a kind classic film. I never liked musicals until this movie and now I love lot's of musicals like Les Miserables and many other musicals. My favorite character is Frank-N- Furter.

When I was 15 and watched it again I realized that there was in fact nothing to understand. There were no deep thoughts involved with this movie. This movie often leaves one questioning what in fact they are actually watching, and that is the beauty of it. It is a fun, dark comedy which thrives on sexuality and music. I now watch this movie and wish I could be a part of it. The humor is wonderful. The characters are memorable, especially Tim Curry as the transsexual Dr. Frank N Furter. The music is the kind that gets stuck in ones head. It is a cult classic and after nearly thirty years of being on screen it is still going strong.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

The two sidekicks, Rif Raf and Magenta steal the show and makes the film so enjoyable...SPOILER!!!

It's one of those movies that never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. Tim Curry puts on an amazing show and I think that's probably what makes this film so exceptional. I love the eccentricity and the aura of the film, and the script is quite good. One thing I've always found very memorable is when they're at the table and Frank N Furter pulls off the table cloth and Eddie's body is all pulled apart underneath, and he's wearing his heart on his sleeve. A truly fantastic modern(ish) Frankenstein story. However, I wish that Rocky had more lines and sang more songs, as his performance on ""The Sword Of Damocles"" is very good, but I also think the movie wouldn't be nearly as good if anything was different. I would recommend this movie to everyone. You can sing to it, dance to it, cry to it and laugh to it.

You don't get Tim Curry in the (sigh) flesh, but even on celluloid, he's raw sex, whether you're male, female, gay, or straight. I've probably seen the movie 50 or more times and it doesn't get old (for me, anyway). Sure, the midnight shows are a blast, but if you actually want to see the movie,rent the DVD. Rocky rocks. Brevity may be the soul of wit for the Bard (thank you, Hamlet), but it isn't the soul of IMDb, which wants me to write ten lines even if I can get my point across in eight.

But to really appreciate it you need to see it live at a midnight show with lots of other veteran Rocky Horror Fans. To really appreciate this movie you need the audience interaction that you can only get with fans who have scene this movie 50-100 times and know what to do and when to do it. Too bad they don't really allow the audience participation they had when I first saw this in the 70s.When I first saw it was at midnight shows and the key to really enjoying it was the audience participation where they act out whole parts of the movie, throw stuff at the screen, and have lots of the movie lines memorized.

The moment I heard about this movie I fell in love, and the best part is my family made it a huge affair, we all watched it together. Everything from creating a lead character that is comfortable not only in his sexuality, but his skin. The quirkiness of the lead couple, Brad and Janet, contributes to the overall atmosphere of the movie. The tiny squabbles and the antics of sexual affairs between the couple, the transvestite, and the creature. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie, I hope it maintains its popularity, and continues to be loved by all who watch it! The campiness of the movie gives insight to the time in which it was created, and how it has developed into a cult classic.

From the moment the iconic singing lips come onto the screen, you know this movie is going to be out of the ordinary. All the actors give shining performances, but legendary actor Tim Curry steals the show as the charismatic scientist Dr. Frank N Furter. No remake or redo will ever do it justice.

You need a sense of humor to enjoy, I would say, and must have an open mind.Back in the 70s I used to see this film almost every weekend with my buddies. It was a blast! The audience participation is so energetic! Dressing up was also something I loved doing (I'd dress as Magenta!) The film is hilarious and the lines delivered are priceless. Kudos to Richard O'Brien for writing such a good script! And the actors were simply amazing!! A first role for many of the stars. Tim Curry stands out as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, 'the sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania', a role he will always be famous and remembered for. He is so hilarious, delivers his lines perfectly and, if I do say so myself, he is quite magnetizing! Susan Sarandon performs great as Janet Weiss and has a very nice singing voice. Barry Bostwick's character, Brad, is simply lovable! Patricia Quinn and Little Nell are 2 beautiful women playing 2 beautiful characters who are also very entertaining! Charles Gray and Jonathan Adams are also a great addition to the film.Another major plus of this film is the singing and the dancing! Catchy songs and thrilling dance numbers drew me to this film the most!

Most of the characters are drawn as sharply as if a straight razor...well, not straight...as if a razor had been used. Not intended for the super straight part of our culture, which is why it usually plays at midnight shows, but you'll notice that it's been playing steadily for 30 years now, especially along the American coasts, which is a better record that almost anything else you can think of (excluding Gome With The Wind in Atlanta, a single town). I even took my mother to one of the 15 or so theater viewings I've attended.

473,voluptuousfire,"hot patootie, bless my soul, i really love that rock and roll.",10,25 December 2005,"ah, possibly my most favorite film of all time. like others have said, you either get this film, or you don't. and the key is to suspend disbelief. this is not a film for the overly logical. its full of little blunders, intentional or not. the film has an energy unlike any other films i have seen. i reckon the devotion rocky horror inspires is due to that it offers a way for people who are a bit left of center to really come out and just be decadent and sexual for a night. in this day and age especially, such nights are few and far between. it creates an environment for those who want to sing and dance and to genderbend without reproach. they can put their masks or makeup on and do the time warp into the night. this film is just a fun, freakish romp through 50s B horror and sci fi films with a rock and roll edge. imo, rocky horror is what rock and roll is supposed to be: shocking to your parents and rebells against the uptight squares. i adore this film because frankly, it makes me happy. it gives me a sense of confidence i wouldn't otherwise have. the songs are amazing, and i really enjoy the cheekiness of the entire film. its definitely NOT a film they could have made in the states. it would have been weird and sort of awkward.this film came out 4 years before i was born. i actually hated it when i saw it as a teenager at a friends house. i didn't understand it. i ended up seeing it again around halloween about 6 years ago when i first got cable, it just clicked. this film just makes me really happy in a way a lot of things don't. the music is solid, the acting is sublime, and its just pure campy fun. i like both seeing it in the theatre with the cast and at home on my own. so just hitch up your fishnets, put on your heels, and dance to the dark refrain that is rocky horror picture show.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show

Like I said this movie is brilliant. It is smooth and never loses it's momentum. This film is based on the stage show in England and Tim Curry did play in it. So, you can say that The Rocky Horror Picture Show is what started Curry's career as a comedic actor. Unfortunately, the only time you hear from him is on cartoons.

477,irv0735,Rocky Horror sucks,1,13 February 2006,"The movie in general sucks, as it has no story line and has terrible acting. The movie was then made into something that has potential, when people started coming up with the lines, to interject into the movie. These lines make it a lot funnier, and make it into a huge joke. The problem is, some people don't realize it is a joke and they go every other weekend to see it in a theater. That wouldn't be a problem by itself, but the problem exists when they are dressed like transvestites from the movie, and make it into a cult get-to-gether. These people have taken it way too far, and have made this movie, sick and wrong. I strongly recommend never seeing this movie, as watching it by yourself makes you a transvestite, as you watched it purely for the movie itself, and going to see it in the theater on the weekends, has become a cult meeting place.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
478,davendeb-1,A Cinema Classic,10,19 October 2006,"I first saw ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in 1976, shortly after it's release. It was shown as a double feature along with the movie ""The Ritz"" with Rita Moreno. There were only about 10 people in the audience and no audience participation. I was so shocked and impressed that I convinced some friends to go see it with me the following weekend. There were about 30 people there that weekend. My friends were so impressed that we came back with a larger group the next night. That night there were about 50 people in the crowd, many of them, like myself, had seen the film several times or more. Gradually the audience size and participation level grew. I feel privileged to have seen it grow with each time I saw the film. I saw the movie about 35 times before the audience participation became extreme and annoying to me. Now it is virtually impossible to see the film at a theater as I first did, without any distractions or interference from the crowd, and that's a shame because the movie and music are very well written and show best on the big screen. To many the participation is what makes the movie fun, but this flick stands very well on it's own. I consider it to be a cinema classic!",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
479,jml-89481,Very Entertianing- for older audiences,8,20 February 2019,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a film where the 2 heroes, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, are planning to get married after their friends' wedding. They choose to visit an old friend, going for a drive in a storm. However, they soon get a flat tire, and with no spare, are forced to walk to an eerie castle they saw a few miles back. But they find themselves to be whisked away in a lust-filled, scandalous mansion with a crazy scientist and his friends. But the scientist and his friends don't really have morals, nor do they seem human. I really enjoyed this movie for the character development, the acting, and how the different plot line from other movies.
The ""hero"" characters in the film are Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, fiancés. In the beginning, they seem well made for each other through songs like ""Dammit, Janet,"" where Brad proposes to Janet, and ""There's a light,"" where they journey to the movie's ""villain's"" castle. Both Brad and Janet are virgins, and were planning to give each their first, but plans change. Neither of them are able to resist temptation, and let themselves go. I liked this because most ""hero"" characters are usually good, and stay good even through a trying time. However, Brad and Janet show the audiences that they are being swept away by the ""villain"" and his loose morals, and was only ""saved"" when they were released by the villain's servants. The ""villain"" in this story is Dr. Frank N. Furter, whose main goal is to create the perfect lover for himself (well, more like a sex toy) and is from a planet called Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania where he mentions in an earlier song. He is a jealous murderer and loose-moral man who loves to have some loving. He is able to create his perfect toy, named Rocky, seduce both Brad and Janet, kill his former delivery boy, serve people said boy's remains, and yet was able to be seen as a victim in the end when he is killed by his servants, Riff Raff and Magenta. Riff Raff and Magenta are siblings, and they are also from Transsexual, Transylvania, and at first seem like able, until they kill Frank because they want to go home. A fan of Frank is Columbia, who was Frank's lover, but was pushed aside and she begins to love someone else. I didn't personally like Columbia as much as the other characters because of her high and squeaky voice, and how she could be annoying by being extra needy. However, that shows how well the actors performed, making the audience switch sides on who the heroes and villains are.
Tim Curry portrays Dr. Frank N. Furter, and goes through most of the movie in a corset, stockings, heavy makeup, and heels. He also sings numerous times, and has intimate scenes with the other actors. However, Curry also has numerous songs to sing, and he is able to pull off each song convincingly, and even has to strut and run around in heels, a corset, and stockings. He also has to wear layers of makeup that had to be reapplied, but Curry still pulled off everything and made Frank to no longer be the villain by the end of the movie. Susan Sarandon portrays Janet Weiss, someone who dramatically changes by the end of the movie. Sarandon has an amazing voice and acting that shows how Janet became seduced in the castle through her songs. Barry Bostwick did an amazing job at playing Brad Majors, especially towards the end when Brad is still trying to not give in into the lust, but his voice and body say something different. Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn plays Riff Raff and Magenta, and they were a great duo. They made you feel sympathy for the servants, but as the movie goes on you start to see them as the real antagonists. Nell Campbell plays Columbia, someone in my opinion is very annoying. Columbia has a very high voice, and Campbell could hit those high notes, tap dance, and still stay in character throughout the whole movie with a very squeaky voice. Lastly, Peter Hinwood plays Rocky Horror, the creation. Hinwood has to play a character whose only reason he is alive is to be Frank's play thing, so Hinwood is in golden spandex throughout most of the movie and can only grunt to really show what he is feeling. Hinwood did a great job, using different tones and facial expressions to show how Rocky was feeling.
The plot line was pretty unexpected at most. There are numerous songs throughout the movie, many sex and sexual references that are pretty obvious, and the development of characters that made the plot very different from other movies. In The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the heroes of the movie gave into lust and has affairs, and the main villain came out to be a victim. In most films, the protagonists stay on the ""right"" path, not giving into anything the antagonist throws at them. In this movie, however, Brad and Janet give in, barely making it out alive.
I appreciated and enjoyed ""The Rocky Horror Movie Picture Show,"" however I highly agree with the Rating of Mature, and would not recommend this movie to younger audiences. The reason why I enjoyed this movie is for the many songs featured, which are catchy and original such as the ""Time Warp"" and ""Sweet Transvestite,"" and the humorous interactions between the characters. However, that being said, many interactions involve sexual connotations and references, hinting and showing sex scenes. Overall, I say viewer discretion is advised.",The Rocky Horror Picture Show
