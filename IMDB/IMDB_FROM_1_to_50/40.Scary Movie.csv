0,TheLittleSongbird,Mindless and a lot of fun,8,15 July 2011,"There are some spoofs I like, and some I don't. Scary Movie is one of those I like. It is rather rushed for my liking, and Anna Farris overdoes it, plus I can understand because the humour is crude the film mayn't appeal to all. Crude humour is not my favourite kind humour, however I found the film hilarious. The script is witty, funny and pretty much laugh a minute and the gags and spoofs are mostly dead on, my favourite being the one with GhostFace and Shorty getting high. The soundtrack is fantastic as well, and the acting is better than I expected even from Marlon Wayans who I can be annoyed by. Overall, a lot of fun and the best of the series though I liked the second(despite its reputation), the third was okay and I didn't really like the fourth. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Scary Movie
1,Leofwine_draca,Deeply unfunny horror spoof,2,11 December 2016,"Halfway through this film I was praying for something subtle and witty to happen. Praying that we wouldn't get another joke which was easy to spot a mile off. Hoping beyond hope that I would find something to actually laugh at. Unfortunately, there isn't a single funny moment in SCARY MOVIE. There are a couple of mildly amusing parodies and in-jokes but otherwise, this film sits in the barren wasteland of humour. That ultimate failure: a comedy that just isn't funny.It's obvious which audience the makers of this film were aiming at: the teen market. Thus, we have a movie whose jokes fall into two categories: the parody, and the crude. By crude I mean jokes which are extremely obvious in nature and lack both wit and sophistication - somebody getting hit by a car is an example of this (so hilariously funny that they do the same joke twice). In the right context these jokes can sometimes work (take THE NAKED GUN trilogy for example), but here they fall flat. And, to make matters worse, many of the jokes are of the explicit sexual nature which have been depressingly filling the movies as of late. Do they make me laugh? No, they just make me sigh.The parodies should have worked, by all accounts. A fight between the heroine and the killer is done in slow-mo, to remind us of THE MATRIX. Yet even infallible jokes such as these somehow fall flat - perhaps because they were all used up in the film's trailer, so that we simply spend our time waiting for them to show up. They fly by thick and fast, references to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE SIXTH SENSE, and many more, but they consistently fail to provoke laughs. The film's ending is ripped off from THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but incredibly this is played seriously - a cop out for sure. A cameo from DAWSON'S CREEK star James Van Der Beek is unexpected and successful, so perhaps more cameos would have helped.The one funny scene in this film has Cindy (Anna Faris) stalked by a mask-wearing murderer up a flight of stairs. She grabs anything at hand to throw at him, and the items become more and more ludicrous - beginning with a vase, moving on to a bicycle, an old woman, and finally a piano. Yet for one genuinely amusing moment, there are a hundred more painfully bad ones. For fans with bad taste only, this is guaranteed to offend everyone else - as witnessed after I watched other audience members walk out of the cinema I was in as this was playing.",Scary Movie
2,SnoopyStyle,Scatter shoot jokes from the Wayans,6,1 March 2014,"The Wayans brothers bring a horror spoof based somewhat on the Scream movies. It also spoofs every TV and movie that the Wayans could get their hands on. The biggest question should be 'is it funny'. The answer is yes more than no. It starts with a funny opening with Carmen Electra. Anna Faris is adorable as Cindy Campbell, and is best when playing dumb.The movie is very scatter shoot with its humor. It leads to some hilarious jokes but also some groan worthy stupidity. Not all jokes work and definitely not for everybody. The scatter shoot approach should get some laughs from everybody. The best has to be when they inject some black people humor into the lily white Scream franchise. It takes the similar path as Zucker's Airplane without the cohesive story.",Scary Movie
3,kosmasp,(S)Poof,4,21 July 2009,"While the spoof movie seemed to live a quiet life for quite some years, Scary Movie did resurrect it. Seeing what movies it brought us, it should be charged. But let's stay focused on this movie. A movie which makes fun of ... well ""Scary Movie""(s).As a basic storyline ""Scream"" is being ripped off, which originally was called, yep you guessed it: ""Scary Movie""! While it tries hard to get as many laughs as possible out of that concept, it is doomed to fail (in my eyes) from the get go. Spoofing a movie, that is already a funny/cynical take on the horror movies, doesn't really quite work as good as it should. In contrast to classics, such as ""Airplane!"", where the object/movie that's being spoofed took itself seriously, ""Scream"" was meant to be funny. So how many jokes can there be? Well not that many, because other movies (or TV Series) get dragged into the mix. Unfortunately it never really hit a high point (one of the best things is the ""Wassup"" call) with me ...",Scary Movie
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Hilarious,9,2 February 2018,"Scream had redefined a genre, bring the slasher genre back from the depths of despair, Scary Movie rode the wave of interest in the genre and ripped it to shreds, hilariously.Who doesn't watch a Horror movie and say to yourself don't do that, or don't go there, this film highlights all the dos and dont's ridiculing all we love about them. The gags are non stop, the Scream parody opening scenes look great to be honest, the play on the Scream mask is so funny. Doofus is hilarious, and arguably has more sense then his counterpart in Scream. Anna Faris, Regina Hall and Shaun Wayans provide the most laughs, each equally hilarious.It's not to be taken seriously, when I'm in a bad mood, this is the film I reach for, it always changes my mood, let's be honest it's hilarious, and not afraid to offend everyone.",Scary Movie
5,classicsoncall,"""We'll just pretend it never happened.""",4,19 August 2021,"This could have been titled ""Stupid Movie"" and no one would be any the wiser. I don't really have a tolerance for over the top, exaggerated characters like Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Doofy (Dave Sheridan), and those two were an immediate turn off. Granted, I'm not in the target audience for a film like this and should know better, but I wanted to check out whether there was any clever humor between the dialog and the sight gags. Some but not much, as a movie fan I was more interested in the references to other films throughout the story. My favorite was the Keyser Soze turn by the killer at the very end, the only problem being I had to wait all that time to see it.",Scary Movie
6,lee_eisenberg,"And they just keep on coming, don't they?",10,13 February 2006,"The 10/10 rating of course only applies to people who would desire to watch such a movie (for anyone else, it's a zero). A spoof of ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", and other such movies, ""Scary Movie"" is another in the gag-a-minute genre associated with the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, the ""Airplane!"" crowd, and so on. Some scenes were kinda gross (they can't go without scatological humor, can they?), but overall harmless. The end was a real surprise. I never saw ""Scary Movie 2"" (I assumed that it was the same), but I did see ""Scary Movie 3""...and it was pretty much the same. And there's a ""Scary Movie 4"" coming out soon (we can probably assume that it's the same).",Scary Movie
7,jboothmillard,Scary Movie,5,17 March 2005,"This is the first film in what would become an on-going series of spoof movies parodying the latest horror films, television and popularised celebrity news, unfortunately it also gave birth to the various other terrible spoof films from the same ""writers"", e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, Vampires Suck, but at least this film has some alright laughs. This film predominantly parodies the teen slasher movies, specifically the Scream trilogy (the fourth film came much later) and I Know What You Did Last Summer (and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), as well as spoofing or referencing Baywatch, The Exorcist (quoted), Dawson's Creek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Election, Halloween, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Run Lola Run, the Budweiser ""Wassup!"" adverts, Candyman (quoted), The Blair Witch Project, Titanic, Amistad, Murder on the Orient Express, The Sixth Sense, American Pie, American Beauty, Psycho, The Matrix; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Usual Suspects, The Shawshank Redemption, Final Destination, Beetlejuice, Clueless, Cruel Intentions, The Dead Zone, Die Hard, Friday the 13th, Friday the 13th Part 2, Friday the 13th Part III, Grease, Gridlock'd, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Heathers, Kids, Men in Black, Trigger Happy TV, Twin Peaks and Xena: Warrior Princess. Basically Drew Decker (Baywatch's Carmen Electra) is murdered by a psycho killer wearing a Ghostface mask, her high school classmates Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), her boyfriend Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), her gay boyfriend Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Buffy Gilmore (American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth) and her easily angered boyfriend Greg Phillippe (Lochlyn Munro) think it coincidence that was she was killed exactly a year after they accidentally killed a man on the road and dumped his body. The psycho killer is now stalking the teens and one by one killing them and a couple of other students, and in the meantime news reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri) is trying to get the exclusive story with her hopeless cameraman Kenny (Dan Joffre) and seducing Buffy's mentally disabled ""Special Officer"" brother Doofy (Dave Sheridan) for police information. Greg is killed at the beauty pageant, Bobby is arrested but released being innocent, Buffy is killed in the locker rooms mistaking him as a prankster and sarcastically playing along with killer clichés, and still mocks after being decapitated, Ray appears to die getting stabbed through the ear by a penis through a bathroom glory hole, and Brenda is stabbed not by Ghostface there but the various cinema-goers who are getting agitated by her constant interruptions during a film. At a house party held by Cindy to keep everyone safe a fat girl (Marissa Jaret Winokur) is killed being crushed by the opening garage door collapsing on her, Bobby and Cindy have sex and she is no longer a virgin, and Brenda's stoner brother Shorty (Marlon Wayans) is in the basement with his friends as they get more and more stoned, along with the killer. Bobby turns on Shorty shooting the gun at him and killing him, and Ray turns up to join him, they corner Cindy claiming to be the ones who committed the crimes, Bobby explaining because he was refused sex and being gay with Ray, he denies this, and planning to give themselves stab wounds to look like survivors, but the real Ghostface pops up to kill them. The killer and Cindy have a Matrix style fight until he goes through the window and disappears, the Sheriff (Kurt Fuller) informs her that the killer is not the man who they accidentally killed as he is buried, then she works out that it is Doofy, and he walks out the station becoming normal and throwing away the Ghostface mask, and Cindy screaming gets hit by a car. The final moments of the film see Shorty on a surveillance camera giving a posthumous message telling the viewer three rules to help survive the situation, but he is actually explaining how to get away with a snatch-and-run, and we also see Doofy trying to break up with his first love, the vacuum cleaner he uses to masturbate, because he has fallen in love with Gail, but he does masturbate with it one more time. Also starring David L. Lander as Principal 'Squiggy' Squiggman, Keenen Ivory Wayans (the director) as Slave and James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery. This film is certainly reminiscent of the classic spoof films, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, where most of the characters are pretty stupid and the jokes are laughably ridiculous, the best characters of the film are obviously Cindy who would go on to do three sequels with Brenda as well, Ray is funny making it obvious that he is gay, and Shorty is my favourite with his moronic personality, constantly being off his head and high-pitch voice, laugh and catchphrase ""S*** son!"". If you have seen the films being parodied it makes it all the more fun, and if you can't you can simply enjoy the spoofing of all the clichés and tricks that go into real horror films, it should be noted that Scream was originally meant to be called Scary Movie, so it is good that it wasn't and you can see the irony with this title, a not bad and funny horror comedy spoof film. Worth watching!",Scary Movie
8,ccthemovieman-1,Another Sad Example Of Today's Comedies,1,18 May 2007,"Here's yet one more example of a modern-day comedy that has its funny moments but unfortunately, to me, was more of a sleaze-fest that a parody or a straight comedy. This movie is spoofing horror films. That's cool, I like a good spoof, but why all the irreverence and sex jokes? Why is that necessary? Don't writers today have the intelligence to make people laugh using clean material? This is just one R-rated scene after another. The language is brutal, too: tons of profanity in this film.Funny, but comedies for years made the public laugh without having to resort to profanity and sex remarks, like this film does. The really sickening part is that movie was geared for a young audience. The film business has no shame. What passes for comedy films today is, by and large, low-class material. This movie is Exhibit A.",Scary Movie
9,rmax304823,A Deconstruction of Ludic Elements in Contemporary Parodistic Cinematic Syntax,5,28 June 2002,"I suppose there are three major elements to consider in figuring out what kind of spoof you're watching.  (1) The dumbness of the gags.  (2)  The kind of genre being referenced.  And (3) the level of self awareness of the characters.The gags can range from elegant to really visciously vulgar.  The stupid ones have broader audience appeal and probably make more money.  This movie probably made a lot of money.  (Eg., one of the gay characters is assaulted by having a phallus thrust in one ear and out the other.)  They're not all that gross.  When Cindy runs to her room and contacts 911 on her PC, she gets the question, ""What is your problem?"" and types in, ""White woman in trouble.""  But the run of the mill gags are pretty lowbrow.  Over the final credits is a rap song with lyrics like, ""Take your tongue, and cut it out your mouth.  Take it home, feed it to my trout.  Fry him in a pan, shoot him out my can, right into your face, so you know your place.""  If you find that level of wit funny, it's your kind of movie.  The genre being spoofed here is the teenage horror/slasher flick.  Not something like ""The Shining"" or ""The Innocents,"" but something like, ""Scream,"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer.""  I can catch most of the cliches being skewered in something like, ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" (a caper movie) or ""Fatal Instinct,"" (a private eye noir) but I'm certain that most of the allusions here got past me because I don't find the original films very entertaining so I'm not familiar with them.The characters here are more self aware than in any spoof of recent memory. They know they are in a movie -- all of them.  At one point two young people are going to make love for the first time and the guy says, ""Just like in a movie.""  The girl says, ""No, this isn't a movie.""  And he says, ""Sure it is,"" and begins naming the crew while we see them gathered around the camera.  It isn't that this hasn't been done before.  There's a deliberate, fleeting shot of the director and crew in ""Candy,"" and in ""Blazing Saddles"" the characters break into the set of a musical being filmed on the neighboring sound stage.  ""Shakespeare in Love"" flirted with this, when one of the characters says, ""I own tobacco plantations in Virginia.  I think there may be a future in tobacco,"" and glances furtively into the camera. It's just that here, we are always aware of their awareness, whether we actually see the camera or not.  I didn't find the movie very funny.  It doesn't seem instrinsically funny when a retarded character named Dufus walks around with his lips twisted into an odd sneer, any more than it was funny when Mel Brooks made twitching faces as the mayor of the town in ""Blazing Saddles.""  Teenagers seemed to enjoy ""Scary Movie,"" or at least that's the impression I get.  There must have been some respectable activity at the box office and at Sam's Blockbuster after all the hype that accompanied this release.",Scary Movie
10,BA_Harrison,What is really scary is that I have three more of these movies still to watch!,3,4 July 2011,"I enjoy a spot of lowbrow humour as much as the next guy—unless the next guy happens to be a Wayans brother. In 90s slasher spoof Scary Movie, Shawn, Marlon and Keenan Ivory Wayans have created a film so infantile and so devoid of genuine humour that it is hard to believe that anyone exists with an IQ low enough to appreciate its idiocy.A crass collection of obvious lampoonery, gross-out toilet humour, sexual innuendo and uninspired visual gags, this utterly puerile effort must represent the absolute nadir of spoof movie-making (with the possible exception of the Scary Movie sequels!). Rapid fire gags about farts, fat birds, genitals, drug-use, and sex all fail to raise a laugh thanks to their predictability, whilst jokes that might have seemed topical at the time now seem extremely dated and will probably make no sense at all to many of today's viewers (eg.,The Miller Time 'Wassup?' skit and a Spice Girls gag).In their desperate search for cheap laughs, the Wayans Brothers also unwisely cast their net outside of the horror genre, lampooning everything from Amistad to The Matrix with material that even Leslie Nielsen in his twilight years would have left festering at the bottom of the barrel.I rate Scary Movie 3 out of 10: one point for the delightful Anna Faris as winsome heroine Cindy Campbell, and another point each for the ample curves of Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth (it's always nice to have something good to look at when a film sucks so hard!).",Scary Movie
11,paul_haakonsen,Wazzup?...,6,11 February 2016,"""Scary Movie"" is a funny spoof, for sure. But it is not the best of all the ""Scary Movies"" in the franchise. That being said, don't get me wrong here, because this movie is fun and entertaining, especially so if you enjoy comedies that is a spoof on other movies.""Scary Movie"" does have an overall storyline, which is very similar to the storyline found in ""Scream"", although elements from other famous movies are thrown into the mixture to spice it up. And it does work out quite nicely.The list of movies and TV series that are being spoofed is just great. I didn't catch all of these spoofs and references, not by a long shot. And if you enjoy spoof comedies, then you should check out those listed under the ""Connections"" heading and then ""Spoofs"".The laughs are bountiful throughout ""Scary Movie"" and the comedy is really great. It was right up my alley, so I was really amused by the comedy throughout this movie.The cast list in ""Scary Movie"" was also quite good, and those cast for the roles were all doing good jobs and individually brought something unique and nice to the movie. And this really lifted up the movie quite a bit.And ""Scary Movie"" is also the movie that brought the 'wazzup?' thing and made it popular.""Scary Movie"" is entertaining and funny, although you must like spoofs in order to really appreciate this movie (or the franchise as such).",Scary Movie
12,Quinoa1984,One of the funniest spoofs ever,5,7 July 2000,"Scary Movie is now (it was a little while ago it was Me, Myself & Irene) my favorite comedy of the year.  This film gives another word to the spoof/comedy genre, and even though it doesn't make a breakthrough like Airplane!, it is still very, very funny. Sure it's not for everyone, but for those who have seen all the scary movies parodied in this film (example- Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, Halloween, The Shining, etc) and can enjoy a good comedy, this film is definitely for you.But the plot is unexplainable, but the jokes are.  The spoof follows in the Wayans bros. tradition (this film is directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, produced by all three, and starring all three) of they're last spoof- Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.  Jokes include a guy who acts very gay but isn't (Shawn Wayans) a pot head (Marlon Wayans) and some other characters (Carmen Electra's cameo is my favorite).  Also, the references to movies but not parodies are still funny.  Very sick, very crude, very funny.  The funniest film of the year. A+",Scary Movie
13,ComedyFan2010,Whassssuuuuuuuup!!!,8,28 October 2018,"My headline is what I am sure everyone remembers from the movie. People kept repeating it for a long time, maybe a bit too long. Watched it today for the first time in almost 2 decades and was doing the same thing while laughing about this classic.Besides this scene I couldn't remember much about the movie and it ended up being pretty good. I just watched Scream a few days ago so I could get most references. They were done really well. The parody scenes were done perfectly when compared to the original. The character of the mentally challenged police guy was pretty funny even though the guy in Scream was pretty sweet.References to other movies that I haven't watched in a while but could still recognize. Dawson climbing into the window was also a hilarious moment.Really good parody movie catching the essence of the horror movies of the 90's and the humor of that time.",Scary Movie
14,wes-connors,The Wayans Brothers are a Scream,6,28 December 2009,"A mysterious masked serial killer decides to slaughter six retarded ""B.A. Corpse High School"" students, after learning they accidentally murdered a man while joyriding. Planned victims include virginal heroine Anna Faris (as Cindy Campbell), horny boyfriend Jon Abrahams (as Bobby Prinze), subliminally gay Shawn Wayans (as Ray Wilkins), black girlfriend Regina Hall (as Brenda Meeks), busty beauty Shannon Elizabeth (as Buffy Gilmore), and studly blond Lochlyn Munro (as Greg Phillippe).Keenen Ivory Wayans' ""Scary Movie"" spoof ranges from clever to stupid. One of the best sequences is a dead-on hilarious opening, featuring Carmen Electra (as Drew Decker) parodying ""Scream"" (1996). One of the hardest laughs comes when Shawn gets poked in a movie theater's bathroom stall. Visiting ""Le Sex Shoppe"" must have been funnier. While it occasionally gets flaccid, there are laughs throughout, and the brothers score points for pushing the envelope and hitting a tired genre.

15,Coventry,"Shameless, brainless, tasteless...and very entertaining!",5,17 May 2004,"Scary Movie looks like a rapidly fixed comedy to mock the success of Scream and all its clones. In the tradition of films like Airplane and Hot Shots, the audience is being attacked by a never-ending series of brutal gags. Not one joke in Scary Movie has a little depth or range and they merely focus on dirty' sex-jokes. The characters are constantly being humiliated and portrayed like empty-headed jocks and bimbosReally anything goes for the Wayans brothers apparently! Many of their jokes either glorify drug-usage or handle about adultery, women-beating or bizarre fetishes. Yet, even though the entire screenplay is a mess, some sequences really do prove the writers know their classics. The more subtle references in Scary Movie are the best ones, like for example the spoofing of `Blair Witch Project' and `The Shining'. I would even go far to call some aspects downright ingenious. Presenting Deputy Doofy (David Arquette's character in Scream) like a complete retard for example! The cast is merely filled with unfamiliar faces that look dumb almost naturally. Shannon Elizabeth is offered another change to show how gorgeous her body is and the casting of playmate Carmen Electra for the Drew Barrymore intro is another successful gag. Enjoy Scary Movie 1 as much as you can, since it was almost immediately followed by two inferior (and disgustingly irritating) sequels.",Scary Movie

After a beautiful classmate(Carmen Electra)is murdered; a clueless group of friends realize that there is a serial killer among them. Laugh out loud funny.

Cindy Campbell(Anna Faris)and her close friend Brenda(Regina Hall)try to comfort their friends as well as stay one step ahead of the killer.Strong crude sexual humor, violence, vulgar language and depiction of drug use guarantees an R rating.

18,preppy-3,Crude but VERY funny,9,29 December 2014,"Parody of the ""Scream"" series and the ""I Know What You Did..."" series. A bunch of teens accidentally kill a man one night and dump the body and agree to never tell anyone. A year later they get notes telling them that someone knows what they did last summer. This is all a copy of the first ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and throws in some very funny parodies of sequences from the movie pointing out all the stupidity and inconsistent plot lines. However there's also a killer wandering around dressed just like the killer from the ""Scream"" movies and we get parodies from those movies too.The jokes are sometimes VERY crude and not all of them work but, as a horror fan, I found this movie hilarious. I got every reference and plot point they were making fun of it and the movie keeps moving full tilt throwing out jokes left and right. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense but neither did the original movies. The cast are as good as they can be saying their lines with completely straight faces and enjoying themselves.

19,poolandrews,"""We'll pretend it never happened, like the time we went down on each other."" OK spoof.",6,30 January 2007,"Scary Movie starts with a young attractive girl named Drew Decker (Carmen Electra) being killed by a masked killer. Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) her boyfriend Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) her boyfriend Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans) along with Greg Phillippe (Lochlyn Munro) & his girlfriend Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth) are all good high-school friends who hide a terrible secret, the secret that they accidentally killed a man (Craig Bruhnanski) while drink driving & didn't tell the police. Cindy gets a sinister message that refers to the incident & she become convinced that the killer is after revenge & wants to kill them...Co-produced & directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans I thought Scary Movie was OK & had a few funny moments in it but it was rather repetitive. The script by Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer is basically a spoof of Scream (1996) with a large dose of I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) for good measure. In fact there are scenes which are virtually shot for shot, obviously Scary Movie mocks & spoofs those films to varying degrees of effect. The emphasis is on crude juvenile gross-out humour that relies heavily on childish immature sexual jokes & gags which while some are genuinely funny they get tiresome quite quickly & the script doesn't have any real variety about it. It's just a constant stream of sex gags with very little else, some of it is funny while some of it isn't. It tries to spoof the traditional horror film clichés & rules which it does with some success I suppose. The film plays out almost exactly like Scream even the ending & as a whole the only real interest in Scary Movie are the bad taste gags which are very hit & miss, it really depends on your sense of humour & your knowledge of films it pays homage too on exactly how much you will enjoy Scary Movie.Director Wayans does OK, there are loads of references to other films but is that enough to sustain your attention for 90 odd minutes? I'd say not really.With a supposed budget of about $19,000,000 it's well made & has that glossy Hollywood look to it. The acting isn't up to much really although the young cast are suitably attractive.Scary Movie is an OK watch, there are some funny moments & some not so funny moments while as a film it's virtually the same as Scream. It's quite fun to watch & pretty entertaining but too shallow & limited to really stand out.

20,zardoz-13,The Perfect Slasher Send-Up!,10,25 May 2008,"This salacious but superb spoof of 1990's slasher sagas ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" qualifies as the best dead teenager send-up tale since Mickey Rose & Michael Ritchie's ""Student Bodies"" (1981). Not surprisingly, this hilarious horror parody received an R-rating for frontal nudity, verbose profanity, and a couple of penises. Surprisingly, the prudish Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) permitted the filmmakers to show more close-ups of peters than any mainstream Hollywood movie had dared at this point. The best way to appreciate this inspired but irreverent lunacy is from the perspective of an infantile, four-year old boy who revels in blowing raspberries. Audiences that genuinely appreciate parodies will have one hell of a blast, too! Spotting the spoofs constitutes half of the hilarity of ""Scary Movie,"" and the filmmakers knock off every recent major hit with an odd reverence for the source material. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans scores one of his best lampoons with a scene taken from the Stephen King movie ""Thinner."" Demographically targeted at young males aged 18 to 25, ""Scary Movie"" is fully guaranteed to offend females of the same corresponding age group. Crude genitalia jokes, farcical bowel humor, and outrageously blatant stereotyping provide the basis for most of its wickedly witty japery. The gifted Wayans Brothers are the demented intellects behind this splatter-brained spectacle. Not only do they deliver the standard buckets of blood and gore for a fright flick (yes, several characters bite the dust), but they also ridicule the clichés and conventions of the genre with consistently inventive flair. Indeed, Shawn, Marlon, and Keenen Ivory Wayans handed us the zany ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"" (1988) as well as the keenly subversive ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While You're Drinking Your Juice in the Hood"" (1995). If you look carefully, you can spot variations on jokes from those two masterpieces. In ""Scary Movie,"" they plumb depths lower than either the Zucker Brothers could with ""Airplane"" or the Farrelly Brothers did in ""Me, Myself & Irene."" The column of semen that plasters heroine Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris of ""Lovers Lane"") to the ceiling in a bedroom scene hits a new ultra-low/high in gross-out humor. If you prefer subtlety in your movies, avoid ""Scary Movie."" Actually, despite their politically incorrect stance, the Wayans offer provocative commentaries. For example, a movie preview begins as a travesty of ""Titanic"" and then turns into ""Amistad 2"" with its star getting lashed by a whip. Few white directors would have had the pigment to lens such a scene. Similarly, the cultural bashing that blacks-as-audiences in a movie take in another scene when nearly everybody in a cinema as well as Ghost-face stabs, slashes, hacks, and disembowels one garrulous African-American male is hysterically funny.Shawn & Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson & Phil Beaumont, and Jason Friedburg & Aaron Seltzer scraped the bottom of the celluloid barrel to contrive this no-brainer buffoonery. Some jokes are pretty obvious, such as the name of their educational institution: B.A. Corpse High School. Others reveal more depth than you could possibly imagine. If pop-psychology has constantly suggested that kniveslike firearmsare latent phallic symbols, ""Scary Movie"" rams the comparison home by using a penis as a knife to stab one character through the head in a knock-off of ""Scream 2."" About every fourth or fifth joke really tests your sensitivity. The writes make fun of gays, women, transsexuals, stoners, and virgins. Seemingly nothing escapes the trenchant jibes of these scribes. What sets ""Scary Movie"" apart from recent parodies is the consistency of the humor and the headlong momentum with which the jokes are delivered. The Brothers Wayans never spare a second in this trim 89-minute romp to devastate everything in sight and leave you laughing.Like the slashes it sends up, ""Scary Movie"" concerns an anonymous killer that stalks a clique of high school students. A year before the killing spree commences, our teenage protagonists struck a pedestrian accidentally one night on the highway. While they argued about whether or not to call the cops, the guy recovered and tried to walk off. Inadvertently, one student flings a whiskey bottle into the air and it knocks the pedestrian unconscious again. Anyway, our inept heroes and heroines bundle his inert bulk into the trunk of their car. As they squeeze him into the truck, he revives again, but they slam the trunk lid down on him hard enough to knock him out again before they cruise away to dispose of his body.Shrewdly, director Keenen Ivory Wayans never lets the laughter lapse as he piles on pun after pun and slips in gag after gag in fast frenetic fashion. The first scene impales ""Scream,"" while the second skewers ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" Although Wayans mocks these movies, he celebrates them at the same time. While a tone of disarming sarcasm permeates the atmosphere, the filmmakers follow the formula, dutifully reenacting the ritualistic killing, sometimes with ridiculous but blood detail as when Ghost-face confronts Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth of ""American Pie"") and watches in amusement as she participates in her own death, another farcical stab at the slasher genre. The movie unfolds with a fart and degenerates gleefully into a series of low-brow but ludicrous ""Naked Gun"" style vignettes that deride the clichés and conventions of slash movies. The take-off of ""The Matrix"" is especially delightful, while the nostril gags from the ""The Blair Witch Project"" must be seen to be believed, too! If you missed either ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" you're going to be baffled when ""Scary Movie"" satirizes them. Moreover, if you haven't seen any major blockbusters like ""The Matrix,"" ""Titanic,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" you'll be puzzled when the Wayans mock them. The Wayans Brothers don't push the envelope on tastelessness, they shred it! Call me a sicko, but ""Scary Movie"" still kept me laughing the fourth time that I saw it.",Scary Movie
21,Boba_Fett1138,It's funny!,6,22 October 2009,"This movie isn't exactly an example of great taste but still you can't help laughing at it.It's one of those movies that is humor filled, with means that you are being bombarded constantly with jokes, of which some are just too lame for words, while others will make you laugh surely. Really a movie with hits and misses but luckily in this case the movie its hits make it worthwhile.Because it spoofs so many movie, the movie isn't really being a one-joke movie. Its plot line provides the movie with plenty of opportunities to let spoof-sequences fill up the movie. It lets the story flow rather well and keeps the pace high but pleasant. Even though it's all quite silly and very childish, it's a movie that entertains and that was of course also exactly what this movie got made for. It's a spoof in the same trend as the Naked Gun movies for instance, which on its own also aren't exactly great movies but hilarious and entertaining ones nevertheless.You can say that this movie got made at the right time. Horror movies were starting to regain their popularity again at the time and the Scary Movie-series perfectly exploits this. It makes these movie very profitable ones and it also adds to the popularity of both the modern horror and comedy genre. I sort of feel that the Scary Movie movies are also somewhat responsible for the many horror remakes of classic movies. These movies showed, by spoofing them, how popular and still well known these classic movies were by the young movie goers and therefore also profitable and interesting to do for the big studios.This movie is simply good and fun for what it is!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scary Movie

It doesn't reach it, but it's a fair attempt.Using as a template the recently successful Scream movie by Wes Craven, but cramming in references to every other movie which is halfway relevant (and a fair number which aren't), Scary Movie offers a mixture of sight gags, plot gags, dialogue gags, movie reference gags, in fact every type of gag you can think of. Not all of them succeed (I tended to lose patience with the stoner gags, for instance), but enough of them work to enable the movie to be marked a success.And it is fair to comment that far, far worse was to follow.It is also fair to note the movie as being Anna Faris' break-though film.",Scary Movie

The title is a mockery suggesting the extreme vulgarity within the humour with jokes like the ear-tickling penis scene or the testicles that hang just below the skirt of an unshaven gym teacher. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans proves that he knows the genre and is backed with a terrific resembling production. Anna Faris plays the heroine who receives ominous phone calls. Jon Abrahams plays her moron boyfriend accused of murder. Shannon Elizabeth plays pageant winner in a role highlighted by Sarah Michelle Gellar in I Know What You Did Last Summer. She is even named Buffy like the famed character whom Gellar portrayed in a popular TV show. Carmen Electra exploits every flaw made by horror heroines in the film's hilarious opening scene. Shawn Wayans earns a few laughs as a flamboyant homosexual character who seems to say the wrong things. Kurt Fuller is hilarious as a police captain low on empathy and high on showing pictures unrelated to the case. The ending is a tremendous Scream reference only it goes the extra mile that has Faris screaming at the heavens. Vulgar but very clever andscary. Score: 8 / 10",Scary Movie

And what was with all the penis stuff...I don't think you saw one female part, but you saw plenty of the guys.  The best part of the movie for me was the front part with Carmen Elecktra in the Drew Barrymore role from the first Scream.

32,JamesHitchcock,A witless parody of a worn-out genre,3,18 January 2004,"A successful film parody needs to follow two rules. First, one needs to understand the conventions of the genre one is parodying. The master of this sort of comedy was Mel Brooks; films such as Blazing Saddles and High Anxiety are amusing precisely because he had both a deep knowledge of and a respect for the westerns and Hitchcock thrillers on which they were based.
Secondly, one should avoid choosing as the target of one's satire a film genre which does not take itself seriously; in particular, it is hopeless to try and parody a parody. The classic example is the unfunny James Bond spoof Casino Royale, which seems to have been made in complete ignorance of the fact that the Bond films are themselves tongue-in-cheek send-ups of the secret agent genre. A related trap is that of trying to parody a movie which its makers may have taken seriously but which nobody else does. Even Brooks was not immune from this; Young Frankenstein has always struck me as being the least funny of his movie parodies precisely because the old Boris Karloff films on which it is based, although possibly regarded seriously when they were made in the thirties and forties, aged so badly that even by the seventies they seemed like unconscious self-parodies.
The `teen slasher' type of horror film is one that is particularly bound by conventions, many of which it shares with the more general high school movie. Scary Movie has its fair share of stereotyped characters drawn from this type of film- the bitchy beauty queen who is dating the meatheaded musclebound jock, the shy virginal girl, the token black characters in an otherwise all-white school (who always date one another because of Hollywood's uneasiness about inter-racial romance), the lesbian gym mistress. Added to this are a list of well-worn conventions- the fact that teenage characters are always played by actors in their late twenties or thirties, the weird mask worn by the killer, the moralising tone whereby the killer's victims are all either sexually active or have some guilty secret, the girl-alone in-a-house-with-the-killer situation.Unfortunately, although the film blazes away at all these targets, it never gets much humour out of them. The reason for this is that the film makers have ignored the second rule of successful film parody. Scary Movie is too obviously based on films such as the Scream series, which was itself an attempt to parody the horror genre, or on knowing, self-mocking TV series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. (To drive home the point, one of the characters is actually called Buffy). The result is that it comes across not as a parody but rather as an inferior copy of those films and programmes. Moreover, even if the film had not been based upon models which are themselves tongue in cheek, it would have been very difficult to have got much mileage out of a parody of this particular genre. In the late seventies and eighties there might have been some point to films such as the original versions of Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street; twenty years later, they have been followed by so many inferior sequels and bad imitations that slasher movies can no longer be taken seriously. No deliberate parody could ridicule the genre more effectively than it has managed to ridicule itself.
Deprived of the main source of laughter in any good parody- the contrast between a serious original model and a gently mocking humorous version- the makers of Scary Movie have tried to make good the deficit by relying on crude lavatorial and sexual humour. The result is a piece of leaden witless humour. Those who think that references to breasts, penises or homosexuality are automatically funny will find this film hilarious. Those who don't, won't. 3/10.",Scary Movie

I have heard people say that they laughed uproariously when they saw this. I find that very hard to believe. There were a few scenes that brought a smile or soft chuckle to me, but nothing side-splitting. None of the ""performances"" are worth a mention, but, as I said, the movie was certainly designed around deliberately bad performances, so maybe the actors were all first rate! Perhaps there should have been Oscars for these performances! OK, I'm going a bit overboard. The movie was OK; nothing great, but not a disaster. Probably on the downward side of mediocre. Not being a huge fan of Keenan Ivory Wayans, it's exactly what I would have expected from a movie directed by him.The one thing that intrigued me throughout was a casting decision that I still don't really understand. David L. Lander (""Squiggy"" from the old TV show ""Laverne and Shirley"") was cast as the high school principal. OK. But I couldn't for the life of me figure out why he was cast as ""Principal Squigman!"" In other words, he was playing ""Squiggy"" as a high school principal! Maybe I've missed some obvious point here, but why the fascination with ""Squiggy?"" Greater minds than mine will have to work on that.Overall, I rate this movie as a 4/10.",Scary Movie
39,thesar-2,"And the First Amendment gives us the right to say what we want - Aw, shut the **** up!",9,25 October 2009,"With the bombardment of horrid spoofs, I didn't think it possible to get even close to the two best classics of spoof: 'Airplane!' and 'Naked Gun' and then came the genius 'Scary Movie.' I just recently watched the 'Scream' trilogy again, and it was so hard to watch parts 1-2 due to remembering all the lines/scenes from 'Scary Movie;' it made me laugh out loud when I suppose 'Scream' was supposed to be frightening, even for a bit. After now watching 'Scary Movie' for probably the 12th time, I still laugh hard. And though it was not perfect, only a slight few of the gags were silly/bad ('Dawson's Creek' bleah). The rest were ingenious. Plot line: it didn't just follow the events of 'Scream' (and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and others) it completely mimicked the sets, scenes and even dialogue. They even point that out. And as much as I liked 'Scream,' when they point out major plot-holes and corny dialogue, I have to actually rethink my review of 'Scream.' (All the way through 'Scary Movie,' I kept thinking, ""Oh, yeah, they're right, that part was bad."") And even though they were set out just to make a spoof, the acting, the spirit and depth was actually performed by these actors. Farris, both Wayans, Elizabeth, everyone, actually were excellent in their roles and really gave it their 100%. The lines were fantastic, and quoted by me and my friends for the longest time following. The creativity of the set-ups and even the background gags were hilarious. (Heck, even their names.) I don't want to ruin too much of the movie, it's clear that I highly recommend this movie for horror/comedy/spoof buffs.

40,Lejink,Scary bad,1,2 June 2015,"We all make mistakes. Mine was to watch this movie. I actually quite like spoof comedy movies, like ""Airplane"", ""Hot Shot"", ""The Naked Gun"" et al, so, thinking I was in for a good laugh, I tuned in. I guess I wasn't properly aware of the difference in the directorial method of James Brooks back in the eighties and the Wayans in the noughties. Maybe if I was also 40 years younger, I might have got a kick out of the shenanigans which unfolded here.Really, this is just a frat-boy's paradise, meaning lots of low humour, vulgar jokes and crude banality. I got the references to contemporary thriller - horror movies, like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Scream"", ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Sixth Sense"" amongst many others, but really just found the humour way too obvious and infantile to connect with.Even in the earlier movies mentioned above, I accept there's some risqué humour, but for every clean, even clever smile-inducing gag, (like when the subjective camera bumps into the lead actress, although they even borrowed that from Mel Brooks) there were twenty- plenty other wince-making, below-the-belt and often just embarrassing so-called jokes. I could go on by saying that the largely unknown cast failed to demonstrate any great originality or distinction in their acting, but to be honest, they're largely secondary to the non-stop barrage of cheap sex-jokes right from the start.Successful enough to spawn a horde of sequel movies, I won't be tuning in for any of them anytime soon. Last one in class, turn off the lights please.",Scary Movie
41,ElMaruecan82,"The Millennium's ""Airplane!""..",8,23 November 2019,"Recently I was reviewing ""Jaws 2"" and I mentioned that it was with ""Halloween"" one of the early precursors of the ""dead teenagers"" slasher sub-genre before the ""Friday the 13th"" series would turn them into a joke and long before the ""Scream"" or ""Final Destination"" series would provide a more qualitative approach and until ""American Pie"" would prove that you can make good comedies about teenagers or young people as characters without insulting their intelligence as viewers.It is in that particular context that ""Scary Movie"" was released in 2000 and on the surface, its success is due to its avalanche of gags mocking a genre that had it coming. It was Jon Abrahams who stars in the film as Bobby who said it better: ""It's enjoyable to make fun of those movies because I think they're just silly to begin with. They're just so serious that everything becomes a joke."" I'm pretty sure the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team thought similarly about the disaster genre before they made ""Airplane!"".And till the early 90s, the parody genre belonged to the Zuckers with a peak reached in 1991 with the second ""Naked Gun"" film and ""Hot Shots!""; two sequels were made after but didn't get the same success. Mel Brooks tried to revive his starlight with ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" but it turned out a disaster. It didn't mean parody was dead but that it couldn't be the material to build the whole edifice, an artistic license at the very least but not a narrative-structuring thing. That's why Jim Carrey's, Tom Shadyac and the Farrelly brothers' movies did better in the decade's second half, they relied on absurd premises and over-the-top jokes, they had parody elements but the films tried to provide references of their own before building their fame on pre-existing ones.And I guess that's the difference between a good and a bad parody movie, a good one has its own breath, it depends on viewers' appreciation of a few classics but in its own right, it's valuable, that's the difference between ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"" (a film with a few hilarious gags but that grows rapidly tiresome), or the difference between the early and late ZAZ movies. It seems like the parody genre has its outbursts of creativity and needs a few pauses to reload the battery or to wait for a new turn of generation to find the power of its legs again. There were the early 70s with Brooks and the early 80s and 90s with the ZAZ team, these directors understood their audience and so did the Wayans, finally, in the 2000s.Directed by Keened Ivory Wayans and starring Marlon and Shawn, ""Scary Movie"" was the sensation of the new millennial, so big that it spanned not one but four sequels... but so did ""American Pie"" (is it a coincidence that Shannon Elizabeth stars in both?)... not sure I care for the sequels but at least I can say I enjoyed the original: even the lousiest gags have their beat, it's a film that shamelessly rips off from classic or cult or recent horror movies but it does it like ""South Park"" would do without the satire, in the least tactful or the most childish way and yet it works. The phone calls from ""Scream"" and its unforgettable cameo from then-Baywatch star Carmen Electra"", the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" parody, the close up from ""Blair Witch project"", they all remind us of the mood and atmosphere of the 2000s to the point that it's almost an era-defining movie.Indeed, the film plays on the teenage movies clichés just as much as the horror, and that's why it's far superior than ""Not Another Teen Movie"", to name this one. ""The Naked Gun"" worked in the same way because it was a spoof of the cop genre but also corny romances, I guess parody needs to run on two legs and never be reliant on one specific genre, otherwise, it turns out to be a sort of one-note movie. ""Scary Movie"" surfs two waves at once and succeeds. And the casting is part of it, there's Anna Faris who plays the heroine with the right amount of goofiness, Shawn Wayans is a jock who can barely conceal his homosexual tendencies (and is responsible for many gags that wouldn't be accepted today), Regina Hall is his loud girlfriend who heckles the projection of ""Shakespeare in Love"" (and is also responsible for many gags that wouldn't be accepted today) and Marlon Wayans is simply the comic counterpart of his character in ""Requiem for a Dream"".The film is also surrounded by great supporting characters, including two policemen but speaking of them might give away a few jokes. Anyway, the real star is Ghostface who actually makes many faces through the film. In fact, it's a credit that you'd wonder which version of the villain is the most famous, the real from ""Scream"" or the funny whose tongue appears during the ""Wazzaaaa"" parody or with that tripping smile during a pot party? But that would be like asking which is the most famous between ""Airplane!:"" or ""Airport""? Pretty obvious, huh? My guess is that horror is a genre that attracts young people waiting to grab their girlfriends' arms, but maybe the Wayans understood that what kids wanted in 2000 was to laugh their a- off.To conclude, there's a hilarious moment involving the killing of the pretty female character (it's a horror parody, people are expected to die, aren't they?) and she's laughing at Ghostface whenever he stabs her (""now I'm supposed to scream?"", ""now I'm supposed to cry for help?""), this is a brilliant moment that captures the silliness of the horror genre's overused tropes. So it's possible that parody is a poor man's comedy but that's when it lacks the inspiration, ""Scary Movie"" is the kind that take ingredients from recipes and make something different (if not better) out of them.",Scary Movie
42,MOscarbradley,Some kind of classic ... and in the worst possible taste.,8,13 February 2008,"For the most part, inspired lunacy, (ok, so it dips now and again but with a gag rate of about one every 30 seconds what do you expect). What plot there is is basically a rip-off of ""Scream"" and to a lesser extend ""I know what you did last summer"", (here it's 'I know what you did last Halloween'), but this crazy spoof also manages to get digs in at ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" not to mention such non-genre specific films as ""The Matrix"" and ""The Usual Suspects"".Sure it's crude in a frat-boy fashion but it's also very, very funny and a likable and talented cast, (in particular, Anna Faris), display real comic potential. Sequelitis set in early as it did with the ""Scream"" franchise but not having seen any of the other 'Scary Movies' I can't vouchsafe for their quality or lack of it but this feels like a classic, albeit a classic in the worse possible taste. (It's like an X-rated Mad Magazine spoof brought to life). So yep, Nuno, I have to say - you win again.",Scary Movie
43,bowmanblue,Neve Campbell sums it up best (and she's not even in the movie),7,17 February 2015,"In case you don't know, Scary Movie is (primarily) a parody of the first 'Scream' film (although there are plenty of other horror movies made fun of). It was in Scream 4 when Neve Campbell declared, ""Don't **** with the original."" Since Scary Movie has been made, not only has it spawned several sequels, but a whole range of other parody movies from the same studio. There may be a few chuckles to be had from its successors, but none can compare to the first.Scary Movie is a very rare example of a parody movie that's actually funny. Yes, you may have to have watched (or at least be very familiar) with Scream to fully appreciate it, but I'm guessing that if you're thinking of watching a parody of a horror movie then you've probably seen the original horror movie first.The jokes come thick and fast, but they are pretty 'low brow' and most involve pratfalls or 'gross-out' gags, so you have to have your humour appreciation meter set to 'gutter.' So, if you've seen Scream and feel like watching basically the same movie again (as Scary Movie does tend to follow the original source material scarily closely), but with more - dirty - jokes, then give this one a go. It's by far the best of the series (although I found part 3 quite amusing, too).",Scary Movie

47,callanvass,"Before spoofing was the cool thing to do, this was one of the better one's.",6,22 August 2013,"*Minor spoiler*Scary Movie is far from a laugh riot, but it does contain many amusing scenes, which is something most spoofs fail to do. I wouldn't say I'm a fan of the sequels, but a couple of them are at least tolerable, which is something I can't say for a lot of other spoof films. Scary Movie spoofs movies such as Scream (Obviously) I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, among others. Dewey from Scream being spoofed as Doofy (a mentally challenged deputy was borderline offensive, but I did get a couple of chuckles from it) It helps that we have such a winning lead in Anna Farris. (Cindy CampbellGENIUS!) This girl goes all out in making a fool of herself and plays it STRAIGHT! I give her all the credit in the world for portraying this role and making it as memorable as it is today. She's kinda cute in her own way as well. The Wayan Brothers do their usual thang. You'll either love them or hate them. I was personally in the middle. Shawn Wayans is the one I enjoyed the most. The dude is too cool for school. Marlon Wayans is amusing at times, and annoying at others. Jon Abrahams is pretty amusing as Bobby. He does a pretty good Skeet Ulrich impersonation. Regina Hall is involved in one of my favorite scenes, and she had me chuckling. She is good as Cindy's friend. Shannon Elizabeth is smoking hot and very easy on the eyes. She plays a b*tch very well. Lochlyn Munro plays a jock very well. Not much of a stretch for him. The best thing about this film is probably the twist ending, and I howled for it. Final Thoughts: It's not a laugh riot as I said, but it is often funny and amusing, and that's all my arse cares about these days. I've seen it at least 4 times now and it always gets the job done. If you want a good spoof movie, this is a pretty solid choice.6.5/10",Scary Movie

50,jacobjohntaylor1,could very well be the worst comedy ever,1,18 April 2015,This not funny it is just gross and stupid. I have seen a lot of horror movie. I have seen all the once this movie made fun of. Some of them I like but I don't think they were insulting these movie. And I don't mind some one making fun of them if they were being funny. But they were not being funny they were just being stupid. They did make fun of some crappy horror movie. But they did not point how to stupid they were all they did was stupid collage hummer. Scary movie 2 is better and it is nothing that great. Scary movie 3 is better and that is pretty awful. Scary movie 4 is better. And that was also awful. Scary 5 is better. And that was awful to. The bad horror movie there make fun are better movies by default. I can't believe people think this movie is funny.,Scary Movie
51,Floated2,Some comedic has its moments,4,31 December 2018,"The Scary Movie franchise has become and was well wide known during the start of the 2000's. Being an instant hit among audiences, as well as critics, though despite mixed reviews. These films have gotten quite a following as they have amassed five films.As watching for the first time late 2018, Scary Movie doesn't quite live up to the hype which have been heard throughout. There are some funny scenes, and a decent plot but much of the humor is toilet humor and really not that funny. Though the film is quite entertaining and the cast is likable (mainly Anna Faris as the lead), it's decent at best. The 2000's were much different times for comedies as this film is quite old and seemingly outdated in 2018.Many jokes just fall flat and were more misses than hits. Though a funny joke and gag involved the Scream killer hanging out with Marlon Wayans character smoking it up as we can see the Scream mask change facial motions. The ending was also quite clever, and not as predictable. Other than that, there could have been better and more clever jokes. But it is what it is.",Scary Movie
52,filipemanuelneto,Ups and downs...,6,28 January 2021,"This teen film (one of the most abominable cinematographic genres) was made to mock some well-known horror films. The clearest victim was Wes Craven's film ""Scream"", but if we pay attention we will see scenes that satirize other films such as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Blair Witch Project"" or ""Sixth Sense"". Interestingly (or perhaps not so much), the working title of ""Scream"" was ""Scary Movie"" and the studio responsible for the two films is the same: Dimension Films. Talking about the plot here would be not only redundant, but it seems to me a mistake: by mentioning the most spoofed films here, I think I have already left enough clues about the plot. Whoever wants to know more, please go see the film.The film is a satire, it was made to entertain, and it is clearly aimed at young audiences, so it is better not to be expecting something complex or a dramatic show. This is not a movie designed to win Oscars or anything like that. It is a film to make people laugh, for the easy laugh of teenagers who don't think much, love eschatological humor or suffer from a serious obsession with everything related to sexuality. But that does not mean that it is a bad or abominable film, as many teen films really are. In fact, it turned out to be a pleasant film, one that you can't revisit often or make us laugh out loud (although it varies from one person to another) but it will put some smiles in the most circumspect audiences. For me, the film has both good and bad things: I don't like such an immoral humor, but it is impossible not to laugh at some situations. Parodying horror films also helps, although the choice of these films is debatable.The cast is led by Anna Faris, and she does a satisfying job, just as Regina Hall and Jon Abrahams, Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans are decent enough, but do not exceed the average. Carmen Electra does not work well as an actress, she appears only to show her generous cleavage whenever necessary, and Shannon Elizabeth is not much better than her. But the one who really does badly in this film is Dave Sheridan, thanks to the horrible and offensive character that happened to him. There is a limit between being politically incorrect and being offensive, and the character Duffy overcomes that limit by the insulting way in which he portrays a mentally handy caped man. And it's not even worth mentioning the fact that this character is annoying and not funny at all.",Scary Movie
53,TheMovieDiorama,"Scary Movie pretty much coined the word ""wasssssup!?"" and for good reason.",4,29 April 2018,"Taking popular films from the 90s and replicating specific scenes and plots to create a spoof film sounds incredibly lazy. Surprisingly the originality comes from transforming these horror films into comedic sketches that will certainly make the originals less scary. A group of high schoolers have their past come to haunt them as a masked serial killer slashes his way through each one. Borrowing the plot of 'Scream' and entangling it with threads from 'The Usual Suspects' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. Wayans attempted to include as many film references as possible, and half the fun is identifying them. ""Ohhh there's 'The Matrix' 360 freeze frame!"", ""the classic ""I see dead people"" line, niceee!"" and ""Amistad II instead of 'Titanic'? Sure, I'm onboard"". Certain imitations were hilarious such as 'The Blair Witch Project' woodland run and the cinema viewing of 'Shakespeare in Love'. It's certainly a good time when with friends, but is it actually a decent film? Well, yes and no. The horrendous overacting is humorous at first but quickly becomes tiresome as Cindy consistently screams in fear and runs away like a headless chicken. For me, a large portion of the slapstick humour and ""witty"" dialogue were misses. These spoof films rely on you watching the films that it is attempting to mimic, so if you haven't watched any you will not find this funny at all. At the time of this review I haven't seen 'Miss Congeniality' so the entire beauty pageant scene was wasted on me. The script relied heavily on visual comedy which mostly comprised of grotesque uninspired actions such as farting inconveniently. May have been funny in the 70s but not anymore, come on. What this flick does do is introduce us to the character Brenda who, whilst criminally underused in this, is a massive highlight in future sequels. This is, for me, my least favourite of the original trilogy. A solid watch if you are drunk with friends, but unfortunately comes across as unintelligent and unfunny for most of its runtime.",Scary Movie
54,insomniac_rod,Not for the easily offended!,8,2 April 2006,"A controversial Horror spoof that gained mainstream attention when released. If you liked and took seriously ""Scream"" then you should watch this movie with attention. It's almost the same concept. While ""Scream"" tried to be taken seriously , ""Scary Movie"" mocks about everything possible in the genre in a raw way.Anna Faris and the Wayans brothers deliver a funny performance. Sure the cast is over the top but the movie asks for it. Having such a pretty girl like Faris behaving like that always shocks and this time, it entertains. The rest of the cast is pretty good. All in the ""American Pie"" style but with raunchy humor. The main reason for me to like this movie is that it mocks perfectly many Horror popular movies. Friday the 13th, He Knows You Are Alone, Black Christmas, Psycho, etc. That's in my opinion, the best feature of the movie. It's a joke but it's a homage at the same time. Unlike ""Scream"" that tried to convince people that it was an innovative slasher. Give this movie a try if you are in the mood of raw black humor. It surely will entertain you if you are not easily offended.",Scary Movie

56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Crude and tasteless humor spoils a good spoof concept,3,15 August 2009,"A spoof is never a bad idea, but it requires wit and the Wayans brothers don't have it. Think back to the films that made the spoof a genre (""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"") and there you have a commitment to nonsensical but witty humor and most of all -- subtlety. ""Scary Movie"" might make a lot of people laugh with its literally balls-out mentality toward comedy, but the explicit drug and sex content is anything but clever. If the team of six writers spent half as much time making the jokes work for the plot instead of the plot working for the jokes, ""Scary Movie"" might have left a humorous impression on its audience. Instead, we leave feeling bad that we laughed at even some of the jokes in this movie because of how generally distasteful it is.Meant to spoof the wave of '90s horror films that brought back the slasher genre, ""Scary Movie"" combines the plot line of ""Scream"" with ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" but fills it with goofy and/or stupid characters who make fun of these films' repetitive clichés.When watching this movie, you can tell that different jokes were written by different writers. At times, there's some actual cleverness, like when Shannon Elizabeth's character gets a standing ovation for a dramatic monologue in a talent competition, only she's actually screaming about her boyfriend who she sees being killed in the back of the auditorium. Another character taunts the killer by egging him on with descriptions of slasher clichés like ""now I've broken my leg and I'm helpless!"" That's the good stuff.Then there's other writers' humor: the killer getting high with a bunch of stoners, recurring female flatulence jokes and the gratuitous use of genitalia for a cheap laugh. It's like they were trying to sabotage whatever comedic intelligence they put into the movie because they didn't think people would like it otherwise.The characters are much the same way. Avoiding stereotype versus perpetuating it is a fine line. Some of them, such as Shawn Wayans' questionably gay athlete character, try so hard to make fun of clichés that they create new ones and others are just flat out tasteless jokes like the trans-gendered gym teacher who is preyed on for the sake of the ignorant people that find that stuff funny. On the good side is Cindy (Anna Faris), who gets on the map with her comedically believable performance. She plays up her stereotype of prude do-gooder but plays right into the best material i.e. the subtle jokes. Then there's Shorty (Marlon Wayans), the idiot stoner. I suppose the Wayans brothers have creative license to make jokes about black people, but there are so many that this humor forms its own subplot in ways, like it was intended to entice the black demographic that they worried the rest of the film wouldn't reach.For every three effective jokes that ""Scary Movie"" has, there's one horrendous one and that's how this movie negates itself. The franchise of spoofs that this movie launched (without having seen them myself) is certainly unprecedented and unwarranted.",Scary Movie

After seeing the preview, I expected that I was going to leave the theater holding my sides, and with my cheeks aching from laughing so hard. What I got was an hour and a half of the exact same jokes that I had already seen in the previews, with a few disgusting and boring sex jokes. The spoofs were put in almost verbatim from such films as the Scream trilogy (obviously), Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer, the Matrix, and even the Usual Suspects for some odd reason. Because of that, what you get is not a film that stands on its own, but a conglomeration of skits based on the above horror films. Watching Scary Movie is almost like watching a sick version of a Saturday Night Live-type TV show. While I was watching Scary Movie, I found myself laughing at the jokes almost entirely because I WANTED it to be funny, but then I found myself feeling stupid for laughing out loud at something that was not even remotely amusing.

The movie that it parodied the most was Scream. Ironically the title was the original name of Scream before they changed it (for marketing reasons). The Wayans brothers co-wrote the script (with a few others) and they had their older brother Keenan direct the picture.The film is about a group of high school friends who learn that one of their circle (Carmen Electra) was killed in a brutal fashion. They felt that it might have to do with something that happened last year. A secret that they swore to never have mention again. After a brief mourning period, the gang goes back to there usual business. But a crazed killer is stalking the student body at their high school and the circle of friends grows smaller every day. Who or what is behind the killings? Does it have to do with their secret? To find out you must have already watch SCREAM. Better yet go get yourself a copy of SCARY MOVIE!!A funny film for those who actually watched the teen slasher films they reference. Some of the jokes were from the Wayans Brothers other script (DON'T BE A MENANCE....) whilst the others seemed to be either tacked on or picked up from the cutting board.

This one's in the tradition of Airplane! et. al, as nouveau-horror movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer are gleefully lampooned. Oh, and there are references to The Matrix as well, and other movies whose names escape me at the moment. The film is the handiwork of Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and it's as if they took the scripts of the gee-aren't-we-hip horror movies of recent years and shot the hell out of them. Ripped asunder, these scripts are funnier than ever. You've got the opening scene of Scream where the sexy starlet is terrorised by the guy on the phone who can see her, you've got the scene in I Know What You Did Last Summer where the joyriding kids run over someone, plus you have scenes from all those old horror movies where the hero/heroine is running up the stairs, chased by a madman (Halloween comes to mind).Your main characters are an amalgam of the kids from IKWYDLS and the Scream monstrosities. You remember: the Romeo, the virgin, the slut, the BMOC (big man on campus), and at least one African American tossed in for some good ol' ethnic diversity. You see, while the Scream series thought it was poking fun at other, more revered horror films while not taking itself seriously, you don't need to have Protean intelligence to realise that the in-jokes were just dumb and overwrought, like elitist coeds snickering at something they didn't understand. Well turn those frowns upside-down, folks! The Wayans boys know what they're doing. The simple vacuousness of the characters in those lesser flicks is exaggerated perfectly in Scary Movie. There's not a sacred cow left untipped!I won't delve into the plot, they introduced a whole stoner subplot that had me in stitches, too. This is lowbrow humor executed perfectly.

65,MaxBorg89,"An overall tasteless horror parody, despite some good bits",6,12 November 2006,"On paper, Scary Movie must have sounded like a great idea: after all, this film spoofs a series of slasher flicks, mostly Scream, which was a clever satire on horror traditions. How hard can it be to take those traditions and make fun of them, yet in a more extreme way than Wes Craven's opus did? Judging from the finished movie, it's very hard.The Wayans brothers, who came up with the whole concept (one of them directs the film, two act), seem to think the only thing you have to do is insert as much (gratuitous) crude humor and tasteless situations as possible. Movie opening with a big-breasted woman (Carmen Electra) who gets killed while running around in her underwear? Check. Bunch of stupid teenagers who, when not thinking how to defeat the killer, only talk about sex and drugs? Check. Endless rude jokes involving the aforementioned topics, as well as some puerile gay stuff? Check.That said, not everything is that bad. All the scenes featuring the Scream killer are quite funny, mainly because he's the only character the filmmakers can mock in new, unseen ways. Everyone else, however, is a boring stereotype, particularly Shorty (Marlon Wayans), an obnoxious stoner with almost no comedic charisma. Imagine my surprise when I found out Wayans could actually portray a drug addict convincingly in the harrowing Requiem for a Dream.Those who haven't seen it yet might find Scary Movie amusing the first time, otherwise it's just another throwaway comedy.5,5/10",Scary Movie

If you haven't seen any of these but still enjoy a gross-out comedy, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh in all the wrong places (one of the most interesting things in watching it is that different sections of the audience puzzlingly laugh in completely different places).	The basic story concerns a bumbling killer who uses the Scream movie cloak and techniques to hunt down a group of teenagers who accidentally killed someone years ago. Laughs are in two categories - totally gross ones that push the limits of acceptability and the censor, and in-jokes based on parodies of other movies. For instance, many will remember the ""I'm so scared"" scene from Blair Witch where the girl's nose runs: in Scary Movie, the nose runs, and runs and runs and eventually starts hilariously blowing bubbles. The gross-out jokes make There's Something About Mary look definitely prudish. There's a retard who has sex by putting his penis into a vacuum cleaner hosepipe, a man who doesn't realize he's gay but chases men (and, when an erect penis is offered him through a latrine wall, finds it goes, quite literally, in one ear and out of the other.) The real nastiness of the reporter from earlier movies is made obvious. And so on.

67,drownnnsoda,All-Around Good Fun.,8,10 September 2006,"I saw ""Scary Movie"" years ago when it was really popular, and it's one of the best spoofs I've seen. The plot revolves around innocent teenage girl Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who finds herself wrapped up in a horrible mystery. One year ago, she and some friends accidentally killed a man on a road, and dumped his body in the water. Now, someone has come for revenge, in a white mask armed with a knife. As more bodies begin to pile up within the halls of B.A. Corpse High School, and all around the town, Cindy must fight against the killer and save her friends and herself.""Scary Movie"" is a film that can't be taken seriously. It's not meant to be taken seriously, and it's proud of it. The entire film is basically making fun of numerous entries into the horror genre, and the result is satisfying and amusing. The film mostly spoofs ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", but throws in a few handfuls of others, all blending them into one big horror-comedy. The movie itself is pure slapstick comedy, so if you have seen a lot of horror films, you will understand easily what movie is being made fun of in what scene. I found myself laughing on many occasions, which is rare for me when I see comedies. There are some fairly good jokes in the film, although they also do throw in some of the tired, racy sex humor, but I was expecting that. The acting is great, everybody gave extremely funny performances, and from what I know they say that comedy is the hardest genre to accomplish, because you have to make people laugh. Well, this slick crew of actors did it for me. Some particular spoofs that stood out for me were - number one, the opening with Carmen Electra, spoofing Drew Barrymore's performance in ""Scream"", and number two, the sequence between the teens and the fisherman spoofing ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". There are many more, but those are ones that I found most amusing.Overall, ""Scary Movie"" is one of the best satires I've seen, although I can't say I've seen a whole lot. The jokes were good and on pitch for the most part, the acting was funny, and the film delivered plenty of laughs while spoofing loads of recent horror films. If you are a horror fan and are fond of comedy too, I'd highly recommend this, because more than likely you will get most of the jokes. This is a good way to spend a couple of brainless hours, just don't expect to take any of it seriously. 8/10.",Scary Movie
68,kluseba,American junk food for cinematic lunatics,5,22 February 2011,"I know that one shouldn't take this kind of movies too serious and the main public of this kind of films might still be twelve year old boys and girls that are excited to see a movie with many sexual allusions, exaggerated gore scenes and absurd slapstick humour.The problem that I have with this movie is that the jokes are permanently repeated and quite superficial. You can laugh about fake oral sex scenes in the beginning but when it turns out that every pun of this movie is orientated towards this, it gets quite silly, boring and even somewhat embarrassing. Another bad point is that there are not that many movies that get parodied by this film so that it stays quite one-dimensional all the time and mainly focuses on two well known movies (""Scream"" and ""I know what you did last summer""). A little bit of diversity would have been more dynamical, funny and enjoyable. The last bad point is the really atrocious acting. The characters are mostly so ordinary and boring that you can't even laugh about them. The next parts of the series have done a better job and included some truly gifted actors like Leslie Nielsen for example.Nevertheless, this is a short and entertaining movie made for parties to have some good laughs in a good company and where it doesn't matter if you are drunk, stoned, chatting, gone fishing or simply falling asleep during the movie and miss some bits here and there. It somewhat because of those curious twelve year old teenagers that this has become a cult movie as I know many better parodies in that key like ""The naked gun"" or ""Wrongfully accused"" but there have also been movies that have been worse like ""Epic Movie"" or ""Meet the Spartians"". This is pure entertainment, but nothing groundbreaking or truly interesting. I would call it typically American junk food for the cinematic lunatics.",Scary Movie

Now the crazed murderer knows their secret, they keep-ed. Now he's going to kill them, one by one, ending their stupid little lives.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans (I'm Going Git You Sucka, Little Man, A Low Down Dirty Shame) made an very funny spoof, based on popular slasher films like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and countless different movies genres. This was actually an Surprise Blockbuster in the Summer of 2000.

71,slokes,"""Airplane"" on one engine",4,11 August 2003,"The preview for ""Scary Movie"" was a pretty popular workplace download back in 2000, when you could pull the latest commercials off of one of a plethora of websites now shut down. The goofy drug-addled Shorty jumping up and down in front of the news cameras saying this was better than the time he was on ""Cops"" was just one highlight of one of the funniest minutes ever put together on screen.Unfortunately, the makers of the movie had to fill some 90 more of them, and this they could not do too well. ""Scary Movie"" isn't bad bad. It has funny sections throughout, an unattractive but capable newcomer in lead Anna Faris, and three of the Earp Brothers of comedy, the Wayans, director Keneen Ivory, Marlon (Shorty), and Shawn (not-gay Ray) putting down their considerable talents to the enterprise. I like Cheri Oteri here, too, though the other characters are pretty cardboard, even for a farce.Ultimately this movie is a blend of two better films, the classic ""Airplane"" and, more obviously, ""Scream."" Sometimes it works, like in the solid opening with Carmen Electra, a banana, and the funniest non-cameo cameo I've ever seen. That scene works because it plays off the recent memory of ""Scream"" in theaters. But the movie quickly drags into a series of elongated, who-cares refs to such lesser fare as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Dawson's Creek."" The more it runs, the more you're reminded of how it's been done better before.2000 wasn't all that long ago, but a lot has happened since, and this film feels as lost in time as a high-tech IPO. Take one bit this film has in common with ""Airplane,"" the commercial parody. I still laugh when I hear the woman in ""Airplane"" think to herself how ""Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home"" not just because I'm one of seven people left on the planet who still get that joke but because it's over and out fairly quickly. The ""Wassup"" gag in ""Scary Movie"" just goes on and on, a memorial to a commercial that lost gravity faster than Spuds McKenzie on Skylab.I really want to lambaste this movie, but it's hard. I liked Faris, as I said (she's prettier in ""Scary Movie 2"", maybe because she isn't sharing that one with Shannon Elizabeth), and the film's eagerness to make you laugh does win you over, at least a little. Even the stupid ""Riverdance meets Matrix"" fight scene makes me chuckle, and there are some actual good moments not worth spoiling by enumerating here.Maybe I missed this one by a generation, but I'm not sorry I did. ""Airplane"" and ""Kentucky Fried Movie,"" even ""The Cheap Detective,"" were pretty good for its day, and I guarantee you will hold up better 20 years later than ""Scary Movie"" will by the time Bill Gates is ready to retire.Really high raunch factor here, too. Did they really need to have scenes like Ray in the men's room and Carmen losing her implant to get laughs? Buffy's final scene is just too sado-bizarre (probably unintentionally), and the whole Doofy experience leaves an uncomfortable aftertaste.",Scary Movie

The biggest joke is the 'R' rating this movie got, while an actual MOVIE like 'Requiem for a Dream' gets treated like something that stinks by the intelligencia at the MPAA..I could write a movie where a fart joke is the punchline, so that obviously does not take a genius.  The Wayans do not care if I laugh though, I'm a 41 year old white guy and this was written to cater to another audience.

76,Spleen,"Yes, well",2,19 February 2001,"The jokes in ""Scary Movie"" are on the whole so poor that at least one IMDb writer came to the conclusion that the Waylans chose poor jokes DELIBERATELY - in order to make a meta-joke at the expense of people who will laugh at any old rubbish.  Let's take this idea seriously for a minute.Yes, I know, but play with me.Meta-jokes CAN be done well.  Does anyone remember the ""drinking party"" episode from the second series of ""Blackadder""?  The revellers made the most hideously unimaginative double entendres possible, so that Curtis and Elton could make fun of their puerile sense of humour.  It worked.  The difference between this scene and ""Scary Movie"" is this: while the puerile jokes in the ""Blackadder"" sequence were not in the least bit funny, the scene as a whole WAS funny.  The Wayanses, on the other hand, throw us a lot of bad jokes - and that's all they do.  Even if all these jokes taken together make one big meta-joke, they don't make a good movie.Nor do they make a good meta-joke.  Why did audiences titter at all the references to farting, or at the constant reminders that such-and-such a character was gay?  Nine times out of ten,  NOT because they were stupid. People who managed to laugh during ""Scary Movie"" by and large laughed out of good will.  When one is told a joke one WANTS it to be funny.  I found myself thinking, again and again: okay, I came for satire and instead I'm being bludgeoned by ""Ha ha, he said the word 'bum'"" humour; still, there is SOME satire here and there, and I don't want to be a grouch, so I'll play along.""  If the Wayanses really WERE trying to make me laugh at bad jokes so that they could make fun of me for finding them funny (N.B.: I'm sure they weren't) ... well, the joke's on them, not me.  To the extent that I found the jokes funny at all I was only being polite.And note where the lamest of the lame jokes are concentrated: in the purely functional scenes, the ones in which all the plot exposition takes place. The Waylans clearly have no idea what to do with such scenes.  EVERY scene in the film crawls along at exactly the same pace and in exactly the same way; but while the Waylans manage to crack some decent jokes in the horror scenes, in the non-horror scenes, the ordinary dialogue scenes, the standing-around-talking scenes, the Wayanses can think of nothing better to use as padding but irrelevant jokes about gays, blacks, drugs, sex, and alimentary tracts.  This would matter less if they could be bothered to think up GOOD jokes about gays, blacks, etc.",Scary Movie
77,Movie-ManDan,Redefined Spoofs.,10,17 September 2015,"Parody movies have been around for decades. Mel Brooks was very well known for making fun of various movies such as Star Wars by creating Space Balls. Just as the style began to become stale, Scary Movie enters the scene and pushes new boundaries, making it the movie that changed the way movies make fun of others.Scary Movie was actually the original name of Scream. Scream redefined horror by ridding the typical horror clichés that made them mindless. Scream had substance and brains. Keenan Ivory Wayans successfully keeps the substance and brain of Scream and takes the smarts of other movies to make one big laugh fest. The two main movies is parodies are Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. It also includes Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek among others. Most spoof movies these days to atrocious jobs of putting various things together. Movies like Disaster Movie and Epic Movie throw in random things just because they can. Scary Movie uses a solid bases and similar things that flow together. Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer are both teen horror movies that deal with a killer whom they try to find out his identity. Dawson's Creek is a high school drama, and that vibe could easily fit in with the horrors. Basically, this movie masters thrown-in humour: very difficult thing to do.As I mentioned, the basis of the movie combines Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.The characters are made fun of in truly hilarious ways and some characters are redone to be more funny. In Scream, David Arquette is a rookie cop, and his ""other"" in is a retarded officer named Doofy. They really did an excellent job of bending his character. Then there's Shawn Wayans who plays a seemingly gay character who is so funny. There were no hints of homosexuality of the other movies, but Shawn works well. In fact, each of our main characters are well-developed and hilarious.The movie works on so many levels, mainly the comedy. I laugh so hard every time I watch this. This pushed the boundaries for R-rated comedies. Since Scary Movie's release in 2000, every teen comedy tries to emulate this with most fail and none coming close.3.5/4",Scary Movie

Even thought I believe this is the less funny out of the 4 scary movies, I must admit this is still pretty good. Cindy Campbell is a classic character that people won't ever forget, and you see, in this picture she still didn't have the big attention she has in the following versions-- she becomes the main role after this picture.

They are not funny, they only think they are funny. As a result, I can imagine they laughed more during the making of this film than the audience did when watching it.It's unashamedly bad. Not funny.

I just loved all those references to the for the nineties typical teenage slasher / horror movies like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". And even the fact that they had used a scene that was clearly inspired on ""The Matrix"" and one that referred to ""The Sixth Sense"" were direct hits. But since then a lot has changed and the genre of horror movies on which this was a spoof, no longer seems to exist. So I found myself posing the question whether I would still like it all that much...Telling something about the story isn't very easy. I guess that you can best try to find a resume of the horror movies that I mentioned in the previous paragraph, since this entire movie more or less follows the same story lines. The entire movie is in fact a literal, but comical version of these movies.If you are looking for a somewhat intelligent comedy, than this movie will once again be a huge disappointment. The Wayans brothers know no shame and find humor in every bodily function. What you'll get are jokes about farting and sex and sometimes one about smoking pot. Personally I still could laugh with most of the jokes, because I already knew that I didn't have to expect anything decent from this movie, but I can imagine that there are people who will be very offended by it.I'm not even going to tell something about the acting, because there isn't really any to be seen in this movie. This was just a bunch of young people re-enacting several scenes from all kinds of (scary) movies, behaving like a bunch of fools, but also having some excellent fun while doing so. And it shows. It's probably the best reason why you should watch this movie. It's completely over-the-top, couldn't be more opposite from subtle humor and hasn't got anything to offer that comes close to a story line, but I still like it because it's so absurd and that's why I give it a 7/10, maybe a 7.5/10.",Scary Movie

83,brando647,The First (and Best) from the Spoof Craze,8,23 October 2012,"At the beginning of the millennium, there was resurgence in the spoof movie genre that would eventually lead to an overwhelming flood of horrible films over the next decade. The majority of those films are the fault of writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, two of the writers who had a hand in SCARY MOVIE. But back before Friedberg and Seltzer committed atrocities like EPIC MOVIE and SUPERHERO MOVIE, the Wayans were involved and everything was a lot better. This came out when I was still in high school and, just to be sure I wasn't remembering it through some naïve juvenile haze, I dug it out of my collection and watched it again. Not surprisingly, it held up well over the years. SCARY MOVIE is a spoof of the popular slasher movies of the time, primarily SCREAM and SCREAM 2. A masked killer has come to B. A. Corpse High School and he seems to be targeting Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) and her friends. Really, the plot isn't important here and neither are the characters. Everyone in the movie is a direct spoof of the common horror movie archetypes: the horny boyfriend, the virgin heroine, the ditzy bombshell/cheerleader, etc. A movie like this is all about the gags and a constant stream of parodies and pop culture references, but that doesn't mean it's as bad as the stream of garbage that followed. No, the original SCARY MOVIE (for those who haven't seen it) is hilarious, even more than a decade later.The problem with all the spoof movies that gummed up theaters for nearly a decade before studios realized people were tired of paying for crap was that they believed a pop culture reference alone was enough to garner laughs. Well, they're wrong, and it didn't take them long to slip up. This is really the only good spoof to come out of the fad. The original tag line for the movie promised ""no sequels"" and I wish they'd kept to their word because the rest of them were awful and it only got worse when Friedberg and Seltzer tried to branch out to other genres. SCARY MOVIE was good and they should have left it at that but, you know money. This movie made serious bank at the box office so I guess it should've been expected that it'd be milked for all it was worth and then some. Lame legacy aside, SCARY MOVIE is great fun and pokes fun at all of the popular thrillers of the time with references to SCREAM, SCREAM 2, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, URBAN LEGEND, and more. The core parody is that of the original SCREAM. While SCREAM itself was a satire of the horror movie clichés, SCARY MOVIE just straight up made fun of them. Busty babes running from masked killers, tripping and falling or running upstairs. Bumbling cops on the case and horny teenage motivations. And then there's the stoner humor. Of course, there's the stoner humor.The movie's pretty dated now. It references a Budweiser commercial that anyone born in the mid to late nineties probably doesn't even remember, but it compensates by taking the usual easy shots at white people, black people, fat people, stoners, blondes, etc. Pretty much every stereotype you can think of, but never crossing the line into offensiveness. At least, not in my opinion. It's actually pretty tough to write out a comment/review to support SCARY MOVIE without discussing the gags, because that's all the movie boils down to. I'm not looking to ruin the jokes for anyone who hasn't seen it and might be thinking of checking it out for the first time. The cast is pretty well done with Shawn and Marlon Wayans, Anna Faris (in her ""breakout"" role), Shannon Elizabeth, and Cheri Oteri (in the only role I've seen her play outside of SNL). SCARY MOVIE is a good movie to get wasted and settle in for some cheap laughs with. Just don't get your hopes up that the rest are anywhere near as good.",Scary Movie

The famous ""first ten minute"" scene in Scream is spoofed in the prologue of Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra comes in to make a cameo, like all Scary Movie film does.This film is very funny, crude, and gross. No wonder the franchise is a huge success in the box office. Anna Faris, the main character, is the heroine. She gives a funny performance. The teens are REALLY DUMB in this film. If you like smart comedies, stay far away from this series. When the killer kills the characters, we wouldn't care because it might be funny or because the characters are just too stupid to die.There are many ""laugh-out-loud"" moments in this film.

I try to analyse and critique every movie I see with the same standards and level of judgement.  I think there are FAR too many teen comedies out there on the back of the success of the 'quite good' ""American Pie"", and most of them don't hit the mark and seem to be just trying to push the envelope as far as tasteless humour goes.   ""Scary Movie"" is no different to the rest in that respect, and yet I found it hilarious!  It probably had something to do with the fact that I was with a group of friends as part of a birthday celebration, and was thus determined to have a good time; but ""Scary Movie"" definitely hit the spot. Rightly or wrongly, I gave it a 9. On a second viewing I probably wouldn't rate it anywhere NEAR that high, but I really enjoyed myself the first time. I think much of the film's success is due to its philosophy of joke telling: You fling enough mud and some of it will stick.   (SLIGHT SPOILER)   On a last note, I do think it was a stupid idea to include a skit of the Budweiser 'Whassup?' ad.

You better make sure that you have something funny to say and an intelligent way of saying it because audiences, at one time or another, have already done, in their minds, what you are putting on film.  We've already made cracks about how slow Michael, Jason and Freddy walk.  We've already made comments about how it always seems to rain when women are running around with their see through blouses on.  And we have already commented on how stupid Jennifer Love Hewitt is in I Know What You Did....  So to make a film that pokes fun at these films is not an afternoon excursion.  It takes time, energy and research.  And as a horror movie buff, an obsessed horror movie buff, I didn't have high hopes for this film, even with it's funny trailer.  I thought that all the funny parts would be in the trailer and I would be left feeling cheated again as an apathetic spoof film about horror films came and went. 
I am glad to say that I was wrong.  Not only is Scary Movie intelligent at it's look at scary movies over the last ten years, it is intelligent with many of it's other jokes.  There is nothing prosaic about this effort.
Scary Movie doesn't hold anything back.  And I think it has the benefit of having Keanen Ivory Wayans direct it.  Because some of the funnier jokes in the film are at the expense of black people.  And since it is written by the Wayans ( who are very black )they can get away with more than a white guy could with some of the same material.  For example, there is a scene in a movie theater when Regina King is talking too loud and she ends up being sliced, knifed and diced by the all white crowd.  It is a very fuuny scene but one that a white director would have taken flack for no doubt.  And when Marlon Wayans is telling another character about how there was a shooting at an all black showing of SCREAM, and everyone just left, again, it is funny but it is more accepted because it is a black person directing a black person.  This is not to say that all the humour in the film is directed at blacks, because it's not.  It's just that many of the scenes where blacks seem to make fun of themselves gets some of the best laughs. 
Some of the funniest jokes were about penises.  One in particular when the Ryan Phillipe character from I KNOW has a picture delivered to him and it is him with an incredibly small member.  He then shouts out, "" This isn't funny.  Having a small dick is a disability!  You wouldn't make fun of a guy in a wheel chair now would you? ""  The crowd didn't stop laughing at that one for quite some time.  There is also a funny parody on the ""Whas UP!!! "" Budweiser commercial and in one of the funniest scenes I have seen in any film in quite some time, a weed cutter is used to shave someone's pubic hair that has grown out of control. Scary Movie has a joke in every scene in the film and that is going to mean that not all of them are going to work, but most of them do.  And not only is this film funny but it is smart.  You will recall in Scream, the high school principal was from a 70's T.V. sitcom, well, so is he in here.  You will recall in I STILL KNOW.... that when Jennifer Hewitt screams at the top of her lungs "" What are you waiting for?"" as the camera shoots an overhead view of her with her shirt wide open, so does Wayans.  And the impression of Dewey is priceless.  Also, Shawn Wayans does a pretty good impression of Mathew Lilliard from Scream, when near the end of the film he almost spits his word out to the camera.  There are so many great moments of familiarity in here that if you do know the films that are being parodied, you are almost tempted to say to yourself, ""Oh that's stupid, that part is so easy to spoof"" until you realize that it takes a great mind that has at least somewhat of a love for the kinds of films he is making fun of. 
Scary Movie is funny, there is no doubt that but it is also smart and familiar.  And that's not easy to do.  This film is also raunchy, gross and it will probably be one of the top films of the summer.  This has sleeper written all over it and that can be attributed to the Wayans brothers.  They have written and directed a wonderful spoof of horror films and of films in general.  And I highly recommend it.7.5 out of 10... Also watch for the smart take on the Usual Suspects.  And see if you can figure out when it is going to come.  It is also one of the funnier parts of the movie and it will make you curse yourself for not seeing it coming.",Scary Movie

95,Beta_Gallinger,"Not the worst of those spoofs with titles that end with ""Movie"", but still bad!",3,14 September 2007,"Recently, I saw ""Epic Movie"", which is horrendous, but that didn't surprise me, seeing that it was in the IMDb Bottom 100. Soon afterwards, however, I looked at the IMDb page for ""Scary Movie"", knowing that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the writers and directors of ""Epic Movie"", were behind this film as well (they were two of the six writers). I saw that it didn't have a very high rating, but not a low one, either (one well above those in the Bottom 100), I decided to give it a try. However, although it wasn't quite as bad, I have lost all faith in Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's comic abilities, and probably those of all the other writers as well! A group of teenagers (Cindy Campbell, Greg Phillipe, Bobby Prinze, Brenda Meeks, Buffy Gilmore, and Ray Wilkins) all find that their lives are at stake when a masked serial killer begins to stalk them! Last Halloween, while on the road, these six teenagers accidentally hit a man and killed him. Obviously not wanting to be arrested, they have kept this incident a secret. However, it appears that this serial killer may know about it, and that could be why he's after them! With a killing spree happening around town, what are these teenagers supposed to do?! I'm not going to get into the movie parodies in ""Scary Movie"" and what I think of them (I haven't seen all of those movies). Instead, I will just focus on what this movie is like as a comedy. As such, it's quite bad, in my opinion. I'll admit that unlike ""Epic Movie"", it did make me laugh or smile a bit at times early on (maybe a bit guiltily), but for the vast majority of it, I did not laugh at all. In fact, just like in ""Epic Movie"", I saw some terrible scenes that were supposed to be funny, such as the ""I went poopy"" one, several genitalia gags, and probably others that I can't think of right now, and don't want to! When it's not terrible, it's just boring. I assure you, I am NOT one of those people who hate all movies with this kind of extreme crudeness, it's just that those behind this particular one simply don't know how to do that kind of comedy.Well, I've only seen two of the spoof movies from this decade with a title that ends with ""Movie"" (all of which Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had something to do with), but I think I've seen enough. I do not intend to ever watch any of the ""Scary Movie"" sequels, nor do I intend to watch ""Date Movie"". It's too bad I didn't watch ""Scary Movie"" before any of the others. If the rest are supposed to be worse than this one that started it all, seeing it first would have stopped me from watching any of the rest! I don't even understand the 5.8 rating, and I'm sure I never will! Even for those who usually like parody movies and/or offensive R-rated comedies, this could be sorely disappointing!",Scary Movie

Carmen Electra's role, basically an opening scene cameo, is hilarious as they pan another horror movie, and I love when she gets stabbed and pulls out a breast implant and throws it away. To me that shows a lot of self confidence and she is comfortable with the fact that she had breast enlargement. Pretty cool actually.

98,Stampsfightclub,Unfliching crude teen spoof,8,5 November 2008,"A group of teenagers are targeted by a serial killer exactly one year after they ran over a man.In 1996 Scream was a film that reinstated the slasher horror genre and Keenan Ivory Wayans' spoof is a true and funny testament to that horror classic.Modern spoofs often contain slapstick humour, stereotypes and a fairly predictable plot. This is evident with this 2000 hit and is pure silly entertainment that you can't help but love and laugh along with despite the conventional approach.Recent releases such as Disaster Movie have brought the spoof genre to an all time low. Filled with unfunny parodies, attacks on celebrities and ultimately silly plots, it's a wonder why they are still being made. In the nineties we had classic spoofs such as Austin Powers and Naked Gun, silly but with a sharp and entertaining plot.Scary Movie has such a good plot, choosing to focus its energy on Scream and I know what you did last summer, that you forget its intentions to demean other films and therefore, are able to sit back and enjoy the ride.The opening is pretty much Scream with some great moments of slapstick in, and crude slapstick at that with safety signs, sexual references and an out of control car.This opening sets the tone for an engrossing comedy and viewers are thrust head first into typical teenagers lives, filled with some fine slapstick humour and stereotypes lives There is a consistency to Scary Movie. There is little wondering away from its objective to tell the tale of the teens being targeted and therefore achieves a realism in its own context. With follow-ups 2, 3 and 4 there is a tendency to run away from the main narrative and have sillier skits that this original remains the most sophisticated to date.Though the comedy is frequently predictable, there is still elegance about the way Wayans achieves this effect. His close and unflinching style gives that humorous and equally horrific substance to fly across both genres into this tantalizing tale.Spoofs are always worth viewing for their sheer cheek to criticize blockbusters and Scary Movie is no exception with its pin point accuracy on Scream and other horrors. Filled with likable slapstick and funny stereotypes, this is the finest in the series",Scary Movie
99,CharltonBoy,Living proof that the yanks can't do comedy.,2,27 February 2001,"I find it hard to put into words how bad this film is. Scary movie is supposed to be a spoof of all the horror movies that have hit our screens over the past few years. The problem is i thought spoofs were meant to be funny. This is so amazingly unfunny it is hard to believe.I sat through this movie , stunned at how bad the so called jokes were. The was only one funny moment in this film and that was when the Gym teacher revealed her secret. One funny scene in 90 minutes is as bad a it gets when it comes to comedy. I find far too many Hollywood films stink like Scary Movie and i have come to the conclusion that it is the childish American sense of humour that does not appeal to me. Why does every US comedy involve farting? It was funny first time round with Blazing Saddles but why have we had to endure it in nearly every other American comedy since? Have they never heard of overkill? This film is so bad that the only way to sum it up is to say Please, please dont waste an hour and an half of you life with it. 2 out of 10.",Scary Movie

The only two spoofs I like are the The Spy who Shagged Me and this one. This one (Scary Movie) is really pretty good. It has some real big fat laughs, where you almost spill your guts and not too many where you think: too extreme (I thought there were only two or three). That is a good thing. Plus it is pretty violent sometimes too, which I always like and the trailer did not show the best jokes at all. I actually thought after watching the trailer that this would suck be dumb, but it didn't, because you get all sucked in to the films lameness. One big flaw though is, that it almost follows the original storylines of Scream and I know what you did last summer.

102,The_Movie_Cat,"""Would you laugh at someone in a wheelchair?""",4,12 September 2000,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS.
Of course, that's something the Wayans brothers have already done in their hilarious spoof of ghetto movies, ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood"".Here they push the bad taste envelope further, with mockery of the mentally retarded and violence against women. Whereas such things may be forgivable if done right, Scary Movie's biggest crime is that it simply isn't very funny.There are some amusing moments, of course. A Blair Witch mickey-take got the biggest laugh from the audience, and a brief Sixth Sense parody is nice. Perhaps my favourite bit is the masked killer's inept attempts to hide (""I can see your feet sticking out from behind the sofa"") but how funny can seeing people stabbed to death be?Similarly, the on-screen use of marijuana (something now fashionable in cinema since American Beauty) produces some comic moments, but the image of the stoned killer, his mask distorted into a bemused smile, is not the sort of humour that travels across the Atlantic.It's impossible to say why the movie isn't that good, and certainly after Don't... (written by half as many people, yet at least twice as funny) I was desperately looking forward to this. Maybe it's the underuse of Marlon Wayans, or the film's major flaw: you can't spoof a spoof. Breaking the fourth wall and adding a succession of in-jokes doesn't work when 90% of the film is based on the already self-referential Scream. And the fact that it's plot structure is exactly identical to that of Scream means that this is a movie who's joke is four years too late.The best jokes are the ones that don't refer to Wes Craven's film, and consequently show more imagination. There's some satire of cinema etiquette in a theatre, some nice mock trailers, and some literal toilet humour, with a sideways look at condom machines and urinal culture. This element also raises an important issue about the nature of censorship, if not intentionally: Shawn Wayans finds himself stabbed to death by a penis in one of the more bizarre moments. The fact that this plastic prosthetic is incredibly realistic makes a mockery of the censorship board: erections are not allowed to be shown in cinema, but incredibly realistic fakes  that by all accounts could be the genuine article - are. Weird.
There are some moments of genuine social satire, when the movie gets to show its teeth. Particularly notable are the people who dial 911 and recieve a quicker service by registering that they're white. Or the police station where officers stand around a Rodney King beat 'em up arcade game. Generally, though, the humour is soft and lacking in focus. Ultimately, I laughed heartily for fifteen minutes at Scary Movie. The film is 89 minutes long. Disappointing.",Scary Movie
103,fernandoschiavi,"Scary Movie is an immediate classic of the comedy genre, engaging in the success of the nineties horror and appropriating it to produce",6,24 April 2021,"Certainly a film, in fact a whole series, that divides opinions and that manages to be at the same time one of the most commented and remembered comedies of all time, as a film of terrible taste and of extremely questioned quality. That is how in the year 2000 the big box office hit hit, an undeniable fact, Scary Movie, created by the Wayans brothers, commanded here on the big screen by the older brother Keenen Ivory Wayans.The script for the feature film is actually a combination of two others that were acquired by Dimension Films: 'Last Summer I Screamed Because Halloween Fell On Friday The 13th', written by Phil Beauman, and 'Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween ', written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The slasher parody was released 21 years ago in North American theaters and has since won three sequels and a reboot starring Ashley Tisdale. Of course, everyone knows that the saga created by the brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans is bad - but it remains our ""guilty pleasure"" to this day for the bizarre script and ridiculous scenes that reflect the level of irreverence in the feature films.Twenty years after the release, it seems reasonable to say that Scary Movie is a classic, especially a classic of the genre. If the feature is considered bad for being crude, then voilà, we are facing a work that teaches the steps of how to make a crude film. The purpose of comedy is one: laughter. It gets even more interesting when you notice that big holes in the script and in the scene of the film itself are part of a total parody of cinematographic art. It is not free that the bloody knife gets cleaned up suddenly, or that things disappear: it is, to a large extent, a general satire of the commonplaces of the films that the film is dedicated to parody, not only of them, but of cinema in general. Scary Movie is the cinema talking about the cinema. But it is also the cinema talking about the ridiculous. The most common ridicule: the girl who changes clothes at school when her father leaves her at school; everyday malice; of ulterior motives, etc.The film came up with the proposal to satirize great successes of recent cinema, especially those of terror, through a comedy with a foot in suspense. The film is really daring and fulfills its role, having here in this first part of the series, a whole background of the script and inserting several characters from the film ""Scream"" by Wes Craven and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer "", where they mixed the events of being run over, the beauty contest with death, the roles in which the killer warned that he knew they were involved in a murder, with virtually identical scenes from the Craven film and using mainly the image of the murderer Ghostface and playing with their faces, knife and how the deaths were prepared and inserted. In addition to these two base films, the various other quotes also include famous American TV series, big hits like ""American Pie"". ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Blair Witch"" with a very funny scene, ""The Sixth Sense"", as well as a fight scene with clear allusion to the classic fiction Matrix and even a quick scene involving Steven's ""Amistad"" Spielberg and James Cameron's ""Titanic"". The idea was precisely to try to reproduce the same close-ups of cameras, almost identical scenarios in the greatest possible number of the base films and inserting the other films mentioned during the scenes.The cast does what it sets out to do. Anna Faris proved to be a good choice when mixing the good, naive, sweet girl, always at the mercy of her pursuer and at the same time able to behave like a depraved one. The rest of the cast like Shannon Elizabeth, Regina Hall, Marlon and Shawn Wayans, Jon Abrahams are also doing well on the scene. The homoerotic subtext drives the entire narrative, from beginning to end, but this context is never given explicitly, it gradually reveals itself, and the central character of this homoerotic parody is Ray, played by Shawn Wayans, a non-straight man, that gives genius scoops about your sexuality. The public bathroom scene is very suggestive and the way he dies in the toilet leaves a very perverted message between the lines, which is hilarious. In the end, Bobby (Jon Abrahams) and Ray end up dead, one on top of the other, simulating la petite mort. Another strong point is the sexual neurosis of the characters: as in American Pie, everyone, all the time, from young to old, is thinking about sex. Most of the time, things will end up in sex or in a sexual joke, but in a very ordinary way.The way in which the director works with self-referential cinema is a merit. In addition to the constant references, the central stylistic aspect of the Scary Movie film series is parody and nonsense. Every person, at a given moment, when watching a horror movie, has already asked himself: ""But why don't you get out of there? Can't you see that the killer is nearby?"" And then, afterwards, a predictable death occurs, since the character went to meet death. This encounter of the characters with death is worked in genius in the parody and several scenes play with this situation by showing some characters who choose, willingly, to follow a road sign that literally points to death. Or even when Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth) meets the killer in the locker room and makes fun of the horror movie scripts: ""So, now do I fall? Do I start to bleed? Wait, I have to break my leg"". This scene recalls many horror classics in which the killer chases the victim, who creeps along the way, stumbles, falls, takes time to get up, etc. - rough situations of the horror genre.The basic premise is very welcome: to satirize modern teen horror films. However, whoever expects a fun, intelligent or surreal satire (like ""Airplane!"", or ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!""), can forget. Scary Movie is bad taste on eschatology, it is low on crap. A succession of gags aimed at that pre-teen audience that has learned to speak bad language and thinks this is great. Interestingly, the quality of the film is inversely proportional to its box office: in the US alone, Scary Movie earned an impressive $ 160 million (cost 19 million).It is certain that the film will fully please its target audience (teenagers) because as it could not be there are many jokes regarding drugs, stereotyped but funny characters and an avalanche of scenes of sexual nature and profanity that makes us extremely embarrassed if we are not just watching the film with our friends, as well as blood and murders used in a funny way. As if all that were not enough, the main thing here is to have the films mentioned as a reference still fresh in the audience's head and the inevitable comparison is precisely what makes the film interesting. The Wayans brothers have the sole intention of entertaining and causing an hour and a half of relaxation, but if the audience wants some quality in the script, a technical refinement, twists with a surprising ending will certainly be disappointed and be faced with a show of mistakes of continuity in editing, characters who die and who will return in the next film, ill-conceived suspense theorist, bad visual effects and stereotyped and poorly constructed characters, he found what he was looking for.Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, the film has a very important representation. Despite the comedy, the film introduces black protagonists and offers them filmic importance, treating the subject of racism lightly, with great humor, without seeking the problematization that prevails in cinema two decades after its release. When Cindy (Anna Faris), the protagonist, is in trouble, the management jokes about how quickly the police are able to better meet some demands due to the racial aspect by putting, in Cindy's mouth, the following sentence: ""White girl in trouble"", In a message sent to the police - and four police cars appear immediately.Scary Movie is an immediate classic of the comedy genre, engaging in the success of the nineties horror and appropriating it to produce. Twenty years old, Wayans' feature is the portrait of a generation and a very powerful affective memory. Metalinguistic, funny, creative, enduring and risky, Scary Movie is a tribute and a ridicule of himself and the cinema itself, which makes him famous today, for better or worse. For what it is proposed, the film brought a new freshness to the comedy and it is not for nothing that it was a huge success at the worldwide box office and is one of the current phenomena of the genre. It serves to laugh without commitment alone or with friends, because in the family it will be a competition for those who will be ashamed more often during the projection. In the end, the question remains: Decades after the release of Scary Movie and with the sect of the politically correct dominating Hollywood and the artistic world with a left bias, will it be that such a franchise, which is politically incorrect in essence, would the success you have had in the past? It would probably be another one of the films ""canceled"" by the social media militancy.",Scary Movie

Director Keenen Ivory Wayans, getting back into the groove of parody after his previous ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,"" and his writer/actor brothers, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, create a motion picture comic in so many ways, not one homosexual reference is left out, no racial gag is too offensive, not a minute passes without some kind of dirty joke occurring: every kind of crude bodily function and exaggerated sex possible. Many are clever, funny, and unexpected; others fall flat. Regardless, ""Scary Movie"" contains the maximum amount of comic sexual content that the R-rating allows, thus is this years envelope pusher.The movie provides a wide variety of targets, but aims squarely at the work of horror writer Kevin Williamson, like the ""Scream"" trilogy and the first and second ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" The film also offers spoofs of and or refers to ""The Matrix,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Amistad,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Carrie,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" ""The Crying Game,"" ""The Usual Suspects,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""Kazaam,"" and even the television teen romp ""Dawson's Creek."" These parody scenes take the position a plot would normally occupy. There is simply an outline of characters, mostly teens played by actors in their late 20s and 30s, who attend B. A. Corpse High School, for the ghost-faced killer with a hook for a hand to spear out breast implants, chop off heads, stick a penis though a character's ear, and cause a riot inside of a movie theater where a profoundly rude pedestrian is mulled by the upset crowd.""Scary Movie"" has the correct timing to spew such raucous humor at audiences, in the middle of a summer where effective comedies are few and far between. The film is amusing with the same kind of raunchy style teen sex comedies get away with. I have always enjoyed screwball films a great deal, and its no coincidence that I know Leslie Nielsen to be the ultimate in slapstick. Like Leslie Nielsen flicks, ""Scary Movie"" is at its best with slapstick parody and will undoubtedly deliver your dollars worth if you have an education in this film's many targets. Unlike Nielsen movies, however, ""Scary Movie"" provides less comic edge and tries instead to beak new ground in offensiveness. After watching one of Nielsen's better credits, I walk away with a smile on my face, feeling like I have just been tickled. As I walked out of this comedy, I felt like I had just been flicked off.",Scary Movie
116,the red duchess,"Fun, if unambitious.",6,11 September 2000,"'Scary Movie', itself part of a long lineage of movie spoofs of culturally prominent movies, has provoked a similarly ancient critical kneejerk reaction, whereby the present offering under consideration is deemed beneath contempt, puerile, imbecilic, lacking any kind of wit or invention, especially when compared to a recent, once reviled predecessor.  Last year saw the bizarre sight of 'Porky's' being used as a stick of quality with which to beat the wretched 'American Pie'.  Now 'Scary Movie' has none of 'Pie''s saving graces.Of course it doesn't.  'Pie' was an extremely rich and intelligent comedy of manners, with strong emotional underpinning and humour firmly rooted in character.  And I said so last year.  'Scary' cannot be a comedy of character, because protagonists in a spoof are mere ciphers, at the service of the satirical demands of each scene.  So, Brenda, streetwise and coolly cynical at the beginning of the film, becomes a shrieking boor at the screening of 'Shakespeare in love' (an understandable response).  This isn't a development of character or situation - the filmmakers have different things to say in each scene.  Interestingly, the first scene is based on a kind of realistic, character-based comedy, however mocked - the move towards abstraction is typical of the movie as a whole.It is initially dismaying how crude the satire actually is, merely a re-enacting of a handful of scenes that weren't terribly serious in the first place.  A far more devastating spoof would puncture the pretensions of 'Schindler's List', say, but no-one would ever dare.  You could say the same about 'Airplane' - the original 'Airport' films were hardly weighty philosophical tracts - but its spoof's humour has actually transcended its source, whereby it is eminently possible to enjoy 'Airplane' without ever having seen the originals.  If you have not seen the 'Scream' trilogy or 'I know what you did last summer', at least, you will miss 99% of this movie; and even if you have, the humour rarely stretches beyond recognition.A lot of people have complained, as they did with 'Casino Royale' or 'Austin Powers', that you cannot spoof a spoof, that the original 'Scream' itself was a sly wink at a jaded genre.  But look at how quickly the fresh  air of that film became dank with complacency, how its codes and practices quickly became the mainstream, unassailable, monolithic.  'Scary Movie' is perfectly right to attack it, but it only scratches at its superficials - never catches the deeper currents of Craven's work, the analysis of play and family, the Shakespearean pretensions.Once one gets past dismay at the primitive satire, the casual homophobia, the fact that the creator is in his late 30s and severely out of touch with the milieu he's describing, 'Movie' is still a very, very funny movie in spirits, outrageous physical humour being timeless in its appeal.  There are some good serious points - the overwhelming whiteness of a genre not quite deconstructed by Craven; the casual racism of arthouse snobs; the brilliant 'Amistad II' joke which exposes the double standards of Hollywood worthiness more effectively than a thousand wordy articles.Many of the jokes are deadly accurate male adolescent fears - fear of the reality of female sexuality (brilliantly visualised in the dismemberment of SHannon Elizabeth, straight out of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'), concomitant anxieties about gender.  But the truth is we watch - and enjoy - 'Movie' for the pendulous testes and volcanic ejaculate jokes.  Yeah, fun.",Scary Movie
117,FlickJunkie-2,Funny but tasteless horror parody/sex farce,4,7 January 2001,"Now here's a clever idea, a parody of a satire.  `Scary Movie' spends most of its time lampooning `Scream' which was a tongue in cheek satire of horror flicks.  It also takes pot shots at various other successful horror flicks such as `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Blair Witch Project'. Unfortunately, this film's cleverness is overshadowed by its bad taste.This is a Wayans home movie, written by Shawn and Marlon and directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans.  There really isn't any story, just a succession of skits based sometimes verbatim on various horror flicks.  In actuality, this is more of a raunchy sex farce than a horror movie.  It has a puerile sexual obsession throwing as much bawdiness as possible into every scene.  The jokes are crass and vulgar guttersnipe humor.  This is sledgehammer comedy, with everything bluntly stated and no subtlety whatever.  Though the slapstick is funny, even hilarious at times, there are so many tastelessly offensive lines that the net result is negative.  The Wayans take political incorrectness to its irrational extreme, taking the liberty of mocking just about every group possible with exaggerated stereotypes.The acting is nothing special except for Dave Sheridan as Sheriff Doofy who is worth the price of admission.  The direction is also mundane.  I must give the Wayans brothers credit for knowing their audience.  This film is clearly targeted at the 18 to 25  demographic (in reality probably 14 to 25) and panders mercilessly to their fixations (sex, drugs and sex).  It is likely to offend the sensibilities of a large number of people, but after grossing more than $150 million at the box office, the Wayans brothers can shrug that off as irrelevant (a sequel is already in the works).As I watched this film, I laughed hysterically in some parts and I was revolted by others.  However, since the good is outweighed by the bad, I rated it a 4/10.  Add one point for every year of age under 25.  Those who are offended by foul sexual humor should steer clear.",Scary Movie

No movie or celebrity is safe from the Wayan Brothers as they form some sort of plot out of many, many different movies of many different genres.

This is one of the first in the notoriously unsuccessful spoof genre. But, believe it or not, this one is perfectly OK. The jokes are hit and miss, but when they hit they are genuinely funny. The film feels considerably less desperate than many spoofs and is (slightly) less juvenile. It's extremely low and earns its 18 certificate with ease, but the vulgarity isn't always completely mirthless. It is offensive, but manages not to overstep the line. It is admittedly quite funny at times. The reason why my rating isn't higher is because not all of the jokes work, it can be very annoying and leans too heavily on crude jokes. The thing which really irritates me about Scary Movie is its spoofing of Scream, which was itself a parody. This is not the level of The Naked Gun, which is my favourite comedy ever, or Airplane, and does run out of gas before the end but this represents a partially successful parody of horror movies which at the very least is funny sporadically and is miles better than the cinematic wasteland of Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans.6/10",Scary Movie

128,FilmFanInTheHouse,The Start of the End of Parody Films,6,13 July 2007,"Scary Movie (2000, Dir. Keenen Ivory Wayans)StoryA group of teenagers including Cindy Campbell and Bobby Prinze, accidentally hit a man when driving, and dispose of the body, but now they are being stalked by a very recognisable masked killer. The victim count increases, whilst Cindy must survive the carnage that has she has seen in so many films before.ActorsAt the time of the release, many of the stars featured in 'Scary Movie' are young and very unrecognisable among the audience. They don't do a bad job in it and really fit into the world of parody films. They seem to fit in so much that at times, they do seem a tad bit annoying, but for the tone of the film they seem suitable for it. Music'Scary Movie' is simply a parody of horror films, and it only seems right that the music of the scenes fits the film in which it parodies. The films which it's parodying, especially 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' have a deep, beating, suspenseful theme, and 'Scary Movie' produces music very music like it. Special EffectsLike many parody films, the special effects are seen ad more comedic effects. Instead of using digital effects in this film, there is a more common use of physical props. Sometime, they look quite realistic and disgusting, such as the testicles appearing and sometimes look quite unrealistic and again disgusting, such as a dummy of Cindy being sprayed with seamen. Overall, most of the effects in this film are either disgusting or sex related. ConclusionWhen the film was originally released, it was quite entertaining, but as the years go on, it starts to lose its comedic factor. This movie really seemed to be the start of the downfall of parody films, as we are now presented with such ""gems"" as Date Movie and Epic Movie.

129,jhaggardjr,"Not even close to ""Airplane!""",4,18 January 2001,"""Scary Movie"" was a big disappointment. Even though there were some funny moments here and there, this movie, which targets the ""Scream"" films, didn't make me laugh as hard as I thought it would. So I have one question: why did this movie gross $157 million at the box office last summer? It's a shame that ""Scary Movie"" has made more money than far more funnier comedy spoofs like ""Airplane!"", ""The Naked Gun"", and ""Blazing Saddles"". ""Scary Movie"" isn't even close to matching the same kind of laughs as those movies generated. Other comic spoofs like ""Spaceballs"", ""High Anxiety"", and ""Top Secret!"" have more laughs than this movie. This film just goes to show that Mel Brooks, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker can do comedy spoofs better. Why couldn't this movie be made by one of those guys?

130,dfle3,"Pointless 'remake' of ""Scream""",1,20 June 2008,"For some reason, the makers of this movie (the Wayans brothers-who also star) decided to pretty much, in my view, make a scene by scene remake of the vastly superior horror/comedy ""Scream"".""Scream"" was a witty hatchet job on all the conventions of the horror movie which we now take for granted-take for granted because of movies like ""Scream"".Now, presumably, the Wayans brothers missed all the wit of ""Scream"" and thought it would be funnier with low-brow humour. It definitely isn't.From memory (it's been a few years since I saw it on network TV) it also 'parodies' other movies of around the time, like ""I know what you did last summer"". Can't really remember too much about it...it's more a narrative movie than the latter sketch comedy movies in this franchise. In any case, if you've seen ""Scream"", you'll know how this movie plays out, but it will just have a more lowest common denominator sense of humour to it.Even though I did find this movie a dud (glad I didn't pay to see it!), I do recommend the sequel-the second one I think, which parodies such movies as The Exorcist. That one, especially, really marked the high water mark for these comedy makers.Not sure how many of this franchise I've seen afterwards...I do know that I saw the last cinema release (Scary Movie 4) and was again disappointed by the Wayans' efforts. Some of the latter movies had the involvement of the guys behind the brilliant comedy ""Flying High"" (a.k.a. ""Airplane!"") (Zucker and Abrahams), which I've reviewed here. They couldn't quite recapture the magic of their past efforts though.Overall-Scary Movie is a film to avoid.

132,chrisbrown6453,What a funny movie this was.,8,2 July 2001,"I think I was in the theater for Gladiator with one of my fellow movie-going friends when I saw the first preview for Scary Movie. It looked like it was going to be the most hilarious movie ever created, and fit right in with my interest in horror movies. It was so promising; full of potential.
So, did it live up to my expectations? Sort of. More a comedy than anything else, Scary Movie manages to make fun of recent horror movies, commercials, and even itself in an extremely short time. The characters are hilarious parodies of the original characters (Doofy/Dewey, Cindy/Sidney, Gale Weathers/Gale Hailstorm, etc), the killer is a wise-cracking half-wit, and even the soundtrack manages to be a parody, namely with the fake ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" in the bedroom scene with Cindy and her boyfriend.
Probably the most enjoyable parts of the movie are the ones that feature the killer. I'd consider him the best source of humor, with his out-of-place interactions with other characters. He's got a laid back attitude, smokes pot with his victims, does freestyle rap, and has casual phone conversation with other characters, claiming that he's just ""chillin'...and killin'..."", sounding just like your normal lazy guy with a slight twist. The Budweiser ""wasaaaaap"" spoof had me laughing so hard it hurt. The camera work, the changing voices, the goofy expressions, and the acting just came together so well. It was a great scene. My only real gripe about the movie is it's use of sexual comedy for the majority of the short 88 minutes. I guess it could be seen as a different take on the tastelessly frequent sex scenes in teenage horror movies, and is indeed funny the first few times. But it gets old. Fast. To me, it seems as if the sexual stuff is thrown in there as much as possible to entertain the types of people who are amused by ""Stiffy Lube"" novelty shirts, and is sort of an insult to intelligence. It feels like the movie's trying to cover up a lack of humor, but that's not necessary.",Scary Movie
133,willcundallreview,Lighten up and enjoy it,6,6 August 2015,"With all the various teen horrors's of the 90's and early 2000's, what else is better than to completely lampoon them in ridiculous style. Coming from a comedy styling much like that of films such as ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Gun"" but much more crude, comes Scary Movie, with it's jokes that are completely insane and plot that well, doesn't really make sense a lot of the time. I thought before I watched this that it looked like a movie I simply wouldn't like, but it surprised me, it is far far from perfect but still, a funny movie.It's all based around the fact the our main characters killed a man a year before and someone is out to get them all, but who?. Of course the story is just a rip off of ""Scream"" but that is the whole point, in fact at various times throughout it is alluded to. The narrative plays out like a child had tried to write a film but then some guys called the Wayans brothers came in and added some rude joke to the pot, oh and on that point about pot, well watch it and you'll see what I mean.The cast has people such as Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shannon Elizabeth and of course Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans who all could of destroyed their careers here. I did though enjoy the cast, they mix the right amount of humour into the bad acting that when by the end, you don't know if they couldn't act or not. One of my favourite characters from this is Shorty played by Marlon Wayans who's stoner comedy is hilarious and makes some scenes truly laugh out loud. And on the point of laugh out loud moments, the scream masked murderer is hilarious, watch out for when their mask changes facial expressions, just very funny. That all said about the jokes, the film can be near hit and miss. It is true probably that this is way too crude and stupid to be OK but I felt it is, it's enjoyable, doesn't overstay it's welcome and as mentioned before, can have laugh out loud moments too. Sure the Wayans don't always make the best decisions in film and when your film has Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer co writing it, you may expect your movie's reputation to drop really low. A thing I think the Wayans do well here though is mix the crude with genuine jokes, not only is it a good parody of slasher movies, but can turn serious moments into hilarious ones in a second.Now who might like this movie, well of course this is right up some people's street when it comes to comedy, it's the kind of movie where you might expect a critic to recommend this to teens. The truth is though that teens or well maybe people who were teens when all these horror movies were around, will really enjoy it and probably laugh(well at least I hope as if you don't laugh at this there isn't much else to enjoy). Don't just watch this like you expect it to be bad, give it a go and like me you might be surprised how funny you found it.Overall a movie I personally found kind of OK, maybe wrestled with my thoughts a little as to whether it was pretty so-so but I think all in all it is funny enough to be mostly positive stuff. Wouldn't really say people who consider themselves ""connoisseurs"" of fine comedy would enjoy this but to the hell with most comedy, this is stupid enough to be fun to watch.",Scary Movie

If I'm giving this movie a good review, then there's no point in telling you which question is correct.Here are three tips that you should know:1) Don't take this movie too seriously. 2) It's a comedy, not a slasher movie. 3)TRY TO HAVE FUN.Be sure to check out the sequels as well.",Scary Movie

Here we have a hilarious, though at times disgusting movie that has a plot all it's own even though much of it is made up by parody. Scary Movie is a spoof of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer with tidbits from other horror movies thrown in throughout.It tells the story of Cindy Campbell and her group of friends trying to survive a serial killer stalking their town a year after they accidentally killed a man with their car. The comedy type in this movie is pretty good. It's all visual gags that are at times funny enough to make your ribs hurt. However, there are times in the movie when the comedy resorts to immature bathroom humour, like a penis impaling someone's head, or a huge amount of semen blasting someone into the ceiling.The Wayons' Brothers did a good job with this movie, and it's definitely going to be recognized as one of the great comedies of the decade.

143,Ddey65,Slamming a genre that deserves it,6,3 June 2004,"Before I say anything else, let me point out that this movie CLOBBERS ""Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth(2000)(V)."" I only saw that movie, because I wanted to find out what the reference to DARIA was all about, proving once again how difficult it is to break the habit of seeing movies for miniscule reasons. Believe me, that reference is brief and worthless.   The movie starts off as an obvious spoof of the trailers for SCREAM, with Carmen Electra as Drew Barrymore makes the same stupid mistakes that lead to her murder, like so many victims in these movies. Somehow the story leads up to six friends at the dead girl's high school(aptly named B.A. Corpse High) who think that her killer is a fisherman they thought they killed in a hit and run last summer. Unlike the one in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, this guy survives and holds no grudges, but these kids are too stupid to figure it out. Anna Faris is the Neve Campbell-clone who takes a lot of lumps, not from her boyfriend Bobby(Jon Abrhams), who's more than ready to have sex than she is, but from her friend Buffy's(Shannon Elizabeth) beau Greg(Lochlyn Munro), who's got a short-fuse an some sexual issues of his own. Of course he's not the only guy in this clique with sexual issues, right Ray(Shawn Wayans)? Anyway, like in all the movies this flick makes fun of, one by one Faris' friends are being bumped off by the allegedly mysterious serial killer. Some might say that if you haven't seen SCREAM, you wouldn't understand this movie. I say you don't need to in order to understand any of the cultural references. The Trailers for Scream, IKWYDLS, The Sixth Sense & The Blair Witch Project are enough to help you get the jokes. Plus, this movie had perhaps the funniest sex scene shown in the movies in a long time. The sequels, on the other hand aren't as good.

A serial killer that is after them because of an accident that they caused last Halloween. A serial killer that seems to have come out of every other scary movie.

This movie is also spoofing famous movies and horror movies that are famous also. Scary Movie spoofed these movies: Scream, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense, I Know What You Did Last Summer and The Matrix! The most funniest part is where the serial killer was in Cindy's house and he is on the phone and he tells her that she might not know where he is and the serial killer was hiding behind the sofa and then he told her to turn around so that he can hide some place else. Another funny part was when the part where the six friends were thinking back about the one time where they might of accidentally run over this one man and he was okay and one of threw a beer bottle at him and then they concealed him! I liked it in the beginning where Carmen Electra was running away from the serial killer and she got her clothes ripped off and you she her with her underwear and getting wet with the sprinklers and I thought that was sexy! Considering that Carmen Electra is one of the most sexiest celebrities alive! Another funny part was when the guys and the serial killer were all getting drunk and kept saying Wassup! Another funny part was when Shorty and Brenda are at the movies and Brenda keeps being so loud and talking through the movie and the other people want her to shut up!

1. The film does a fantastic job at ridiculing horror movie cliches, like how the killer will waste time when killing their victims, conveniently allowing the victim to escape.Cons:
1. A lot of the humour is incredibly basic and immature and is more concerned with ramming in loads of, then, pop culture references than developing actual comedic moments.2. The characters are exceedingly one-dimensional. Just because the film is a parody, it doesn't mean we shouldn't care about the characters.3. The movie is a parody, and then it weirdly feels the need to act as a documentary by showing the film crew, or when the camera bumps into Cindy (Anna Faris).4. The pacing is horrible. Everything from the character conflicts, to the jokes and action scenes are rushed through as if they were being checked off a list.5. The conclusion is wholly underwhelming as other than the quick revealing of The Killer to be Doofy (Dave Sheridan), nothing is resolved.6. There's a bizarre sub-plot wherein Bobby (Jon Abrahams) and Ray (Shawn Wayans) are copy-cat killers. It's raised out of nowhere, and then they're killed off by the real killer in the next scene.7. The horror is virtually non-existent. Rather than being a horror-parody, it's more of a comedy movie that features horror cliches.",Scary Movie

Well, in this movie we have it, it is not necessary to imagine, here it is the sequences themselves that are absurd. The main plot and numerous scenes are traced from Scream, but always in a parody tone, and perfectly inserted into the plot we see references to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""The Matrix, or even ""Scream 2"".With some jokes better than others, Scary Movie does not have any waste, it contains gags under the gags and the references to horror films of the 90s are multiple. The cast is full of young faces that could well star in any modern horror film but their characters are totally morons who are capable of being scared by phone calls or a clumsy with a mask.The beginning of a saga that fell precipitously in its sequel and that came back with a fun third part.

159,zmaturin,The fact that Leslie Neilson isn't in this proves there's no justice in the world.,5,29 September 2000,"There has never been a good ""Airplane!""-style movie about horror movies. There have been attempts, like ""Pandemonium"" with Paul Reubens and ""National Lampoon's Class Reunion"", but none of them have been very funny. ""Scary Movie"" is pretty funny and it's based on the movie ""Scream"", but it isn't really a parody of that trend-setting hit or of horror movies in general. It seems like the writers had a bunch of gags about drugs, pubic hair, penises, boobs, testicles, oral sex, and other such things, but no plot, and Miramax said, ""here, use one of the plots of our other hit movies, and stick all your jokes on it!"" The gross-out sex and drug jokes that make up the bulk of ""Scary Movie"" could have been transferred easily to a parody of, say, ""Good Will Hunting"" (that's not a bad idea- they could give the Robin Williams character the big afro of pubic hair).None of the big laughs in ""Scary Movie"" are derived from mocking the conventions of horror movies, except for a scene inspired by ""Halloween"", where the killer is shown running behind a tree to hide when a victim spots him out the window. In ""Scream"" the characters have a party where they watch old slasher movies. This movie could have used that scene to show a bunch of short satires of other horror movies, like ""Nightmare on Elm St."", ""Friday the 13th"", or ""Child's Play"". Heck, Miramax owns the rights to the ""Hellraiser"" and ""Halloween"" franchises, so Pinhead and Michael Myers could have made cameos. It seems they were too afraid to leave the plot points of ""Scream"", ""Scream 2"", and ""I Know What I Did Last Summer"" for too long, less the brain dead teen audience get lost due to a reference to a movie less than five years old. There are effortless take-offs on ""The Matrix"" (just like in ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo""), ""The Usual Suspects"" (just like in ""Wrongfully Accused""),  and ""The Blair Witch Project"" (just like in- well, pretty much everything, these days).""Scary Movie"" isn't totally crappy. I thought a lot of the jokes were funny and was amazed at the amount of sordid sight gags that got by the MPAA (more proof of how arbitrary and irrelevant they are today). I thought Shawn and Marlon Wayans were good, as were the actors in the Neve Campbell and David Arquette roles. The low points of the cast are, predictably, Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth. Elizabeth is undeniably awful, yet her character has not one but two scenes that require expert acting: When she sees her boyfriend getting murdered but people think she's just acting; and later when she is acting like she's scared of the killer but isn't. A good actress could have made these sequences work, but Elizabeth isn't up to the task. That's what you get when you cast someone solely on the basis of a topless scene in ""American Pie"".Since the success of ""Scream"" inspired plenty of imitators, hopefully the success of ""Scary Movie"" will inspire some knock-offs, and one will take full advantage of the plethora of slasher movie cliches available to mock.",Scary Movie

When I actually saw this movie however, it was VERY VERY poor.That's really a shame, since the movie contains a number of great parodies: ""The Matrix"", ""Amistad"", ""The Usual Suspects"", '""the Sixth Sense"", they all get thouroughly and profesionally spoofed. Unfortunately, a lot of jokes are parodies on ""Scream"" and ""I know what you did last summer"", and those simply aren't funny. Also, this movies' ""plot"" is utterly stupid with some of the worst acting and most unlikeable characters ever seen in any movie. Way to many of this movies' jokes are about sex, and almost all of them are distasteful, stupid and offending. The most excruciatingly disgusting joke ever to feature in a movie was also in this one: the East German gym teacher and her ""private parts"". About half way through, this movie had lost all its appeal and became a burden to watch.

Unfortunately, like people, movies don't always live up to their potential, and the execution (sorry) in this case, is frighteningly bad.Rather than creating a clever script the writers chose instead to make enough changes to escape being sued for  copyright infringement.  They then cobbled together scene references from the spate of copycat horror films that have been polluting movie screens since ""Scream's"" success, had Carmen Electra (the only recognizable ""star"" in the film) run through a sprinkler in her underwear and showed the funniest scenes from the movie in the trailer.  There was also a conscious effort to capture the ""Something About Mary"" crowd with scenes of people being done in by penises and a woman being plastered to the ceiling and deluged in semen.

On the other hand, if you like this type of movie (namely the ton of other films that came out after this one), go for it, you will not regret.I think that the only downside for me was Marlon Wayans' character, I think he was insanely over the top even for the standards of the movie, and besides the line ""I see dead people"" I didn't laugh at all with anything his character did, just didn't work for me here.

I guess I had the impression that as a teen I would have to get something out of a teen movie, but I guess where I went wrong was watching this expecting something actually really funny and I was let down in that point, 'cause it is really only OK.The movie does have some pretty funny scenes, not any sex jokes really making me laugh like promised by praise by friends and cousins. The good lines came from the randomness. If I may show a bit here that made me laugh...Girl #1: Whats Wrong? She's gone and she is not coming back Girl #2: Face it, she is gone and is never coming back Girl #1: But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Club...Now that was funny. It was stuff like the small penis scene that did not even get a small laugh from me, and it is partly due to that scene, and the blow job scene really made it hard to watch at times.

I know that I will probably get some backlash for this comment but I honestly think that Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Summer.Overall, this movie is worth a watch once and that is it. Once again, I will say that half the jokes in this are NOT funny and half of them are very, very funny. I rate this movie 54%.",Scary Movie
169,Mitch-38,Some good moments...some long stretches,5,25 July 2000,"The trouble with doing a parody film on this particular genre (especially the SCREAM series), is that a lot of these movies made fun of themselves, as well. So SCARY MOVIE has had to take the parody concept to a second level, with mixed results. The gags were either hit or miss, like any other comedy. The essential ingredient in all comedy is a sense of timing, and the element of amusing surprise. This movie runs hot and cold. The jokes that succeeded, were hilarious (and some more than slightly tawdry). Other attempts, were pushed to the point where the humor felt forced. This was evident, as at times the theater (which was packed) would fall silent, except for a groan or two, scattered about the room.
SCARY MOVIE isn't bad, though. It's just that this form of send-up has been done a lot, and it's starting to show signs of wear.",Scary Movie

Also the scene in the bathroom was totally inappropriate.  The photo was one thing, but an erect penis does not belong in any movie with a rating lower than NC-17.

But you know what, they were all immature and that's why this film was so successful. There is an unbelievable amount of crude humour in this movie, I watched this a few months ago, and found myself tired from it fast. There was only two standout parts for me, that actually made me laugh. Something so generic and simple as the character seeing the killer one second, then looking away and looking back and he's gone, while showing him running away behind a tree was something I didn't really think about. Thinking about Micheal Myers doing that makes for some fun imagery. The other scene being when Ghostface kills that girl in the locker room, not very intelligent but it was amusing. This film could have been so much better if it was given to a more talented writer or director, but it just turns in silly jokes about sex. If you want to sit back and let all intelligence slip away for an hour and a half give it a watch. Take for what it is, a very crude film.",Scary Movie
173,patrick_dunne,I turned it off after about 10 minutes.,1,30 October 2005,"Seriously, I turned this movie off. I thought it would make me laugh out loud. I heard it was smart and funny. I have been lied too.Scary Movie has to be the worst spoof I have ever seen. It is not at all funny, just dumb and offensive. The horrid jokes include dumb teenagers accidentally touching each other, policemen defecating, stereotyping and people cross-dressing. There is even one scene where a girl gets stabbed in the breast and, when the knife is pulled out, there is a chunk of ice attached to it. (I later found out that all it was stating was that the actress had breast implants. Bad joke.)Instead of actually laughing, I found myself saying ""What?"" when trying to figure out the humor. The only funny part was the man who was thought to be dead, but really wasn't, and that was hardly funny at all! I turned it off after the movie showed a picture of a man's genitals. How repulsive. That is solid proof that it is a bad movie, because I have sat through the Cat in the Hat and Jaws: The Revenge. On a second viewing, I found two funny parts. The first was the ""Can you see me?"" part, and the second was ""Does Scream have a plot?"", but they couldn't hold back on the disgusting scenes, could they? The cross-dresser scene and hair coming out of the underwear scene were very, very disgusting and repulsive.This movie is the first movie I have ever rated a 1.1/10",Scary Movie
174,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,"Hold my gum, Kenny ---- ptui",8,25 November 2005,"Very funny Wayans brothers parody of the teen slasher movies so popular the last 15 years. My favorite character in the movie is gail hailstorm played by Cheri Oteri. She plays your typical arrogant loudmouthed TV reporter. The first time you see her she spots a policeman investigating the latest slashing and that's when she tells her cameraman ""Hold my gum, Kenny"" and spits it at him while she rushes to get her interview. She even tries to interview the slasher while he's killing a teen and he gets mad at her too and says something like ""Leave me alone; I'm just doing my job."" Also love the doofy character played i believe by Trevor Roberts. I don't usually like to see the mentally handicapped ridiculed but doofy is hilarious as a 25 year old make-believe cop at the high school. Has a vacuum cleaner called Christine and does not like to be disturbed while cleaning his room.It's an ensemble cast with no one person really the star. Anna Faris has a big part as Cindy the only semi-normal person in the movie and marlon wayans is great as shorty, an obnoxious black teen. Shannon Elizabeth is hilarious as buffy, a super bitchy friend of cindy's. Lots of characters in this movie that you love to hate.My favorite piece is when the killer is in Cindy's house chasing her and she calls 9-11 on her computer and when asked ""nature of emergency"" she types ""white woman in trouble"".

I think these films that like to go laugh at stuff like this is to keep themselves from laughing at their own stupidity.I never really thought that acting stupid in a movie was funny. Now, if people were doing this stuff for real and not faking it would be funny. Ha Ha, but no it is obvious that watching this is like watching a stupid comedy play of how to be stupid and try and make people laugh at the dumb crap they can do on a movie set.

176,danielll_rs,A HELL of a funny movie... What can I do???????,6,21 October 2000,"SCARY MOVIE (2000) ***WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADI agree with Roger Ebert's review that the spoof-genre is a hard one to comment about. You don't know what to say... Film editing? Cinematography? Directing? Acting? Come on!!!!!! What matters is if the film is funny or not and if it really makes a satire or just put one stupid scene after another. By this point, SCARY MOVIE is one of the best satires I've seen in years, ranking up there with AIRPLANE! and NAKED GUN- and staying far from crap like SPY HARD and MAFIA!.I have a strange taste for humor. I'm not a big fan of slapstick humor. I like something that is not forced, that makes you laugh naturally. For you to have an idea, I found BEING JOHN MALKOVICH to be an extremely hilarious film. Even some critics who loved it said that the laughs were not hysterical, but I couldn't stop myself in the scene where Malkovich enters his own mind and finds himself into a restaurant with lots of ""Malkoviches"", from the waiter to the singer, all they speak is ""Malkovich"", everything that is written on the menu is ""Malkovich""... There were also some things involving a monkey and Cameron Diaz wanting to change her sex... It was a hell of a funny film, my #3 of 1999. However, I hated AMERICAN PIE. It was not funny, because the situations were recycled from PORKY'S, THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN and other crappy comedies from the '80s- it was also forced. I loved the nasty humor of SOUTH PARK- BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT, but I was used with the TV series. But I was not very confident about SCARY MOVIE. Maybe the trailer showed everything, maybe the humor was recycled and forced. Thankfully, my expectations were not confirmed when I saw the movie: I couldn't stop laughing a minute. Every time they showed something dirtier than what they had showed in the scene before. But anyway it was a hell of a fun!I can't describe every scene I liked because my comment would be enormous. But, for example, the opening scene, making satire of the one in SCREAM with Drew Barrymore, here with Carmen Electra, was a great beginning- especially when he stabbed one of her tits and took the... you know! There was also the thing of the gym teacher, lots of dick, gay/lesbian jokes, but my favorite is maybe the one similar to that in SCREAM 2, in a movie theater when Jada Pinkett is killed. Here the girl is watching SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, but acts like she were in a hood theater. She comments every detail loudly, answers the cell phone and the audience can't handle her any longer. So some of them start to stab her, and while she is walking to the screen, lots of people come and stab her, probably because she did the same thing other times, in other movies: THELMA AND LOUISE, THE FUGITIVE, a Jackie Chan movie, BOOGIE NIGHTS, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE... It's a very funny scene! So thankfully the best parts weren't showed in the trailer.It's difficult to find out all the references and spoofs to other movies. The ""movie connections"" page shows lots of movies, even some that have nothing related to horror: FIGHT CLUB, AMERICAN BEAUTY, ELECTION, TEACHING MRS. TINGLE. One of the best references is to THE USUAL SUSPECTS, in the end. It is a real twist that concludes this movie very well. Of course there were stupid connections (as the special appearance by James Van Der Beek- pointless!), but overall they were very good (THE BLAIR WITH PROJECT is a disgusting example).So do I recommend SCARY MOVIE? (God help me!) Yes! But only a warning: THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!! If you are an old-fashioned person, has a weak stomach, is an intellectual, is easily offended or can't see or hear stupidity, STAY AWAY!!!!!! But if you don't care about that and have bad taste, don't let this pass by. It is offensive, nasty, disgusting, heavy, over-the-top, silly, stupid, idiotic, brainless... but a HELL of a funny movie.",Scary Movie

While I did enjoy those movies, I do acknowledge some of their flaws, therefore it was a pleasure to poke fun at those and many other horror classics. Scary Movie (Scream's original title) is a 90 minute laugh out loud experience you need to witness. Sure it isn't the smartest spoof comedy ever, but between the more pop culture oriented jokes, as well as the sexual references, you may find some gems in this Wayans Bros. script. As the movie that launched Anna Faris as a comedy heavyweight, one can definitely see her style present in this film. My favorite among the series, Scary Movie is ,in general, my favorite spoof movie, with Airplane coming in as the best of the genre as a whole. As far as this one goes, it is in my eyes a comedy classic since its serves its purpose of making your insides burst out with genuine laughter. Don't miss it.Rating: 10/10",Scary Movie

I believe that Scary Movie could be funny to people that were locked in a library for 30 years with no one else to talk to and suddenly someone played it to them. The jokes are unintelligent, the acting is terrible (like in most of Wayans' movies) and what comes out is a sense of rudeness to the audience. Toilet ans sex jokes at their worst, plus a joke about Usual Suspects that originally appeared in Wrongfully Accused. Now that I mentioned it, did you know that in contrast to this super-production the hilarious 'Wrongfully Accused' was filmed in only 5 days? (there's even a very good I have to say, recreation of the Matrix visual fx in a scene of Scary Movie). Of course W.A. was created by veterans and in a parody no one really cares about the visuals; what really matters is the jokes.

Then you will be blown away.  Most of the jokes work on that level and that's what should be remembered.  Overall the mostly unknown cast does well with the script they have, but it still has to be realized that most of the jokes in the movie are very low-brow with a lot of shots being taken at blacks and gays.

183,refinedsugar,Unsubtle but effective!,6,1 August 2000,"Parody movies are a hard bunch. Let's face it, they usually suck. Typically soulless endeavors meant to make cash in a quick and timely fashion. Scary Movie isn't a champion of the genre, but it delivered enough toilet humor to satisfy me. I really had a better time than I ought to sitting in a theater watching this flick's antics. This much I'll tell you about Scary Movie. It's nearly mindless and there's very little subtlety. That you probably could have guessed. You'll know what movies they're about to parody even before the parody starts. Who actually laughed at the Matrix parody? Didn't they run that into the ground with the trailers and TV spots before you went to see the real thing? Pop culture references only get you so far. As such, I don't expect this film to date very well.Alas it's been the suffocating glut of horrible, teen-oriented horror flicks of late that makes a movie like this possible. Showing how stupid they've been and by extension, how stupid we are to have watched and/or paid for them. If by chance you haven't seen the wave of teenage oriented films like 'Scream' or 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' some of the jokes will no doubt be lost on you. To enjoy this film (like any parody) you need to know the films that the parody spoofs and it doesn't hurt if you dislike those movies too.My review would be incomplete if I didn't mention the guy playing Doofy. A hilarious parody of David Arquette's Deputy Dewey from the Scream series. The guy is an f'ing riot. He so's good that he borderline stole the show. He definitely got my full fledged attention whenever he appeared on screen.All said and done, the Wayans bros. score some points with Scary Movie.

To begin with, there's the ""penis attack"" scene. Yes, you heard me. A character is attacked by a penis. And that's just a warm-up. Later on, we get the part about the geyser of semen. No, that was not a typo. The writers of ""Scary Movie"" act as if they had never heard of good taste. Given the evidence (the Wayans gave us ""In Living Color"") that's probably not too far from the truth. The criteria we must use to evaluate the film is extremely simple: is it funny?Well sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. In addition to those mentioned above, there are countless gags and horror movie parodies. Some of them fall flat, but there are enough hits to compensate for at least some of the misses. I laughed several times, but the film suffers from too many dead spots, especially during the third act. How you respond to it is purely a matter of taste. If gross-out comedy isn't your thing, what are you doing here anyway?In closing, I must give credit where it's due. Anna Faris provides a strong screen presence, guiding us through the movie's weaker moments. She's not gorgeous by any stretch of the imagination, but she has an undeniable appeal. In fact, she would have been right at home in an actual horror film. Let's take it a step further.

Keenan Ivory Wayans' directing is neither subtle nor elegant, but wasn't meant to, as the movie doesn't ask for it, it's mission is to show in our face violently or unviolently the comedy Matrix, that succeeds its mission.

The latest movies are unrecognisable when compared to the original, so re-watching it last week really brought back some memories from my teenage years. The movie is downright stupid and it knows it. Following the scream storyline very closely and re-enacting the scenes with a slapstick comedy twist was original and brilliant at the time. It is so absurd and silly but it completely works.It is written by and stars the Wayans Brothers so that should give you a good idea as what to expect from the film. The cast is well complied, perfect for a teen horror/slasher movie so when put into a spoof spin off film; they really fit the part and make it all the funnier.You honestly have to take this movie for what it is, It really won't be to everybody's taste and there will be many, many people who find it crude, distasteful, offensive or simply not to their humour all together. For me though it is brilliant, the strongest Scary Movie out of them all, it didn't complicate things and stuck to mocking 1 movie (with a couple of others thrown in here and there), something which changes drastically over the later films.It's a popcorn flick, have a few beers, sit back and enjoy it for 90 minutes.

That's why I'm so disappointed in ""Scary Movie"". It has the potential to be there, but it never reaches that point.What jokes work? The ones that wink at the horror downfalls without going in for the kill. Subtle, yet effective. Which ones don't? The gags that involve sex, racist stereotypes, utter stupidity, and homosexuality. Now I'm no prude, and with these subjects the humor could've still been there, but the way the jokes are handled are very child-like and quite painful.All in all, the 2000 Wayans concoction isn't a bad one, but it could've been better.

201,Travis_Bickle01,Disappointing,4,22 August 2005,"""Scary Movie"" is a parody on all those horror- and teen comedy movies like ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and all those others. At least, that's the attempt. The idea is good, it could have been very funny...but the problem is that it isn't funny at all. I've seen several of those movies I just mentioned so I know how it was in the original movies, but the jokes just aren't funny. The only funny thing about the movie was James Van der Beeck's cameo. If you saw ""Dawson's Creek"" you will certainly agree with me when I say that his short appearance was hilarious! But like I said, that was the only funny thing about the whole movie. There are probably people who liked this movie, but I suppose it just wasn't my 'type' of humour..4/10",Scary Movie
202,n-mo,Missed the mark,2,25 July 2009,"""Scary Movie"" wants to be a parody of horror movies. I say ""wants to be"" because it fails, miserably, at achieving this objective.In the first place, a parody, properly speaking, is more than a parallel story with some funny jokes mixed in. A parody should be of the same genre as the work it is spoofing: the humour lies in the self-consciousness of the execution. There is nothing scary about ""Scary Movie""; just some parallel plot elements to a couple of horror movies with some jokes mixed in. By contrast, ""Scream"" was universally acknowledged as a parody of horror movies--and yet it was a horror movie itself.In the second place, attempting to parody a parody will lead to an unmitigated disaster. Thus, if ""Scary Movie"" wanted to jump on the ""Scream"" bandwagon and parody the horror movie, it would have done better to take ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and, say, ""Poltergeist"" rather than ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Scream."" (But frankly, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is one of the many sorry films that parody the fact that movies--horror or otherwise--exist.)Finally... remember what I said earlier about a parody involving more than ""funny jokes mixed in"" and then mentioned that ""Scary Movie"" had ""some jokes mixed in""? Notice that, in the latter case, I omitted the word ""funny."" This was deliberate. The jokes were not funny. I remember an occasional chuckle at the ludicrously implausible means of disposing of human life, but *LAUGHS* evaded me all throughout this obnoxious disaster. The fact is that death is not funny, and that sexual innuendos can make for a guilty pleasure only in the most moderate doses. A ""Scary Movie"" level of toilet-bowl humour reeks up the entire house.Grade: F-.",Scary Movie
203,moviemaniac008,Scary Movies are such crap...,10,9 June 2008,"...And I think that this is what Scary Movie here is trying to prove to us. Many scriptwriters think that by making a character do a stupid decision is going to make the movie a lot scarier, but unfortunately, the movie is usually ruined because of those stupid actions. Take Carmen Electra, at the beginning, for example. Why the hell did she have to take the banana while there was a couple of other weapons that were a lot better, such as a handgun? It just shows a great example to not imitate. The acting was pretty good: The Wayans brothers, Anna Faris and many other were pretty good at imitating mediocre actors. Overall, Scary Movie is a really good choice to look at if you just watched a horror movie and felt really, really disappointed.",Scary Movie
204,Lando_Hass,"What is it spoofing more, I Know What You Did Last Summer, or Scream?",8,1 November 2002,"Scary Movie is probably the most unique, and original spoof films ever made. While it is taking plots from some old slasher films, it is it's own movie. The plot is pretty funny, Cindy Campbell (played by Anna Faris) is supposed to be a spoof of...well Cindy Campbell from Scream. Cindy and her friends, consisting of Greg, Buffy, Bobby, Ray, and Brenda, one night, hit someone with there car (i.e. spoofs I Know What You Did Last Summer), they dump the body in the harbor, and a year later, someone dressed up in a ghost face costume is killing off all of her friends. Cindy thinks its the man that she hit a year before. This movie takes memorable movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Scream, and turns certain scenes, and characters, into funny ass s*it. The character Doofy alone provides a great portion of the comedic material. Scary Movie has some great actors in it, and to me, Dave Sheridan (I) (he plays as Doofy) is the best actor in the movie, in fact, in my opinion, he is the best actor on the face of the earth. Another good portion of the comedy in this film, is the very, very clever lines, such as ""I went poopy"" (that lines was said by Doofy). Overall, Scary Movie delivers some great jokes, great acting, and an original plot. The only flaw that this movie has is the fact that it gets tiring after watching too much.

And while the film people congratulate themselves on what a great trailer it is, they realize they've just given away all the good stuff.Granted, I did laugh about a dozen times or so at the movie, but it wasn't a ""laugh until it hurts"" kind of humor.  The funniest moments were a brief quip by the ""Black News Team"", and ""Principal Squiggy"" making a jibe at ""Scream""'s Henry (Fonzie) Winkler as the high school principal.  The killer's confusion over meeting Shannon Elizabeth was one of the more clever moments, and both Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth made for great eye candy.My problem?  Quoting SEVERAL scenes from ""Scream"" word for word does not make a good parody.  It makes it a copy, and less than inspired as the original ""Scream"" was.  Throw in a lame subplot from ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" (which being one of the most ridiculously stupid movies I had ever seen, and didn't help my opinion), and the film just ultimately falls flat on its face, because it runs out of the really good laughs well before the credits roll. I saw it once, and that was enough.  I laughed a few times, but it was mostly at the original stuff they did, when they weren't blatantly copying ""Scream"" scenes.  I might rent it again, but I doubt it.  I think this is going to be one of those movies that people will barely remember five years from now, other than a ""Yeah, I saw that"" kind of answer.It's made a decent amount of money so far, so if a sequel is in the works, please stick to the more original scenes, guys.

Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by adolescents with hormone-induced stupidity and immaturity.Scary Movie is filled to the brim with jokes that fall flat: there are unnecessary flatulence jokes, body fluid/sex jokes to the extreme, genitalia that does not look fake at all, and some scenes that are directly lifted from other horror movies in order to be parodied, but instead drag on and on forever to a laughless death.  The ONLY scene that is a brilliantly inspired parody is NOT from a horror movie, and you have to wait until the VERY end to see it.  An R-rating? It's ludicrous that serious, quality films like Tom Soldonz' Happiness and others are condemned by the MPAA to have scenes cut or be released unrated for having controversial topics/scenes.  This piece of drek drags out some of the most offensive, thoroughly squirm-inducing and tasteless acts, language, and images ever imagined, yet gets an R-rating just fine.And as for the Wayans, their creativity seems to have dwindled ever since In Living Color ended.

This film is not only a great spoof but a fantastic gross out comedy. There's Something About Mary, American Pie, Road Trip, Porky's, they don't even come close to the gross out gags in this film. It's also great in the spoof department. Some of the scenes use almost the exact same dialogue and it works real well. The cast was great. Each performance was good in that they spoofed the character they were supposed to spoof. Anna Faris was perfectly cast as the Neve/Jennifer character. In some of the scenes I thought I was watching Neve. Jon Abrahams does a great job in the Skeet Ulrich part. At some points in the film, he even sounded like him, it was scary. Marlon Wayans was extremely funny as the stoner, Randy. This is going to go down as one of the funniest movies of all time and up there with Airplane! and Hot Shots as one of the great spoof films.

219,joncheskin,Funny and Shameless,6,14 May 2016,"Scary Movie is a parody of the teenage slasher genre, and luckily a very funny parody indeed. Keenan Ivory Wayans is the mastermind, and he has assembled a fairly standard group of teenagers and a psychopath, and gives them the opportunity to completely spoof the slasher genre. The ""plot,"" such as it is, happens as a result of the teenagers out cruising with much hard alcohol accidentally hit someone, mistake him for dead, and then accidentally kill him when they throw his body into the bay to dispose of it. We suspect that somehow the victim rose from the dead or recovered to be the psychopath, but we are never quite sure. The psychopath, with a bunch of hilarious changeable masks out of the Scream movies, attempts to kill all the teens, but has some misadventures along the way.This movie is completely shameless, and anyone with a sense of decency should be warned. If you do not mind this issue, however, the movie has some great laughs. One scene that sticks out in my mind pretty much encapsulates this movie's strategy: at one point, the killer opens the door on a bunch of teenage boys who are watching TV and smoking ridiculous amounts of pot. They are completely helpless and about to get slaughtered when one of them has the presence of mind to offer the killer a smoke. After a few puffs, everyone starts laughing hysterically together, and then they all decide to start making threatening phone calls to potential victims (giggling all the time). The scene has an ironic ending that I will not give away for fear of tripping the spoiler alert. The killer has lots of moments where things don't go right and you think, man, it is tough to be psychopath. The teenagers are a study in human superficiality and often seem to preoccupied with their own issues to notice that they are slowly being sliced and diced. The sight gags are quite good and their are some legit surprises that keep you guessing. All in all, it is an hour and a half of quite effective tasteless entertainment.",Scary Movie

I know, I know, the plot summary is short, but Scary Movie doesn't have a plot of its own. It's simply a montage of scenes from Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, all done in a spoof-like way.Hugely enjoyable performances from newcomer Anna Faris who plays Cindy Campbell, and Carmen Electra who plays Drew Decker, the porn babe who acts in the hilarious opening attack. But, the stand-out is Shannon Elizabeth, the Tatum-like girl who has a scene with the killer with is so funny that you'll be crying. Elizabeth actually acts in the film, but you can tell she is having so much fun.

229,andrewburgereviews,Nitpicking on clichés,6,9 May 2020,"Keenen Ivory Wayans, one of the most ridiculous contributors to cinema, takes a pretty ironic approach in ""Scary Movie"". This picture abandons notions of a plot, coherence or really anything for the sake of nitpicking on the clichés of horror movies. Notably their stupidity. Is it funny? Yes. But ""Scary Movie"" is to parodies what the movies it parodies are to horror--superficial, it doesn't go too deep or too smart into its concepts... but perhaps that is the point.Its main victim is 1996's ""Scream"". A year after a group of college kids run-over a person and kill him while driving under various influences, they are being hunted by a similar looking ghost. Except this one has a drinking problem and is pretty bad at hiding. Nonetheless, the parodies and ridiculousness are candid and pull through clearly. Anyone who wasn't born under a rock and has seen a run-of-the-mill scary Hollywood movie will have a laugh and point. This is more or less, a stoner comedy. Not only because it features so many scenes involving drugs, but also because its plot is picked-up from and thrown to the ground multiple times. The movie is instead driven by over-the-top ""Family Guy""-esque expositions and references.Most of these scenes are funny, even if most of them are straight-up disgusting or just stupid. Take the movie's sex scene--I won't describe it, you must see it for yourself--so ridiculous, its hyperbolic approach destroys this movie's ambitions, but also spares it of an attitude of superiority. This movie doesn't think much of itself, and I kinda like that. But then again, this also stops it from being, you know, good.""Scream"" is not the only target of ""Scary Movie"". It instinctively goes out of its way parodying many others and it is often self-aware. This fourth-wall breaking create moments of untapped potential, but it is often used to no purpose other that to generate a cheap laugh. And ""Scary Movie"" is fine with that. This is what it wants and this is what it's gives us.",Scary Movie
230,Marco_Trevisiol,Dreadful,1,8 October 2001,"I began watching this film the other night hopeful that I'd get some laughs. However a combination of inept attempts at humour and a rather unpleasant, obnoxious undercurrent soon made this film a chore to watch and I couldn't last the distance without fast-forwarding large chunks of the film. One reason I disliked the film so much was how low its standards were. With the exception of one or two jokes early on, the filmmakers seemed to think that merely making the audience aware they were spoofing a Kevin Williamson-type film was in itself enough to constitute a joke. Secondly, the film seems to have been described as ""outrageous"" by the LA Times for example but what exactly is so outrageous about this film? All the predictable areas are mined for humour. The only way anyone would think that the film's litany of jokes involving gore/sexual innuendo/cross-dressers/homosexuals/pot-smoking are 'outrageous' are those who haven't seen the 4000 or so films that have used this type of humour in the past. Perhaps, like 'Something about Mary', it's deemed outrageous because it pushes the boundaries of some of these jokes a bit further but it's still a variation on the same joke. After a while, the film's tone is so relentless and obvious that it's easy to see where the next joke is coming from. When I saw an overweight woman have a speaking part later in the film, you knew that there would a joke relating to her weight. As Hollywood deems, only 'the beautiful people' appear at the multiplexes. In reality, 'Scary Movie' is anything but outrageous as it picks safe, obvious targets for humour that won't cause any real controversy. This film is about the same standard as 'Silence of the Hams' from a few years back but due to a few factors (mainly marketing) whereas 'Hams' did zero at the box office, 'Scary Movie' was a major hit.",Scary Movie

This movie doesn't pretend to be anything else other than what it is, plain and simple gags, and in some cases, those gags can be very funny if you have a good memory of what happened in the movies which it was taking the mick out of!(Short spolier here!) There are some moments in the movie tho that made me want to scream because they seem in such bad taste etc. The two major ones were the toliet scene and also ""Mrs Man"" Showing her private privates scene! I didn't really get the spoof of Mrs Man but with the toliet scene, oh yeh, i got it! I was just left hoping that it wasn't a real ""thing"" poking outta his ear!Ahh well, this movie was something spectular in my opinion, altho i think that its one of a kind and not something that can be repeated, i hope that the seuqal is something that can be repeated.... 0=]",Scary Movie
232,snelling,"Acting Okay, But Humor Wears Out Fast",3,30 June 2000,"I walked into 'Scary Movie' with high hopes. The preview trailer was funny and I wanted to see more of the same type of jokes. Since no one can successfully do this type of parodic humor quite like the ZAZ boys from 'Airplane!' I was not sure what to expect. The jokes got repetitive. The pacing became labored. And the sex organ jokes should have almost given this movie an NC-17 rating! For those keeping track, the take-offs included the 'Scream' series of course, 'The Matrix', a brief 'Sixth Sense' gag, 'I Know What You Did...', 'The Blair Witch Project', and for some reason, 'The Usual Suspects'. They also reshot the 'Whassup?' commercial almost line for line. The film is only referentially funny. If you didn't see any of the above, none of the humor will make any sense to you. Even if you have seen everything listed, some jokes are just plain silly or stupid. When the main character Cindy (Anna Faris) is poised in midair a la 'The Matrix', she starts doing an Irish jig out of nowhere. This is the best they could do? The acting was pretty good for this type of lowbrow comedy, however. The characters seemed sincere even when they repeated the same joke over and over. For example, there are several references to the possibility of a character being gay. This just went on and on throughout the movie until you wanted to, ahem, scream. For nostalgia fans, even Squiggy (David Lander) from Laverne & Shirley shows up as the Corpse High principal.",Scary Movie

There is hardly anything good about it. I don't care how funny you think it looks. It was a huge waste of an hour and a half of my life, and many others lives, and it is not even funny at all. Most of the humor is disgusting. I really could have gone my whole life without seeing Ghostface stick his penis through a mans ear while humming to himself in a bathroom. Sounds stupid doesn't it? Yeah well there is a whole that more where that came from. Just watch the movies that this was based on (which include the Scream series, The Blair Witch Project, The Usual Suspects, The Shining especially, Titanic, The Matrix or even I Know What You Did Last Summer, which was actually the only film in the movie to be spoofed well) or watch a more intelligent parody film.

239,Rinho18,My number 23 movie,9,5 March 2001,"Scary Movie is my number 23 movie. I loved the Scream series, I love horror movies, and I love films spoofing them. This movie is made with the screenplay of Scream, part 1, with some new lines in it. I saw Scream about one week before I had seen Scary Movie ( so I had watched it about 5 times till then ), and I knew what they were saying before they actually said it. This film could have been much better, if there had not been those disgusting jokes ( the restroom, the Blair Witch parody, the pubic hair scene, the Dewey parody( was his name Duffy?) ). They were disgusting weren't they? I saw this movie with my friend. We had seen Rush Hour, and South Park, and in those films there were just two guys laughing : me and my friend. But while watching Scary Movie, everyone was laughing. That was something new for us. In some scenes we laughed so hard that we could not get the following jokes. In the evening he reminded me of one scene of scary movie, and we laughed about five minutes about it, because it was just very hilarious.This movie features one of my all-time-favorite characters : it is the killer/s with the mask/s. They/She/He were/was just unbelievable funny.I'm really looking forward to part 2, I hope that they will leave out those disgusting jokes then.Good points about Scary Movie : the killer/s ( and her/his/their voice ) , very hilarious jokes, it parodies horror movies as no movie has done before, beginning, trailerBad points : the same screenplay that Scream has ( were they too stupid to write an own one ), many disgusting jokes, Duffy, Sixth Sense parody, ending.All in all, I rate Scary Movie 9.5/10. I recommend it to horror and spoof fans.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. CU; Rinho.",Scary Movie

241,robsellke,"Very funny at parts, as well as stupid",7,24 July 2000,"""Scary Movie"" was a movie with pretty much no plot, as least that the viewer cared about or followed.  I mean, that's okay for one of those mid-summer movies made just to entertain, but I expected a little more.  There are quite a few funny jokes, parodies, and references to other movies, and they all tied in together fairly well.  The movie was, however, also quite nasty at parts, with a few scenes of graphic male nudity, a bloody compound fracture, and some graphic jokes, but you learned to see by them.  So, a lot of the jokes were stupid and maybe not that original, but I think that there a bit of intelligent humor as well, and that the comedy was basically successful in the end.",Scary Movie

I hadn't seen scream at the time but then went on to watch it and found that the films are so similar! I thought that the idea of the whole 'I know what you did last Halloween' was funny. I found that Anna Farris delivered a hilarious performance but I also really liked Buffy's character. Some bits were a bit inappropriate for my age but other than that I would say Scary Movie is hilarious but approach with caution if you don't find toilet humour or sexual humour funny.

243,simplysoda_19f,Loved it!,8,16 March 2007,"This movie is very funny and it spawned a series of sequels, there's talk about a fifth one coming out. Shawn and Marlon Wayans are hilarious, loved them in the Wayans Brothers TV show. This movie is hilarious, it takes all those teen horror flicks and parodies them. What movies does it parody you might ask, well flicks like ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and the unforgettable, ""The Sixth Sense"".I love Anna Faris as well, she's so talented, hard to believe this is her first movie. She's very funny, Baywatch fans will love Carmen Electra in her cameo role. Jon Abrahams, he's very funny to, all around good guy. Lochlyn Monroe, totally loved him in this, Shannon Elizabeth too, she's great at doing a parody of Sarah Michelle Gellar.The movie is pretty funny, if you thought ""Scream"" was pretty hokey, you'll love this movie, it's pretty good. It does have some toilet humor, but hey, what teen movie doesn't. It's really funny. I remember when this movie came out on VHS, I had to rent it at least 3 times, before I bought it, just so I could show everybody how funny it was. There's a lot of great lines, as well great acting, oh they also parody the ""Matrix"" it's good. Watch it and see how many movies you can see that they made fun of. It's great.",Scary Movie
244,d_fienberg,"Funny, but Stunningly Disposable",5,14 December 2000,"There's a moment, around four minutes into Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra, playing the preprocessed meat role originated by Drew Barrymore in Scream, makes a joke about having a black boyfriend who's going to beat up the psycho who's taunting her on the phone. It takes several seconds to remember that for about thirty seconds Carmen Electra was married to Dennis Rodman. But when the killer turns on the pool lights to reveal the boyfriend he's kidnapped, it isn't Rodman, but Prince. Well, what percentage of the teen audience that made Scary Movie such a huge hit even remembers Prince before his name became a glyph? And how many remember, or care, that Carmen Electra was once musical hopeful in the Prince Paisley Palace empire. Electra, of course, has gone through several lives since then. She posed nude; she co-hosted an MTV gameshow; she was on Baywatch. Basically, Electra was the perfect star for this opening sequence. Not because she gets such a kick out of self mockery, which she clearly does, but because she is the perfect disposable (and reusable) icon for this film, which may be the most disposable film ever made.First of all, Scary Movie is funny. It's frequently even very funny. In a crowded theater or crowded room, the laughter is largely wall to wall. With that out of the way, it's tempting to ask if anybody is ever going to pick the film up in twenty years and still find it funny. It's my guess that they won't have a clue what's going on. And that's why Scary Movie is so sad. It's hip. It's current. And it sure won't have a legacy.Airplane was made more than 20 years ago. It's still the funniest film (in terms of laughs per second of screentime) ever made. Blazing Saddles, The Producers, and Young Frankenstein are also still amazingly funny films. Were these films funnier at the second they were released than they are now? Inevitably. All the films get much of their humour from boundary breaking. Compared to Scary Movie, they're all pretty tame. They also get much of their humour from parodies of cinematic conventions. They all look 100% original compared to Scary Movie.The most hilarious thing about Scary Movie is how it reflects on the self-cannibalization rampant in Hollywood. In this case it's Miramax's Dimension films that represents the serpent devouring its own tail. Scary Movie, of course, is a parody of the Scream movies. And Dimension produced both the Scream trilogy and Scary Movie. Scary Movie is Dimension's assurance that there's no point in another Scream movie (arguably there wasn't a point in the third). After all, what can you do when you get a movie that parodies a movie that parodied a genre? Nothing. You hit a dead end.Similarly, Scary Movie hits a cultural dead end. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans (who you probably forgot directed Low Down Dirty Shame, as well as creating In Living Color) and written by several Wayans siblings, Scary Movie pokes fun at the Screams, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, The Sixth Sense, and any number of other recent movies and commercials. The problem is that when the movie came out this summer, it's Matrix jokes were already a little past their freshness date. Watching them on video, it seems positively stale. Already. Sure it's funny, but for how much longer? The Usual Suspects jokes are old. The ""Wassup"" sequence will be absolutely meaningless within three years. After all, would you still get a kick out of a movie from the 80s making Spuds jokes? Or if the ""Yes I Am"" guy showed up in an early 90s movie would you laugh? Perhaps, but only at the lameness.The expiration date on Scary Movie is accelerated by the fact that the non-parody jokes (including a legion of gay jokes) are the least funny parts of the film. Scary Movie frequently mentions the fact that it's a near scene-by-scene remake of the original Scream and as a result, the humour is similarly paint-by-numbers. Some of the quality slapstick will always be funny, and the stoner elements (mostly in the person of Marlon Wayans's Shorty) will always have their adherents. But at a certainly point the film will hit a brick wall.I'm overanalyzing Scary Movie, of course. Dimension made the film on the cheap to make a quick buck. They succeeded. And, more importantly to me, people were happy with the movie. Some of the reviews were positive and audiences kept coming back from more. And despite the tag line ""No mercy. No shame. No sequel,"" a sequel is inevitable. So look at your TV or movie screen now and see what's hot. That's what'll be mocked in Scary Movie 2, which will certainly cost a penny, make a mint, and spawn another sequel. Perhaps against all odds, one of those movies will look beyond the instant gratification of the cheap laugh  to try to create something that will last.But why would anybody want to do a silly thing like that?I give this one a 5.",Scary Movie

Albeit some of the gags were noticeably funny, there were some that were either too gross or too lame.This movie is not very innovative on how it is spoofing ""Scream."" In fact, it follows ""Scream"" too closely only by adding on exaggeration and overrated gags. Not to mention that it's integration of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was fairly pointless, and also followed its segments a little too closely as well.Much of the drug humour is not very funny. Sexual humor way too gross. The WAZZUP gags was too lame and pointless, even when that gag was at the height of its popularity. ""I see dead people?"" How about ""I see dumb people?"" The memorable garage scene from ""Scream"" was totally pointless in this movie. The Blair Witch parody also pointless. Even the climax of the movie followed Scream too much to the point where you have to ask ""why bother doing that?""

PROS:Scary movie is a guilty pleasure film and a parody of the horror genre. It makes fun of the many illogical conventions that have defined movies such as Scream, I Know What You did Last Summer, Sixth sense, The Shining, Halloween, The Blair Witch Project, even Star Wars and Matrix. The opening scene is literally a parody of the one in Scream and the ending is similar to The Usual Suspects. Moreover, it makes fun of the cliches of these movies like the choice of 30 years old actors to play teenagers, the selection of preety women and the sexualization of them and the stereotypes of what black people do. Anna Faris as the supposedly innocent college girl and Shannon Elizabeth as the open-minded friend (the have the names Sidney Campell and Buffy respectively!!!) deliver funny lines. Shawn Wayans is entertaining when he tries to hide his sexual preferences and Regina Hall is hilarious in the cinema sequence. The stupidity of the villain makes him awkwardly entertaining and the humor overall comes organically.CONS: The film lacks creativity in some parts when it repeats some spoofs. In the second act, especially, it fully depends on sex jokes, unfunny slapstic humor, fart jokes and several genetilia gags (the gym teacher scene is horrendous). Dave Sheridan as the goofy officer Doofy is awful and he doesn't deliver funny lines (''I went poop'', really?) and Marlon Wayan's constant yelling makes him irritating and obnoxious.",Scary Movie

At the time i thought it was the grossest yet funniest movie of the summer but now that Scary Movie has emerged i can honestly say not only is it the funniest movie of the summer, it's one of the funniest films i have ever seen.Scary Movie is a spoof of all the major teen horror films that have emerged in the last few years. Targets of this film include: Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did last summer, halloween. Other films include: The matrix, Titanic, the usual suspects, and Amistad. This film hits on all these films dead on. take the opening scene for instance with Carmen Electra. It takes some of the dialogue and action from the opening scene of the original Scream. The filmmakers have carefully researched all these movies and have some major fun poking fun at them.the acting in the film isn't great but it's good for this kind of film. Anna Faris who plays Cindy is good at mimicking neve campbell's chracter sydney in scream and doing a good Jennifer  love hewitt impression from her character in I know... Shawn waynas is good as the closet homosexual, and Shannon Elizabeth, last seen in american Pie, has great comic timing and is very funny in the film.

But, I'm sorry, sometimes just being irreverent and revolting and disgusting all by itself is not funny.  At least not for a feature length movie.  They say, ""if you like 'Don't Be a Menace...', you'll like this movie.  Well, I liked ""Don't Be a Menace..."" a little, but I didn't even find this marginally entertaining.  You see WAAAAYYY too much to justify an 'R' rating, especially when you consider the flack the MPAA gives many sexually explicit films.  This may not be very popular to say, but I'm guessing they got away with it because the film makers are, how should I put this, of the ""ethnic"" variety??  And I'm sure having Bob and Harvey Weinstein as executive producers didn't hurt either.  I think those guys are crooks or something.It seems like they just wanted to see how much they could get away with in Hollywood using their aforementioned ""ethnicity"" card...Despite this movie's supposed ""outrageousness"" it feels like it has no heart.  It was obviously only directed by Keenan because the other Wayans are too lazy to learn how to do it.  I hate the Wayans brother  that plays the stoner.  Why do I get the feeling he is really like that?I liked South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut and I'm a big fan of whacked-out movies, but something about this movie was just wrong-  and I don't mean that in a good way.Most bad reviews pique my interest, but seriously, don't waste your time- rent an old Mel Brooks or Jim Abraham movie for way more laughs...

And that's all it is to it, don't expect a high budget comedy (that to me, usually attend to be very successful with high ratings but not funny at all, makes no sense?) This world needs more spoof movies like the 'Scary movie saga' even though the latest attempts at it (such as Epic movie, Superhero movie, Disaster movie) have been Epic failures due to the Certification (all being 12A) The actors did incredibly well the Wayans brothers, who were hysterical and arguably them at there best. This movie was directed at just the right audience, it knew exactly what it was out for, being rude and over the top at times. Okay so it's no way near to be Oscar material or anything like that, but that's not what it's for!It's rude, crude and stupid.

For one thing, the Wayans brothers are relying way too much on sex-related jokes, here.  None of them are funny and they're all pretty redundant after a while.  Also, the death scenes quite easily could have been the funniest parts of the movie, but only one of them made me laugh much at all (it's the fifth one, but I don't want to give it away).  In most cases, there's just too much standard horror movie violence for the movie to seem funny.  All in all not a bad film, but a disappointing one.  5/10",Scary Movie

It is actually a porn movie disguised as a parody of various influential movies. i thought this was what it said it was but it turned out to be a compilation of sex scenes, drug abuse and bad toilet humor strung together by a weak story and excuses itself as a parody. Having said what it is, I consider this the worst movie I've ever seen because it qualifies as a hollywood movie but is no different than an underground porn flick. The parodies were weakly done and overused. The acting, needless to say, was stupid. The plot, there really is none.

All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy, sexy girls and everything else you would expect from a parody.It's a time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days and remember ""Shorty"" and all the other iconic situations and characters of the movie.The story is as cliché as you would expect from a parody movie, but it's not a bad thing at all and it's very enjoyable even after all these years.
Cliché story, music, effects, and the amazing 2000s vibe works extremely well.Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and quite lot not. Personally, after watching it, this feels like not the greatest parody and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 7 out of 10.

Probably 17 or older. Lots and lots of sexual references, some drug use, some language, and some male nudity. Most scenes with Shortie (Marlon Wayans) with them use drugs.

304,Hypercentury,Nasty sense of humour,1,8 October 2000,"That's a very silly comedy. I didn't laugh at once cause the only funny scenes were the trailer' s scenes and the rest was full of American jokes that would never make me laugh. The story sucks -even though there is no a story- and I think that that's a movie for persons with no intelligence or that's what the director had in mind while making it. If you want to see a really smart comedy check ""Shooting fish"" and omit such movies. And for those who might think that I didn't understand the movie cause I hadn't seen the movies it was running down-you're wrong I have seen all the movies it was running down except ""Usual Suspects"". Besides Scream, I know and the Sixth sense are three of my favourite movies. My advice: If you like American humour this movie will be your favourite but if you don't then you'll be completely disappointed. 2/10",Scary Movie
305,jennifer-99,"A ""Public Service"" comment...",1,25 January 2001,"I debated over whether or not to waste my time commenting on this film (and I use the term ""film"" very loosely.) But I decided that if I can prevent even one person from wasting 5 bucks to rent this movie, then my time will have been well spent.  It's pretty bad when a movie which is labeled as a comedy relies on a scene parodying the ""whazup"" commercials for it's only (somewhat) funny moment. The nod to the Usual Suspects was clever, but it's inclusion in this disaster of a film is an insult to the original picture.  Don't worry, I'm not spoiling any crucial plot elements, for there is no plot to spoil. 
For the film's entire running length (thankfully, it's less than 90 minutes long) I simply rolled my eyes at the ceiling while my viewing partner was laughing hysterically.  Maybe I missed something?  After reading user comments, I doubt it.  Not one joke hit the mark.  Not one scene was worthy of a chuckle, let alone an actual laugh.  The thought that there will be a sequel to this movie is even scarier than all three ""Scream"" films put together.  Consider this my Public Service Announcement to the movie renting population.

Scary Movie does have one thing going for it though, it is a hell of a lot better than 90% of the movies it is poking fun at!.I'd give this film half marks as there is some genuinely funny moments and it does have enough guts to admit that 90's horror movies are embarrassingly bad!.",Scary Movie

312,lone-wolf-007,Funny spoof drowned in vulgarity,4,9 June 2008,As a spoof of television and slasher films of the late 90's this had potential to be funnier than what it ended up being. The Wayans are funny and talented but they decided to go a little to far into the gutter with a lot of jokes. Do not get me wrong I can understand the need to be raunchy sometimes but here they decided to push it a little to much and it becomes gross instead of funny. Basically the plot follows Scream but it tends to jump to other things and spoofs of other movies. Anna Faris is cast as the lead and target of the killer and she is very good and fits the part perfect. She is the highlight of the film. Carmen Electra also has a funny cameo but it is just at the beginning. Overall it is a good time killer if you do not mind the vulgarity but it could have been better.,Scary Movie

I liked that the film was overtly sexual...it just wasnt very funny. Very juvenile, and the bad, groan-inducing  jokes outweigh the funny ones by a factor of 20.  I mean, were the makers trying to set the cinema record for most fart jokes? I prefer  a movie that keeps the number of flatulence gags in single digits. Another gripe-other than a nod here and there, the film was a send-up of Scream only. I would have liked some parody of older horror movies. But thats probably not where this film was targeted.

Yeah it had the usual fart jokes, but in this movie it's the women who fart.  Carmen Electra gets her silicone implant ripped out with a knife, there's a gym teacher with the biggest balls ever seen, and an orgasm that puts ""Old Faithful"" to shame.Don't go to this movie expecting great acting or a great script.

Making spoof movies are extremely difficult because you have to make it funny enough so everyone will enjoy it..that's not easy. Everyone has different tastes and most likely people wont like it. Scary Movie achieves to deliver to many people...more than i thought. Its very crude but its still awesomely done. It was hilarious but also stupid. It's a great comedy!! I recommend this for moviegoers who want to laugh. I was amazed by the reviews for this film because spoof movies tend to not really succeed. But this got many positive reviews.

321,Tim-130,One of the dumbest films I've ever seen,1,25 December 2000,"Rented the DVD over the holiday weekend, and boy am I sorry about that. What a waste of money. Totally unfunny! The only scene that made me laugh was when the girl was being chased by the killer up the stairs and she was pushing things down at him, (bike, grandma, piano). How this 'comedy' could have possibly earned the kind of money it did is beyond my realm of thinking. The Wayan brothers and company should have sent it back for about a thousand re-writes. I love comedy, and I'm not a prude by any means, but this kinda of gross out gag comedy got stale very fast. Dumb and Dumber made me laugh, as did Something About Mary, but not this. Keenan Ivory Wayans, (I hope I spelled it right, comments about taking this kind of comedy to the next level was way off the mark. Does he think outdoing the hair gel scene in 'Mary' by having a girl plastered to the ceiling by a stream of semen make it ten times funnier? Sorry, the answer is no. Not only is it not funnier, but parodying another comedy is just plain dumb. And simply re-making 'Scream' into a comedy is a one-joke routine too. I hope 'Scary Movie II' is a bit more original, (yeah right!). The first parody films, (Kentucky Fried Movies and Airplane) were hilarious because they were original in the material based on previous work. And they spoofed normal life, ('No stopping in the red zone' routine). Scary Movie was simply an un-funny ripoff piece of crap.",Scary Movie

324,ralphgillis,A Great Spoof On Slasher Movies,7,11 September 2021,"11 September 2000.Scary Movie is the new movie by director Keenen Ivory Wayans who is known for making comedies with very stupid humour that anyone can understand and you can either loathe it or just tag along and laugh. Scary Movie has hit mainstream success, the actors appeared at the MTV Awards earlier this month and everyone seems to talk about how ridiculous this movie is. It is extremely successful and has great box office results. I'm pretty sure they're gonna make a sequel. How could they not after the popularity their movie gained?I really enjoyed Scary Movie, I laughed pretty much from beginning to end and yeah, sure it's dumb and can be over the top sometimes but this movie is all about just having a good time and making you zone out for a while so you can just simply laugh at how outrageous and witty the movie is. I thought that most of the gags worked really well and made me laugh like a kid. The movie is really short and feels that way, the runtime is 1 hour and 28 minutes but if you're enjoying the movie, it feels like half an hour. And that's a good thing, it means the pacing is on point, it's fast and keeps you attentive. Every character in this movie has a different attitude, different traits and it's all pushed to the extreme. The performances are over the top but in a good way because it never comes across as cringe-worthy.I recommend Scary Movie, it's a fun movie that is in a sub-genre of comedy that certain viewers but mostly critics look down to for sometimes good reason, terrible movies have come out of this sub-genre (straight to video garbage). But this movie stands out because the gags are effective and work most of the time, the characters are interesting because they are all drastically different, it creates funny imitations of slasher movies and the ending is good because it's unexpected. Watch it and have fun.",Scary Movie

335,Benzzo,A parody of a parody?,8,10 July 2000,"Actually I think this movie may be breaking new ground.  Scream was a good trilogy.  The first 2 movies were basically satirizing horror movies from the past, all the characters know they're in a horror movie and the film does a good job with this, although Scream 3 was disappointing, it's almost like it became what it was mocking.  So how do you do a parody of a film that was a parody?  I have no idea, but I think that Scary Movie does it just about as well as it can be done.It's nearly impossible to write a review on this flick.  None of the dialogue or plot is original, and everyone pretty much knows what it's going to be about.  So basically the movie has one and only one task: to make us laugh.  And that it did.  I really wish I had watched the Scream trilogy before going to this so it would be fresh in my mind, but most of the gags seemed familiar to me.I could steal all the movie's best lines and write them here, but I don't want to spoil it any more than the trailers already did.  I believe the theater would've been in an uproar had we not seen The Matrix ripoff 20 times already.  There's 2 scenes near the end that are intercut and take up about 10 minutes.  For these 10 minutes I laughed harder than watching any other movie for the same time that I can think of in quite some while.  It includes a sex scene which features goggles, a hedgetrimmer, funny dialogue (""Say my name, Bobby!""), and an orgasm that must've felt awfully good or hurt like the dickens (so to speak), I'm not sure.  All this completed with a scene where the killer, after getting high from an aquariam bong slashes folks during a freestyle session.Many parts of the movie are almost too funny for itself.  Some scenes are so hilarious that you're still laughing halfway through the next scene and you miss some of the dialogue (Sample: ""You ruined Schindler's List!"").  Some of this is pure gross-out humor, but it's fresh.  Case in point: Mrs. Man, the Omar Epps Bathroom Scene, and the Carmen Elecktra breast stab.  The Blair Witch remake was done so perfectly you wonder if they cut and pasted the actual film and put it into their own reel.I must end this review sometime, so I'll just say that it delivers the goods.  It's humorous to know that Dimension Films produced this movie, which also produced the Scream series, I believe.  They must've had some clout as apparently the MPAA didn't see fit to rate this movie a deserving NC-17.  What disturbs me is that I could hear kids behind me saying ""Daddy, is this supposed to be Scream?""  What kind of sicko would take their 7 year old to see this?

There's nothing else in it - they just repeat it using different characters and you're supposed to laugh. This movie is like the annoying guy at work who thinks he's funny when he repeats the same movie/commercial catch phrase over and over.

But I gamely went along with my friends to watch it last night. First, this movie would have been better without the questionable material (which should have qualified it for an NC17 rating.) Second, the acting in this movie is much better than the material. Third, most of the fun in this movie comes from figuring out which movies they are spoofing or out-right ripping off.  By my count, they stole whole scenes from both the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer franchises, and peppered the movie heavily with direct and indirect references to other recent flicks, many not even of the horror genre: American Beauty, Matrix, Very Bad Things, American Pie, even Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance (or was that Riverdance?) And I believe the bathroom scene with the male organ could have been a reference to the famous shower scene from Porky's, but I might be reading too much into it.And yet, this movie reminds me of a Woody Allen routine about life being like airline food -- it's bad, and they don't give you enough.  Yes, some of the humor is strained, and most is juvenile... but the movie is also too short (run time claims to be 88 minutes, but it must have some really long credits, because we were in and out of the theatre in 85 minutes, including the coming attractions.)  Bottom line is that I wish I had seen it at a second-run theatre for $1, or at least at a matinee -- it's worth seeing if you like picking out pop culture references, or if you're really into juvenile humor, but it isn't worth the $7 or $8 most theatres get for an evening showing.",Scary Movie

May be sad to say, but because I saw this movie as a young teen, it holds a place in my memory so that's why I gave it a 1.5 star rating. It also has some funny moments as I mentioned before. I don't like some of the raunchiness and some jokes are a bit offensive, but overall it's an okay movie.",Scary Movie

There was a funny joke every minute and I laughed through everyone of them. The only other scary movies that are close to being as good as the first are the 3'rd and maybe the 4'th, but the second one wasn't that good.

This film is just terrible for any reason.  It's not funny, it's not intelligent, and it's certainly not thought provoking.  And anyone who thinks this movie is really good needs some serious help.  This film is disturbing, perverted, profane, and utterly vulgar.  Like one other member here has said, ""Anyone with good taste will be offended.""  How the Wayans had the green light to produce this dreck is beyond me, and how a sequel is being planned is even more of a bad surprise. This film, along with other lousy movies catering to the ""teen"" sector, which now seem to be the majority of films being churned out, is an indication that American cinema is entering its dark age, approaching self-destruction unless someone starts getting sense and begins to make more GOOD movies which respects the intelligence of their viewers.  Now I best leave this comment the way it is.  Right now, it feels like I've not said enough bad things about this waste.  Unless you're sick, dellusional, researching the possibilities of deteriorating intelligence of the general populous, or an idiot, do not watch this movie.  - Reinhart",Scary Movie

The only problem was that the only humor the actors could deliver were the jokes they remembered from high school, leading to jokes being repeated more than once because one actor wasn't on the set when the last fart joke was used.

Not because I was sick from the gross-out gags, but because I was sore from laughing so hard and so often.  Yes, the humor is, in most cases, rather crass, but this is easy to forgive because the parody is so well done.  The Wayans' intelligently capture the shallow spirit of teen horror flicks like the ""Scream"" trilogy and lampoon them perfectly.  Mainstream (non-teen) films are also thrown into the mix, resulting in hilarious parodies of movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Matrix.""  I'm not normally a fan of shock humor, but the reason it works so well here is that the Wayans brothers do not *rely* on it alone, but use it  as spice only.  Beneath the gross-out gags is a foundation of intelligent parody. 
The humor is non-stop.  If you can take the crude adult jokes, I highly recommend this very funny movie.  Be prepared to laugh loud, and laugh hard. And, maybe even feel a little guilty about what you're laughing at.  My rating: 9 out of 10 stars.",Scary Movie

SM also pokes fun at I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Blair Witch Project, and the Sixth Sense among others.Seeing as SM is a parody of other films you may be wondering if you should watch those movies first. I wouldn't say its essential (I hadn't seen Scream before), though an appreciation for the satirized material definitely adds to the humour. For instance the scene where the killer is casually washing the school floor in the background is a reference that viewers will only pick up on if they've actually seen Scream.I'll be the first to admit that SM is stupid, cheap, and cheesy but hey, hear me out! It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to be, a funny, irrelevant stab (no pun intended) at popular culture.

I was in stitches at times while watching the film, but was left feeling empty inside after I left the theatre.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect cinematic art here, but I thought I'd at least have something to tell my friends about.  All I could say about SCARY MOVIE was that I enjoyed it, but couldn't really describe why.    Perhaps it is because I believe they put way too many sexual references into it.  The parodies of SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and other movies were great and well thought out, but the sexual humor was unnecessary most of the time.  It felt like no one could think of anything else to spoof, so they threw in all these sex jokes to fill the voids.  They really dragged the fun down and made me think at times that ""this is too stupid, even for a spoof"".    SCARY MOVIE is both entertaining and lackluster.  I had fun, but also felt like I was wasting my time.  I did laugh quite a bit, but I think I needed to force a chuckle a time or two.  Perhaps I expected too much from this.  I thought it would be as hilarious as I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA or DON'T BE A MENACE..., two Wayans Brothers films I think are much better.

Both of them are much funnier and don't have the distasteful nasty streak that was present here. The likes of Billy's orgasm scene and Cindy flashing her [somewhat deformed] breasts are some of the many moments in which this Scary movie crossed the fine line between the wearisome and the unwatchable.I could keep going.

Some might say that this movie is plain stupid. I think they meant to be stupid and it was very funny. This one is a parody of Scream. I must say that some of the humour is very crude so if you don't like that sort of comedy then this movie is definitely not for you. I thought Anna Farris did a good job as Cindy Campbell. This movie is great if you compare it to other parody movies however if you compare it to other normal movies it's obviously not that good.

Scary Movie mocks about EVERYTHING that happened in Scream 1 - 3, and in such a twisted way that you cannot help but to laugh your a** off! Just take a look at the names: Neve Campbell's character Sidney Prescott becomes 'Cindy (notice the exchanged 'd' and 'n'?) Campbell'. Hilarious! And it goes on like that.For those who haven't seen it yet, I would say it is making fun of the following movies: 90% Scream 1-3, 7% I know what you did last summer, 1% Blair witch project, 1% American Pie and 1% Matrix - even though that seems off-topic, but you just has to love it when you see the parallels.Oh yes, of those 90% Scream I'd divide it as follows: Scream 1: 75%, Scream 2: 20%, Scream 3: 5%. And I really liked it that way!And, again, the warning to all German spectators: Go to your local video store and rent all three Scream movies in English!

This movie disappears below the surface entirely because there is almost nothing funny in it. Indeed, many scenes have been lifted whole from ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie"" without the addition of any humorous twist whatsoever.OK the movie theatre scene is quite funny and Anna Faris is as good as the script will allow as the terrorised virgin, but that's all I have to say in favour of this limp and tasteless attempt to rip off moviegoers.If the horror spoof mini-genre appeals to you I would recommend the similar, but mildly amusing ""Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth"".",Scary Movie

The South Park Movie had one life like penis and some cartoon female flesh so it was ok.  I just think there needs to be more balance.

When I saw the trailer I wasn't too enthusiastic about the movie: I mean, I laughed but it sounded too much like that other parody, BASEketball, which quite frankly was total crap, not funny at all. So, keeping in mind that I'm a huge fan of the Scream trilogy and that I had seen the other movies this one parodied, I went to the nearest movie theater to see it. And my conclusion is: 4/10, due to the fact that I knew by heart the movies it parodied, and so it made a lot funnier to watch, but on the down-side I rate it like so because of the way it was written, too incoherent, and that weird guy who I hate. Oh, and also due the fact that some of the jokes were too much in your face and weren't as funny as they should.

The plot does not exist because this...thing for no reason switches to a needless sex scene or some other perverted scene just for the sake of putting one there. None of those scenes have any relation to the movie, if it was one. In fact, you might think you are watching a different film when the scene switches abruptly to a sex scene. As for the scenes that satrize films like the Matrix, Sixth Sense, Blair Witch Project and Scream, those were done poorly because the actors genuinely look like they were trying hard but unsuccessfully to imitate the scenes. The actors...are just pitiful. Anyone who would agree to act in such a film is either perverted or in desperate need of money. The acting is the same boring thing every time. For instance: person sees killer, person becomes supposedly ""scared"" and panics, killer stabs person. Whenever any of the main characters see the killer heading towards them with a knife, its always the same reaction. Their eyes go wide and the go ""Oh My God! Its him! Run!"" After about 5 times of the afore mentioned it becomes less funny and more stupid and pointless. I've heard a lot of good and bad remarks about this waste of my time.

She even had to stop it about 40 times to go to the washroom because she almost wet herself laughing.  This movie was very funny.  The cast excellent, the story unforgettable, the characters memorable.  The story was brilliant, course it was written by the Wayans brother who I think are hysterical.  The cast was phenominal, I loved Anna Farris in this movie.  I also love Cheri O'Teri, who I used to love watching on SNL.  I think Gail Hailstorm (Cheri O'Teri's character) has got to be the most memorable character for me.  Anna Farris though, she did an awesome job.  She played the role of Cindy Campbell terrifically.  The tagline for this movie is sooo... true, you will die laughing.  I know when I was done watching this movie, I had to take a few seconds to catch my breathe because I was laughing tooooo hard.  Lochlyn was also funny as Greg, it's nice to see a fellow Canadian in the movies once in a while.  He was good. The spoofs were more than words can describe.

I do wish it was rated NC17 as we took our 13 year old girls. Had we known there were pictures and references to male anatomy we wouldn't have taken them. But that was the only reason we wouldn't have taken them. Some of the jokes were ongoing, like the joke about a main character being gay, but it was done in such a way that we thought it was funny and kept getting funnier.

A totally banal and insipid comedy with labored setups and meager payoffs.  Nearly every punchline is predictable and, thus, spoiled. Spoofs of ""The Matrix"", ""The Usual Suspects"", and that idiotic ""Whassup?"" beer commercial are just plain dull.

Technically, it is absolutely terrible. But there is just something about the Wayans that makes it absolute comedy gold! It is a spoof of mainly scream and a few other horror films, and it just does the perfect job of tearing them to shreds. The ghost face killer is no longer going to make teenagers shiver, but rather fall on the ground p***ing themselves laughing and reminiscing this fantastic comedy. The scene where ghost face killer gets high with shorty is one of my personal favourite comedy moments.If I have to point out one or two flaws, firstly, this is not for everyone. The humour is as crude as it comes (haha, cums), and not every attempt at laughs pull it off. However, the humour is so often, that you are ;laughing at least once every minute. One last miner nag is that this is a boys film, and if you are a girls or a boy on your own, you will not find this movie nearly as funny without all your mates round. That goes for all the scary movies, and indeed most immature comedies.

Let me preface this by saying that I am a big fan of parody and satire.  I loved the Naked Gun series, Army of Darkness is on my list, and the Airplanes (more the first than the second) were great. This movie is not great. There is a way to do over-the-top scenes, check out The Mask with Carrey for an idea.  This movie goes over the top and beyond, poorly.  When a joke is dead, don't repeat it over and over.  It's not funny and it's not entertaining. Mind you, there are certainly some funny parts of the film.  I laughed out loud several times.  Trying not to give anything away (spoiler alert?)(but why would I want to?): the beauty pageant scene, the on-the-lam father, the matrix rip-off, just to name a few. Sadly, this movie on the whole falls flat.  One joke, or a few, did not make Aliens funny, and the pity is that many jokes didn't make this comedy funny. The execution is poor, the acting stale and stilted.  There were many parts of the film that were simply disgusting without being funny (again, for technically disgusting AND funny, try the scene from The Mask where the dog puts the mask on).  There were too many places where I just couldn't swallow the ludicrous scene they had just shown me (beauty queen's death, electric undies). Add to all this a main character who is unlikable, whiny, and unrelatable, and you've got a big miss in my book. Not only unfunny as a whole, but unentertaining.

I mean, it's like they just took the SCREAM script and stuck a few jokes in it and actually used the SAME script!!  I mean, the words are the exact same!!!  I just couldn't get over it!  It made me so angry.  Kevin Williamson (who wrote both SCREAM 1 & 2 and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID...) should really sue!  I've told people this and they say ""Oh, but that's what a spoof is"".

I definitely think the movie could have done with more jokes and less sex. I mean it, it was just too much! Don't go with your parents/children/siblings, cause you'll be in for a very uncomfortable and awkward time.In my opinion, this movie wasn't worth the ticket, and it most definitely wasn't worth missing ""Jesse"" and ""Veronica's Closet"", two shows that were on TV while I was at this movie.Bottom line: Forget about it, if you want a good comedy, see ""The Whole Nine Yards"", or any other movie, cause this one just isn't funny.",Scary Movie

However, isn't a satire meant to be funny?This was a mismatched sequence of take-off scenes from films such as ""Scream"" and ""I know What You Did Last Summer"", but there was no central plot connecting them, and no humour or intelligence in them whatsoever, therefore rendering the whole concept completely pointless.DO NOT WASTE YOUR LIFE WATCHING THIS EXTREMELY POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR A FILM.

The movie follows the plot of the original Scream very closely, while adding some scenes from I know what you Did Last Summer. Cheri Oteri is great as Gale Thunderstorm. The facial expressions on the killer's mask add to the humor. The killer's identity was no big surprise, driving away with Gale Thunderstorm at the end.There are also a few too many penis jokes in the movie, some of which a few people might vomit at.

418,bootjangler,Onother one on the list of terrible parodies,1,20 April 2013,"To start with a summary, I hated it. To give a balance, I generally like parodies, going back to Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, up to Airplane, plus 'college' comedies like Aminal House, so possibly I've been spoilt by the best, by I also know and understand offensive, toilet humour. This film mainly tries to parody 'Scream' which was a parody in itself. How do you parody a parody? Other films included are generally the likes of 'I know what you did last summer' and also 'The Matrix', 'The Usual Suspects and 'The Sixth Sense'. However some, if not most of the parodies of those films fall extremely flat, or simply replay a certain type of scene without any real parody or joke.As said, Airplane is one of my favourite ever parodies, and it would be hard for any movie to match that, and many have tried and failed, but this movie seems like an attempt by a junior class of 12 year-olds. The 'funny bits' are bashed together generally, almost as if the different writers did all of their stuff separately, and didn't bother to a) make it gel and b) check if it was funny or not.

I was clock-watching much of the time, couldn't wait for it to be over; it was so pointless, the plot was so thin and characters so unsympathetic, that I could barely make it to the end. And I hate giving up on a piece of work like a film or book before the end, but this is easily one of the worst I've ever seen in that respect - there was just so little to hold my attention. I couldn't have cared much less what happened by the end.I had expected so much more. I knew going in that it was a spoof and I've seen most of the stuff it was spoofing, but it just didn't do it well. What I assume were the 'laugh' moments were just not very funny, not even in an American Pie way (I actually find that film hilarious, even with its gross-out humour, because it does it well and balances it with plot, relatable moments and well-written characters) - this film had the gross-out but not the humour. It's not a patch on Airplane! Not even as good as Hot Shots! Some parts were so gross, and not funny at all - just gross. I won't spoil it with detail but there are at least 2 scenes of male nudity that were totally gross and not funny in any way, apparently the appearance of this should be a joke in itself according to the writers, but no actually - you need clever comedic writing to make a joke, not just show some genitalia. That's what makes the difference between the gross-out humour in this v American Pie or There's Something About Mary. Here, they shove (insert gross scene/image here) in and expect you to automatically laugh just because it's there, instead of showing relatable moments where (gross scene/image) is inadvertently involved but not the main thing happening - this makes such a difference.The regular references to people's skin colour and related stereotypes were tiring - I get that this is an American thing, but it gets so old and as a non-American I couldn't find it funny at all. Also, the near-constant objectification and belittlement of women's bodies was hard to watch. Some bits were genuinely funny, I'll give it that - they were just so few and far between. The best funny bits were those where the events were OTT (of course, it's a spoof after all) but still relatable to real life. But most of it is just, as I said, gross.I'm sure that in more capable hands, this could've been really good, but I only really laughed a few times throughout the entire film. Such a pity. I won't be watching the sequels that's for sure.

These clips are far more ammusing than the childish humour on show in Scary Movie. Maybe Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson should strike back and make a parody of the parody of the parody of the horror movie, I'm sure the film studios would buy it, they were fooled into paying for the trash that is Scary Movie. It plays the Scream script word for word, shot for shot. Weren't they bright enough to think for themselves?

The others, nothing sensationnal... Marlons Wayans is hilarious...This film will pass in memory, it's better like this... the film parody has seen better days...

It is a parody on the 90's scary movies (see other comments for a complete list), so what you get is a bunch of teenagers having fun, sex, movies, drugs and so on and making a laugh of it.Many comment writers complain being offended by the sexual references and remind their good taste. These people should not watch comedies like this one. This film is for those of you who don't take themselves too seriously. Only watch it, if you can laugh about yourself sometimes.

Rareer still is a quality product, and the Wayans Brothers' ""Scary Movie"" doesn't fail for the most part.Unfortunately this is one of those films where movie critics cannot tell you much about the flick you want to see.  (And if they do, they should be dragged out into the street and shot.)  So much of this movie should be kept in secrecy because part of the fun of watching a spoof is to be surprised in which films are lampooned.An obvious target for ""Scary Movie"" and the film which most of the nonsense plot is the ""Scream Trilogy.""  Irony has it that the original name for ""Scream"" was to be ""Scary Movie"" but I seriously doubt it would have been anything like this.Starring Shannon Elizabeth, Carmen Electra, a pair of Wayans brothers (Marlon and Shawn to be exact) and a whole lot of crassness, ""Scary Movie"" is most definitely the one your parents wouldn't want you seeing.  Featuring no less than three true-to-life phallic insterments, the Wayans seem to be giving the Farraleys the finger.  (Or perhaps saluting them with one, I dunno.)All in all the film comes together thanks to alot of ""Scream"" and even more absurd pranks from other modern horror films.  A number of jokes fall flat, get tiresome, or are just too bad to be funny.  Most of them land one right after the other.See ""Scary Movie"" if you are into this sort of thing, pass it up if you aren't.Scary Movie Grade B+",Scary Movie

My boyfriend asked all the people working at the video store if this was a good movie all of them said it was horrible and supposedly it got bad reviews as well but theres one other movie in the world thats made me laugh that hard. I agree with another user comment that you should see a hand full of the movies it makes fun of before seeing it otherwise it just wont come off as funny.

The actors play their hearts out in this parody/comedy. Everyone actor in the movie is in his prime and maybe this is their best roles. Ray - his gay kind of character is hilarious and his jokes are just on the limit of not to offend anybody or to be uncomfortable to watch. Shorty - freaking funny and insane with his shouting jokes. Cindy - innocent, stupid and naturally funny. Bobby - absolute punk, funny as hell, especially the part where he explains to Cindy and Ray that he's gay at the end, I laughed my ass out at this part. Brenda - so natural to play rude black woman. Buffy - the ultimate bitch, he plays herself. Miss Thunderstorm - awesome hot ass reporter, a little bit evil to her cameraman. Greg - the ultimate macho, but with the smallest dick ..hahahahahaha, hilarious character. Doofy - the best retard in a movie ever made. The Slave and his master in Amistad II...OMG may be the funniest part in the movie - to see how black director make fun of slavery in America.

Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Nia Long, Anna Ferris, and Carmen Electra. With also the deceased Prince playing a small role in the movie. Of course the movie has references to the deaths and in the ending every one is revived no one is dead really. A scene I really adored was the scene of Buffy setting murdered.

The trailer did tell me that it was going to be an awesome funny movie, but not.

444,absolutetravist,Just Slightly Smarter Than Scream 3,4,6 July 2016,"Coming out in 2000, the Wayans and their parody entrepreneurs were up against another film stomping on the Scream license, that being Scream 3. One would end a franchise (for a while) that started with greatness and the other would start another franchise that wish it could be as clever as the other film however dumb it is.Much how Craven revisited Woodsboro eleven years later, there was a morbid curiosity in seeing if sixteen years later Scary Movie ever deserved even one sequel. Almost guiltily the potential for a franchise is there in a lowbrow if decent enough comedy. Perhaps it's an ironic form of nostalgia having witnessed the desolate laugh vacuums that were the later entries such as Epic Movie or Disaster Movie but the original is not that bad at all.It's biggest compliment being it actually resembles a film. In that it follows a basic three act structure, has a natural pace adopted from source material, and even characters that abide by basic archetypes while showing a smidgen of actor personality. These all seem a given however after enduring the quality of the latter films, the restrained assemblage of film parodies here all compliment each other well, tied together and flowing along with a sense of competency long gone now.After complimenting the actual ability to parody horror films, this is also a Wayans film. It's not entirely unexpected that a fair 80% of the punchlines are basically ""the joke is I'm black"" with the other percent being ""I'm gay"". While the diet-homophobia is fairly tone deaf (the killer's motive simply being he's gay, oh wait, one of them just 'acts' gay... cue laughter) the Wayans do manage to land a solid amount of racial humour. One timeless if easy gag being the all black news team reporting they're ""getting the f*** outta here!"" before speeding off. It's also funny in an ever-so-slightly awkward way watching Scream afterwards the sheer complete absence of any PoC actors in that film, which seems to be intentionally and heavily corrected in the sequel.It's this humour that seems to answer the age old debate of whether a bold and uncompromising comedy like Blazing Saddles could be made today. Let's be clear: the Wayans are no Mel Brooks. That being said, it's almost disappointing that after a first solid entry, the Scary Movie franchise could've improved over time and become almost respectable in skewering of the genre. Unfortunately it strayed from scary movies like Icarus attempting to tackle all of cinema and forgot what the word satire meant.",Scary Movie

So why is this teenage horror movie spoof so different from ""Blazing Saddles"", the western movie spoof which took sixth place on the AFI list. Both movies used gross imagery and took effective jabs at contemporary social mores. However, the Mel Brooks classic was an original movie which performed a public service by exposing a tired movie genre.

I do not understand why people find these sickening displays so amusing. Even more disturbing was the way people in the theater screamed and even applauded the most immature sexually explicit scenes. I actually regret that I enjoyed any part of the movie. It's a shame that the good scenes had to be completely overshadowed by material that I'm reasonably sure some of my old junior high classmates could have composed. To me, in reference to all movies, romance as portrayed by graphic sex, action as displayed by graphic violence and humor as displayed by throwing in every curse word or sexual term you can think of is not very impressive.

Thereafter ""Scary Movie"" only tries to get laughs through mindless shock value. Someone gets impaled with a penis, ejaculation and erection gags occur at least once every other scene, and twice we're supposed to laugh at how callous and uncaring people are as they watch and actively enjoy people getting stabbed repeatedly. I like horror movies, and I do enjoy comedies. But when a movie relies solely on shock value it loses credibility. It's easy to make people laugh at stupid jokes like these.

It was neat trying to see who was going to be spoofed next!The down side was that the humor was almost completely sexual in orientation, and many scenes were definitely NOT appropriate for young children or even early teenagers.  Not unless you are a parent who's comfortable with sitting the kids down after the movie and explaining the silicon mastectomy, the white fountain of ejaculate, the big deal on penis size, or what people do with those sex toys.  Most parents in the theater I was in were not able to handle those topics, and some even covered their children's eyes during many scenes (the children being ages 11-13).I viewed it with a recent high school graduate, a friend in the early 20s, and another friend in the early 30s who works with children.  While we had differing opinions on how good it was, we *ALL* agreed that the R-rating should be followed in that it is NOT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG TEENS AND CHILDREN.In some ways it was funny, but the humor got old very quickly unless you concentrated more on the non-sexual spoofs part of it.For those that did like it, or are a big fan of the Wayans brothers style of comedy, make sure that you stay and watch ALL of the credits -- there's an extra scene at the end!

However this film takes the Farrelly Brothers approach with using many crude jokes that include gallons of the Hair Gel in There's Something about Mary. The film mirrors the storyline of scream with similar dialogue but this is part of the joke. I think the target audience for this film is between 16-25. I would definitely advise anyone younger than 16 not to watch this, as it might be a little to crude. I think to increase the viewing pleasure of this film I would recommend seeing several films first which are Scream 1+2, IKWYDLS and the Usual suspects. The others will not make that much difference to understanding the gags because they are funny anyway.This film features several young talented actors who are willing to make fools out of themselves for the films sake.

Lots of bad puns over gays, blacks people, gangstas, bimbos and well american high school over all. In short, I thought it sucked. But then I realized that I had used the wrong measuring tools. I mean when you do a parody you have to work your mind in a special way. When your making a parody of a parody, you have to take the whole thing two steps further. And really freak out.

The gross out jokes will no doubt make many people uncomfortable.  In retrospect, this movie should have probably been NC-17, but it was really pretty harmless. (the girl-in-the-movie-theater-talking-on-the-phone bit should have been done a long time ago) The stereotyping is pretty bad, but again, harmless. I was more or less shocked at the material, rather than offended. There could have been less Scream spoofs and more ""old-school"" horror jokes, but I wouldn't trade the Doofy material for anything.  Great impersonation! Cheri Oteri was a wonderful presence, in a great Blair Witch knockoff.  The ghostface killer does a nifty little Friday the 13th music impression. And, there is a very brief Halloween spoof with Cindy in the classroom. The sex jokes were way over-the-top but pretty darn clever.  After seeing Me, Myself, and Irene (which was god-awful, especially if you're used to seeing Jim Carrey doing good movies) I was thrilled to leave Scary Movie thoroughly pleased.

The rest of the movie lacked taste and was designed for the many desensitized teenagers who are raving about this film. I should hope that the Wayans troupe will do better with a sequel, as they've had success in the past (in both TV and movies).It seems like they were striving for a ""Naked Gun"" or ""Airplane"" sort of slapstick comedy with this movie, yet it comes off as images of male body parts and homosexual activity and crude jokes - none of these were necessary in those other films to make people laugh.  It also seemed like the director was trying to fit as many different film references in as short a time as possible, and this just causes confusion for those of us who like a good parody.I wouldn't honestly recommend this movie to anyone.

I haven't seen anything in this movie that I hadn't seen in Sex in the City that was offensive, but yet that show is a masterpiece by everyones standards.  But when a movie makes fun of other movies and throws in sexual humor, that's just appalling to them.  It's just a movie people, it is taking cliches, stereotypes, and making them funny!

I expected to cringe at a few of the jokes walking in, and had I not, I would have questioned my taste limits.  The movie's there to offend.  It's a spoof, a satire, and just as with others' works in such categories, the greatest group to speak up seem to be the ones who were horribly offended and sickened by it.  It's just a movie.  Take it with a grain of salt and milk the fun for all it's worth.All in all, I enjoyed it.  This is probably the best spoof to come out in the past decade, and I'm glad to see that the Wayans are still not bound by the limits of good taste.  They work best that way.  This is coming from a gal who was raised on tapes of the good episodes of ""In Living Color"" and accepts the Wayans' raunchy humor used in those episodes and in this movie as something good.  I'd much prefer this sick movie over the other sick movie of the summer - ""Road Trip"".  Head and shoulders better than that.

It was never going to be a mind-stretcher like The Usual Suspects, so if you can tell who the killer is straight away that's probably part of the irony! Furthermore those who have warned others about taking their children to see the film have clearly lost sight of the fact that R-rated movies are rated so because they are likely to confuse or repulse young children, or go straight over their heads. So they shouldn't be watching the film anyway - the very fact that it's called Scary Movie and that Laverne & Shirley from 1976 is referenced should indicate this! There aren't as many phallic images as made out either. There's one full-on one in a photograph, the rest are all disguised.***POSSIBLE SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH***I think most of the negative press stems from lack of understanding of the film references, of which there are a lot. I had seen just about all of the movies parodied, but there were some blank faces around me - for example, if you haven't seen The Usual Suspects, the ending will seem fairly standard and won't have the extra irony it presents for those who have. On which theme, being from the UK I seem to have missed the Budweiser 'Wassup?' parody that people have found funny - perhaps someone could e-mail me to clear it up? Cheers :)All in all I found Scary Movie hilarious and recommend it despite the occasional disgusting moment. My only criticism is that, at times, it seems like a re-run of Scream with the occasional improved line thrown in from another film, and one or two of the jokes are embarrassingly unfunny e.g. the Spice Girls reference.

It seemed like at least 75 percent of the film was lifted directly from the films it ""parodied"", sometimes almost word for word.  The constant crude humor quickly became grating.  It isn't possible to create a memorable film out of dozens of dick jokes without backing them up with good characters.  This is why ""Something About Mary"" succeeded for me while ""Scary Movie"" failed.  In fact, the only character I remember now is the stoner character, and this is only because I found him to be the most annoying of the lot.  That this film broke the 100 million dollar mark shows the degree to which juvenile attitudes have pervaded modern cinema.

I wish I had checked the IMDb on this movie before viewing it, as I don't think it's really my girlfriend's (or in fact, any girl's) type...In Israel, MPAA ratings and local age limitations are not enforced, so children aged 10 and less were in the theater. This movie is really not for them. This movie included photos of penises, and almost graphic oral sex scenes and talk, which can upset even strong porn-viewing audiences. Parents around the world - If you don't let your children watch porn films, don't let them watch this one.The film would have been much better with the porn scences cut out, and replaced with better jokes.

First of all, this movie basically copied Scream. I had to double check my ticket to see if this was Scream or Scary Movie! They took about 3/4 of the lines from Scream...which, some lines are okay, but I mean, comon! I know they were poking fun, but did they have to say exactly everything that happened?

The only death that was funny was Shannon Elizabeth...And, I didn't even know half of the characters names!!! I thought Shannon Elizabeth did pretty good...But everything else...was just Godawful. And, what is with all of the Sex jokes??? They were gross and stupid...I would've paid $4.50 to see American Pie if I wanted to see sex jokes...I know that this was just a parody and these movies shouldn't be taken seriously, but when you're spoofing horror movies, you don't need the same lame jokes over and over!",Scary Movie

There is a ton of very lewd humor, and the subject matter is probably only really funny to those who have both seen and appreciated the movies it spoofs.

It spoofs (or downright copies) Scream 1,2 and 3, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, The Blair Witch Project, a nod to The Shining, and the now infamous ""Wassap!"" beer commercial, all done in a style which would have made the Zucker brothers proud (Airplane, Kentucky Fried Movie, Police Squad).If you liked the above movies, you'll probably find something to laugh at in this one.  If not, or if you insist on some thread of consistency or deeper philosophical meaning in your entertainment, go rent ""Citizen Kane.""",Scary Movie

YES, I know this is a parody and I have nothing against crude humor, but when it's in nearly every scene, it can get pretty awkward and boring.

However, from the opening scene to the closing credits I did not laugh one time and found myself mildly chuckling at only one or two scenes. For the most part I found this film to be one of the most vulgar, base, puerile, and downright offensive movies I've had the mispleasure of viewing. Had I not been sitting in the middle of a crowded section I most certainly would have walked out on this one -- something I've never done before simply because of a film's stupidity.

So the idea that the cynical banter would be lightened and made fun of as cynical banter sounded like it was capable of holding at least some humor in it.Despite these low expectations it was still a disappointment. In fact this is now among the highly select group of movies I have walked out of, consisting only of the Touch of Evil rerelease and the live-action Spawn movie. This movie takes bad taste to a new level and attempts to out-gross anything that the Creators of American Pie or the Farrely brothers could even dream of. It lacked any sort of value and the humor was entirely geared towards the stupid, hormone driven teenage male.This movie is a complete and utter waste of time and money and despite the fact that I didn't pay for it at all, I still wish I had been given something to at least somewhat equal that squandered hour of my life that will never be returned.",Scary Movie

I am not one of those people who criticize a comedy because the story is dumb or the acting isn't Oscar caliber, I love a good parody. This film however did not even come close to my expectations. There were a few genuinely funny moments, but overall the film was a stinker. I think the idea of making fun of the recent rash of horror films is a great idea, but this one never gets off the ground. Perhaps the Wayans' failed to realize that ""Scream"" was Wes Craven's tribute to the predictable, rehashed horror movies of the 1980's. It was a parody in itself.

I was in the theatre with people from 16-60 and there was not a whole lot of laughter. The humor (apart from the crude sexual bits) seemed to be aimed at 8 year olds.

If one of these latter films leaves you rolling in the isles, then the lack of development is overseeable. Otherwise they are not good enough.

What we do get is a no holds barred parody of the recent rash of teen horror flick that have come out in the last few years.  Scream, The Sixth Sense, I Know What you did Last Summer, and the Matrix among others all are given an ol' punch in the guts through this film.  The plot, which is very thin, is used only to keep the gags running along.  But who cares?  This film is very much aware it is a movie, and takes good advantage of it, with the gags coming along a mile a minute.  Scary Movie is meant to be silly, and it pulls more jokes off more than it misses.  I found myself laughing heartily at this film, along with the majority of theater.  From the amazingly hilarious opening sequence, which features the ravishingly beautiful Carmen Electra, to it's subtle gags involving the facial expressions of the killer's mask, Scary Movie is non-stop laughter from the beginning to the end.

""Scary Movie"" had me thinking the same thing, but I didn't laugh. The above movies were gross, but they were on a different level -- and they varied the content.  This movie had a handful of jokes that were played over and over and over and...""Scary Movie"" got real tired real quick.  The first gay joke was funny. The 50th was not.  The first oral sex joke (a rip-off of  a classic Chris Elliot moment in ""Mary"") wasn't funny. The 50th was offensive.  The first naked male brought a chuckle.  The next few times, I had to turn away.  Drugs and dopers were funny in ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", but Spicoli rarely mentioned them or was even seen with them.  His attitude and actions told it all.  Everything out of Marlon Wayans' mouth is cliched drug references. It bored me.The movie did have some funny moments.  Carmen Electra in Drew Barrymore's role from ""Scream"" was classic.  The remake of the ""Wassup"" commercials had me.  The ""The Blair Witch Project"" spoof showed exactly what everyone who saw the movie was thinking.  I especially enjoyed the girl watching ""Shakespeare in Love"".   There were just too few of these moments.I wish that more time was spent in developing this movie.  References to the Bud commercial and ""Big Momma's House"" show how recently this was thrown together.

The ""riverdancing-in-midair"" scene made absolutely no sense.Most of the jokes were unoriginal. I've seen the Blair Witch Project flashlight scene on about ten different television shows and commercials. Why did Keenan Ivory Wayans think I'd laugh at it just one more time? There wasn't anything special about this movie, with the exception of an overabundance of male genitalia.If you're into movies with some offensive material that are ACTUALLY FUNNY you should check out some Trey Parker films, such as the under-rated ""Baseketball"".

Even the most weird jokes, like the fountain-like ending of a sexual encounter made me laugh loud. I was amused, while my friends kept saying that it was a bad movie. Half a year later I wanted to see it again, to think again about this film. I rented it on video recently. Well, and again I was laughing hysterically at some times. The job of a comedy is to make me laugh -  Scary Movie made me laugh. But.. I see myself as a sentient being, and I realize that Scary Movie is bad. Really Bad. The humor is beyond stupid. One half of the film is f*rt-jokes, another half is about oral-***. Add some p***s-jokes, and some stuff about being/looking homosexual. Everything is mixed together with the help of a lot of references to other scary movies. Is it funny? No doubt! But only when your brain is on stand-by while watching. Otherwise you'll notice the the unbearable quality of the script. People deliver strange lines, but it goes unnoticed by the other characters. It's as if while somebody is saying something, all the other chars are deaf. They don't listen to each other. (Like the loud announcement of the party - Sidney does not react.) This kind of joke somehow annoyed me. Being at things I disliked.. I hated the reference to ""The Usual Suspects"". A bad movie does not get better by quoting from an intelligent one. Other borrowed scenes were better. (The 'dancing in the air' following the Matrix rip-off was the worst S/FX in quite some time.) I recommend seeing this film for it's trash-value.

549,hasan0811-292-607267,A funny but ultimately unmemorable parody,6,14 February 2012,"The whole film is a parody of the horror movie ""Scream"" with a few altered segments from other films combined and a slightly different twist at the end, to try and create a more unexpected finish. Overall the plot isn't the best (although parodies of other movies are adeptly entwined into the film) and the acting is far from great (but in a film such as this that can be excused and perhaps even makes the film seem all the better), the overall effect creates an extremely crude and funny movie that'd be great if you're looking for just one night to relax and lighten up, with some hilarious moments and great adaptations of other movies. But all in all it's just a parody that's been stretched to a movie length that you may or may not find funny, depending upon what you are expecting from the film, and though it may make you laugh uncontrollably for some time it'll just be a movie that you'd forget about shortly after.",Scary Movie

While parodying various scenes from well known scary movies, the Wayans brothers have the knack for adding one-liners that are just hysterical. Cheri Oteri as Gail Hailstorm is golden with her delivery, some of the funnier examples include chasing after Cindy for an interview and yelling ""Cindy, your ass looks fat!"", and as she recollects herself after being floored ""okay, who copped a feel?"". Anna Faris as Cindy is a real find, and spot on with her feigning of Neve Campbell-esquire fear. However, the big winner in this movie for me is Regina King, who plays Brenda. My friends and I have often found ourselves replaying her scene where she is watching Shakespeare in Love, where every line is pure gold. A must for the DVD collection.",Scary Movie
552,Trinadtsat_Tomitsu,Should've gone straight to video,1,15 May 2006,"I find the fact that this movie is so highly acclaimed is an unfortunate indicator of the collective IQ of 75-90% of the human population under 30 (hint: it's the same number as the rating I gave this film). I'm sure there were one or two funny things, but hell if I can remember. The matrix parody where Cindy freezes in mid-air is done extremely poorly. A lot of things they parodied have already been parodied better, and many of them are the kind of things that only need to be parodied once.For instance, they parodize a zoom-in shot by accidentally going too far and bashing Cindy in the head with the camera. This was already done in Spaceballs, and it was done better. When Dark Helmet got hit with the camera, he fell to the ground unconscious and they went on to the next scene. In this atrocity, Cindy just backs up and fakely says ""OW!"" like the stupid brown-haired blonde she is. Some people may say the fact that the ""OW"" was fake was funny. It was not. Bad acting is not equal to comedy. Plus, she gets hit by the actual lens, which at this point looks like it must be the size of a TV screen, and obviously doesn't have that shroud around the front of the lens. But all that aside, the parody was done in Spaceballs. We get the point. Don't turn a funny thing like this into something that gets thrown into all parodies just as a cheap way to increase the lulz factor.A good indicator of how funny someone is, is whether or not they can think of real jokes without having to resort to blatant and profane references to sex and drugs. The sexual innuendo was old before they even started it. I can just imagine some bozo behind a desk saying, ""hey, I can't come up with any real jokes so let's just have the guy say 'LOL I WAS HOPING TO HAVE MY BALLS LICKED'"". Yeah, that's good comedy right there. ""Stop sticking your dick in the vacuum cleaner""? Wtf? As if that joke wasn't lame enough, two shots later they've got to show Doofus walking around the house with a vacuum cleaner hose and a hardon. The drug jokes aren't much better. ""Lunch isn't a subject."" ""It is when you've got the munchies!"" How is this even remotely funny? Because it's an obscure reference to the fact that the character is on cannabis? Please. His acting is an all too obvious indicator that he smokes more weed than your local police chief, and even if it wasn't, the joke is just not funny. Someone needs to realize that just because a joke has blatant references to sex and/or drugs does not make it remotely funny. And the shots of partially naked male actors, well that's just disgusting. Go back to your fraternity, you're a disgrace to real men.If this movie wasn't bad enough, they've got to make not one, not two, but three sequels. Come on! Three movies is the limit in almost all cases, the only exceptions being ongoing series like Star Trek and Star Wars, and series that focus on one ""ultra-hero"" like James Bond, Indiana Jones, and Columbo. Even the Godfather, which was a series, was still only three movies, with no conceivable reason to make a fourth. They knew when to quit. The Terminator? Terminated, after three. The way they left it, I see no reason for them to make a forth. But Scary Movie's got to pass that three movie barrier, even though there's not enough content unique to the series to even be able to carry through so many movies. Why? It's not like the cast qualifies as an ultra-hero, because they lack character development and - no brainer for ""ultra-hero"" here - HEROISM. If the movies were simply better I could understand three. But without adding a lot to the movies as a series, even if they were good movies to start with there'd be no reason to break the trilogy barrier.If they were good movies I could understand three. They're not. Two was already pushing it, but I could understand them wanting a second hit after the crack high the first movie seemed to produce. For some inane reason, though, people just keep lapping these movies up like antifreeze in a dog's bowl, and the producers keep selling out by laying more of these cables on the collective intelligence (or lack thereof) of society.",Scary Movie

They did a brilliant job on spoofing the overly silly 90's slasher flicks.  This movie was well written and had a good cast. The thing that probably told me that this movie was good was when I saw a man and wife take their young children out of the movie because of the crude humor.  That's always a plus when you see parents trying to shield their children from the toilet humor that so many Americans have come to love.

A lot of gags were over-the-top, but there were a lot of subtle gags throughout the film, which made me feel that every part of the movie was thoroughly thought through.  There are probably many gags I have missed.The Wayans have always had a wide range of spoofs through television or film.  ""Scary Movie"" is definitely their tightest work.

Other films which were spoofed included the other 2 Screams, both I Know What You Did Last Summer and its sequel, The Sixth Sense and The Matrix.  I think I was the only one in the theatre who laughed when ""Principal Squigman"" came on screen, complete with a Shotz Beer sign on the office wall (which is of course reference to Henry Winkler's appearance as the High School Principal in the original Scream).  My two big beefs with the film are 1) that we never find out who the killer is (he just gets buried under an armoire) and 2) while I personally found all the sexual innuendo funny, it is not a movie appropriate for kids, and there were a couple of young kids in the theatre.",Scary Movie

Better than 'April Fools Day'! Better than... I can't think of any more horror/comedies... Oh well...'Scary Movie' essentially (out & out) steals it's story from 'Scream' scene for scene with some 'I Know What...' elements and a plot twist from 'Usual Suspects'. The only difference? Altered dialogue, exaggerated characters, numerous parodic vignettes and heavy, HEAVY doses of EXTREME raunch. Think back to Johnny Depp's death scene in the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street'. Now replace the blood with...If your mind went straight to the gutter on that one then you'll love this film! Far surpassing the Farrelly's efforts by sheer volume, this film isn't subtle... It's blunt, over-the- top, hit-you-with-everything-all-at-once comedy at it's best.Unfortunately, even the best has it's flaws. Some of the vignettes are so annoyingly pointless and unfunny that it takes away from the overall flow. Ex.: The ""I Know..."" flashback scene is funny at first, but soon forgets to be funny and doesn't effect the rest of the film in ANY way! Ex.#2: Although funny, the ""Whazzup!?"" send-up is seemingly thrown in for no reason! 'Airplane!' had at least SOME semblance of purpose for it's send-ups...Funny for funny's sake can be funny... But only if it's funny. Either poorly executed or just plain dumb some of the jokes/gags fall short. Note to everyone: Stop laughing at the same gas-passing jokes used in seemingly EVERY comedy nowadays. It's lame. It's old. Stop laughing and it will go away... When the film hits a lull, it resorts to childish, Adam Sandler-esque humor. Nothing wrong with that, but it's still old-hat.Even with all of it's flaws, 'Scary Movie' is still up to the task of making you laugh out loud. It's the first good film from Keenen Ivory Wayans since 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka'. It's the first good film in the horror/comedy genre. It's the first good film of the week of July 7, 2000.

Needless to say, I was very impressed with the Wayans' satire on the on-again off-again horror genre.  While a lot of the jokes will not make sense if you haven't seen these movies, that should by no means stop you from seeing it.  But be warned, if you can't handle grossout humor, stay away.  This movie takes sex jokes to a whole new extreme; a certain body part makes several appearances in the film.The cast is absolutely fabulous.  Shannon Elizabeth's dead-on parodies of both Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rose McGowan's characters are so funny. Marlon Wayans' is over-the-top with his pothead Shorty. Even the relative unknown stars do a great job, especially Anna Faris, in the Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt roles. Even the opening scene with Carmen Electra was still funny, even though most of it is seen in commericals.No recent movie seems to be left unturned; or commercial for that matter with even the recent ""Whazzup?"" campaign spoofed.  While some of the gags go WAY over the top, I found myself continually laughing at its stupidity. The script is really well-done, even though some of the lines are directly ripped from some of the spoofed films, especially ""Scream."" But since the film is released by Dimension, as was ""Scream,"" I guess they can get away with it. The Wayans' brothers have achieved yet another destined to be successful satire.

It wouldn't be funny if the bimbo were intelligent. Is Naked Gun a classic because Frank Drebn is as skillful as James Bond?

Is it just me or did everyone, including the critics, seem to missed the Brady references? Cindy, Bobby, Greg...sure they were subtle, but I like them, especially how it when with the Wayans' commentary on the ""whiteness"" Williamson's films. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Williamson fan but I appreciate humor in any form. Going back to the ""whiteness"" commentary, the Wayans' have several references in the movie that are funny including a reference to Williamson's commentary in Scream 2. The best part of the movie is that you're guaranteed a laugh or groan from scene to scene with just enough time to catch your breath. Going back to Williamson, the movie takes pot shots at his films' self-awareness which I found amusing, fans of Williamson's work will also be rewarded with a semi-unexpected cameo. The film loosely ties together Dimension's Scary Thriller plotlines well enough that anyone who's seen them will get a good laugh out of them. I was a bit disappointed in not seeing any spoofing or reference to the last of the Scream Trilogy. As for the, ""Oh my god, that's offensive"" stance some seem to have with this film and others such as ""Me, myself and Irene""...why don't you tight <explicative> calm the <explicative> down and laugh. The whole point of these films (to me) is to point out how erroneous those types of views, stereotyping and such are...a movie isn't real life, movies can comment on real life, but in the end it is we, the viewers, that make that commentary possible.

Why not spend more time emphasizing the jokes of the Scream movies (which were actually funny when explored) rather than spend uncanny amounts of time on sex. Hey, it wasn't my movie; I am sure they had a reason for their jokes but if you are seriously looking for a movie filled with memorable and exciting gags that will keep you in stitches, you may feel a little jipped.

I was, however, expecting to laugh and I can confidently say that I didn't laugh even once. It didn't offend me, it didn't gross me out. SCARY MOVIE was terribly unfunny, unoriginal, and uninspired. At one point, Shawn Wayans pretends one of his murder victims was responsible for the cancellation of his show. If that's the case, he should have been stabbing himself and his brother Marlon because, newsflash: THE WAYANS BROTHERS ARE NOT FUNNY. ""In Living Color"" was a good show until it lost its primary cast - ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka"" had its moments. ""Don't Be a Menace . . "" was forgivable. But through all of this, if you couldn't tell the yucks were stilted, you were kidding yourself. It's making tons of money, so we'll unfortunately be submitted to another Wayans tragedy in the near future.People have accused me of having no sense of humor in reference to this garbage, that I'm a movie snob, etc. The only thing scary is the fact this drivel now passes as comedy.",Scary Movie

The Wayans confuse dumb with funny, but on the other hand so do many moviegoers it seems.

You're adult (otherwise you couldn't watch this film) so I imagine you can make the distinction.Burn me at a stake, already, but I liked it.

Even though all the characters in the movie are really funny, the best one had to be Deputy Doofy.This movie will keep you laughing all the way through the end.

While some people may upset that many of the jokes in this movie do not mock the recent popularity of horror movies like it should, they are still hilarious.  The difference between ""Mary"" and Scary Movie is that Scary Movie does not get caught up in itself nor develop a need to form a solid conclusion to the plot.

To make fun of Scream is to try and one-up a bigger, stronger, faster, smarter version of yourself! The Wayans brothers should have known better than to spoof a spoof. The movie emulates Scream too heavily to actually be a send-up. It's more like a remake with dirtier jokes. The parts that spoof other fright films are few and far between.

There are no superstar actors with years of accolades and awards on their coattails.  If you are one of those critics who can't see the enjoyment in movies like American Pie, South Park, or Something About Mary, don't even bother going to the theatre.

How this movie passed as an 'R' is beyond me, but I would have gone to see it anyway.  Some of the intended jokes are so shocking that your eyes will pop out of your head before you even know what you are supposed to laugh about.

I personally am a huge fan of all of the movies that they made fun of, and I think that's why I loved it so much. I was a total mockery of something and the writers did it in such a way where anyone could appreciate it. They didn't just go off of stuff that was in the movies, rather they went off of what everyone would know, even if all the audience ever saw of the other movies was a preview or a commercial. I loved it! GO RENT IT TODAY!",Scary Movie

631,hollyp,worst movie ever,1,9 July 2000,"After seeing this movie I now know what the worst movie ever made is like. First of all, it shouldn't have had an R rating. It's way too disgusting and foul even for that. By the way, surprise! - they gave away all the only funny parts on the trailer, and even those weren't that good. My rating: worst movie ever",Scary Movie
632,seth_protus,Opening day review of Scary Movie,3,7 July 2000,"The Wayans brothers are certainly talented and generally funny but this movie is tailor made for 14-year olds.  The premise is good and the parody references are well chosen, but the film relies too heavily on the typical early teen mix of jokes.One interesting side note is that they bring back many faces from In living Color such as Kelly Coffield (who hasn't been seen since the show ended)",Scary Movie

I knew going in that the humor in this film would probably be a little crude, but I was completely unprepared for it.  This was the most immature, disgusting display of gutter humor that I have ever seen.  I don't consider myself a person to be offended by many things, but this movie was offensive on many different levels.  That saddest part is that the film could have been just as funny and very good without 99% of the crass jokes that were included.  I guess the Wayans brothers showed that they can't be funny without being filthy.",Scary Movie

A lot of the jokes are like those of the Naked Gun series but fail to produce any laughs. There are some glimmers of what a great spoof it could have been.  For instance, the scenes were you see the killer are the funniest because you see him in situations using body language that you would never expect to see from a slasher in a horror movie.  Otherwise its not worth seeing.  Some re-writes to make the movie more coherent would have done a world of good.",Scary Movie

Although I do have to admit the sex scene and bathroom scene and the Gym teacher parts were grotesque. So if you're not going to see it because you dont wanna see gross stuff just close your eyes on those parts the rest is fine. It was good though I wouldn't recommend it to NE one under the age of 11. This is a parody of alot a movies, Scream Series, Sixth Sense, I know what you did series, Halloween H20(Buffy dragging on the ground after leg incident),Blair Witch, Matrix and Usual Suspects. So if you've seen all of these movies you can quickly recognize some funny s**t. AS to the reference it was racist the only part I thought was even border line but definitely was not racist is when the news guy goes ""White folks are dead we gettin the f*** outa here"" and Shorty(Waynes) is a druggie but there's white guys right there next to him smokin pot.

This movie is so unbelievably awful that I almost can't stand to listen to anyone talk about how it was funny. (Note: most of these((the afore-mentioned people who think it was actually funny)) people are under the age of 13 and shouldn't have been able to see the movie anyway) When I left, I was so ashamed, especially when I looked over and saw ten year old children walking out as well.This film is really an argument for the toughing up of admissions at movie theaters. Though everyone accepts the fact that underage kids get into see movies-- especially R rated movies-- maybe things should be made much more difficult for them: the parent or guardian must be with them at all times.But the blame for this disgusting movie being brought to the public lies also in the ratings administration-- How could it not be NC-17! ""Orgasmo"" had 1/5 of the adult situations-- and in the companies from which it came: Dimension, through Miramax, and back finally to Disney, of all places. Parents, if you're upset- call Michael Eisner! You really can't blame the Weinstein brothers, they're just a pair of pimps-- exploiting foreign movies and artists, then taking the credit. But please, don't go to see this revolting movie. If you do, you're just reinforcing a terrible idea. As a knowledgable parent would say: ""Don't encourage them.""

What I didn't like is the timing with the jokes... they didn't know when to stop a good joke and they let it drag on and on.  Why not just put text/cue cards in there for all the lamers they think must be watching it would at least give those of us with brains something else to laugh at as we watch the light go on over their heads!

I even had to stand up in the theatre to catch my breath because I was getting a side ache from laughing way too much.

I've seen some bad movies, but a lot are so bad that they are really good and fun to watch. Not this one, it's just awful. If you've never seen it, here's what to imagine. Take a penis joke, then another one, then another one, then a lame sight gag, then more penis jokes, then some pot jokes and then about 500 more penis jokes. I laughed twice for this entire movie while the rest of the time I just asked ""Is this supposed to be funny?"" But the worst part is that everyone else I know loved this movie.

All the funny jokes in this movie were killed because you've seen them on the commercials. Save your money, save your brain cells, and do not see this movie. Ever.

Unfortunately i doesn't stop at making references to these two films - it's more or less the exact same plot(s). Even the lines are sometimes the same. One joke for instance is exactly the same - just the name of the actor is different. There *are* some good references to other films like ""The sixth sense"", and yes - if you haven't seen the two (base-)films mentioned you might like this one but probably not otherwise.

It kept me happy before my parents divorced and after they first separated, this movie comforted me as I watched it on my iPad (back when iPads were brand new and I used my new one all the time in the early 2010s). So anyway, it was a good movie that still makes me laugh the hardest to this day and really mimics other horror movies well. I have watched 5/6 of the movies in this series (excluding 'Stan Helsing' which I don't even intend to watch) and all of them have mimicked horror movies well and I have watched every horror movie that each film in this series has mimicked so I guess that's how the parodies make more sense. The first movie in the series was definitely the best one, but it can get quite boring after that. I still watch it to this day, as a teenager, and the jokes make more sense now.

I than noticed the huge talent those two had and that's why I was pretty excited when I've heard that they wrote yet another Comedy-Parody movie. I went to the theater with lots of excitement and anticipation. And believe me, I wasn't disappointed when I left the theater! ""Scary Movie"" is a real pleasant break out of life, I almost wet my pants... I never stopped laughing! The wayans brothers simply took every single ridicules thing out of the new yet old genre movies called ""teen-slaughter"" and found a refreshing way to totally mock them. I really enjoyed watching them for 88 minutes making fun of every single movie that was made in the last 5 years with a minimum funding and a bad line of actors that can't even persuade an Eskimo to buy a heater (Maybe beside David & Courtney Cox Arquette) and made millions at the box office (It's just not fare to art!). I also wanted to say that I'm really impressed by the way Lochlyn Munro manages to maintain a magnificent performance every single time (considering his small but wide roles). such as:""A night at the Roxbury"" & ""Dead man on campus"". And also, the Amazing Anna Faris that did a great job on this breakthrough movie for her. In conclusion, I give this Movie a 10 out of 10 in the TRON's scale of movies.

680,JMFIS,Ohhh...the boredom..,1,2 August 2001,"The only laugh I had in renting this movie was in reading on the box that someone considered it ""razor-sharp"" satire and an ""outrageously funny parody"".The box was hilarious!",Scary Movie
681,marksheilden,Better with time,7,23 July 2021,"""Scary Movie"" is suddenly somehow getting better with time; perhaps that's the pendulum swinging back against tastemakers who want content like this erased from the history books. In its day, this hilarious and sneaky-smart film outmuscled its raunchiest competitors. And its influence is still seen in sharp-witted, filth-forward flicks from ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" to recent record label spoof ""Stadium Anthems.""",Scary Movie
682,elisehobbs,Still hilarious,9,2 August 2021,"I rewatched this movie, 20 years after seeing it in theaters. I couldn't stop laughing. The references still hold up and the origins of the franchise shine. Also, what happened to cheri oteri? She's the best,.",Scary Movie
683,jakep-41629,Still (mostly) holds up,7,2 August 2021,"There's so much in here that still holds up and is just funny as the first time i watched it. But there's also a good chunk that just doesn't work anymore, I question if it even worked back then and my laugher was out of shock. The good still outweighs the bad though.",Scary Movie
684,bflighter,SO fun,9,11 August 2021,"I've seen all the movies, and all of them several times. I loved this first film, and set out to see the next three. It started out with the best of intentions and made what I think is a very funny movie. Some of the characters were annoying, and some scenes aren't as funny now or never were in some cases, but they made a movie where you want to see what happens next and what they throw at you, and let's face it. Some of the movies they lampoon were just ripe for the picking.",Scary Movie

687,dvdjbrn,Absolutely awful,1,12 January 2002,"This movie is so unfunny it hurts.  Particularly unfunny is where the woman gets beaten up by her male friend - violence against women is particularly ripe for satire, isn't it?  I'm not 100% positive, but I think that the Wayans brothers may have cribbed most of this from a joke book that a friend of mine wrote in grade 3.  Not for those over the age of 16, or suitable for those under.",Scary Movie
688,djsan77,I cannot stop laughing,10,20 February 2002,"Most of the people found this movie was too much, too gross. Well I have to say that I love this kind of stupid movie. Taking Scream and follow its script in literally making all situations funny, is a great job. Just look at Ray the guy who doesn't even know he is gay, and the killer who makes me laugh everytime I see him. I have seen this movie 5 times now and will probably see it again and again. Much better than the second one, Scarymovie is worth watching.",Scary Movie
689,sum41chick07,BAD!This Movie Stinks on ice!,1,19 March 2002,"OK. There was no way of following this movie. Once They'd start on something they jump to the next. It is by far the most boring, laziest, worst put together, and dumbly acted movie I have ever seen. The rating it got was giving it too much credit!",Scary Movie
690,ZenoWariorJanitr,HIGHlarious,10,2 June 2002,"Hahaha..it's a great movie.  The fact that I'm easily amused is a different story.  All in all, it's a movie for those easily amused, have dirty minds, can laugh at anything, etc.  But don't take the movie seriously,...it's just a movie..",Scary Movie
691,xEllaBellax,Bad bad movie...,1,18 August 2005,"This was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen... What? Am I supposed to laugh when the killer is killing Buffy? Am I supposed to laugh when they're screaming ""wassup?!"" in the phone? Am I supposed to laugh when they hit the fisherman or whatever, and him being fine and all and they accidentally kill him again? Am I supposed to laugh when Cindy shaves her face? Am I supposed to laugh when the killer rips Drew's clothes off and suddenly the sprinklers went on and she's running like in Baywatch? Am I supposed to laugh when suddenly everybody starts killing ... was her name Brenda? Anyway the girl at the theatre...I could just go on and on and on but I assume you all get the point...The only good in this movie was Cheri Oteri (Gail Hailstorm).",Scary Movie
692,Mitchcraft,Hilarious parody of 90s horror movies. As a teen of the 90s i still laugh to this day.,10,16 May 2021,"If like me you are a fan of 90s horror such as SCREAM 1 & 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Blaire Witch Project and have a good sense of humour you're going to love this. I watch this once every year and still find it funny.If you have not watched the above mentioned movies I recommend you do so before watching this or you wont get any of the references.The rating is far too low for such a well written parody by the Wayan Brothers. This is by far their best project they ever done.If you are looking for a fun night with goofy fun jokes with a little bit of horror thrown in then I recommend this. I would be surprised if you don't laugh at least once.",Scary Movie
693,fatdog3000,The Movie of all movies!!!,10,14 November 2003,"Scary Movie 1 and 2 have to be the number 1 movies of all time not just being very and extremely to the point of crying funny but also the way that they are filmed the Wayns brothers did the best job in the world making this movie I now finally realize that they are more brilliant then Pat Proft (best comedy writer of all time) and the Marx Brothers and Buster Keton and Charlie Chaplin all in one they put the word `Original' in `Parody' and they bring a freshness and brilliants to our otherwise common world of stupid money only making movies, the hart and soul I found in these two movies shows that there are still real people around there that like doing what they do and are very good in it, so that's why I give the Wayns Brothers Funny movies Scary Movie and the best sequel in the world Scary Movie 2 two thumbs up and two tows two and give them 10000000000000 on the best movies of all time chart.fatdog3000 internet surfer",Scary Movie

695,babyfurok,God this is awful,1,31 December 2005,"All I have to say: This is simply the most awful thing I have ever seen. I'll never get those two hours back! I think I saw this when I was 16(?) and even then I couldn't believe just how awful this movie was. I hope to god I can help prevent at least one person reconsider seeing this awful, awful, awful piece of trash. It's not even funny! Obviously it's crude, but many movies are very funny as a result of crude humour. This movie just does everything wrong. I would rather sit thru Santa With Muscles or Baby Geniuses 2. This is by far the worst thing I have ever seen on a movie screen. I could die happy if I knew that no one else would ever see this movie again. Thanks for listening.",Scary Movie

697,timbobracing,My all time favorite comedy,9,6 July 2019,"Sure it's stupid and you'll let out some groans, but this movie is hilarious. I find myself watching this over and over. If you have seen the movies they spoof it makes it that much funnier. Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix. I'm probably missing a couple. The entire cast of Scary Movie is funny, but I do think Anna Faris makes this. While the sequels to this just go downhill more each one, Scary Movie is clever and literally had me laughing the entire movie.",Scary Movie
698,user-719-16379,It really made me laugh,6,22 June 2013,"I watched two series of horrible movies before I watched this one.They are SCREAM series and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER series.When I saw the mask man with hook in his hand,I felt cool.And I also saw THE MATRIX in this movie.In this movie ,the killer is not scary,but cute,full of humorous.I need this kind of movies when I am sad.Not only it made me laugh,but also can I see many movies that I have ever seen before.They have made five SCARY MOVIES till now.During these five movies,I prefer this one and the fourth one.The fifth one has released this year .Even if I watched CABIN IN THE WOODS and MAMA before,I don't like this one.Will there be the sixth one in the future?",Scary Movie
699,franches_97,Very good *spoiler*,9,8 July 2014,"It makes little I saw scary movie and I best thought this plot than scream certainly very entertaining one of my favorite old movies big fan of the films of comic horror and I loved the last part I did not expect doofy I certainly was a good choice of the murderer And good choice of characters ray and ""shorty"" was very entertaining made ​​me laugh a lot the only character I did not like was the Buffy was very irritating. The parodies of other movies like matrix, The Sixth Sense, and part of scream 3 rules for survival (steal) I found the funniest of all though the other were also well I give good score of 9 I recommend this movie for the not yet seen although it is impossible. :)",Scary Movie
700,brenreichwein,Scary Movie,9,2 December 2006,"This was a very funny movie about teens who one night ran over and killed a man. Exactly a year later, there was a killer on the loose only killing their group of friends. The teens are Cindy (Anna Faris), Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Wayans), Ray (Shawn Wayans), Bobby (Freddy Prinze), Greg (Lochlyn Munroe), and Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth). They are fighting for their lives in this hysterical spoof of the Scream Trilogy, Buffy, and more comical spoofs. This movie is rated R by the MPAA due to profanity and graphic sex jokes and pictures. Some of the highlights of this funny movie are Brenda in the Movies, and the flashback of the killing. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans.",Scary Movie
701,lapsuslingua,Not so bad.,6,9 October 2005,"Well... it is not so bad.However it is composed recreating the other scary movies, movies basically thought for teens.Movies that have success cause they are planned for them,naked women, and so on. If you are a teenager you probably will love this kinds of films.By random tonight I saw this movie.And I laugh a lot.Because it is plenty of other movies references, not just about scary movies.Sixth sense, for example a marvelous movie, The matrix just to mention two movies.I have not seen ""I know what you did last summer"" and other movies like that and I saw little shots of "" Scream"" basically because I do not enjoy much these kinds of movies. I think it is worth to see at least by random or desire. You choose.Ana",Scary Movie
702,baugh5694,My Review on Scary Movie,8,7 October 2005,"Excellent! I never let my kids watch Scream, but I watched this, and then let my kids watch it. It was that dang good!My favorite part was when he called that girl, and he said, ""Where am I"" or something like that, and she say's ""You're behind the coach. I can see your feet!""This movie took my personal favorite movie, which I don't let my children watch, scream. and made it a comedy! I mean, how funny can a movie get. Even though it does have some bad parts, my kids loved it!NOTE: Cindy Cambell is so hott! But everybody knows she's a knockoff of Sydney Presscott. And that ghostface, looks much better than the ghostface from scream. This movie is fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuny!",Scary Movie

704,richardp-10,What a hilarious comedy!,10,28 February 2006,"When I first seen this on commercial i was like i have to see it. So when my brother came to get me to see it in theaters i was excited. It was funny when i realized that they were making fun of ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Scream"", and ""Blare Witch Project"" I like the part when she was in the woods running away from the slasher. Saying ""Kenny Kenny move you fat ass, and snot come out and i huge snot bubble. That was funny. It was more hilarious then i thought. I got to say it was funny beginning to end. It kinda got gross in the middle, but ill give it a 9 out of 10. Just for giggles go rent it and watch it. It will make you laugh till you pee your pants.",Scary Movie
