0,Leofwine_draca,Merciless black comedy,10,8 November 2021,"THE TRIP is the latest film from the director of the DEAD SNOW films and it's far superior to those movies; Wirkola feels like he's really grown and progressed as a director and as such there's a lot more depth and 'meat' here. It starts off as a battle between the sexes before moving into home invasion territory; overall I'd describe it as a black comedy going into some very dark places. Aksel Hennie and Noomi Rapace both give excellent, grounded portrayals of the married couple who take bickering to the next level, and later the director ramps up the action and bloodshed to outrageous levels. It also happens to be very funny - I was crying with laughter at certain points - which helps it out a great deal!",The Trip
1,Tweekums,The Trip,9,21 October 2021,"Lisa and Lars have been going through a rough patch in their marriage. They decide to spend some time together at Lars's father's lakeside cabin to patch things up... except that neither intends to do that; they each plan to murder the other for the insurance money! It won't be as easy as either of them think with each gaining the upper hand at times. Then a treat emerges that endangers both of them; Petter, Dave and Roy, a trio of escaped killers were hiding in the attic and now plan to do unpleasant things to Lisa and Lars. Things are about to get nasty.If you like your comedy pitch black then this is for you. The plot may not have great depth but serves to first put the leads at each other's throats before introducing a threat to them both. The earlier scenes in the cabin are laugh out loud funny. This means when the unpleasantness in the basement starts it is quite a shock as it threatens to go into 'Straw Dogs' territory. The humour does return; much of it at the same time as we witness wince inducing violence. The various weapons employed are quite original as well as guaranteeing a lot of gory damage. The cast is solid; most obviously Noomi Rapace and Aksel Hennie as Lisa and Lars respectively. The setting was great; scenic and remote enough to mean we can believe the activities won't be seen or heard by others. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of gory comedies; it was even better than I'd hoped.These comments are based on watching the film in Norwegian with English subtitles.",The Trip
2,paul_haakonsen,This was quite enjoyable...,7,28 October 2021,"I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the 2021 Norwegian movie ""I Onde Dager"" (aka ""The Trip""), and needed no persuasion to do so. Why? Well, solely because it was a Norwegian movie that I hadn't already seen. And no, I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down for watching it, so I wasn't really sure what I was in for here.I have to say that writers Tommy Wirkola, Nick Ball and John Niven definitely managed to churn out a storyline that proved to be entertaining. And it was a storyline that combined elements from various genres of movies, from dark comedy, horror/thriller and action in a very fulfilling manner. So thumbs up to the writers for their collaborative achievement here.There was a good flow and pacing to the story, which meant that there weren't really any dull moments throughout the course of the entire movie. Director Tommy Wirkola definitely had a knack for setting up the scenes and piling gradually on to the storyline.The cast ensemble for ""I Onde Dager"" was great. I was only familiar with Noomi Rapace here, but they had an abundance of good performers in the movie. I will also say that Aksel Hennie, Atle Antonsen, Christian Rubeck and André Eriksen put on great performances and added a lot to the movie.I was genuinely entertained by what director Tommy Wirkola delivered with ""I Onde Dager"", and this is certainly a movie that I can warmly recommend you sit down to watch.My rating of ""I Onde Dager"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",The Trip
3,BandSAboutMovies,Bloody fun!,5,2 October 2021,"Scandanavian director Tommy Wirkola is known in the United States for Dead Snow and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. Now, he has created this film, which was called I onde dager (In Bad Days) in its home country.It concerns a couple - Noomi Rapace (who played Lisabeth Salander in the original films) and Aksel Hennie - who go away to a cabin to reconnect, but they're just going to probably murder one another.In fact, he's been following her with a noose when she turns around and tases him, awakening him to explain how she was going to kill him and make it look like a hunting accident. That's when three criminals that have been hiding inside the cabin make their presence known.This could have been a bit shorter, but with all the black comedy, the blood and the mayhem, I really have no reason to complain.",The Trip
4,Calicodreamin,Surprisingly good,7,20 October 2021,"At no point did I ever really know where this movie was going, and I appreciate that. There were a few funny moments, a lot of top notch gore, and decent acting.",The Trip
5,bombersflyup,Av a larf.,7,16 October 2021,"I onde dager could certainly be cleaner, but fun it is.It's amusingly silly, gets weird, then spirited and funny again. One thing happens after another, no one simply goes away, it gets extreme. The father coming to save the day and still managing to go on after being impaled and shoved into a lawnmower's gold. I couldn't understand the foreign music or see the scrabble words etc so I would've missed some things, but I liked the film enough.",The Trip
6,A_Different_Drummer,Possibly worst production values ever for a Netflix release,5,16 October 2021,"OMG, the audio, the music, the lighting! Within a few moments of the opening credits, the ""hollow echo"" of all the sound pickups will tell you that every possible cost-saving shortcut was taken to get this one to market on a shoestring budget. Some clever ideas, yes, but the execution is terrible. I picked this up for Rapace who at one time was an A-lister but this production marks her career low.",The Trip
7,joiningjt,"This writer/director is BRILLIANT we hope no we PRAY he keeps making comedy/horror films, PHENOMENAL!!",9,2 November 2021,We watched this hilarious brilliant film and did no research at all it just looked good so we said let's watch. Comedy/horror films have become our favorites but most are 5s and 6s at best. The writer AND director of this film knows how to do it. We loved this film and after looking on IMDb found out he also was responsible for the PHENOMENAL 2 masterpiece films dead snow 1 and part 2!! Our top 10 comedy horrors now have 3 of his films in it. We LOVED this film everything about it!! PLEASE KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING...its absolutely BRILLIANT!!!,The Trip
8,ks-60500,Good start bad end,5,17 October 2021,Bloody scene is topnotch and storyline is alright. Thing turns very messy when the story close to the end. Too long is another issue but overall speaking it's one of the few Norway horror comedy I ever watched thus quite impressive.,The Trip
9,OJT,Bloody fun on a trip to the mountain cabin,8,1 August 2021,"The Trip, or in Norwegian: I onde dager (""For worse"" in the ""For better and for worse.."") is a typical Tommy Wirkola movie, which means it's fun and bloody.Wirkola has taken the trip back from Hollywood to make a piece with Noomi Rapace and Aksel Hennie, and it's a fun ride.All actors impress in this wild and funny violent ride.Lisa and Lars are unhappy. She's an actor, he's a director, and the happy days of marriage are over. So when holidays come, they plan to kill each other while staying in their mountain cabin. But things don't at all go as planned.Not at all, for any of them, nor for the three escaped prisoners on the run which has turned up in their cabin.",The Trip
10,Xstal,Carnage in the Cabin...,7,4 November 2021,"A slapstick, melodramatic, over the top, theatrical, comedy thriller bloodbath - knifing, shooting, strangling, drowning and mowing its way through so much flesh it would make Takeshi Miike proud.",The Trip
11,gianmarcoronconi,Nice,10,29 October 2021,Really very nice movie with very beautiful twists and scenes structured in a very beautiful and original way. Then it's very nice how the whole film is practically a couple therapy to bring the two murdering spouses back together. Film in general light and funny even if it deals with a gory theme.,The Trip
12,surfisfun,"Watch in english with subs, much better then...",6,21 October 2021,"Started watching in English.I dont like it dub.So will watch in orginal audio wt subs.Will rate it later....thaNKS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Movie was ok.Its a black comedy .Scandinavian language add tones and flavor. In english te flavor is too flat.",The Trip
13,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Norwegian horror comedy,6,18 October 2021,This is a Norwegian horror comedy that's worth the watch. Comedies are not easy to translate so I cut this film some slack. The Boomer/army vet at the end of the film did make me laugh he was pretty funny.,The Trip
14,athies,"The first 30 minutes of setup drags a bit, but then you are on a wild ride...",8,18 October 2021,"He's trying so hard to set the stage.Mowing the lawn?!He's be smart to not degredate those you depend on. Especially for your life.Wow! That was a body reaction to being shot.Who the f are these guys?!Love his removing the stick from his hair :)DignityNice switch of expectation for Dave.Roy is not so dumb. Or at least has a memory.Lars better have a plan or he's elevated himself below these scum.Why does he keep sending the dumb guy off on his own?Reload! You know the noise will draw the others back.Why?!He's holding the blade the wrong way to her throat.Good reaction to modern car by the old bastard, but f him for not only his homophobia but his calling someone he needs help from fatso! I'm hope he shows up, helps, then drops dead.He had to stick his head I the car to see it was empty?I feel the bag of rocks is gonna make an appearance soon.Wow! This movie has the most solid punches to the face I've ever seen!Excellent English speaking.",The Trip
15,julianrosser-440-787839,Fabulously dark !!,8,22 October 2021,Think Kill Bill meets Arizona. Absolutely riveting with amazing cast and great everything. Extremely funny and one of Noomi's best films.A must see !! I'll definitely watch it again.,The Trip
16,gab-67599,A Good Movie,8,18 October 2021,At times it was hard to watch poor Rapace get thrown around and hit as many times as she did. Then again the whole movie was punching and pain. It was also an up and down movie. Something cool would happen and then it would get boring and then something cool and back to boring. I loved Lar's grandpa he was lol hilarious! I recommend if you like action and a lot of blood.,The Trip
17,tccandler,Starts well... Ends with insanity!,3,20 October 2021,"The first thirty minutes are filled with some really successful dark laughs. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie becomes ludicrous beyond belief. The gory violence doesn't shock because the silliness cuts the tone... And the comedy doesn't hold up because the violence is too grotesque. Just asking... But how did the fat old man with crutches, whose chest was shredded by a lawnmower, manage to climb into a hammock? Perhaps that is the least of this film's worries.",The Trip
18,rochfordsimon,"War of the Roses, meets Gone Girl, meets Straw Dogs.",7,24 October 2021,"Has a few laughs, gore & decent characters.His film starts off good and continues at an interesting & steady pace. It builds to a good climax, but a bad ending overall. Enjoyable, quirky & a great mixture of genres.But the last few minutes of weakness, let the rest
of the film down.",The Trip
19,mjanssens26,Extremely dark and gory comedy horror,8,27 October 2021,This movie is very graphic with a bit of comedy relief. A somewhat home invasion film with a blend of tongue in cheek humor to lighten up the extremely dark moments. Highly unpredictable and definitely worth the watch. It was pretty great.,The Trip
20,witra_as,Fun straight-up black comedy thriller,8,23 October 2021,Fun straight-up thriller had black comedy elements as well. Tommy Wirkola never failed to present such wild and gory action sequences with unpredictable characters inside a remote cabin. Rapace & Hennie slowly got your attention and sympathy for reconciliation.,The Trip
21,YabbaDabbaDabba,This Movie Had More Twists & Turns Than a Pretzel,7,27 October 2021,"Before watching ""The Trip"" I looked at IMBD and wondered how it could be a/an -as appropriate- 1) Adventure; 2) Comedy 3) Horror; and 4) Thriller. The answer is: Yes. You need to watch it all to believe it.With about 45 minutes left, we ran several different possible scenarios for the ending. And we did good ones. Not a single part of any of our scenarios happened. Now you have to admit that's good writing.In good conscience I have to tell you the film is dubbed in English, and the subtitles never matched the verbal dubbing. But that didn't bother us at all. Just watch and you forget it's dubbed.",The Trip
22,windsorenquirer,So funny,10,17 October 2021,"Great comedy, very funny. Not stupid and vulgar like Jackasss but one silly and bloody ride for nearly 2 hours. Not one bore moment. A nice Netflix surprise.Highly recommend it.",The Trip
23,arrmeen,"Loved it, good one from Netflix 👌🏻",9,6 November 2021,"I saw this with some expectations , but it went way beyond that and much better. What a superb movie, starts off well and just doesn't let the fun and thrill go right till the end. Plus it has my favourite potty humor too. The entire screenplay is tight, good acting , top notch gore and violence , with an exciting story.Watch it ASAP on Netflix. You won't regret.",The Trip
24,michelle_kummer,Great film,10,20 October 2021,"This movie was fantastic, Noomi never disappoints with her acting skills and natural beauty, the plot is funny and you never know what's going to happen next.The scenery is beautiful in Norway, and this film
had me laughing.",The Trip
25,freddy_at_home,This is just cheesy bloody fun!,9,16 October 2021,This is a classic Wikola production. It's suppose to be funny and cheesy. I loved every moment of it. Really fun!!Watch it if you don't got a limited view on movies. And just enjoy something other than Hollywood.,The Trip
26,leonidasstathopoulos,Trip to a kill,7,20 October 2021,"A couple not just apart, but with mutual plans to get each other out of the way. . . But there's always circumstance waiting to upset your plans.Not a masterpiece of Scandinavian cinema,but still worth to watch.",The Trip
27,furnacefuneral,...you shot my anus,10,28 October 2021,"This movie is hilarious. Weird, funny, dramatic, original, and at times REALLY messed up. Norway knows how to make great movies so add this one to the list. Enjoyable throughout.",The Trip
28,Dottsylove,Wanted it to be more of a revenge film,5,24 October 2021,It's not. It's more of a fight for survival type production. Husband and wife both are dead set on killing each other this getaway. However 3 escapees have other plans for them. Now what will the couple do to survive the situation and how will they exploit it once it's over with. 5.7 out of 10.,The Trip
29,mrrcave,Very entertaining in a dark way,7,18 October 2021,Thoroughly enjoyed this dark comic tale. Actors played their parts well and the tale was credible in a comic way. The only thing that detracted from the film was the irritating music played at various juncture.,The Trip
30,caroline_chupaa,Something we've all seen a hundred times before,4,19 October 2021,"Nothing new, nothing original. Can see 80% of everything happen before it happens. Too dumb. Sad. I was hoping this would be better. The acting isn't really that believable either.",The Trip
31,celtic451-228-782719,Best movie I've seen in a while,10,24 October 2021,"Thank goodness for this movie. It's been a little while since I've seen a movie this good. Noomi Rapace delivers a solid believable performance as usual which is why she is my new favorite actress. As in her other roles, she plays a hard hitting confident and strong woman with a subtle hint of tragedy in her background that you can just feel. The writing is witty and in your face and it just pulls you into the story. I loved all the surprises and connections with a great ending. Finally a movie that actually has satisfying and actual ending like endings are supposed to be.",The Trip
32,lucienm-60321,Great dark humour comedy !,8,16 October 2021,"Don't think it's really a horror movie.It's actually more like an excellent, very dark humour comedy !Very good casting !Love the Norwegian countryside chalet location.Good screenplay !",The Trip
33,dnw-37,Don't Breathe + Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6,30 October 2021,"A combo of ""Don't Breathe"" and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (or ""War of the Roses"" if you remember that one) all done on a shoestring budget with lots of gore thrown in for the fun. It's not going to win any awards and it's quite predictable, but it's a decent action comedy and an entertaining way for couples to spend an evening.",The Trip
34,samthejudgeamos,Pity that the two lead actors didn't do the dub,7,23 October 2021,"As they both speak great English, I suspect it costs to much. However, aside from that, its actually quite amusing. Not for the feint hearted though as there was more gore that i expected.Definitely worth a watch if you can cope with dub/subtitles.",The Trip
35,sgimera-34917,You know early this one will be good,8,26 October 2021,"Great acting, scenery, story and great mix of comedy, action some drama and a ""wee bit"" of pure gore. This movie has it all, subtitles won't take anything away from this gem!",The Trip
36,josantoddi,Great comedy/horror,9,19 October 2021,I will watch any fim starring Noomi Rapace. Period. She's fantastic. In this film her co-star is Aksel Hennie who is also a great Scandanavian actor. This movie is both dark and hilarious. I enjoyed it so much. Two thumbs up.,The Trip
37,Saoustou88,Excellent Ride,10,17 October 2021,"Prepare yourself for the very wort that can happen. The Trip is one hell of a comedy horror. So much drama and so much gore. Axel Hennie is a brilliant actor and writer and after watching Headhunter's thrice back when it came out, I knew this would be a worthwhile film. Starring him and a fantastic cast, also with the versatile and excellent actress Noomie Rapace, this film is fast paced, relentless, entertaining and down right insane. An original script and hilarious.",The Trip
38,WhatcanyaDo,Funny Love Story Disguised as an Action Thriller,8,24 October 2021,"I've been passing up this movie on Netflix for about a week, unsure if it would something I would enjoy. I am a fan of Scandinavian movies, however, so I took a closer look one lazy Sunday and noticed it starred one of my favorite actresses, Noomi Rapace; I knew then it couldn't be missed. Her co-star is Askel Hennie, a Norwegian actor and the star of Headhunters, another great movie that shouldn't be missed. If you like your movies well acted, violent, super bloody, and with a healthy amount of black humor, this movie does not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check it out.",The Trip
39,hgieselmann,"great laugh, great script, great ensemble",9,30 October 2021,"A real highlight of the year, too good for netflix, the whole crew is a great ensemble, fantastic script with catchy one liners, great skandinavian dark himor.",The Trip
40,eronzierjoly,Migrane inducing stupidity,1,29 October 2021,"I do understand how this was trying to be funny, but it was just extremely stupid and boring. Long periods of nothing happening. I can see it appeals to quite a few people who have rated it really high, but I can't work out who the target group would be here. Couldn't recommend it to anyone at all.",The Trip
41,jasonpauljones-64690,"Good start, then terribler and terribler",3,18 October 2021,"Why did they feel the need to make this such a looooooooong movie, when after the first twenty minutes, it gets more and more ridiculous and becomes painful to watch. Iam sure I am not the only one who felt this way, with a movie that did have some funny moments, mostly in the opening scenes, that just faded into complete insignificance by the closing credits.",The Trip
42,gerardmartin77,A first class thriller,7,21 October 2021,"I expected little from this Norwegian movie on Netflix until I realised who the two lead actors were. What a pairing of Rapace and Hennie. Just brilliant. Great acting , a first class script and thrilling direction. This black comedy/thriller deserves all of its 7 stars in my opinion.",The Trip
43,itumaesh,Worthy of 2nd Half,9,31 October 2021,"1. Fantastically plotted 2nd half
2. Survival of the Fittest
3. Lot of Twists and Turns in 2nd Half
4. 2nd Half is the reverse of 1st Half
5. Every single frame keeps you engaged here
6. Survival Thriller.",The Trip
44,musashinwari19,Wow Wow Wow,10,18 October 2021,"Winner
Super comedy, super action, emotional and thriller what else could I ask for this one of the best scandinavian movie I have ever watched Aksel and Noomi acting is fascinating
Thanks NETFLIX.",The Trip
45,kbaxws,Enjoyed this!,7,16 October 2021,"I wasn't so sure after the first scene seemed pretty cheesy..,and i nearly ditched the movie. But glad I didn't. A cool rollercoaster ride as a married couple with a grudge try to kill each other. The various characters that came along were an added boost in the second half. All around a fun gory movie.",The Trip
46,Finalreminder,Very funny,7,29 October 2021,"My first foreign film black comedy (excluding Norsemen). All the more funny because it looked like Bill Burr trying to murder his wife. Definitely worth a watch, you won't be disappointing.",The Trip
47,davelowen,What a trip!,8,27 October 2021,Think a Coen Brothers film crossed with an adult Home Alone and this is The Trip. It's a good fun ride with a great script and acting. The flash backs work well and enhance a lot of the humour.Thoroughly recommended.,The Trip
48,jcdamien,Now this was great fun!,9,15 October 2021,"Excellent original script, beautifully acted and directed and not a single dull moment. European movies are just so much better than Hollywood!Sometimes all we want is to be entertained.",The Trip
49,saysjenn,What a Pleasant Surprise!,8,6 November 2021,"This movie entertained from beginning to the end. It was dubbed in English yet it was still good, which says a lot. The music, the plot, and the characters are well chosen. I highly recommend it. If you are squeamish on a little blood you may want to avoid or cover your eyes here and there. It's not too over the top.",The Trip
50,wulf3003,A Little Horror Mixed With A Little Feces!!,10,30 October 2021,"Oh this movie was fun.Highly recommended!!If you want drama and blood, you'll love this one!!The twists and turns were so much fun.That's all I'm gonna say lol.",The Trip
51,hasanimasoud,The film tells the story of lives that recover on the eve of separation based on an event.,8,21 October 2021,"The film has an exciting and fascinating action story that nails the viewer at the beginning of the film. In addition to many action scenes and bloody conflicts, the film also has a very good comedy that makes the viewer laugh at the height of excitement and creates a good balance in the film. Overall, the film is both very action-packed and has a good comedy that satisfies the viewer in every way.",The Trip
52,The_Geek_Spot,Entertaining indeed!,9,17 October 2021,"Remarkably good in all honesty! I thought at first it was just going to be one of those foolish foreign movies that go just about nowhere. The beginning parts seemed slow at first and I was kinda tempted to switch to another movie, but just manage to go through the talk stuff and the novia is truly worth watching until the end.It had the right amount of action, gore and squeezed in bits of comedy as well. The story was funny and entertaining and will get you wired up with the action too. I wanted to give it a full perfect rating, but like I said it was kind of a drag in the beginning.",The Trip
53,johnkampouropoulos,Smashing and funny,9,21 October 2021,"I never thought I'd see Aksel Hennie act that well; the last time I saw him was playing the character ""Vogel"" in the film ""Martian"", a small and quite limited role. So that was a pleasant surprise for me.But then again I'm a top fan of Noomi Rapace, since Stieg Larson's ""MIllenium"". I thought the film would be good.It turned to be quite spectacular.Even though I'm not a fan of comedy-gore films, I enjoyed this one. Blended with sarcasm and intense scenes, a very clever script with lots of unexpected twists and a directional approach that unfolded in a tight and timely manner.In the beginning I was wondering wether Noomi and Aksel would fit together, but as the film went on they did brilliantly. Two different yet in the end very similar characters share a deep love that went sour- so much so, they tried to kill each other in the process, only to be ""saved"" by three bandits and an ex-commando father, bringing the catharsis to its conclusion.I will not comment on Noomi's acting, cause my opinion would be biased. All actors were brilliant in their own way, and I didn't feel even for a moment that there was something lacking.Overall, despite my unfamiliarity with comedy gore films, I think it's a movie very worth watching, if you like to laugh and live the heat within it. Slapstick, gag, dramedy, all bundled together in an exploding mix.",The Trip
54,kjetil1979,A funny movie,9,6 August 2021,"And a good time at the cinema, whats better? People laughing in the seats. Yeah. Splatter and more is more... and for me it jumped too 9 since I saw it at the cinema in Alta, the directors birthplace. The movie is a bit Tarantino or Coen... and for us that loves that kind of movies then two hours goes very fast. There are also good acting in this movie.",The Trip
55,joey912,Dysfunctional married couple + 3 escaped convicts = Slapstick horror,7,17 October 2021,"A dysfunctional married couple takes a trip to a remote cabin in the woods with plans to murder each other. But the situation goes awry when they encounter 3 bumbling escaped convicts who were hiding in the attic. Back and forth fighting. A lot of 3 Stooges-like smacks to the face. Everyone has a bloody face in this movie! Lol. It was actually a fun movie that flies by, but not a perfect movie. Favorite character was the lead convict. He was just so calm and matter of fact throughout the whole picture.",The Trip
56,israelkirven,A bloody violent trip. Not for faint of heart.,10,18 October 2021,I loved this ever changing plot. Never kept me bored for a second. People at their base survival. At times it was sweet and touching at others. Watched in original language. Loved how they sound. Cannot recommend this enough. Looking forward to more like it!!,The Trip
57,shsam,Solid!,10,18 October 2021,"Wow a movie! I was very surprised, I watched it without seeing the trailer and i'm happy I took the risk of watching it. I just clicked din it too bco of Noomi Rapace!This is kinda gruesome but, very entertaining and well made too! That's it, just pls watch it. It's going to be worth your time :)",The Trip
58,stevey-2,"Reminiscent of 'Bloody Hell' -- fast, funny, brutal",7,21 October 2021,"Didn't know what to expect going in. The writing is tight and the jokes start getting really funny after the first 20 min or so. There are some tonal issues--it can't really decide whether it is a black comedy or a violent, sadistic home invasion piece. But it eventually winds up choosing comedy, albeit super dark. There are many twists, some predictable and some surprising. Overall it was good fun. Reminded us of the Australian gem ""Bloody Hell"".",The Trip
59,randychenault,Really admire the director.,9,22 October 2021,"I love the ending, when they take a punch at stupid Hollywood protocol. It is worth watching just for that. Overall the movie was very entertaining. Decent foreign music a plus.",The Trip
60,elfulge,You Will Wake Up Sore,8,30 October 2021,"Very entertaining watch. But a bit of warning, you may wake up sore from watching all the beatdowns in this movie. When you think you no longer can take it the movie just keeps giving you more.",The Trip
61,aliblahblah,bloody British black comedy movies have done this thousands of times ...,2,25 October 2021,"Actually, I ONDE DAGER (2021) can be summed up in one word: cliché. Probably any work from Ken Russell (for older audience) or Simon Pegg (for younger audience) is better than this one. For those who gave this movie unimaginable high marks, it's good that they were enjoying it.By the way, the leading man Aksel Hennie looks a bit like the legendary Chinese actor Ge You. Again, probably any black comedy Mr Ge has done is better than this one.",The Trip
62,quietlioness,I Must Preserve My Dignity,7,1 November 2021,"This is a sick, twisted movie. It's also very funny. Poor Roy, ""You shot my anus.""
Anytime, that I see this actress in a movie, it's always good.Whatever Happened To Monday was a good movie that she plays the 7 lead roles.",The Trip
63,siddhanth154,Bang On !!,8,16 October 2021,"This Movie from Start to Finish is on point, Acting is brilliant and the characterization is perfect.The entertainment quotient is so high and there is not even a single dull moment in this 100mins Movie.The Dark Humour and the Background score go so well together and this is the first time I laughed when blood went splattering all over in the movie.",The Trip
64,amaya_bi,"Fun, fun, fun",8,17 October 2021,"Yeah, it has that Tarantino´s vibe. But the first Tarantino. There is blood, and violence, and fun everywhere. Not a Master Piece but sincerely very enjoyable.",The Trip
65,ringsangbordoloi,"Very good sense of humour with pack of action, horror",6,27 October 2021,"First twenty minute flicks is boring, but when three guys are on the scene than feel the real thrill. It's an unexpected action pack of European movie and i like it.",The Trip
66,Shock-UK,Starts off funny then gets a bit boring and slow. Ends being just silly,3,19 October 2021,The movie can't make up it's kind whether it's a comedy or cheap thriller. And trends up doing both rather badly.Starts off promising and funny then just goes downhill.Avoid.,The Trip
67,subieluver,My New Favorite Movie!,10,16 October 2021,"Will definitely be watching this one many times! One of the best movies I ever seen! You got comedy, blood, great acting etc. All in one incredible film. Great job to everyone that had a part in making this a reality, so we could all enjoy this masterpiece!",The Trip
68,pinkisred,Super fun,9,22 October 2021,"If you enjoy horror comedy with a decent side of blood and guts, you're going to have a nice evening with this film. Grab some popcorn and a glass of wine. High recommendations!",The Trip
69,Rightagain-45411,Good fun and good comic value added.,8,21 October 2021,"I enjoyed this revenge/horror/black comedy.I thought the acting was pretty good and the Nazi and top baddy were comically excellent.Better than most.Only sour point is the unnecessary inclusion of woko characters , made no sense in this geographical context. Is there a Netflix quota? Ability first please.",The Trip
70,emailbnatrajan,Awesome Movie,9,17 October 2021,Very different experience. Hats off to the entire crew for coming out with a great movie with unique story and wonderful performance by all the actors.,The Trip
71,SherwoodCS,Brilliant movie!,10,4 November 2021,I literally have no words for this movie.. it's a goddamn masterpiece and that's all i am gonna say about this awesome movie!! I recommend it to all of you because it's funny and also props to the director.,The Trip
72,wyellen,Worth a look,7,20 October 2021,"Plenty of Norwegian violence with the story of a couple so fed up with their marriage that they try to kill each other. But then, at just the right moment, three escaped killer convicts show up and they must work together to survive. After getting the crap beat out them repeatedly in their battles to remain alive and rape free they start to see renewed value in their relationship. It's basically extreme marriage therapy with plenty of gore and some comedy.",The Trip
73,tornikes,Fantastic!,9,18 October 2021,"Hilarious, funny, kind of Tarantino style.The finishing was simply gorgeous - they made fun of Hollywood. Thanks for that too. Gonnaa watch this filmmaker from now on.",The Trip
74,wiskeybreakfast,"Not a comedy, not horror and not mystery. But a failure",3,17 October 2021,"I honestly cant figure out what the creators tries to do here because the movie is not smart, scary or fun. But it is however embarrassing every time it fails to accomplish what it seemingly aims for. And that happens every other minute.And the characters are very unlikable and quite frankly incredible daft all the time. And not in a funny way - just awkward.",The Trip
75,PaleRider981,Haven't enjoyed a black comedy in a long time,9,6 November 2021,"I am not a guy who laughs much nor one who writes movie reviews more than once a year or so, so that tells much.I thought the movie could be good but it's actually great. I don't remember when was the last time I watched black comedy as good as this one. Thumbs up!",The Trip
76,emwire,Great movie. André Eriksen stole the show!,10,23 October 2021,"This movie is well written. Has some real hardcore violence, but also a lot of humor.There are a lot of seasonal veterans from the big screen in this one, but someone with a shorter list of merits, who completely steals the show here, is André Eriksen, portraying the character Roy. Hilarious, witty in a dumb way and menacing. Plays the part so well.Usually these sort of movies fall flat halfway through after a promising start with an exciting plot line. This one did the complete opposite.",The Trip
77,NachiBhatt,Tarantino Would Be Proud!,9,20 October 2021,"Going into this movie, I wish I hadn't read the storyline. If you go in blind, it would give you a more refreshing and amazing look. To all the other ones who are complaining about it being a little long, you don't complain when Tarantino does it.I happened to chance upon this flick while wandering on Netflix, and I am so happy I gave this a shot. This also reminds me of Tucker and Dale vs Evil. The actors played their part perfectly. All in all, it was a wild ride filled with bloodshed, fun and action.",The Trip
78,manuel-flury,Very good and funny,8,2 November 2021,"I had no expectations when I watched this film, I usually enjoy films with Noomi Rapace, so why not watch it?It turned out to be very funny with a type of humor quite similar to ""Shaun of the Dead"" on a totally different subject though.Definitely worth seeing if the sometimes bloody scenes don't make you feel bad.",The Trip
79,jaweebelow,Positively surprised!,7,18 October 2021,"An awesome, well made comedy-thriller with real laugh out loud moments AND some brutal scenes.Great story for this genre, I thought it was well executed with a good cast. Definitely worth a watch, easy 7/10.",The Trip
80,gemsing,What a film!,10,21 October 2021,"Watched this expecting a cheesy late night ation horror. Stared it dubbed but quickly changed over to subtitles. Definitely watch it with subtitles. Fun, gritty, edge of your seat experience. 2 hours I never want back!",The Trip
81,viirek,Really funny,8,20 October 2021,"This blood-soaked Norwegian film noir takes Pulp Fictionianism to a whole another level. Absolutely hilarious. Dark humour at its best. So many twists and turns in the plot that it makes your head spin, but its wittiness makes the experience thoroughly enjoyable. If you cannot tolerate the sight of blood, this film is not for you.",The Trip
82,lsbaugham,Loved it. Not for children,9,18 October 2021,I absolutely loved this. It was so entertaining and you never knew what to expect next. It was bloody and gory but still great. A married couple who each have their own agenda on a time off trip winds up being turned into their worst nightmare. Gotta watch to the end. You won't regret it.,The Trip
83,mkvale,I don't even know why I watched until the end,1,20 October 2021,"We did laugh a lot, but mostly because it was so stupid and that we didn't yet turn it off. One of the worst Norwegian films I've seen. This is one of the concepts where the maker ""tries too hard"" and has no idea what their doing.",The Trip
84,simonwoodhart,Unpleasant & Boring Trash,1,22 October 2021,"He wants to kill her for cheating on him, she wants to kill him because he directs soap operas? This is a supposed comedy film filled with dismembered limbs, poop in a dudes face, rape and shotgun wounds aplenty, but no entertainment to be found anywhere. This film is so incredibly stupid, tasteless and worst of all boring. At least they could have populated the soundtrack with black metal instead of this Dum Dum Boys rubbish, oh well. Zero stars!",The Trip
85,ryancannon-31859,"Been done before, but this is done well",8,23 October 2021,"It's on Netflix, so 9 times out of 10 you can expect garbage. This is a familiar concept, but it's done really well. The characters are all likeable and also hateble. The scenarios are stupid. But there's some great humour amongst the cartoon violence. This is nearly 2hrs long but the Scandinavians have done it again. So much better than most of the utter garbage on Netflix, amazon etc.",The Trip
86,arnekristofferwangholthe,Best of Wirkola,8,19 October 2021,How far can you push the script before it turns on you? I think W is hitting the mark on this one. Nice flow from bordering-boredom to slammer-splat. Nice acting. Best production value by W so far. Dark splatter humour at it's best.,The Trip
87,alecic92,Wirkola tops Dead Snow 2,9,18 October 2021,"The Trip captures the essence of pure fun, if you are an American who is sensitive or you have a dissatisfaction with foreign masterclasses please leave.",The Trip
88,tommy-190,Very entertaining splatter movie,10,31 July 2021,"The production quality was very high for this Wirkola movie compared to previous Norwegian movies, but that was merely the icing on the cake. The actors' performances, especially Atle Antonsen, were top notch, and made every character believable.Well-paced and well-made through and through. Would not recommend it to people who can't let go and just enjoy a movie for what it is, but for everyone else, it's definitely worth checking out.",The Trip
89,aj-84622,Directed by Tommy Wirkola = Guaranteed Fun,8,28 October 2021,"I can honestly say with no hesitation that Tommy Wirkola has not made a single movie that has not kept me fully entertained and thrilled from beginning to end. What's better is that his work just seems to get better and better with each project. You can only imagine how excited I was to see he was releasing a movie on Netflix (and with Noomi Rapace, who is an outstanding actress).Dang, is this one of those movies that I wish I went in completely blind before watching. If you haven't seen the trailer but loved the Dead Snow movies and even Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (which is also insanely fun), you can come to expect the same levels of outrageousness, pitch black humor and copious amounts of gore to go along with the well choreographed fight scenes that get progressively more violent and brutal as the film goes along. And lemme tell you, this does get brutal, both physically and emotionally for the two main characters. While one prolonged scene was extremely uncomfortable to watch, the film still manages to maintain its bleak comedic tone throughout, and you never get bored for a second.There's just no way to predict what happens next, and it's so much fun seeing how the story plays out. The performances by the actors are great all around; the two leads feel real as an unhappily married couple, and their arguments are so scathing and harsh that you feel like a child watching your parents fight. Makes the more tender moments between them so much more impactful.Wirkola is the man. At this point, I think he's managed to get such a firm grasp on his craft and style that there's no way he can make a bad movie. While his films have their flaws, including this one (ending could have been a tad better), they're so easy to overlook because his movies are just such a blast to experience. I hope many more people watch this, it's great.",The Trip
90,laszlomezofalvi,Different,5,18 October 2021,"Completly different, not gooc but different...
Bit slow, action part is fun,, actors doing a fair job.I'm not sure its meant to be trash style or not, but violance is funny in the movie.",The Trip
91,corbeeltim,Entertaining! Funny! Bloody!,8,20 October 2021,"Entertaining! Funny! Bloody!Started watching with little to no expectations and was pleasantly surprised.The trip (I onde dager) is a funny, at times hilarious, horror comedy.Would recommend!",The Trip
92,street-10135,I think this maybe my first review?,5,22 October 2021,"It was ok , low budget euro film, erm... at a time when there is bugga all to watch on Netflix and the like, this fills a little gap. Took me two nights to watch it as do most films that are just average. The grandad plays most genuine character with probably the most solid role and background and he's in it for all of 10/15 minutes of the film lol. Some funny moments overall it's a 5 I don't think I've ever watched a 1 or 2 rated film as I just can't watch a film if there is no interest or draw. I genuinely hope my review helps as I use the reviews to make my choice to watch most films. A few similar to watch , The mule (Australian film), wormwood zombie film and probably slither.",The Trip
93,ltcolmsingaravel,Great performances,8,18 October 2021,"So much blood and gore, so many plots within plots and just about half a dozen characters, but the Director keeps you glued to the chair. It is actually a simple story of a married couple reigniting their love. But after they go through, and take you through too, a lot of cynicism and violence. All that done in a comical way. So, it is an oddly satisfying love-action-comedy.",The Trip
94,bajjohn,delightfully over the top in every department.,7,29 October 2021,"So over the top that it has become a 'black comedy'... Noomi usually offers understated performances, yet here, she's operating on full throttle. A tight, almost claustrophobic setting, has me on the edge of seat throughout..",The Trip
95,frank-anders-borch-aamot,"When you try real hard, but you don't succeed..",4,23 October 2021,"It's not often that I quote Coldplay, but this time it was fitting.This movie was a letdown. Really.It was full of forshadowing, clichés and non existing chemistry between the characters.It is edited too long, and id Tommy Wirkola had made it shorter it COULD have been a better movie.Kan skrive det på norsk i stedet:
Filmen har scener som er altfor lange. Det som kunne ha vore spennande, blir kjedeleg. Det som kunne ha vore morosamt, vert forutsigbart.Kjemien mellom ""ekteparet"" er nesten like lite troverdig som kjemien mellom dei rømte fangene.Død Snø/Død Snø 2 klarte med sjarm og stil å være morsomme og underholdene.Denne var langdryg og forutsigbar. Samt lite troverdig.",The Trip
96,ailujyof,Absolutely Brilliant!,10,4 November 2021,"Like no film we've ever seen before. Weird, gory and laugh out loud funny. We went from wtf moments to shrieking laughter. Mad, but highly entertaining. Recommended.",The Trip
97,ottoandre,Reviews has to be fake,2,31 October 2021,"Movie was so booring, all of the reviews must be fake. I could still not understand what was so good with the movie, maybe it was the swedish girl, or Atle Antonson, I dont know.",The Trip
98,ewakopanska,Excellent dark comedy,9,17 October 2021,In just two words it's Norwegian Tarantino. It will surely make you laugh. Dark comedy with lots and lots of blood and some unexpected twists. I recommend heavily!,The Trip
99,tonyebikemejr,A Budget Thriller,9,17 October 2021,"This Norwegian thriller stars two of my favourite, Noomi and Askel, (think it's the first time these two have worked together). It's dark, it's funny (in a childish juvenile way that isn't too bad) it has gore, ridiculous gore that will leave you cracking up. Go into this expecting such, which will hopefully won't leave you disappointed. Don't skip, watch it.",The Trip
100,tkliger-00560,Not funny. Not good.,1,17 October 2021,"This movie is listed as a comedy and I didn't laugh once. It's listed as a horror and it wasn't scary. Violence and injury are inflicted with varying levels of realism and zero realistic effects. People have deep cuts, are shot, are hit by cars, and just get up and walk over and attack someone without showing any signs of being injured. It kills any sort of suspense, tension or sense of fear for the heroes when characters just shrug off wounds for the sake of getting back up to attack the protagonists again.""You're Next"" did everything this film was TRYING to do but 10x better. Watch that instead.",The Trip

None of the characters are particularly good yet I still found all of them enjoyable. The action was fun in a way that had me shouting ohhh yeah a lot throughout. Heads up, there's a scene in the movie that might make you a little uncomfortable, but it just threatens being really effed up and doesn't get too deliverance on ya.",The Trip
