0,boblipton,Just Sit Back And Enjoy Yourself,8,23 October 2021,"Wes Anderson's latest movie, under thinly disguised names, supposes that Harold Ross, instead of going to New York to found THE NEW YORKER, had moved to France. There, with the same writers and cartoonists, he turned out essentially the same magazine, but with, understandably, more of an emphasis on France than on Broadway. We are then graced with Bill Murray as the editor dealing with his writers, as Tilda Swinton narrates her tale of insane prisoner Benicio Del Toro inventing a new movement in art; Frances MacDormand covering a student uprising while bedding leader Timothée Chalamet, while editing and writing an appendix to his revolutionary manifesto; and Jeffrey Wright covering the novelties of ""cuisine policier"" with the commissioner, which turns into a hot pursuit as the commissioner's child is kidnapped, and his chef must take the lead in the recovery.I am a great fan of Anderson's cartoonish, highly detailed cinematic worlds, in no small part because he is constantly winking at the audience, letting them know they are in on the joke, as he manipulates aspect ratios, colors, timelines, and moves walls aside in plain sight, His actors seem to enjoy themselves. This is Bill Murray's ninth appearance in an Anderson movie, Owen Wilson's eighth. Other well-regarded performers include Lea Sedoux, Mathieu Amalric, Bob Balaban, Henry Winkler, Christopher Waltz, Willem Dafoe, and a dozen others. Nor do they come for the big parts; they seem to be happy to show up. When the show ended, two men in the audience began to discuss how the aspect ratios and moving walls had some significance to the underlying meaning. Perhaps I lack the depth to understand such things, but I think Anderson tells his little tales and wants us to have a good time. Does that make it great art? Perhaps not. Sometimes it's enough for us to smile.",The French Dispatch
1,jboothmillard,The French Dispatch,7,1 November 2021,"I saw the trailer for this film, and I recognised the distinctive style of its director immediately, always symmetrical imagery, many bright colours, often surreal or eccentric, and an all-star ensemble cast, so I was up for it in the cinema, written, produced, and directed by Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs). Basically, set in the 20th century, Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray), the editor of The French Dispatch, an American newspaper in France, has died suddenly of a heart attack. The final wishes in his will state that publication of the newspaper is to be suspended immediately following his death, with one final farewell issue. The newspaper will feature three articles from past editions of the paper, along with an obituary. This collection of stories is brought to life. It starts with The Cycling Reporter: travel writer Herbsaint Sazerac (Owen Wilson) gives a cycling tour of the town of Ennui (French for ""boredom""), showing several key areas such as the arcade, Le Sans Blague café and a pick-pocket's alleyway, and observing how much and how little has changed over time. The first story is The Concrete Masterpiece by J. K. L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton): Mentally disturbed artist Moses Rosenthaler (Benicio Del Toro) is serving a prison sentence for murder and paints an abstract nude portrait of prison officer Simone (Léa Seydoux), who he develops a relationship with. Art dealer Julien Cadazio (Adrien Brody), also serving time for tax evasion, sees the paining in a prisoner art exhibition and is immediately taken by it, and buys it despite Rosenthaler's protests. Upon his release he convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display, and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world, with his paintings in high demand. Three years later, Cadazio and other artists are angry at Rosenthaler's lack of further artwork, they bribe their way into prison to confront Rosenthaler, and discover that he has painted a series of frescoes on the prison walls. Angered that the paintings are irremovable, Cadazio gets into a fight with Rosenthaler, but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are, and later arranges for the entire room to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum. For his actions in stopping a prison riot that breaks out during the paintings being revealed, Rosenthaler is released on probation. The second story is Revisions to a Manifesto by Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand): The report focuses on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the ""Chessboard Revolution"". Despite Krementz's insistence on maintaining ""journalistic integrity"", she has a brief romance with self-styled revolt leader Zeffirelli (Timothée Chalamet), and secretly helps him write his manifesto and adds an appendix. Fellow revolutionary Juliette (Lyna Khoudri) is unimpressed with his manifesto. After they briefly express their disagreement about its contents, Krementz tells the two to ""go make love,"" which they do. A few weeks later, Zeffirelli is killed trying to repair a small radio tower serving as a revolutionary pirate radio station, and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes a symbol of the movement. The third and final story is The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner by Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright): During a television interview, Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force, prepared by legendary police officer-slash-chef Lieutenant Nescaffier (Steve Park). The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire's son Gigi (Winsen Ait Hellal) is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals. After a series of interrogations, the police discover the kidnapper's hideout and stake it out. Following a shootout, Gigi manages to secretly send out a message in Morse code to ""send the cook"". Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers' hideout to provide the criminals with good, but secretly laces the food with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison, along with Lt. Nescaffier after being made to test it first. But one criminal escapes with Gigi and this leads to a police chase. Gigi manages to escape out of the sunroof and jumps into the police car. At the French Dispatch office, Howitzer tells Wright to re-insert a segment he previously removed about a recovering Lt. Nescaffier saying something to Wright about the taste of the poison. In an epilogue, the French Dispatch staff, including Sazerac, copy editor Alumna (Elisabeth Moss), cartoonist Hermes Jones (Jason Schwartzman), the Story Editor (Fisher Stevens), the Proofreader (Anjelica Bette Fellini) and the Legal Advisor (Griffin Dunne), mourn Howitzer's death. After paying their respects, they immediately set to work putting together a final issue to honour his memory. With the voice of Anjelica Huston as The Narrator, also starring, in alphabetical order, Quantum of Solace's Mathieu Amalric as The Commissaire, Bob Balaban as Uncle Nick, Jarvis Cocker as the voice of Tip-Top, Willem Dafoe as Albert 'the Abacus', Bruno Delbonnel as Tip-Top, Rupert Friend as Drill-Sergeant, Alex Lawther as Morisot, Edward Norton as The Chauffeur, Larry Pine as Chief Magistrate, Morgane Polanski (Roman's daughter) as Girlfriend, Tony Revolori as young Moses Rosenthaler, Saoirse Ronan as Junkie / Showgirl, Liev Schreiber as Talk Show Host, Christoph Waltz as Paul Duval, and Henry Winkler as Uncle Joe. The all-star ensemble cast all bring something different to the table, the switching from black-and-white to colour in many scenes is interesting, the scenes of animation and characters freezing in poses are eye-catching, and the perfectly symmetrical imagery and eccentric feel throughout is exactly what I've come to expect, I can see why it is described as ""a love letter to journalists"", a worthwhile comedy-drama. Very good!",The French Dispatch
2,CinemaSerf,Don't try to make much sense of this and it's quite enjoyable...,7,7 November 2021,"I suppose like any newspaper or magazine upon which this compendium effort is based, there are some ""articles"" more interesting than others - and that's what this offers. Three elongated features form the centrepieces of this somewhat surreal comedy. As you might expect from Wes Anderson, these stories are eclectic, and delivered well by a cast that were well up for their tasks. My favourite of the three features Frances McDormand and Timothée Chalamet offering us some sort of Hemmingway-esque parody of revolution fought over a chess board - with quite humorous results. Humour is a strong feature of this film. I would say comedy, not so much. One has to pay attention to what is going on to get the best from the acting, the script and, as importantly, the imagery which effortlessly mixes monochrome and colour, and which is also bright, vivacious, and frequently just as informative as the dialogue. It does run out of steam at times, the themes could have been a little more compact, and the two side-stories - especially the travel report with Owen Wilson at the top of the film didn't work so well for me. I'm not an huge fan of eccentricity - it is all-too-often just hit or miss, but here we have more hits than not, and with a healthy swipe at journalistic values along the way, a bit of romance and some daft antics from a rogue Benicio del Toro, this is certainly worth watching.",The French Dispatch
3,george.schmidt,Masterful filmmaker Wes Anderson's most ambitious production extends his reach in twee-ness in spite of a powerhouse cast,8,29 October 2021,"THE FRENCH DISPATCH (2021) *** BENECIO Del TORO, ADRIEN BRODY, TILDA SWINTON, LEA SEYDOUX, FRANCES McDORMAND, TIMOTHEE CHALAMET, LYNA KHOUDRI, JEFFREY WRIGHT, MATHIEU AMALRIC, STEVE PARK, BILL MURRAY, OWEN WILSON, BOB BALABAN, HENRY WINKLER, LOIS SMITH, CHRISTOPH WALTZ, LIEV SCHREIBER, WILLEM DAFOE, EDWARD NORTON, SAOIRSE RONAN, ELIZABETH MOSS, JASON SCHWARTZMAN, FISHER STEVENS, GRIFFIN DUNNE, (narrator - ANJELICA HUSTON) Masterful filmmaker Wes Anderson's most ambitious production extends his reach in twee-ness in spite of a powerhouse cast of eccentricities in his latest venture about a fictitious American magazine stationed in France with somewhat colorful writers, a dyspeptic publisher, and varying degrees of criminal activity afoot. The rambling screenplay by the director with long-time associates Roman Coppola, Schwartzman & Hugo Guinness often gets in the way of its sprawling cast with some getting short shrift (hello Mr. Waltz & Ms. Moss) with three separate vignettes set up as the The New Yorker-esque story lines unfurl.",The French Dispatch
4,ferguson-6,the most Wes Anderson-y to date,8,28 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Few things in the cinematic world are more instantly recognizable than a Wes Anderson movie. In fact, historically speaking, perhaps only Jacques Tati comes as close to having a signature style easily spotted by viewers. This is Mr. Anderson's 10th feature film in 25 years, and I now rate 5 of these very highly, though all 10 have a certain appeal. This latest, co-written by Anderson with frequent collaborators Roman Coppola, Hugo Guinness, and Jason Schwartzman, could be considered his most ambitious to date ... and likely the most 'Wes Anderson' of all.Billed as a love letter to journalists, it becomes crystal clear, that by this, Anderson means the esteemed stable of writers from the early days of ""The New Yorker"". In fact, Anderson structures the film as if it were following the path of a magazine being published. We are informed upfront that this edition features ""an obituary, a travel guide, and 3 feature articles"". An episodic format is not unusual for films, yet Anderson never does anything by the book. Each piece takes place in its own time period, and there appears to be little connection or crossover among key characters. Still, somehow he makes this work by ensuring each piece stands on its own and is filled with unusual characters and those patented, fabulous Anderson visuals.The obituary is that of Arthur Howitzer Jr (a deadpan Bill Murray), the founder and publisher of ""The French Dispatch"" magazine, a spin-off from The Liberty Kansas Evening Sun ... a move from a small town in Midwestern United States to a charming small town in France (hilariously and fittingly) named Ennui-sur-Blasé. Howitzer adores his writers, and the only guidance he offers them is, ""Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose"". He also has a ""No Crying"" sign posted in his office, likely as much as a reminder to himself as a rule for the staff.Our travel guide section is fortunately quite brief since it involves Owen Wilson as a bicycle tour guide showing us around the town - the ""Local Color""- of Ennui-sur-Blasé. This takes us to the first feature story, and the best of the lot. Tilda Swinton excels (doesn't she always?) as a writer and art expert giving a colorful lecture entitled ""The Concrete Masterpiece"". She tells the story of Moses Rosenthaler (Benecio del Toro), a genius modern artist serving a life sentence for murder, and as she lectures, we see it play out. While incarcerated, Moses continues to work and his muse is a prison guard named Simone, played exceptionally well by Lea Seydoux. Her nude posing for him leads to his signature modern art piece, which attracts the attention of an ambitious art dealer played by Adrien Brody.""Revisions to a Manifesto"" is the next feature, and it involves a young activist named Zeffirelli (Timothee Chalamet). He's a chess expert, quite moody and has a questionable quest. He's being covered by writer Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand), who is unable to maintain objectivity, and inserts herself right into the story, amongst other things. The segment pays tribute to the activism of the 1960's and is filmed mostly in black and white.The third feature, ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner"" involves writer Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) telling his story while a guest on Liev Schreiber's Talk Show in the 1970's. Roebuck is obviously inspired by James Baldwin, and he famously recalls every line he's ever written. The story he recites involves a legendary chef played by Steve Park.Actors mentioned so far are just the headliners, and Anderson has packed the film with his usual troupe, as well as dozens of others - some you'll recognize, and some you won't. There are at least seven Oscar winners involved: Christoph Waltz, Fisher Stevens, and Angelica Huston (as narrator), in addition to the aforementioned Swinton, McDormand, del Toro, and Brody. Numerous Oscar nominations and awards are included in the group of other familiar faces like Willem Dafoe, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Lois Smith, Henry Winkler Bob Balaban, Elisabeth Moss, and Mathieu Amalric.Other frequent Anderson collaborators who deliver standout work include Production Designer Adam Stockhausen, Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, Editor Andrew Weisblum, and composer Alexandre Desplat. The film looks and sounds remarkable, and somehow it doesn't feel like it's moving fast - although we can barely keep pace. The film can be compared to ordering a flight at your local distillery. Each flavor is tasty, but they may not add up to a full drink.Wes Anderson has delivered another stylish, fun film to watch, and one that is endlessly entertaining. It may not have as many moments of laughter as some of his previous films, yet there are still plenty of sight gags, insider references, and light-heartedness bathed in nostalgia - even if it's not quite as whimsical. Shot in the French town of Angouleme, the visuals are as impressive as any you'll find, serving up a collage of time, caricatures, color, and topics.Opening nationwide in theaters on October 29, 2021.",The French Dispatch
5,blanbrn,A Wes Anderson movie of stories and characters.,4,4 November 2021,"I watch Wes Anderson movies even though I don't understand or like his movies the best, still as always he fills his films with all star and all pro stars. This ""The French Dispatch"" has Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Adrian Brody, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Saoirse Ronan, Benicio Del Toro, Elisabeth Moss, Henry Winkler, Jeffrey Wright, and Christoph Waltz now what a collection. The film is filled with drama, action, and fun, as it involves a prisoner, a hooker, a magazine editor and made up stories it's like a roll coaster ride that involves a car chase and kidnapping. I guess it's a watch if you like movies I got thru it even though it was not my cup of tea.",The French Dispatch
6,UniqueParticle,This movie is art!,10,29 October 2021,"Such a mind blowing fun nourishing entertaining piece of cinema, this truly is Wes Anderson at his best! About at least 4 different stories a prison artist, a writer/chess extraordinaire, a kidnapping, and The French Dispatch columnist. The production design must've been fun to work on there's so much details and pastilles. Definitely deserves praise, from my experience the film is a masterful delight and I was happy I saw with my 60 year old mom. The cast was perfect, pacing was just right, writing is brilliant and the exciting vibes all around were superb.",The French Dispatch
7,stevendbeard,All Star Cast/Off The Wall Stories,4,4 November 2021,"I saw ""The French Dispatch"", starring Bill Murray-Zombieland, Get Smart_2008; Benicio Del Toro-the Sicario movies, Sin City; Frances McDormand-Nomadland, Aeon Flux and Jeffrey Wright-the James Bond movies, Shaft_2000.This is a Wes Anderson movie so if you are not a fan, you may want to steer clear of this one. It has an all star cast in a collection of off the wall stories. Bill plays the editor of an American newspaper that is located in France-their headquarters are in Kansas-and the stories are told to him by his journalists/reporters and published in his newspaper, The French Dispatch. One has Benicio as a psycho/murderer in prison that loves to paint, with people desperately wanting to buy his paintings. Another has Frances covering student uprisings and yet another one has Jeffrey relating a kidnapping of a policeman's son. They all contain cameos by actors you will recognize-Timothee Chalamet, Willem DaFoe, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, HenryWinkler, Edward Norton and Elisabeth Moss, just to name a few-but the stories are just so weird, it's as if Wes was just trying to be weird for weird's sake. Examples; The painter is in a straight jacket when he is not painting naked women but the paintings don't look anything like them. The kidnappers have a chef bring them food, during a shootout with the police. Some scenes are animated during a chase scene and returns to normal-if you can call it that-after the chase is over.It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you are a fan of Wes Anderson, you might enjoy it more than I did but otherwise, I'd wait until it comes to cable.",The French Dispatch
8,arthur_tafero,Delicious Comedy and Satire - The French Dispatch,8,30 October 2021,"I like Adrian Brody and all the work he has done in the past. But this is his best piece of work since The Pianist. I think he has a great flair for comedy as well as being a fine dramatic actor; and he looks so much like Thomas Tafero. Del Toro is also excellent in one of his rare comedic turns, Swinton is always good, but Brody steals the film. Anderson has created a wonderful world that is both fantasy and realistic at the same time. I loved the pseudo-intellectual pandering and the patrons of the arts who will buy anything as long as you give them a good pitch. It is a film to be seen more than once, because it is highly unlikely you will catch all the satire the first time around.",The French Dispatch
9,aciessi,All The Film That's Fit to Print,6,6 November 2021,"Alert the press! We have another Wes Anderson movie. The French Dispatch is Wes Anderson's long awaited live-action follow-up to The Grand Budapest Hotel, which garnered the best acclaim of his career as his most visually exquisite film to date. Dare I say, The French Dispatch nearly tops The Grand Budapest from aesthetics alone. Visually, this film is a mind-blowing work of art. It's absolutely beautiful, from frame to frame. To take your eyes off of it, for a mere second, is to punish yourself. Every fabric and every set piece is meticulously crafted to an absurd degree. It's enough to say that The French Dispatch won me over in the end. Even though, on substance, I felt it to be hollow and cold. This is arguably Anderson's most insular film. About as Ill-disciplined as The Royal Tennenbaums, but not as excruciatingly ponderous as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Luckily, Anderson treats us to a series of original vignettes, which spaces things out just enough to keep you from feeling restless. My favorite segment was The Concrete Masterpiece. Adrian Brody had me doubled over, I must admit. The Cycling Reporter was the most useless vignette and arguably should have been cut or re-written. This is a mixed bag and I wish it wasn't. I say, catch this when it arrives on streaming platforms.",The French Dispatch
10,Movi3DO,Weird but beautiful,7,31 October 2021,"Wes Anderson is back with another bizarre movie, and this time it's about three independent stories written for the last issue of a magazine, the French Dispatch.I don't watch a lot of Wes Anderson, but I love the Grand Budapest Hotel. His movies all have distinct editing style, frame, and especially color. To love Wes Anderson's filmography, you need to embrace the dream-like, surreal, yet beautiful looks of his movies.The French Dispatch took this to a more extreme level. The three stories were so damn weird that it was usually hard to follow. Characters retelling stories in messy order like they have ADHD, which kinda made sense because we usually say a lot of things when we are excited.Even though the stories were confusing, the look and editing were full on amazing. There were so many different editing styles that it's like a soup of color and unique camera shots. Some scenes made you look left, right, or corners at the same time (unless you know French).Overall, a magical looking movie that I'm sure Wes Anderson fans will love. 6.5/10.",The French Dispatch
11,Alexander_Blanchett,Enjoyable but not the strongest Anderson,7,5 November 2021,"I am a huge Wes Anderson fan but I was kind of let down by his newest feature. I thought it was too over the place without much of a structure and no real plot at all. This kind of bothered me, I know this was the intention but for me it just didn't make the click it was supposed to make.But and that is a huge BUT, although there is no visible plot and the stories itself were not too interesting for me, this film involves some of the best dialogue work Wes Anderson has ever written, and this truly makes up for it.Also the cast is stellar. Even the smallest roles are filled with star power like Edward Norton or Willem Dafoe. What an outstanding ensemble. Its hard to single out any but if I have to I would say Benicio Del Toro, Tilda Swinton, Timothee Chalamet, Jeffrey Wright and Frances McDormand were the best of the of the bunch, with characters that seemed to be written for them. But also Adrien Brody and Bill Murray have really good moments. I loved the look and feel of the film, which was typical Anderson. Not a biggest fan of the black/white and color twists because he overdid that one. Still its a charming film. Not the kind of thing I was hoping it to be, but another nice entry after all in Wes Andersons fantastic filmography, even if this is among his weaker ones.",The French Dispatch
12,owen-watts,Warm Off the Press,7,6 November 2021,"Anderson's latest is one of his most intricate confections yet - a love letter to the New Yorker magazine and a concept anthology more than it is a coherent filmic narrative. I dig it though and the rare (for him) excursion into 2D ""ligne claire"" animation is absolutely gorgeous. The Murray emotional core is too crowded out to emotionally land as it should and the sheer wealth of cameos is almost hilariously superfluous with some of the greatest actors of our age getting one line or none at all. Not his strongest work but as always, he's somehow managed to push the form even further to create meticulous piece of art with no visual equal in the mainstream.",The French Dispatch
13,statuskuo,Wes Anderson Continues His Diorama Sandbox,8,26 October 2021,"If you know the style of Wes Anderson, this will be more of that.A moving diorama of actors acting odd for the sake of oddness. This is actually four stories in one about American ex-pats who write for a French paper.Everything is stylized in this film and works effectively. Watching the Benicio Del Toro story unfold is the most fun. The rest seem to be muddled in more pretention.One gets the feeling Wes just sits around like an overgrown child and makes vroom vroom noises as he drags a toy car on the carpet. This is quitessential Wes.Very well crafted.",The French Dispatch
14,sweidman-28016,100-Minutes of Happiness,8,5 November 2021,"""It began as a holiday. Eager to escape a great future on the Great Plains, Arthur Howitzer Jr., transformed a series of travelogue columns into the French Dispatch. A factual report on the subjects of world politics, the arts, high and low, and diverse stories of human interest.""The French Dispatch is a love letter to journalists set in an outpost of an American newspaper in a fictional twentieth century French city that brings to life a collection of stories published in ""The French Dispatch Magazine"". Wes Anderson. I mean, where do you begin? Most everyone knows his distinct style that's whimsical and charming. Over the years, he's amped it up and we all love it. This has to be his most stylistic film to date. The whole film is about style, really. Looking at the screen it's hard to believe someone created that perfect look. First of all, the cinematography has literally everything you could want: different aspects ratios, black and white, color, unique framing, the list goes on. Paired up with it is the production design. Maybe not as great as The Grand Budapest Hotel, but it's incredible to look at. We have a wide variety of colors painting the set. One of the stories is actually about a painter, and though it's mostly in black and white, it's bursting with color. A cool thing with the sets as well, and we have seen this before, is how some are done on a stage and they have the resources to continue the scene in one shot but also change the setting by the use of a backdrop. There's a really cool example in one of the stories starring Timothée Chalamet. You could analyze the set design and look for hours and still not cover every little detail.With Anderson's past films, he's set standards to what his best is. Those answer may vary from person to person. For me, at least, it's The Grand Budapest Hotel and Fantastic Mr. Fox. In The French Dispatch, he does something different that may turn people off. The film is several short stories paying respect to writing and France itself. There is no overarching story. Because of that, there's hardly any character development. That's sort of the point because we know these stories for a short period of time, and never hear anything again. If you are looking for an overarching story, I guess you could say it's with Arthur Howitzer Jr. And selecting stories for the new addition of the magazine. However, that's about five minutes at the beginning and five minutes at the end. I like how there's not too much development, but I also wanted a little more from the characters. It felt like we were watching people with little to no significance, and I wanted to know just the slightest bit more. Because it's so charming and mesmerizing, it's easy to forget about it. Some stories are more interesting than others. That's up to opinion, but my favorite is with Timothée Chalamet and Frances McDormand. As usual, we have a grand ensemble with many stars. Everyone does great, some even going out of their usual typecast. Nothing groundbreaking, but still good. Lastly, I should add that Alexandre Desplat gives us another fun score. He and Anderson have an understanding in what they want, and it always works. With that, we have a fantastic soundtrack full of songs from France. There's one amazing use of music (yes it's in my favorite segment) that makes the viewing and listening experience so pleasing. If you're an avid Wes Anderson fan, The French Dispatch will deliver. Even if you're not, you'll probably find joy and a good amount of comedy because it's really funny. I want to see it again just for 100 minutes of happiness.",The French Dispatch
15,ethanbresnett,If you like Wes Anderson you will LOVE this film,9,1 November 2021,"If you aren't keen on Wes Anderson then give this film a wide berth as it is the most Wes Anderson film you could imagine.The characters are so well penned, all of them bringing something rich and quirky to the film. As you'd expect from the stellar cast they are all wonderfully portrayed. Every scene offers up about 3 or 4 cast members who either have been, should have been or will be Academy award winners. It really is something else.Like any Wes Anderson film the story is so unique, detailed, character driven and just bizarre. The French Dispatch boasts 3 separate stories which all offer something slightly different and are all so enjoyable to watch.Then there is the direction from Wes which is as you'd expect top notch. This film is just a feast for the eyes, with the colour pallete, the use of black and white in certain scenes, the framing, the camera work, the use of animation all fantastic. Everything is so Wes Anderson and so beautifully shot. I reckon you could pause this film at any given frame and end up with a brilliant canvas to hang on your wall.Absolutely brilliant and my favourite Wes Anderson to date.",The French Dispatch
16,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Deeper into Wes Anderson's hole,9,10 November 2021,"Somehow, Wes Anderson's movies keep getting more and more impressive, and on top of that, more and more insane. On paper, the plot to this movie would sound ridiculously dull, but Anderson is one of those weirdos who can take the most lukewarm concepts and turn them into something completely mind-blowing, primarily through his visual artistry, and his knack for uniquely witty and complex dialogue.But there's always more to it. Of course, everything you see is the most astonishing element of the film (sets, wardrobe, cinematography...and the additional animated segments were a much welcomed surprise), but the movie is also packed with iconic performances. Of all the films I've seen Benicio Del Toro in, this is going to be one of the top ones I remember him in from here on out. This was also the first thing I appreciated Jeffrey Wright in - his presence and voice was so disciplined, I was whoa'd by it. And finally, Lea Seydoux wears the crown for my favorite appearance in the film - her character manages to be so simple and so complex at the same time - she gets to show immense strength and intimidation, and complete vulnerability at the same time - it's really quite amazing.While the movie is mostly an unpredictable tram ride through bizarre conversations and happenings, it does have a couple of minor weaknesses in my eyes. First, I thought the first story of the 3 felt much more cohesive, where as the next two didn't feel like they had much of a ""wrap up"", not that that's big of a problem - just something I feel could have added a bit to the flawlessness of the film otherwise. And, considering what a legit fan of Timothee Chalamet I am, it was kind of odd to walk away feeling like he was the only cast member that felt a bit out of place. He did well, but I felt like literally every single other cast member collectively encapsulated the signature Wes Anderson world energy, whereas he very much had his own Timothee Chalamet energy.This may be Anderson's most stylish film yet, aside from maybe The Grand Budapest Hotel, my personal favorite of his many masterworks. Even if you can't get into the deadpan vibes, or understand what the story is about, the visual artistry is an immense feat on it's own - if you can go to a museum and appreciate a painting or a sculpture, you should be able to see plenty of magic here.",The French Dispatch
17,euroGary,"Huge fun, mostly",8,14 October 2021,"'The French Dispatch' consists of three main stories, so it is probably inevitable that one of them is less successful than the others. It is nothing to do with the actors concerned - principally Tilda Swinton, Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody and Léa Seydoux - simply that the story of an imprisoned artist becoming The Next Big Thing drags a bit. The other main segments - Frances McDormand and Timothée (still not sure how to pronounce that) Chalamet in a tale of student unrest; and Jeffrey Wright, Mathieu Amalric and Liev Schreiber caught up in a police operation including a kidnapped child and fine dining - are rollicking good fun.The conceit of these tales is they are all articles in the final issue of the 'French Dispatch', a supplement to a Kansas newspaper that brings French culture to the American Midwest. As the journalists tell their stories, the audience sees artistic pretentions and student naivety knowingly skewered. The acting is universally good and it would be hard to single out one performance - although how the whippet-thin Chalamet twice managed to deliver the line ""I'm embarrassed by my new muscles"" with a straight face is beyond me.The film is a mixture of black-and-white, colour and - in an inspired choice for a chase sequence - animation. Even the opening- and closing credits are entertaining (indeed, if there were an Oscar for best opening credits 'The French Dispatch' would win hands down).

19,darkreignn,Extremely enjoyable,9,31 October 2021,"""The French Dispatch"" is undeniably one of the most flat-out entertaining films I've seen in theatres so far in 2021, and this is coming from someone who isn't even a huge Wes Anderson fan. I typically find his movies to be quite cold - visually stunning, but emotionally distant - so imagine my surprise when I found myself entranced not only by this movie's remarkable visuals but also from its tender stories that depict the lovely, tragic, and unpredictable beauty of life.""The French Dispatch"" takes an anthology type approach to its plot that explores three unique stories and many unique characters. The ensemble cast that Anderson employs portrays a wide variety of characters that are a complete joy to watch; Timothée Chalamet as a cigarette enjoying wannabe revolutionary, Léa Seydoux as a soft-spoken but strong in conviction prison guard, Steve Park as a head chef who seems to believe that he has tasted all there is to taste - Anderson compiles a bizarre, relatable, and lovable, assortment of characters that all point toward the richness of individuality.From minute to minute, ""The French Dispatch"" is a celebration of reality, and an ode to people. I found the compilation of stories and portrayal of so many different types of people very life-affirming, and I certainly left the theatre in a better mood than I was when I entered it. I've read some reviews that state the film loses momentum after each story, but I disagree. I found each of the film's three stories equally as engaging - but even if you don't, I still believe you'll enjoy the overall experience of watching this film because of how beautiful it is to look at and hear.Anderson once again proves himself to have quite an eye for pleasing visuals. The film goes back and forth from color sequences to ones that play out in black and white, and regardless of if a certain scene is in color or not, every frame, shot, and sequence is bursting at the seams with style and flair and life - it literally felt like my eyes were eating up the scenery, and I can confidently say that I haven't seen a movie that looks this good in a long time. But Anderson also shows a masterful employment of music here that just enhances the visuals; one sequence in particular with Léa Seydoux walking past artwork, the scene going from black and white to color, with gorgeous music playing as Léa walks and admires, was simply stunning in its combination of sound, cinematography, and vibrant color.Listen, I don't really have much else to say because, simply put, I found ""The French Dispatch"" to be highly enjoyable. If you're not a fan of Wes Anderson you may be put off by his trademarked style, but then again, I'm not really a fan of his, and I found myself loving this movie from beginning to end. While walking into the theatre I was unsure if this movie would warrant a movie theatre experience, I can now say that I am very happy to have seen this on the big screen, and if you have any interest at all in seeing this, I encourage you to do the same.",The French Dispatch
20,Lewis_Heather787,Repeat viewings needed!!!,6,30 October 2021,"I will admit that I had very high expectations for this film as soon as the first trailer dropped. It looked like it had the potential to be one of Wes Anderson's classics. Is it that? To be honest, I'm not quite sure because this film will 100% require repeat viewings for anyone to fully grasp everything going on in this film. I am also not sure that's a good thing.For me there is a lot going on in this film, maybe too much going on at once. In places throughout the film I did get a bit lost so much so that I started to lose interest ever so slightly. Now I know that having too much Wes (and his quirky/unique style) in one film, doesn't work all the time. There are story lines, aspects and characters that I really really enjoyed in this film. However there are also paths this film takes that aren't as interesting or rewarding as you think they would be.I am not trying to take away though from the incredible achievement this film is in terms or writing, directing and editing. I am telling you now, this film will be nominated for multiple awards this year......I have no doubt. The script for this film must have been one of the longest ever written. There is so much information packed into every single scene, interaction between characters and narration over the top. It is a lot to handle as an audience member but also makes you marvel at the sight of a technical genius, like Anderson, at work. I have a feeling this film is what it is like inside his brain hahaha. To have the imagination and vision to create this film is breath taking. All the complexities to the story along with the constant screen format changes, black and white to colour, time jumps and animation.......you name it, this film has it!The best parts of this film were some of the performances from this truly incredible huge cast. Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet are all absolutely phenomenal in this film !!! Also a shoutout goes to Lea Seydoux again another great role delivered from her!! The rest of them were all terrific as well however the ones mentioned above caught my eye more and jumped off the screen in the scenes they were in.Overall though I would say that I am slightly let down by this film because I know I missed so much information just viewing it the once. Should a film launch so much information at an audience at once it needs a second viewing to understand it all. (Some films get away with it, like Tenet because that is a spy, mystery, thriller....... I don't expect it nor think it works in a drama such as ""The French Dispatch""). Doesn't fit the genre for me.65% out 100, I thought that the film overall was ok/good, although I did start to get bored slightly because there was too much going on. Plus not all the story threads were as interesting. I think a second viewing would enhance my viewing pleasure, I am positive it will. That doesn't take away though from the phenomenal technical achievement this film is.",The French Dispatch

My personal favourite was the first story, and it never quite reached the heights of that one for me again. Shot beautifully and filled with quirky moments and humour as expected.

The problem with his 'style', is that it's all that there is. The stories are bland, the characters are lame. If you like watching a movie that screams hipster and 'ain't I'm clever', then this the movie for you. Wes' movies are good for screenshots as computer desktop wallpaper, but taken as a whole, they leave you feeling empty and wondering why you wasted so much time.",The French Dispatch
23,hunter-friesen,Wes Anderson at the height of his power,10,17 September 2021,"*Watched at Cannes 2021*With each subsequent entry into his distinct filmography, Wes Anderson seems to make it a mission to make the most Wes Anderson film. The intricacies of 2001's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" seemed quaint around the time ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was released in 2013. Even his side ventures into stop-motion animation contain a great distance in production quality between 2009's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and 2018's ""Isle of Dogs."" With Anderson's tenth feature film, ""The French Dispatch"" towers over all of his previous works with its masterful production qualities and international ensemble cast.Set within 20th century France in the fictional city of Ennui-sur-Blasé, ""The French Dispatch"" opens with the untimely news that the editor of the titular magazine, Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray), son of the magazine's founder and holder of a supreme eye for talent, has died. As per his wishes, his life is to be tied directly to that of the magazine, meaning that the publication dies with him. His team of writers - an eccentric bunch of expatriates all recruited over the years by Howitzer in one way or another - are granted one final issue, which they decide will contain ""an obituary, a brief travel guide, and three feature stories.""The obituary is, of course, for Arthur, while the travel guide takes one through the historic village that has acted as the publication's home for nearly half a century. The three retrospective stories selected are considered to be the best in the publication's long history: an account by the paper's art critic (Tilda Swinton) of the deranged painter Moses Rosenthal (Benicio Del Toro) and a brash art dealer (Adrien Brody); an on-the-ground report by political correspondent Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand) of the student revolution led by the charismatic Zeffirelli (Timothee Chalamet); and a retelling by food critic Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) of how he got entangled in a kidnapping involving the son of the chief of police (Matthieu Almaric).While there is no central story to fully move the film from start to finish, the anthology-style structure still allows Anderson to explore several of the themes found within his previous works, such as human curiosity and the ironic relationship we share with the world and its other characters. The final story of the food critic ranks as the best in terms of what's on the page, giving Jeffrey Wright a wonderfully complex character who unintentionally learns several valuable lessons about his place in the world.Some will find that the anthology structure limits the emotional connection one can have to the characters, especially since Anderson has built his career on wonderfully layered characters such as Royal Tenenbaum and M. Gustave. On the contrary, while many of his characters tend to overstay their welcome in a 100-minute narrative, the anthologies force Anderson to be as efficient as possible with character development, creating several sequences of mise-en-scène where the direction tells just as much of the story as the script.After gradually becoming more confident as a director, Anderson has finally allowed himself to fully unleash his unique brand of filmmaking. Visually, this is one of the most accomplished works ever made as Anderson toys with aspect ratios (very similar to the strategy within ""The Grand Budapest Hotel""), color and black & white cinematography, ingeniously hilarious freeze frames, and a period-accurate soundtrack that seems to always be perfectly queued. Ironically, the major complaint I have against the film is that there are dozens of expertly crafted shots that come and go in mere seconds even though they could be dissected for hours. Every frame truly is a painting as several hidden treasures can be found in every nook and cranny. This is a film that demands to be rewatched several times over to soak in every last detail.There are no weak links within the Robert Altman-sized cast, with players such as Adrien Brody (who seems to only deliver a good performance nowadays when directed by Anderson), Frances McDormand, and Jeffrey Wright. The phrase ""there are no small parts, only small actors"" doesn't apply here as people such as Christoph Waltz and Saoirse Ronan are reduced to minuscule cameos. Still, Henry Winkler and Willem Dafoe are able to do a lot with the little that they are given.A visual masterpiece bursting at the seams with talent both on and off the screen, ""The French Dispatch"" is a film by a director working at the absolute height of his powers. More importantly, the film gave me one of the most enjoyable theatrical experiences in a long time, with several rounds of applause from the Cannes crowd that seemed to be in love with the film as much as I was.I worry about how Anderson will be able to top this with his next film. But until then, I'll stay in the present and be thankful that something this magical is allowed to exist in a world that only seems to get bleaker.",The French Dispatch
24,bastille-852-731547,"Wes Anderson's latest excels in wit, whimsy, and style",8,22 October 2021,"With his signature aesthetic and uniquely quirky vibes, auteur Wes Anderson has established a devoted following of fans--one of which happens to be me. I also am a big fan of The New Yorker, which the film plays homage to, so I was very excited to see this delightfully Andersonian homage to French cinema and culture as well as journalism and literary magazines. Needless to say, it didn't disappoint, and I think Wes Anderson fans are going to love it. The film chronicles the last issue of an outpost of an American newspaper based in the fictional French city of Ennui-sur-Blasé. The vast majority of the film is an anthology of three chapters, which are bookended by a delightful-yet-fleeting opening and conclusion. The first chapter, ""The Concrete Masterpiece,"" tells the story of an artist incarcerated on murder charges whose paintings become a sensation. In the second chapter (""Revisions to a Manifesto,"") the relationship between a journalist and a revolutionary, anti-conscription leader is profiled. In the third and final chapter, ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner,"" an eccentric police investigation that ends up getting entangled with both an acclaimed chef and a kidnapping plot occurs.Anderson's visual style is beloved by his fans, and suffice it to say the aesthetics in ""The French Dispatch"" are nothing short of superb. From wide shots to panoramic shots to split-screen shots, the cinematography is wholly unique and engaging throughout the entire story. The film toggles seamlessly between color and black and white, and is always gorgeous to watch. Even a late-film traditionally animated sequence is creative and clever. There's plenty of humor on display here too, both of the deadpan variety and of clever one-liners and reveals similar to many of Wes Anderson's other films. Anderson does a great job of connecting the three main stories to the operation, purpose, and writing style of the newspaper--and this narrative ""connective tissue"" is, in many cases, a critical part of having a successful anthology. The film is consistently fun and engaging throughout for those with a clever and highbrow cinematic palette, and never wastes any time. Even though the film can occasionally feel a bit ""style-over-substance,"" the story's consistent message honoring the importance of journalists--particularly expat writers--and the unique literary and visual trends in great journalism that can affect readers ultimately comes off as pretty profound by the time the film reaches its conclusion. The film is definitely an ensemble piece, which has its pluses and minuses. The concern about the ensemble structure of the story's casting and characterization is that sometimes the character development can be a bit skimpy or derivative; however, given the strengths on display overall here and Anderson's clear filmmaking talent, that is a relatively minor complaint. I'm not sure if those who aren't fans of Wes Anderson will be won over by this (it is VERY ""Wes Anderson-y,"") but those of us who enjoy this superbly idiosyncratic filmmaker will have a blast. Gladly recommended. 8.5/10.",The French Dispatch
25,Nate-48,Biggest wes anderson disappontment,3,30 October 2021,"Wes Anderson has made two of my favorite movies - grand budapest hotel and royal tennenbaums but this forgettable movie ranks near the bottom of his work.The art and style is all there - a lot of tributes to the old french and italian cinema greats, to the silent movies back to meiles but what is missing is a cohesive compelling story.There is irony because you get 3-4 stories depending on how u look at it but nothing at all memorable or believable for a second.The writing is on the wall literally from the first scene when we are asked to indulge a joke that liberty, kansas (population 100) had a newspaper at one time with an office in paris. That alone was not enough to sink this movie - not with this great case of top notch actors.What is redeeming here is a few standout performances. If you hadnt seen benicio del toro before this movie is worth something because he shows again why he won the academy award 20 years ago for traffic. His eyes and facial expressions have a hint of lon chaney.Adrien Brody hits the mark and does not disappoint- however the script undercuts him and does not do him justice.They had Jeffrey wright playing roebuck wright who seems to have been partially based on the writer richard wright and a little James Baldwin partial composite though his story does not really resemble either Richard wrights character or James Baldwin that well ( both were american ex pat writers living in france at timeframe of the film) and frankly was quite the waste of time for the character who has the most lines in the movie.I know wes anderson likes to have his trademarks with these stories about how they always become unglued but this movie really took things to an extreme - there was almost literally no point to this nonsense.Add in some animation which he used in his boring movie isle of dogs- another sleeper and he completely lost me.A nude portrait scene was an example of the director's focus on the art crowd which did nothing for me and was another sign early that this was going to be bad. The scene did not do much to move the rather boring story and looked like a misfire of trying to be edgy.Also the use of black and white was ok sometimes and made the color scenes more powerful when they came out of the black and white - there was too much shifting between black and white color and animation - he overdid it. I liked the black and white scenes where he paid homage to the classic films but much of the b&w scenes were tedious.A scene involving an electric chair had some interesting metaphorical and symbolic value though that may have been just for shock value or laughs not sure.Three good scenes in the whole movie - a flashback scene paying tribute to Beau Geste (a three-second montage part of a larger flashback in the way royal tenenbaums does its ramones flashback scenes) an art scene and a quick shootout scene.This movie needed more great scenes - second story should have been cut out entirely.I gave it three stars - one star for art decoration, one star for the actors involved, and another star for the effort to pay tribute to the classic cinema.I cant give it more than three stars because that would be bad advice if you value your time and money. This movie is only going to appeal to the most loyal Wes Anderson fans and those overindulging in artistic self indulgence.This film overdosed on self indulgence.",The French Dispatch

27,varun-25071997,"Strong in Aesthetics, Weak In Content",6,5 November 2021,"When one goes to a Wes Anderson film, we exactly know what to expect. In French Dispatch, Wes Anderson gives us everything we expect but he seems to have focused too much on aesthetics and less in the script. The film resembles like a spiritual sequel to Grand Budapest Hotel, but lacked it's strong characters and bullet speed screenplay.The French Dispatch is an anthology about 3 segments in a newspaper set in a French town. Each story is something Wes Anderson has never done in his previous films, he tries to convey a political satire which often falls flat. A big star cast wasn't necessary for this film but it had it anyway and many top actors have been grossly under utilized.The biggest plus of French Dispatch is that it has a spectacular production design, original score, cinematography and costumes. The aesthetics test has been passed in flying colours, probably the best we have seen in a Wes Anderson movie.

The stories themselves are shown in black-and-white, while action back in the U. S. is in color. One scene is done like a video of a stage play. Another sequence has an animated car chase. Then there is the language. I think the film should be either entirely in English, or have the French characters speak French to each other. However, there are characters who switch back and forth between languages, almost as an attempt to catch audience member napping.While all this is mildly interesting, it is also mildly irritating.

31,severindringel,"Lacking emotional attachment, but an aesthetic joy",7,8 November 2021,"There are only a few directors whose signature is recognisable in their films from minute one. Whether Rushmore, Moonrise Kingdom or The Grand Budapest Hotel - Wes Anderson definitely belongs to this rarity. His new film The French Dispatch is a colourful mix of satire, hurried dialogue and animated sequences. All these elements in one work have never been seen before in Anderson's filmography. Thus, it is true that you've never seen a movie more Wes Anderson than that.The plot, as with most Anderson films, is once again in the background. Nevertheless, it is clear from the message that this is an ode to journalistic work. For in three short stories we accompany various journalists and artists as they interact, research and polarise. The, also an Anderson characteristic, exclusively bizarre characters simultaneously say goodbye with the stories to their magazine French Dispatch, which is retiring from operation after the death of its editor-in-chief. Residing in the small town of Ennui, in the first mini-narrative we get to know the unassuming but at the same time spectacular place because of its aesthetics. A declaration of love to the beauty of France, initiated of course by the Francophile Anderson himself. The journalists' final articles are told to us pictorially, carried by a top-class cast, as in all WA films. Benicio del Toro plays a highly talented but psychopathic and imprisoned artist who draws inspiration from his superior and model Simone (Lea Seydoux) in prison. Acting-wise, these two are definitely the highlight of the film, not only because they have by far the most screen time, but also have the chance to develop something like comprehensible chemistry as the only characters. The story is rounded off by Adrian Brody as a passionate art collector and Tilda Swinton as the investigative journalist. Although she helps us follow the narrative thread, her character comes up short because of her one-dimensionality. In the second story, Timothee Chalamet and Frances McDormand are investigative journalists from different generations with a somewhat perverted attraction. The lack of exposition hurts the story enormously because it is hard to understand or build tension. The same is true in the third and final article, but with a completely new directorial twist and a bravura Jeffrey Wright as a frenzied reporter, this one wakes you up after a very long-winded second act.You can tell The French Dispatch is not a balanced film. Story-wise, it has highs and lows, though here, unfortunately, it's more the latter. If you are not a classic cineaste, you will have a hard time with the film. Even I struggled at times, because although I celebrate such an aesthetic discovery, the script lacks the finishing touches. Moreover, another of Wes Anderson's weaknesses is more apparent than ever in this film: not one of the hundred characters appears often enough or is present enough to even come close to an emotional connection. As a result, The French Dispatch left me very cold in terms of content. However, the oscillation between animation and live-action film, the energetic monologues and dialogues and fabulous camerawork ultimately triggered something in me that leaves me with a satisfied, if not ecstatic, feeling.",The French Dispatch

This one has its charms.. and its moments. It's a collage of separate stories being covered by different American ex-pat journalists living in France, working for Bill Murray (who instead of going to New York and starting the New Yorker, went to France). The best of these is the Benicio Del Toro/Adrien Brody contribution, which I found riveting and moving and all that it could be. Overall, the film is intelligent - yes, certainly. However, there is a level of pretention and condescension that is really not enjoyable. I think I have come to expect something known from Mr. Anderson - true heart and soul in what may otherwise seem vapid or angry (or otherwise one dimensional) characters, humour, pathos, and something bright - something that gets the serotonin running.. bright colours, bright feelings - something ultimately uplifting. Maybe it's not fair of me to expect more of the same. The artist has to grow and has the right to create.. but as the consumer, I can feel a little disappointed when the flavour is just a bit off.

By now, most cinephiles know what to expect from Anderson's films: precise camera framing, expressive colors, whimsical production design, and witty dialogue. While that might be taken for granted by some, it is undeniable that Anderson's movies are consistently great. The French Dispatch is the latest example. Audiences may have become desensitized to Anderson's artistry and it's a bit forgettable by his lofty standards, but The French Dispatch is still one of the best films of the year.Before dismissing it as just another great Wes Anderson movie, a few details about The French Dispatch deserve recognition. First, the script is uniquely structured as a series of magazine articles, connected by themes of the creative process and finding a sense of belonging. Next, there are a variety of effects at play; shifting aspect ratios, color saturation, and animation mediums give the film a dynamic feel. Lastly, the cast is exceptional. Almost every character is played by a recognizable and skilled actor, which helps capture Anderson's quirky world.

42,JoelAlexanderr,"A charming, hilarious ode to journalism and storytelling",9,9 November 2021,"Wes Anderson movies are a genre of their own at this point. Every shot he composes is uniquely his, and nobody else can seem to replicate his distinct style. Therefore, whenever Anderson is coming out with a new film, I, for one, am there. His new movie, THE FRENCH DISPATCH, may be one of his best yet, and contains some of the most enthralling, off-the-rails and beautiful storytelling of his career and of the year thus far. If Anderson was a new director and this were his first movie, he would be the clear winner for Best Director at the Oscars this year, but because he has established his style in the minds of critics and viewers alike, this is seen as a typical output. Whatever box one may try to put THE FRENCH DISPATCH under, it wildly succeeds as an ode to journalism and the art of storytelling itself. The movie never lost my attention despite being quite a lot of complex dialogue to digest in one sitting, and by the end I felt myself reluctant to leave the world this film had established.The French Dispatch is the title of a small American magazine in France that covers world affairs and a wide array of subjects despite starting out as a branch from a different larger publication in Kansas. It contains an old-fashioned yet passionate editor (Bill Murray in his obligatory role in every Wes Anderson movie), a talented writing staff from all different backgrounds, and a knowledge of the fictional city of Ennui. The film does not follow one storyline, but rather three small stories and plenty more small asides, similar to how the structure of a magazine or similar publication may look. These stories are all completely different and bear no relation other than taking place in the town of Ennui, yet they all capture the essence of the importance of storytelling and journalism in capturing the adventure of life.I'll come out and say that part of my immense appreciation for Anderson's movie is my well-established connection and appreciation for journalism, and many may not feel the same love for the disjointed structure. I can see people who are used to a typical story being overwhelmed by the amount of information thrown at them, but for me, THE FRENCH DISPATCH proves to be an immensely enjoyable thrill-ride from start to finish. Even the slower stories feel like a whirlwind of emotion and humor in a way that only Anderson can pull off. In concept, some of the stories may seem uninteresting, but as any good journalist does, Anderson structures and tells his narratives in such a way that every audience member will be on the edge of their seat by the end. While I'm not sure if I picked up every detail on my viewing due to the rapid-fire dialogue, I would not hesitate to travel right back to the town of Ennui and discover even more things I may have overlooked.To say the acting is good in this movie is like saying the grass is green, especially since Anderson has cast every A-list star known to man to star in this film. Every other scene has some ridiculously famous actor appear (Hey, is that Edward Norton?)(Hey, is that Christoph Waltz?)(Hey, is that Elizabeth Moss?)(Hey, is that *insert actor name here*?), which would be distracting if they all weren't so good in their roles. The highlights for me are numerous: Benicio Del Toro is fantastic as a mentally ill, incarcerated art genius; Adrien Brody is charismatic as the art dealer trying to profit from Del Toro's art; Timothée Chalamet wins me over yet again as a stubbornly impassioned student protest leader; and Jeffrey Wright delivers the best performance in the movie as a struggling writer who finds meaning in food. Wright in particular is so excellent that he injects in the story an emotional depth that I did not expect, and also made me look back on the emotional potency of journalism in a different way. This is also due to Anderson's excellent writing, in which he maintains his journalistic integrity of non-bias (""NO CRYING"") while also giving us glimpses of the emotion underneath it all.Saying more about THE FRENCH DISPATCH would be pointless without telling you this: go in expecting a Wes Anderson-esque Wes Anderson movie with copious amounts of Wes Anderson thrown in for good measure. If that doesn't sound like it's for you, then don't bother. If that means nothing to you, then I'd highly suggest watching some more of his films before this one (Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, or Fantastic Mr. Fox are all great choices), because starting with THE FRENCH DISPATCH is like having your first concert be in the mosh pit for Slipknot -- a bit overwhelming. However, if that description sounds like fun for you, it will be one of your favorite films of the year. THE FRENCH DISPATCH serves as one of the best odes to journalism I have ever laid eyes on, and is a movie that I predict will have great longevity as viewers continue to mine endless amounts of detail and meaning out of this meticulously crafted film.A.",The French Dispatch

It's a loving tribute to the lost age of journalism, when giants stalked the corridors of The New Yorker, as well as an inventive and inspired paean to the art of storytelling, as plots, subplots and digressions are juggled like plates or nested inside one another like Russian dolls. While there's certainly a surfeit of whimsy and Gallic je ne sais quoi, it's stylish, beautifully photographed and boasts a cast to die for. I wasn't entirely sure why it kept switching from colour to black-and-white, but there are also delightful animated sections, sly humour, dry wit and...oh, so much, it's almost overwhelming and would definitely reward a second look. Great stuff.",The French Dispatch

Same with Anderson's latest work.This film is artfully delicious, with delicate set design and camera work, a l'art pour l'art episode movie, a real delight to watch. But- it doesn't offer any content at all.

Main challenge must have been trying to see how many stars could be worked into the tableaux. I've rarely walked out of movie, but left this movie after an hour and had started wanting to after 15 minutes. Amazingly stupid.

So many familiar and also unfamiliar faces.Great performances.List would be too long if i would wrote about my favorites.When movie ended my mouth was open and there were couple tears in my eye.

48,danielmullin,The Adam Sandler aspect was hilarious,7,26 August 2021,"I caught this film at the festival a couple months back. The first two thirds seemed like the usual wes Anderson wackiness. But coming in to the final act they start to bring the Adam Sandler aspect to the film all the jokes about ""wishing Adam Sandler was in the movie"" started to pay off, and then without spoiling too much .......... We finally get Adam Sandler. The Adam Sandler pay off was AMAZING !!! It was built up years ago with the wedding singer and happy Gilmore and Wes Anderson's unique ability to capitalise on that was insane. In conclusion, if you find your self thinking ""I wish Adam Sandler was in this movie"" don't worry, you will be pleased !",The French Dispatch
49,Lefteris-Anagnostopoulos,Is There A Universe That Wes Anderson Doesn't Make A Charming Movie?,8,4 October 2021,"This is easily the best movie that I saw during AIFF (Athens International Film Festival).The French Dispatch is an anthology movie that follows three reporters recounting events that led them to write certain articles. As with all Wes Anderson movies, it's unique, visually hilarious without stupid dialogue and a joy to watch. The only downsides are two in my opinion. One, the first story is the best, the second the second best and the third... you get it. This descending order of interest is apparent, but that doesn't means that they are bad. Two, most of the movie is in black and white and when you see colored shots it makes you wish that the whole movie was in color.",The French Dispatch

He always casts his films perfectly and prods great performances from his stars. It's obvious he is a perfectionist and pays attention to the smallest of details in his films. The French Dispatch is no different. Great writing, great sets, beautifully shot, and most importantly; distinctive. Prendre plaisir!",The French Dispatch

52,eevaivilo,The most Wes Anderson movie Wes Anderson has ever made,9,19 October 2021,"I suppose my only qualm with this movie is that it's very talky (as many of his films are), and if you have a short attention span like myself, it can be easy to miss important dialogue. I had to ask the friend I was with for explanation on one or two things I didn't fully comprehend. However, once you really immerse yourself in the world of the film, you'll miss less and less.This film was an absolute delight from start to finish. I thought each of the three stories were captivating in their own, unique way (though I definitely liked Chalamet's the most), and the bookends about Murray's character tied everything together perfectly.Anderson has this marvelous talent for luring you into his fantastical films with unbelievable set design and whimsical details and oddly delightful performances, and then hitting you over the head with reality. There are plenty of moments in this film that truly struck me in a profound way, especially one during story two that included a stellar performance from Alex Lawther, who expertly utilized what little screen time he had. One line of dialogue still haunts me hours later.It's also one of his funniest movies; the absurdity of some of the visuals and performances are really a sight to behold. The cartoon sections in the third story had me ROLLING for a good few minutes.So go see it. It's wildly original and has that trademark Wes Anderson touch dialed up to 11.",The French Dispatch

I really do understand the criticism, but in the words of Rhett Butler ""Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn""! This was an absolute joy to watch. A meticulously intricate set design and great performances by a stellar cast pulled the story from the pages, and gave it a heartbeat.All that being said, it is not without its flaws. The French Dispatch lacked a human element. Unlike the rest of his films, the movie was not rooted in family relationships, which is something I've always admired in his stories. However, this did not bother as much as it did other people. The French Dispatch is an absolute blast and a nice change from the boring, overdone Oscar bait movies that always come out in the fall.",The French Dispatch
54,sebastianschlicht,"""Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose.""",10,5 November 2021,"Wes Anderson is loved by many and disdained by others. ""Typical Wes Anderson"" or ""Always the same"" is read and / or heard quite often. At the end of the day, what counts for me is whether a film entertains and / or touches me. And Anderson has always managed to do that. Even if a film uses its style repeatedly and one might think that he cannot do anything else, one must not overlook what he achieves with its work. The visual, which he often seems to focus on, is a very special level of storytelling. But many then rate it with a simple ""Style over Substance"". I'd would say something like that about someone like Michael Bay, but not Anderson. He's far too talented for that.His latest film ""The French Dispatch"" from 2021 has already received a lot of reviews such as ""a typical Anderson"", but is it really that way?The story revolves around editor Arthur Howitzer or rather his journalists, who present three of their stories: An imprisoned murderer and painter who discovers his new muse in a guard, a war between two student fronts and the story about a kidnapped child and the best chef in the world ...""The French Dispatch"" is therefore more of an anthology film and consists of three episodes plus a prologue and an epilogue. The whole thing takes place in the fictional french suburb of Ennui-sur-Blasé and is a kind of love letter (or film) from Anderson to France, where he himself spent many years of his life. But of course he creates his very own, magical world that seems to have sprung from a fairy tale. But how do you describe such a film? How do you describe ""The French Dispatch""?Anderson brings everything he has tot he table, he brought almost every actor into the film he has ever worked with and still creates something unique and new. His loving homage to France and journalism develops into a turbulent trip, which at first glance has a very simple story or three simple stories to offer, but which transforms the whole thing into a moving picture book. Even if you can't quite follow the story, the immense imagery offers a lot of entertainment. Every shot is detailed, wonderfully filmed and looks like a small painting. A comic that has become real, as it is called in the film itself. Anderson uses almost no CGI, but rather loving miniatures, cartoon animation and even stop motion. The sets are superbly designed and you can tell that every setting, every zoom and every edit has its purpose. The constant change between black and white and color is also very noticeable here.But Anderson also manages the change between joke and tragedy so brilliantly. The humor is often the focus (it´s a very funny movie), but there is always something melancholy and sentimental about it. And that has always touched me emotionally. So I was able to laugh much more at all the crazy, but charming things.Anderson naturally incorporated the french culture, as well as real french locations and extras. The spectacular 2D chase in the final, for example, was also animated in France. So the country had a strong influence on the finished film. But in the end ""The French Dispatch"" cannot really be described, because it is one of those films that you have to see and experience for yourself. Like a picture you cannot describe, you cannot describe this work of art either. And just like the works of art by Moses Rosenthaler in the film, you can't see everything at first glance, but you still somehow see the masterpiece.The cast is bigger than ever. It would be ridiculous to name everyone here, because even the smallest roles are always filled with top-class talent. I recommend not to read through the cast, because every new appearance is a little surprise. Still, I have to highlight Benicio del Toro, whose performance I probably enjoyed the most. I just love that, despite this gigantic number of great actors, the magic of the film doesn't disappear. Everyone does their part, like an ensemble in a play. And the fun and dedication of the actors can always be seen. There is so much passion in here that it is difficult to avoid it as a viewer.In addition to the breathtaking camera work by Robert Yeoman and the phenomenal editing by Andrew Weisblum, the whole thing is held together by the again wonderful music by Alexandre Desplat. His scores for Anderson's films always have this relaxed, playful and melancholy nature. I'm really looking forward to the soundtrack for this.Conclusion: After the first look, you might ask yourself what all this was about? Granted, a lot happens in a relatively short amount of time. Personally, I see it as an encouragement to watch the film several times, not at least to dive back into this unique world. And in my opinion, Anderson can do that like no other. He creates a fictional world that is similar to ours, but more reminiscent of a fairy tale. A modern fairy tale with a lot of humor and emotions under it. The two are so masterfully brought together that any other Hollywood-comedy feels like a visit to the cemetery. Another Anderson masterpiece in my eyes that can deliver a completely different experience for every viewer.",The French Dispatch

58,cmantafounis,The French Dispatch,8,2 November 2021,"At some point I would love to read (or write, but it would be more preferable to leave it to those more informed than I; namely, anyone else) an essay on the phenomenon of artistic self-parody - likely observable in most forms, but particularly present within film. Regularly do auteurs reach a point of such notoriety and acclaim that they resort to attempting to recapture their earlier work, shaping their newer projects to suit the public or critical perception of what their films ""should"" be. The result is often an ungainly amalgam of all the artist's trademarks, overtly portentous in its conceit as some sort of magnum opus. The examples are numerous: Lynch's Inland Empire, Tarkovsky's Nostalghia, even Nolan's Tenet. Wes Anderson has reached this inevitable step with his latest, The French Dispatch. As such, viewers are likely to be polarised between smitten awe at his generous display of stylistic idiosyncrasies (black-and-white, colour, animation, changing aspect ratios, dynamic camerawork, perfectly symmetrical staging, aggressively witty dialogue, et al), or utterly disenfranchised at the sight of this mechanical recitation of his defining tropes. I fall largely into the former category, albeit occasionally off-put by the usual issues that come with anthology films (viz. Superior segments highlighting weaknesses of others, lack of overarching purpose, difficulty to establish an emotional through-line, etc.; though many of these don't apply here, or at least not entirely, and the palpable craft and detail on display won me over on second viewing just as effectively as the first.) All this to say that The French Dispatch is Wes Anderson doing Wes Anderson, a wonderful thing if one is a fan of Wes Anderson. The fact that I struggle to pick a favourite segment is a positive sign (perhaps the first story, if only for my deep love of Tilda Swinton), and the entire runtime is just gorgeous shot after gorgeous shot, the cast listing overflowing with star talent, the score delightful throughout, the dialogue suitably charming, and pacing frantic enough that repeat watches allow for new jokes to be uncovered. Wall-to-wall with references, most of which I did not get as someone unfamiliar with the French New Wave, yet I can't help but smile even when it is clear he is writing well over my head. Perhaps lacks the sentimental counter-balance of e.g. Fantastic Mr. Fox (for the most part; each section ends with a moment that affected me in some respect - the longing final look between an artist and his muse, the elegy for a young rebel and his naïve cause, the reflections of a chef after tasting poison, and the last scene) but still a blast from start to finish.

62,FelixisaJerk,"Basically if you don't like Anderson's style you're really, truly going to hate this movie.",8,26 October 2021,"I suppose the gamble of any film told in a series of vignettes is to capture the rapt attention of your audience in one segment only to lose it in the next (see: The Ballad of Buster Scruggs).None of the vignettes in The French Dispatch ever truly lost me, but one came close. And it's not to say that particular story was poorly written or directed or performed, it's simply that the one preceding it was so dazzling and fantastic I wasn't quite ready to move on from it.Moving on is a large part of this film as it never stops marching forward both literally and figuratively. It has (a) large story(ries) to get through and if you can't keep up...sorry. No crying.The French Dispatch is a film told in five parts. Three articles bookended by an introduction and an epilogue. These five pieces make up the final issue of the magazine titled (wait for it): The French Dispatch. We ""read"" the final issue by watching the articles unfold through Wes Anderson's beautiful, obsessive, whimsical lens.Visually this is an Anderson film cranked to 11. The photogenic establishing shots, contrasting symmetry, and pastel color scheme of his entire career drenches every shot of this film. The picture beautifully shifts from black and white to color, and always at the perfect moment. His creative and effective use of animation and miniature sets are mesmerizing.Basically if you don't like Anderson's style you're really, truly going to hate this movie, but your mind was probably already made up.Seeing this in a theater packed full of micro-beanie, gold wire framed glasses wearing hipsters reminded me of why I don't typically like seeing Anderson's films on opening weekends. There is exactly one reason to ever talk during a movie, and that's if there is a fire, after that there is not one good reason to ever speak in a theater, especially if you're talking directly to the screen which a handful of these people did.The French Dispatch is an excellent film and Anderson is an excellent filmmaker. I think his style and creativity are a much needed burst of originality on the canvas of filmmaking. It also just made me feel nice after watching The Last Duel, that movie stole a piece of my soul... I like unconventional filmmakers, I like divisive filmmakers, and even in his missteps, I'll continue to be excited by and support Wes Anderson.",The French Dispatch

Anderson's style is the same in every movie. It starts with quirky humor, and ends with this bitingly sad, philosophical ending. The last movie of his that I truly enjoyed was The Darjeeling Limited.

This may leave some viewers angry at the superficial world Wes lives in, but it is entertainment, after all. One technical fault I personally had issue with is a couple disjointed animation sequences in the third story, which I cannot help but feel are anything other than budget cuts - particularly as one animated sequence is the biggest action scene within the whole film.Be that as it may, this is still the most Wes Anderson of Wes Anderson films.

68,josiahliljequist,Art underscoring how art sustains,7,30 October 2021,"One of my favorite lines in poetry is Keats' ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever...some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits.""
And I think this movie is Wes Anderson's way of recapitulating that sentiment on film.Each story shows the transcendence of art, beauty, and love in different ways. In ""The Concrete Masterpiece,"" the prisoner Moses staves off thoughts of suicide by delving into pottery, and eventually art. Simone is the beautiful muse that inspires him in spite of himself, and through her artistic spirit he lives on--both in his final work of art and in simply staying alive.In ""Revisions to a Manifesto,"" revolutionary wannabe Zeffirelli finds solace from the confused turmoil of a ambiguous revolution through the brief interlude of love that he finds with his fellow (and rival) compadre Julliette. It's the only time things slow down, and the scene is allowed to breathe, showing the calm that love brings in sharp contrast to the chaos of war.In ""The Commissioner's Dining Room,"" chef Nescaffier saves a boy's life through serving poisonous radishes to the kidnappers, and in doing so he must test it and poison himself. He ultimately survives, but he reveals that the poisoned radishes had a new flavor, something exceedingly rare in his long experience as a chef. Even in the face of death, the sensual art of food was something that enlightened him, something that proved transcendent over possible death.Now this doesn't mean the film doesn't have its flaws. It does. The narration can be frustrating, especially when one wants to simply soak in the gorgeous cinematography that Wes Anderson employs. The vignettes are mostly stand alone, and have no culminating element that ties the whole thing together. Except the beauty in art. The theme of art and love (and love for art) transcending all else, a fitting theme for a love letter to France.So overall, I really liked it. Its emotions are not in the actors, the lines, but in the underlying theme of art and beauty sustaining us through dark times, something portrayed beautifully by all the gorgeous scenes strung together like a jeweled necklace.",The French Dispatch

If you like to think and laugh at the same time have a seat. I've got something to show you,The brilliant director Ernst Lubitsch used to do these very stylized comedies. Fans always said that he, alone, could bestow his pictures with the ""Lubitsch Touch."" He had a sudden massive heart attack while he was working on what would be his final film, ""That Lady in Ermine"" with Betty Grable. It was completed by his countryman, fellow director Otto Preminger. At his funeral the director/ writer Billy Wilder shook his head and said ""No more Lubitsch."" The director William Wyler responded, ""Worse than that. No more Lubitsch pictures.""If Lubitsch hadn't died in 1947, if he were working today and free of constraints, he'd have made this movie. As it is we get to thank his latter day successor, Wes Anderson. In his wonderful hands the Lubitsch Touch shines.The movie flows between color and black & white; between wild action and stop-action tableaus; between live action and animated. I saw it in a movie theater and laughed like a maniac all through it. There was one other person in the theater. She never made a sound and filed quietly out as soon as the credits began.

Great soundtrack and use of animation in parts. The impression given of a artisan French City was very similar to Baz Luhrmann in Moulin Rouge.An enjoyable bit of escapism, I was surprised the French audience at Cannes gave it such a warm reception as I thought they'd find it a bit kitch, i.e a Hollywood director making a French style movie.",The French Dispatch

However I thought the middle was slightly weak compared to the rest of the film due to a rather tedious story sequence and questionable casting of Timothée Chalamet; which seamed to be more style over substance.Mostly, the acting was faultless, with special mentions to Adrien Brody and Jeffery Wright who were particularly great. With help of great writing combined with a lot superb acting, the characters became effortlessly intriguing.On the whole I believe this film is incredible.

74,icasilas,"An ode to youth, loneliness and somehow the French way of life, Wes Anderson's ""The French dispatch"" is a cinematography masterpiece and a new take on the separate narrative.",9,4 November 2021,"If it were not for Wes Anderson's name being on the marquee, in addition to those of the ensemble cast in this movie, the multi perspective and narrative storytelling style would have dissuaded me from watching the film. I so remember vividly ""The ballad of Buster Scruggs"", at the time Netflix's flagship artistic endeavour with the brilliant Cohen brothers. This film adopted at its core the same storytelling style: Different stories that seem independent at first glance, maybe apart from the general common setting, but that are implicitly all involved in building a common narrative and as it occurred in the film set the mood for a western that manages to be light-hearted all the while invoking the grittiness, danger and unlawfulness of the wild west. ""The ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is by all means a good movie, but it felt disjointed and the transition between the different stories seemed to lack fluidity. And trusting entirely the genius of the Cohen brothers especially as masters of storytelling, I blamed the medium and was convinced for about four years that this kind of narrative was very difficult to pull off. And boy was I wrong!Wes Anderson's ""The French dispatch"" is a testament to the genius and the unique filmmaking style of the man and his outstanding capability of leveraging the visual in the service of the story. To sum up (what already is in every description of this movie) this film is a romanticisation a new age France that harboured the peripeties of a newspaper and its numerous unique writers and staff as well as the everyday life of ""Ennui sur Blasé"" residents. I must admit that Anderson's fantasy France resembles more to France than the actual country, at least in my mind. Both depressingly dull coloured, often times grey and surprisingly lively was the setting of the movie, with equally nuanced characters that range from lonely masterful writers to young collegian protesters. The movie was not only marked by the picturesque scenes that the bizarrely symmetrical mind of Wes Anderson but also by the strong performances of its ensemble cast, my favourite being that of Benicio Del Toro. Each performance was beautifully delivered and the dialogue was masterfully crafted, each story was both unique and built upon and the general narrative that adulates the art of journalism writing, and goes with great depth but with brevity and levity through the complex psyches of the French dispatch's brilliant staff and deals with their loneliness, their struggle for creativity as well as their inner conflicts. But the brilliant thing with this movie is that these themes are not only dealt with through the characters, the dialogue but the world building: I believed that ""Ennui sur Blasé"" was a real place, and that an Asian selfless chef lived there cooking for the town's eccentric commissaire.All in all, what a wonderful film. Wes Anderson and Robert Yeoman once more surpassed themselves and my expectations, ""The French dispatch"" is a must see and a piece of film that is to me both revolutionary, bold and as Wes Anderson as it gets.",The French Dispatch

There's plenty of your typical Anderson style and witty dialogue, and I mostly enjoyed the first and third acts of the film. As whole though the story, acting and heart of this one takes a back seat to Anderson's stylistic approach. The production is the entire movie in a sense, and as a result it can be difficult to care about its stories or characters. Every role can be described as ""a Wes Anderson character,"" and that is pretty much all you need to know get the idea.

Both aspects done with copious artistry in the tableaux style Anderson loves to employ.The cast all plays along, as they always do in Anderson's movie. Bill Murray is mostly seen and heard in the opening, but sets the tone with his deadpan style. ""No crying.""

Visually, it's remarkably dull, using monochrome in the most lazy and unimaginative way, and taking away the distinctive colours of a Wes Anderson film. But visuals are not everything, and more importantly the plot suffers from an extreme amount of pretension, humour that misses the mark, and lack of character development or even screen time.

89,serrini,"If you think all Wes Anderson films are the same, well, you're right. (and congrats)",9,24 October 2021,"They are all genius. Or, they all suck. Either way, they are definitely all the same, and I mean that in the best way.I have this argument with my film friends constantly. They say they would love to see Wes try something ... ""different"". I disagree. If Hemingway, or Rowling, or King wrote something in a different style I doubt anyone would be on board with it. There are many a director that can move through style and genre and be competent, as there are many a writer, but Wes is an autore, and in such all his film has that, well, Wes Anderson feel.So was the movie good? Depends if you like Wes or not.It was big, bigger then his others, with bigger cast, and more ambition. The money, which was bigger, went to bigger ideas and sets. It felt good to watch him expand with his budget, to not get suffocated by it like some other directors may become.Fundamentally however, I personally felt that there was some missed opportunity that I personally cannot forgive. I loved all the stories, vignettes really, a kind of ""New York Stories (1989)"" approach to his fanciful world, which is fine, but it lacked the arc and heart that some of his other films execute so well.Budapest is a good example. We start with the aged proprietor of the once grand hotel, and we hear his story, see where all these characters had all these amazing things happen to them, so we care about him in the end, about the hotel, and all the people we've devoted our hearts and minds to for over an hour. With this film however, I felt that was lacking, and what is worse, it was set up perfectly to follow the same arc.The aged proprietor of the periodical housed all these wonderful characters, where all these amazing things happen to them, however, on his death, and the demise of the periodical like the shuttering of the hotel's doors, I felt really nothing much at all, and frankly, neither did the characters who seemed so disjuncted about writing his obituary as the credits roll.Perhaps this was the point. The point was to be fractured, like the stories, like the cartoon covers we see as an epilogue, a sudo obituary for the film itself. Perhaps. But c'mon. Who we kidding Wes?There is one seen, where Murry askes Lowe what he left out of his story ... Lowe hands him the crumpled text, and its a moment with the chef who says something to the effect that we are strangers here, that we are searching for something that perhaps never existed. To me, this is the heart of the film, the only connective tissue between these stories, that would have truly made the sum greater than the pieces. The magazine was itself a stranger, as were all the characters, as is Wes himself and his films in culture really. This unrealized connection, unrealized in the sense that we are robbed from seeing it played out on screen, left the film shattered in my mind, and even now, just an hour later, I struggle to temporally connect the pieces.My immediate thought after the lights came up was that it would have been better as a series, which is a horrible thing to think of a filmmaker you admire so much. The way the stories didn't connect, but stood alone from one another, the length of each piece, some brief, others epic, and even the style of the film jumping from 4:3 to 16:9 color to black and white made me feel that if I would have seen it as a series I would have binge watched 5 hours of it happily and said ""wow, I wish this was a movie"" instead of the other way around. What could have saved it was letting the Editor in Chief tell his story and invite us into his world a bit more so that we would have cared more about the collection, and less about the individual articles.Then again, perhaps, yes, it was the point all along, which is why I am moved to even write about it in the first place.

Anderson makes use of the 'short film' format very well here, especially in the middle two stories, but then cleverly links them all together through this background story of an eccentric newspaper catalogue.The segment with the artist and the student riots were standouts. Unbelievably stacked cast, some major stars showing up for even just a few minutes because there's no time for all of them (Saoirse Ronan, Willem Defoe). Performances are the deadpan and quirky style we've come to expect from Anderson, but surprisingly Timothee Chalamet fits in well amongst the star studded crowd.

French Dispatch has assembled every eccentric character, one can ever imagine living in France in the late 1960s/70s, and turned them all into one collective caricature., which renders them woefully boring and unimportant. The end product is like an entire color palette mixed together, brushed onto a canvas, then labeled art because an auteur amd his popular friends thought themselves artists versus filmmakers and story tellers. The level of self importance and self indulgence is off the chart. Similar to the Grand Budapest Hotel which suffers many of the same misfortunes, I am waiting for Mr Anderson to move me again. Recall Bill Murray and Jason S in the elevator scene in Rushmore. Or, Ben Stiller telling Royal he's had a tough few years.

101,spencermcook,Wes Anderson Provides His Most Ambitious and Refreshing Film Yet,8,3 November 2021,"Wes Anderson may have delivered us the most star studded cast in the history of filmmaking, and I'm not complaining. Known for his visual framing and qwerky storytelling, Wes Anderson provides audiences with his most ambitious film yet, The French Dispatch. Unfortunately, this is only the second film by Wes Anderson that I have seen, alongside The Grand Budapest Hotel, but you seem to feel a bit of clarity to what Wes Anderson is trying to accomplish after watching his two latest live-action installments.Synopsis:""A love letter to journalists set in an outpost of an American newspaper in a fictional 20th-century French city that brings to life a collection of stories published in 'The French Dispatch.'""What You See, Feel, and HearImagine yourself living in the 1950s reading a book that you don't fully understand but in a sense you're capable of visualizing every small detail. Each color pops out at you, each piece of dialogue seems profound, and the humor seems a bit.. dry. That is The French Dispatch. Something that resonates with me from both films that I have seen from Wes Anderson is the visual perspective that he provides. There's no shortage of framing, color satisfaction, and unique camera movement. You, as the viewer, feel engaged with the set from each scene as if you're watching things change and move firsthand, similar to the environment of a broadway theater. Throughout the film you experience about 65% of these stories in a vintage, pastel color, 30% in a vintage black and white color, and then about 5% in animation. (I did mention that this was his most ambitious film, right?)Because of the dialogue, you tend to catch yourself trying to piece together what's exactly going on in the beginning of the film. However, you learn quickly how unique the story is portrayed as you literally experience the publication of an opening remark, three stories, and a closing remark that are included in ""The French Dispatch."" Each story is written by separate authors who allow you to experience their mind and the stories that they have put together. Because of this, I felt as if I was watching three full length films and two short films. Viewers are accustomed to investing their minds and their hearts into one story that lasts anywhere between 80-150 minutes long. The French Dispatch offers a collection of stories that range individually between 10-30 minutes long to build up the 1h 43m runtime. Because of this, some may find it difficult to invest in character development or a story arc, and rightfully so.Though my first remarks mentioned a star studded cast, the acting isn't much of a topic in my opinion. However, I'm starting to learn that this is how Wes Anderson works. His visuals are a clear cut number one focus, his storytelling is second, and then the acting performances come right into place. This doesn't mean that the acting was poorly done. I thoroughly enjoyed performances from Timothée Chalamet, Frances McDormand, Benicio Del Toro, and Adrien Brody. The humor and expressions are meant to be dry and the portrayal of these ""old book"" characters is well performed.My TakeHow do you feel when you finish a film? Are you emotional, in awe of the story or acting performances, or even disappointed? No matter what type of film it is, more times than not you leave those emotions at the theater or in the moment where you experienced a story on screen. With The French Dispatch, I left and immediately felt inspired. I felt inspired to create art, to draw, to write, to take photos, to express my creative nature in one way or another, and I find that extremely admirable. Overall, I enjoyed this film. With an independent nature to how it was written and created I suggest going in with the right expectations. If you're looking for a blockbuster acting performance because of the names that are involved, or a massive cinematic experience, I think you'll be disappointed. If you're looking to learn something from a creative standpoint, you've come to the right place. You'll notice VERY quickly how different Anderson's style of directing and filmmaking is in comparison to others, but you can't help but appreciate it. Two words that come to mind in describing this film are refreshing and artistic. It's a breath of fresh air to experience something that isn't ""copy and paste."" Where you may be able to determine what comes next in most films because of a classic story arc, you'll have no idea what's about to happen in The French Dispatch.Grade: 7.7/10.",The French Dispatch

After witnessing the movie this hypothesis does indeed appear to be the case, which of course is not a bad thing. His signature style, with beautiful photography, fascinating camera work, sharp dialogue and an artillery of world class actors are all on show. The setting of France really seems to suit Wes Anderson's style, and he has done a commendable job of showcasing the beauty of the country. The structure of the film also suits his approach as we jump from one story to the next, creating a living, breathing world in the made-up city of Ennui-sur-Blase, and getting to see many of its different inhabitants and locations.Most people will have a fun time with this film- as each shot is as interesting as the last and the three stories are generally quit engaging. Some of the humour falls a bit flat but the excellent performances make up for it. Its hard to pick a standout from such a talented cast but I found Lea Seydoux and Jeffrey Wright to be particularly enjoyable. The score is nice as always, the music in the middle story was particularly memorable. I suppose the only real criticism I can make of the film is that everything just feels a notch or two down from his masterpiece Grand Budapest Hotel. Still an enjoyable ride though, and I am yet to see a Wes film I have rated lower than a 7.",The French Dispatch

At this point I'd like to highlight Léa Seydoux who just gave an incredibly good performance (acknowledging everyone else as well of course)!

109,davidleasure88,Snobbish.,6,31 October 2021,"Wes Anderson tries too hard with this film. Instead of one long story where we can get a feel for the characters, it's chopped into three small ones. The only one that was good was the first story with Del Toro, after that it was like, 'well, we have to fit two more stories in here.' There's no character development. While the film has a wonderful cast, they're totally bland in the film and might as well be background props. Bill Murray's character is dull and colorless, Will Dafoe is shown like three small times, and why waste your time bringing in Christoph Waltz and Henry Winkler? The film is trying very hard to be caviar for the rich, when us lesser folk really just want the meaty lobster of Wes Anderson's best creative talent. The film is made out to appear play like--painstakingly so. I get it, why not put on a production? And while I respect his trying new things (spoiler) the cartoon car chase just entirely detracted from the film. I really feel (oh no, I said that) this is going on the downward arch after his pinnacle. I won't say what that pinnacle is because that's biased. But I just feel like Anderson is reading snobby critic reviews from the New Yorker, and tweaking his films to fit their needs. Maybe I'm just too stupid, but I feel like the whole film, except the first story, was a waste of time.",The French Dispatch
110,ardenderi,"Stylisticly best Wed Anderson you can find, but copying his own work.",8,22 October 2021,"This movie is absolute delight. It brings the feel of era it is portraying, but in modern touch. It has lovely composition that take inspiration from paintings,theater, animation, television, golden era cinema and of course something modern.This movie has three little stories and few side stories to go along. I think for Wes Anderson this works for his best. I always have felt his movies are bit dragging even though I really enjoy slow cinema. I do not know where this problem arises (Fantastic Fox seems to drag a lot for me), but in this movie there certainly is no such thing as dragging, not to say it doesn't have it slow moments.Every character is fascinating and acting is superb most of the time. There are few times the dialogue/monologue is so fast it feels bit off and I don't think any actor could have done better. It seems there are some problems in audio mixing, because you spot takes and I think even few mic setup switches that are not intended. This is not major problem, but in extremely dialogue heavy movie should be noted.The biggest problems of the movie in my mind are really two things: firstly Wes Anderson recycling his composition, jokes/action, maybe slight character recycling in there too. Secondly it is not per se hollow, but it sort of lacks substance. I don't know why it feels like this, maybe most of the things have already been said so many times that they don't seem so daring or important. Maybe the movie is bit too light-hearted for some of these ideas it portrays (like suicide, murder, war, unbiased journalism)Perhaps it just comes down to that the movie feels like it should give more grand things, but really it is triumph of smaller details, notches in the past, more intimate references that not all can relate. It is highly enjoyable nevertheless.I would give 8,5, but I can't so I give 8, because it already is above average now.",The French Dispatch

112,janetewalker,The French Dispatch Review - An Entertaining Homage to Publishing,10,21 October 2021,"The French Dispatch, from Searchlight Films, brings to the screen the avant-garde bohemian life of 1960s Paris, as told by journalists on assignment for the magazine The French Dispatch, as they present the story behind the words.As the film begins, we see the staples of a writer's life, during that unconventional time, come to life, with caffeine, coffee and cigarettes and all combinations of adrenaline producing beverages being delivered in typical French fashion with a flourish and a finely dressed waiter balancing his tray with finesse as he bounds up the staircase, five flights up to the offices of The French Dispatch.Throughout we meet the writers, staff, and others, those strays like wandering cats, who have found a home among the books, smell of stale smoke and the thrill of publishing. We meet the publisher, a tough but tender American born Kansas native Arthur Howitzer, Jr., played by Bill Murray, who for reasons known or unknown left the cornfields of middle America, the life he was born into, for the dream or fantasy, of the life he wanted.Told in four vignettes, the words on the page are resuscitated to celluloid, as the memories of the journalist and the subjects, flow into the creation of the four stories. With each section of the magazine receiving a frontispiece, the sketches focus on the absurd, the unusual, the unconventional, the stories which made it to print.A travelogue of the seediest sections of the city itself from ""The Cycling Reporter,"" played by Owen Wilson who rides through the streets of the French city of Ennui-sur-Blasé documenting the changes from old ways of the peaceful countryside town to the rise of the 1960s revolution and the explosion of freedom.""The Concrete Masterpiece,"" about a criminally insane painter, played by Benicio Del Toro, his guard and muse, played by Léa Seydoux, and his ravenous dealers, led by Adrien Brody and the Culture and Arts editor, played by Tilda Swinton.""Revisions to a Manifesto,"" a chronicle of love and death on the barricades at the height of student revolt features Timothée Chalamet and Frances McDormand.And from the Fine Dining Section, ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner,"" a suspenseful tale of drugs, kidnapping and fine dining with journalist Roebuck Wright, played by Jeffrey Wright recounting the story to talk show host, played by Liv Schreiber.As the stories are weaved together, we travel with them as Howitzer interacts with his writers and staff, with his drool humor and attempts at bottom line pitches, at heart his journalistic skills supersede as he gently leads his writers to bring the best stories. Part publisher, part confessional, he hears all and see all and understands the humanity is the special ingredient that sells the magazine.Director Wes Anderson delivers with The French Dispatch a homage to the thrill of publishing and the notion that an audience somewhere actually finds the work appealing, interesting even, serves to energizes and rejuvenates writers to push the envelope.An ensemble cast of well-known talent inhabit each of the vignettes. His cast of characters are made up of the familiar, those we have seen in many of Anderson's films and those who are new to his avant-garde style and humor.The French Dispatch is slightly unusual and filled with oddities which pull the audience into these mini stories of life in a quickly changing world. Attention grabbing and distinctive Director Wes Anderson puts his unique signature on the world of publishing. It's a page turner.The French Dispatch opens Friday, October 22, 2021, exclusively in theaters.

113,bb_rose-29347,Pleasantly Surprised,9,4 November 2021,"Went in with pretty low expectations but ended up really liking it. Production design, costumes and the score was all very well done. All the actors involved also did an excellent job and the only issue I had with it was it felt a bit too long and on an emotional level I found it hard to connect with the charachters because there were just too many in my opinion. Even though I am not a die hard Wes Anderson fan, I always found myself enjoying the previous movies I have seen of his, like the Grand Budapest Hotel and Darjeeling Limited. The French Dispatch is about as Wes Anderson as your gonna get so I would not recommend this if you didn't like his previous films.",The French Dispatch
114,Qunjy,"All form, no substance",6,4 November 2021,"I wouldn't describe myself as a Wes Anderson fanboy, but his formula has occasionally worked on me. The Grand Budapest Hotel, for example, was one of my favorite movies of the decade.Unfortunately, TFD completely missed the mark for me. Visually, it is a feast for the eyes. But in terms of story I was completely unengaged. A new character is introduced in the usual Wes Anderson way every 28 seconds, so much so that I end up not caring or relating to them. And if you thought you could at least relate to the story if not to the characters, well too bad because by the time you get invested in one it's over and goes to the next chapter.The story takes place in the fictional city of Ennui-sur-Blasé, and was mostly shot in Angoulême, despite being more similar to Paris (as can be seen on the map in the Nescafier act). The choice of the name (literally bored-on-jaded) is perplexing to me, as the city described in the movie seems far from a boring place. But whatever, that's just they way Anderson names his places, one shouldn't put too much thought in it.The meat of the story is separated in three main acts.The first one was the best, due in no small part to the amazing performance of Del Toro.The second one I found pretty bad. Made even worse by the completely random logic behind the characters speaking French of English. It's bad enough when the American journalist and the French activist girl directly speak to each other in different languages. But it's even worse when Timothée Chalamet, who plays a French man, continuously responds in English when spoken to in French by his comrades. This is despite the fact that the actor can speak French in real life (and very well, at that) and could've easily been given a script in French.This completely took me out of the movie for a bit, thankfully there wasn't much to miss during that act.The last act was just... average. I thought the whole talk show aspect of it was completely unnecessary, and made the film feel even more bloated. There were a few fun scenes in there, like the shootout and the car chase, as well as Nescafier cooking for the mobsters.Come to think of it, there were fun scenes a bit everywhere, surrounded by 15 minutes of introductions and uninteresting conversations in the wrong language. There are smart movies I feel compelled to rewatch a second time despite not being a fan of it the first time before judging, but this one I just can't see anything hiding beneath, besides the first act which could be seen as an interesting take on the creative process.The rest of the movie just felt like an empty shell. A beautifully painted shell on the outside, however.",The French Dispatch

The characters are all joyless and similarly uninspiring, which if intended is a massive waste of so much talent.This film flicks between colour and black & white at seemingly random, presumably to add to the quirky vibe.It's as if the script is a creative writing essay struggling to hit the word count, stuffed with unnecessarily pompous waffle.I like Wes Anderson films usually, but this is beyond dull and absurdly pretentious without a cause.

121,izuniajablonska,Is The French Dispatch good? Yes.,9,24 October 2021,"Is The French Dispatch good?Yes.It is Wes Anderson and well it could be pretty self-explanatory, but if you really want to know, then, I could potentially tell you.The French Dispatch takes you on the adventure that is hiding beneath the words of... The French Dispatch, ""a factual weekly report on the subjects of world politics, the arts - high and low - and diverse stories of human interest"".The film then follows the three stories published in the magazine.""The Concrete Masterpiece"" written by J. K. L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton). Which centers around art (you have to decide for yourself if it is high or low), love and prison.""Revision to a Manifesto"" written by Lucinda Kremen (Frances McDorman, who was incredibly good in this movie). This story puts us in the middle of a youth revolution. There's teenager (or not entirely teenager) love, riots and a fight with the system.""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner"" by Roebuck Wright (Jefferey Wright). In this story we can mainly see food (and lots of it), kidnapping and a little ode to cartoon (which to be fair I was not the biggest fan of).I do not want to delve too much into each story, because thats just a very good way of giving away lots of spoilers. However, I do want to say a thing about the concept of the movie itself.Going into the screening I was a little skeptical, or maybe just unsure how will the three stories intertwine with each other. Granted, I saw other movies with similar concept - even the, beloved by many, Pulp Fiction is structured in three parts, however I was not sure how would it turn out in this movie.It is the least to say that I was satisfied with how it turned out. Wes Anderson, like always, makes the stories so interesting, so vivid, so of his own, that you once again feel like a child listening to those stories written in the books with amazing illustrations. The structure of the film made the Wes Anderson ""touch"" even stronger.What was also my main thought after leaving the theatre was how nice it is to watch a movie that touches upon, sometimes even very complex topics, but doesn't care to talk about it.In The French Dispatch we have topics like revolution, the judgment of what is good and not good in art, and so on. However that is not supposed to be the center of the viewers' attention. What is important is the chess play in between the riots, the preparation of the police dining or the halls of the police department. The vivid colors and the pleasing composition of everything, even the dead body floating in the river.Oh, and I would almost forgot - the cast is amazing. And the writing and the directing too, but I think (and hope you agree) that is a given if it comes to Wes Anderson.The one thing I didn't like - the outrageously small screen time for Edward Norton. But other than that - I have no complains.Go see that movie. The picture is a sensation.",The French Dispatch
122,mirjamvdkooij,"Amazing visuals, confusing storyline",7,23 October 2021,"Throughout the film of Wes Anders, the visuals and decors are really pretty a d stunning. However, the story is so hard to follow! This makes you wonder what's happening and at some point totally lost.",The French Dispatch
123,scrubentaft,Indulgent mess with good moments,5,26 October 2021,"Half a dozen elaborate and expensive set pieces in search of a story.Excited anticipation quickly turned to dismay and disappointment. Confused, rush-along script and many thrown away big set pieces. Wait! Stop! We were trying to take that in - oh - gone. Whimsical, thin, mocking storylines. Music score lazy, thin, repetitive, got very annoying.Some truly gorgeous art department work though, and great performances from Benicio Del Toro, Timothée Chalomet and especially Jeffrey Wright, who managed to finally breathe some human warmth into this overindulgent dog's dinner.",The French Dispatch
124,buchling-09716,Not for everyone,8,23 October 2021,"The style, the characters, the dialogue - Wes Anderson to the core. An absolute superb cast (as to be expected in an Anderson-Film). I loved the occasional switch from the general black-and-white to colour to give some shots a greater impact (sadly, BW also means that you don't get to see much of the stunning colours of the set). The mix of miniature, life action and animation was well-balanced and cleverly underlined the magazine-feeling of the entire film.That is in general its biggest strength: Watching this movie feels like reading one of the iconic articles in ""The New Yorker"". Anderson obviously adores the magazine and its journalistic legends and paints a picture of ideal journalism, that will definitely delight fans of print journalism. This goes so far that the last of the three main stories feels more like a portrait of the reporter Roebruck Wright (and its real-life counterpart James Baldwin) and not the story it tells.This brings us to the - in my opinion - biggest weakness of the film: Its middle part. The second part (starring Timothée Chalament, Lyna Khoudri and Frances McDormand - all three fantastic) tells the story of a student uprising. What every Wes Anderson-Film (and part one and three of this film) manages - creating quirky, weird but absolutely loveable characters - this one fails. The character of Lucinda Krementz (the reporter played by McDormand) has the problem less than the others, but overall, I had a hard time connecting with the characters on an emotional level. It wasn't bad per se, but in contrast with the first and third part, which very much superior, it looked bad and dragged down the rest of the movie with it.Conclusion: Looks amazing, stars an amazing cast, is amazing 75% of the time. Not for people with short-attention span. Not for people who don't like French culture. Definitely not for people who don't like Wes Anderson. For all others: A delightful treat. For fans of ""The New Yorker"" and journalism in general: Absolutely amazing.",The French Dispatch

Soporific to the extreme, even more leisurely than Steve Zizzou, the four segments never really get going and the fine ensemble are criminally underused.I nodded off during the prisoner artist segment a couple of times and seriously considered leaving the cinema before the end of the film but stuck it out and was mightily relieved when the end credits rolled.Such a shame as I love Wes Anderson's style, storytelling and cinematography but for me this was a massive miss.

There's a random mix of black and white, colour and animation which I found slightly annoying after a while. The first story was great, the second was good and the third I didn't like very much.

I went to the cinema with high expectations and I was bored by the middle of the film, and I'm not easily bored.The storys were vapid, the characters had no substance and all women were just there to be sexualized in some kind of way, they were either always naked or had sex with someone which makes me think if he needed that, to keep the film interesting for his audience. When you have a bad advertisement, you just put oversexualized women in it to make it ""appealing"". Had the same feeling with this movie.I liked all the art styles and references to old cinema but all in all it was just too much, so that nothing was outstanding anymore and I can't even recall all the artistic elements in it.Wes Anderson die hard Fans will say it's great.

And I still found this tedious.The French Dispatch hits every beat you would expect in a parody of his work - the very particular visuals, a who's who of famous actors and the trademark nostalgia - but none of the heart. Whilst the majority of the actors did a great job with what they were given, the script was weak, and the stories veered between unengaging and just messy, perhaps because far too much was crammed in. You're never given a real chance to bond with any of the characters, who are caricature like, or even the magazine itself.And I almost burst out laughing at the sheer absurdity (in a bad way) of a character that sounded like he was called Monsieur Nescafe. I mean come on.It felt like the equivalent of going to a high end restaurant and being given a beautiful meal that in no way satisfies your hunger. A film not made for the audience, but rather for Anderson's own indulgences, because he could.And whilst she looked great, and the art world is full of nakedness, the fully nude Lea Seydoux felt like an odd choice for this sort of film.I wanted to like this, I really did, but it just left me cold.

Almost all dialogues are short one-liners and none of the characters get a chance develop any real gravitas. Mélanie Thierry, Benicio Del Toro and Frances McDormand merely deliver a fraction of what they are capable of, while the rest of the all-star cast drown in the ""noise"". In particular, Bill Murray's role is inconsequential - a huge disappointment considering his potential and how he and Wes created fireworks in almost all their previous movies together.

That a youth rebellion must be made rather than youth rebellion happens is the tale.The third short film is the weakest and it is the visual art that makes it good otherwise it would be just be a retreading of a common tale told in film/tv.A rich man's boy is kidnapped and finally the child is recovered.Oh and it should have been the food article of magazine but oh well who wants to see a film of a food article?And there you see it's a film about a magazine.The usual crew of Wes Anderson are great.If you are a Wes Anderson fan please see this film.If you aren't then don't make this your first Wes Anderson movie.Alasdair Kelly.",The French Dispatch

144,leeora-83737,A feast for the eye,10,28 October 2021,Wow! I was blown away. Every scene is a visual treat. Wonderful actors. Wes Anderson at his best. A true masterpiece. Some of the stories are better than others but it doesn't matter. It's just a fun movie to watch.,The French Dispatch
145,gprusha,"Classic Wes, but not his best.",6,10 November 2021,"The French Dispatch was pretty good. Wes went all in on his style how regarding how the shots were set up. I almost wish that I was streaming it because I found my eyes scrambling to pick up all of the subtle details in each shot. The movie is more play-like than any of his previous films, (which is saying something).As far as the story/plot, it is broken into several smaller stories, (3 main ones), as opposed to a more singular overarching story. This means that some of the characters have limited screen time and in my opinion, made it difficult to get emotionally attached to any one character. The cast a huge and includes all of Anderson's regulars as well as some new faces, (including Timee). My favorite performances were from Frances McDormand and Adrien Brody.There was some comedy throughout the movie, however, it didn't get me laughing as much as some of his other films and I didn't walk away with any particular phrases to hold onto like I generally do. Perhaps a second viewing would change that.Overall, its worth a watch if for nothing else than for the incredible amount of artistic display featured. Classic Wes Anderson, but would not be included in my top 3 for him.6 Stars.",The French Dispatch
