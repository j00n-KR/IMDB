0,MartinHafer,Beautiful and weird,9,24 October 2005,"Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film with incredible stop motion camera-work AND a really stylish atmosphere. The characters are really captivating and just plain ""cool"". Halloween Town is also a visual delight. In almost every way I consider this a wonderful film. However, for people like me who are not particularly enamored with musicals, the music is definitely the low-point. It's not that the songs are bad, but that there are so many of them. The dialog is mostly sung and I found it detracted, slightly, from my viewing experience. However, considering that almost all the high school students I teach LOVE this movie, I certainly seem to have the minority opinion. So, for those who are not into musicals, still watch it--you'll enjoy it. But, like me you may also wish they'd done a few less numbers! PS--On the DVD, you also get FRANKENWEENIE (a half hour short) and VINCENT (also a short and the seeming inspiration for NBC). They make this a MUST-HAVE DVD.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
1,TheLittleSongbird,An animated classic? I think so!,10,20 December 2009,"I admit it, I really like Tim Burton. I know his films are very oddball, but he has a wide imagination and his films are visually amazing. And I like a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands being my personal favourite, and I love Batman and Batman Returns too. Henry Sellick is also promising, from the likes of James and the Giant Peach and Coraline. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a brilliant film. Is it an animated classic. Yes I think it is! It is wonderfully weird yet lots of fun as well. Visually and technically, the film looks absolutely amazing, with wonderful Gothic backgrounds and detailed colouring. Skellington silhouetted against the moonlight is quite possibly the film's most haunting image. The story is great, about Jack Skellington discovering ChristmasTown but doesn't understand the concept so he kidnaps Santa Claus. And the characters are endearing and weird, ranging from jazz playing zombies, Four-tenor like vampires to a wolf man. Then we have the title characters, Jack Skellington is a wonderful protagonist, really interesting to say the least. And Sally for an inventor's creation is very beautiful. The songs from Danny Elfman(the fact that he didn't get an award for his score for Edward Scissorhands is the biggest music snubs ever) are great fun, haunting, funny, clever and intelligent. The voice acting is top notch, Chris Sarandon does a great job as the speaking voice of Skellington, and Danny Elfman himself provides the singing voice superbly. Catherine O'Hara is sweet and innocent, and Ken Page(the voice of King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven) is a hoot as Oogie Boogie. All in all, weird, but visually stunning, funny and intelligent animated movie. A definite classic! 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Nightmare Before Christmas
2,Leofwine_draca,A unique animated viewing experience,6,4 September 2016,"A bizarre, in-your-face musical which boasts splendid stop-motion animation and an energy that never lets up, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas is a love-it or hate-it experience. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I could have endured much more beyond the final moments. The best thing about the film is its look, a darkly Gothic outing with plenty of bizarre characters (including the skeletal pumpkin king, a major with two faces, Oogie Boogie the monster, an old evil scientist and more) to love and hate along the way.The story is very light and appears to be stretched to breaking point, as Jack decides to become Santa Claus and wreaks havoc in his wake. The work of the voice actors is excellent – kudos to SPIDERMAN composer, Danny Elfman, here – and most of the songs are engaging and clever, although some veer on becoming twee. Still, a unique experience, definitely influenced by the presence of unorthodox producer Tim Burton.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
3,SnoopyStyle,fun original imaginative,9,3 June 2015,"Jack Skellington is the pumpkin king of Halloween Town. After another successful Halloween, he has grown tired of the monotonous constant sameness. He stumbles into a tree with a magical door which sends him to Christmas Town. He is so taken with Christmas that he tries explain it to his people. Only nobody really understands and he only has limited knowledge himself. Rag doll Sally loves Jack but fears his obsession will turn disastrous when he tries to take over Christmas. It is a wild world of imagination. It is a visual delight of macabre wonderfulness. It is childlike for the kids. It's outlandish for the adults. Jack is a charming character. This is fun and original.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
4,Hitchcoc,Finally Decided to Watch It,9,7 September 2017,"This is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tim Burton, purveyor of the wacko, has created, along with his amazing team, a real classic work. Seldom does a film bank on so much originality, from the incredible creation of Halloween Town, with its denizens, marvelous in their diversity and variety, to a really interesting plot. The character of Jack Skellington is a scene-stealer. Considering he pretty much a stick with a round, skeletal head, he has amazing expression and energy. He is an artist and a rebel, dissatisfied with the continuing shortsightedness of his frightening peers. When his world opens up through an accidental fall into another town, paralleling his own, he tries to bring Christmas back with him. The problem is that he really doesn't understand the concept well enough. He mixes his own social foundation with an alien one and the results are hilarious. Wonderful to look at with some of the finest animation you will ever see, each moment carefully scripted and produced.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
5,Horst_In_Translation,Not a nightmarish watch for audiences at all,6,10 December 2017,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is an American animated musical from 1993, so this pretty short film (75 minutes) has its 25th anniversary soon and it is the first full feature film directed by Henry Selick that younger audiences today know rather for Coraline than for this one here. It was nominated for an Oscar in the visual effects category, which is a rather rare achievement for a non live-action film (lost to Jurassic Park). And composer Danny Elfman was nominated for a Golden Globe for his score. I know him very well for his composing, but I was genuinely baffled by his amazing singing voice for the main character here. Great job. The script is (to some extent) by Tim Burton and if you have seen other stuff from him, you won't be surprised one bit. So this is a film that combines horror, animation, comedy and musical and that must be a pretty unique achievement. While I don't necessarily agree with the truly high rating here on IMDb, I would still say that it was a good watch overall. The fun perspective may be in the center of it all I guess, even if it is without a doubt a more creepy film than Coraline for the most part for example. So horror animation indeed.As for the story, horror is always difficult to combine with the spirit of Christmas. Even the classics like Grinch stuff etc. are hardly truly scary. And most filmmakers trying to combine these two have at best delivered something that could be considered a good guilty pleasure watch, but not a truly great film. Here they came pretty close. The fact how short the film is shows at times when we see for example how the villains are depicted left me a bit unimpressed. Sally's creator Finklestein was still somewhat decent and funny most of the time, even if severely underused, but the torturer near the end was pretty much completely forgettable to me. Nonetheless, one of the film's biggest strengths is the attention to detail. There are so so many characters presented in here that we find out almost nothing about, but they are interesting on a level where they could have deserved their own movie. As for the romance part, it was okay. It felt a bit rushed at times too and I would not call it a defining animation romance, but still it worked out fine and the last shot was kinda cute.The two central characters worked out nicely too all in all. The fact that Jack may not have been too interesting in looks, was more than made up by his singing parts. I would also like to add that his affection for Christmas is interesting to me as we may see his world as scary and creepy, but it's normal for everybody who lives there. That includes the funny two-faced mayor. The abnormal aspect is getting warmth, harmony and gifts in there. The thing we see as normal. And when the worlds collide, nothing is normal anymore (the police call scene e.g.). These worlds shall not be intertwined for the sake of everybody living in them. Pay attention to how adult human's faces are never seen in here. Santa doesn't count as he's Santa and not a human. Overall, I give this film a thumbs-up. It managed for the animation genre to be an unlikely success story with an approach/subject that has little to do with what you'd expect for Christmas. In one way or another like Die Hard. What else could I add? I think that is basically all. I think the style and animation will scare some away, but if you aren't one of them, then I believe you are in for a treat. It was a good film and I recommend checking it out. A bit of a shame it took me almost a quarter of a century to finally check it out. I also think that it is worth seeing more on a big screen than a small screen, so if you haven't seen it so far, wait for 2018 and make sure you catch a viewing when it may return to theaters as a 25th anniversary tribute. In any case, see it.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
6,classicsoncall,"""This year, Christmas will be ours!""",8,8 March 2018,"I was initially put off by the idea that this was a musical but I gradually grew into it. Not being a fan of animated films much either, it's taken me a long while to see this picture, a quarter century sounds a lot worse than twenty five years since the movie came out as I write this. I thought it very creatively done, as Tim Burton is quite adept at putting out these off-beat stories, ""Edward Scissorhands"" being a personal favorite. The tie-in between Halloween and Christmas is a nicely creative touch, with an eclectic appearance by the Easter Bunny providing a moment of humor. There's even a romance involved, even if Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King and Bone Daddy of Halloweentown is oblivious at the outset. The contrasting dark milieu of most of the setting is transformed whenever the Christmas motif takes over, visually stunning by comparison but it's the thing that makes spirits bright. I can't say that I'd make this film an annual holiday viewing, but you probably should see it at least one time to see what you're missing. You'll probably be as surprised as I was.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
7,gavin6942,"Great Film, But Probably Still Overrated",7,27 December 2012,"Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept.I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list.Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or ""Beetlejuice"". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?",The Nightmare Before Christmas
8,lee_eisenberg,It would be better were it not a musical.,6,25 August 2006,"First, I want to say that ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a very neat idea for a movie. If it comes from Tim Burton (although he just produces, not directs), then it's pretty much guaranteed that there's something cool in store. The idea of a land where there's only Halloween having Christmas one year while forcing Halloween on a land where there's only Christmas...a really cool concept. And it's worth seeing what the movie shows happening.Now for the unfortunate aspect. The excessive number of songs weakens the movie. I don't mind a song or two - or more in a Beatles movie - but it's just sort of hokey to have a song every five minutes in a movie that supposed to be macabre.So, if you see ""TNBC"", you can appreciate the concept, but you just might get put off by the musical aspect. Featuring the voices of Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara and Paul Reubens.So what did Santa bring YOU for Christmas?",The Nightmare Before Christmas
9,jboothmillard,Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas,10,13 September 2005,"Tim Burton is a genius at creating good fantasy film, e.g. Beetle Juice, Batman, Sleepy Hollow and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this film is best known as one of his masterpiece. He wrote the story, created the characters and idea and assisted directing (although it is uncredited). Basically this a story about based in a dark (obviously) fantasy world of Halloween. The leader of Halloween the tall and spindly Jack Skellington has got bored of Halloween over the many years and wants to experience something new. One day he walks to far in the forest and discovers many trees with special doors for each special occasion, e.g. thanks giving, easter. The one he was most attracted to was the door to Christmas town. After being there he decides he wants to create Christmas himself himself, seen through the eyes of Halloween. If you think about it, this is nearly like the A Christmas Carol and The Grinch mixed together. Filled with excellent music and singing by Danny Elfman himself this is the essential Christmas musical. Starring Chris Sarandon as Jack Skellington, Danny Elfman singing as Jack, Catherine O'Hara as Sally, William Hickey as Evil Scientist and Ed Ivory as Santa. In 2006 it was re-released in 3D. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Elfman. It was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
10,Woodyanders,Simply delightful,9,15 April 2010,"Leave it to the wildly imaginative Tim Burton to come up with the brilliant idea of combining the radically contrasting holidays of Christmas and Halloween into a single hugely creative and entertaining movie that's done with a considerable amount of genuine heart and loads of cheerfully morbid dark humor. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, is bored with celebrating October 31st all the time. So Jack decides to take a crack at Christmas instead with predictably disastrous results. Director Henry Selick, working with a bright script by Caroline Thompson and Michael McDowell, does an expert job of vividly realizing an utterly believable and enchanting fantasy world populated with colorful oddball characters and a truly enchanting sense of pure wonder. This world and its kooky inhabitants possess a playfully macabre charm uniquely its own; the whole thing has a certain endearing quirky appeal that's impossible to either resist or dislike. The cast voice the characters with immensely infectious enthusiasm: Danny Elfman provides the glorious singing voice of Jack (Elfman also did the terrifically robust score and wrote the highly catchy and witty lyrics for the songs), Chris Sarandon acquits himself well as Jack's distinguished speaking voice, plus there's sturdy contributions from Catherine O'Hara as sweet, smitten, sensible ragdoll Sally, William Hickey as marvelously grotesque crippled scientist Dr. Finklestein, Glenn Shadix as the jolly and hearty two-faced mayor, and Ken Page as supremely mean and evil ghost villain Oogie Boogie. Inspired moments abound: Jack gamely trying (and failing) to explain the concept of Christmas to the creepy citizens of Halloween Town, a gang of wicked brats accidentally abducting the Easter Bunny, and Jack's hilariously twisted mess that he makes of the merry yuletide season. The stop-motion animation is exquisitely fluid, dynamic, and convincing. Pete Kozachik's crisp cinematography makes the picture positively beautiful to look at. Better still, we even get a relevant message about sticking to what you know and do best. Why, there's also a pleasant love story between Jack and Sally to give the film extra poignancy. A total treat.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
11,ccthemovieman-1,Inventive But Unappealing Film,4,16 April 2006,"I just never found this story to be appealing, and I gave it several chances as I usually find Tim Burton movies visual feasts and interesting, even if I don't agree with his bias.Maybe I never was comfortable with an animated film being so dark. Even some of the songs had dark and mean-spirited lyrics. It did get better after the first 45 minutes with ""Jack"" trying to be Santa Claus but delivering the wrong kind of toys. Santa Claus won out in the end, which was good to see, and there was a nice little romantic ending between Jack and ""Sally."" It's an inventive film, to be sure, with a lot of clever animation, especially for its day (it's now over a dozen years old) but I just got too many bad vibes watching this. Sorry. There are lighter, nicer animated films - at least for kids - to watch than this.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
12,Tweekums,Utterly Enchanting,10,22 July 2008,"This film is utterly delightful and can be watched over and over without ever getting stale. As one would expect from a film from Tim Burton it is darker than most animation. The sets and character designs for the inhabitants of Halloween Town are suitably macabre without being too scary for children to watch. Almost all of the characters are well intentioned despite being rather strange, the only exceptions are Oogie Boogie and his three side-kicks Lock, Shock and Barrel.The story begins the night after Halloween when Jack Skellington, the organiser of the festivities is feeling down, despite its success as he is fed up of doing the same thing year after year. He leaves town to do for a walk with his ghost of a dog and stumbles across a strange wood where the trees contain doorways to the other holiday towns. He is drawn through the one that leads to Christmas Town and is enchanted by the strange world he has discovered.Once back home he tells everybody what he has seen then sets about understanding what Christmas is all about. After much experimentation he decides that this year the people of Halloween Town will organise Christmas, soon the townspeople are eagerly making presents and Jack has dispatched Lock, Shock and Barrel to go to Christmas Town to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"". The only voice of doubt is Sally, a rag doll who has strong unrequited feelings for Jack. Not surprisingly things don't exactly go according to plan.This is a film I would recommend to everybody, especially fans of animation or musicals, although the songs are aren't as up beat as most musicals I suspect you'll still be humming the tunes to yourself after it is over. While this is a Tim Burton Film one mustn't forget that is was directed by Henry Selick who did a wonderful job with the stop-motion animation, Danny Elfman must also be remembered as he wrote all the music to this excellent film.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
13,ma-cortes,"Sympathetic, fun though macabre movie relying on a wonderful painstaking stop-motion technique",7,30 December 2019,"Very amusing and well made stop-motion animation film, competently realized by Henry Selick and financed by Tim Burton . It revolves around Jack Skellington, the sympathetic Mayor , he is the unlikely pumpkin King of the dangerously weird city of Halloweentown. He is boring of the same old routine of making people scream every Octuber 13 and to the dismay of the fellow monsters who inhabite the town. Boring with his annual Halloween he sets out to encounter something better and accidentally discovers the happy Christmas town whose goings-on so enchant him and for envy, he then has a phenomenal idea : to stand in for Santa this Christmas. It results in his decision to abduct Santa with unexpected consequences. As the demons trick or treaters : Lock, Stock and Barrel take Santa, but this one eventually goes to Boogey Man. Then Jack Skeffington along with his spooky friends determine to take over the work of the head honcho there, one Santa Claws. Jack riding on reindeers skeletons goes to Christmas town giving surprising, eerie and creepy gifts to children.
This is a fun, entertaining and ingenious stuff with some creepy touches, magic as well as funny elements, but ponderously paced in keeping with rather rousing musical score. An original fairy tale with an amazing screenplay by Caroline Thompson from roles and story created by Tim Burton. It took more than two years to shot with a perfect technique by means of stop-motion. Not cuddly, best appreciated by those with a feel for the sinister. Fast paced is maintained throughout by the equally breathless, lively soundtrack masterfully composed by the great musician Danny Elffman who sings some sings, too . Including known voices Catherine O'hara, Chris Sarandon, Paul Reubens, William Hickey, and Danny Elffman himself. It is a really amusing film that kiddies and adults with a sense of the bizarre enjoy very much.The picture was financed by Tim Burton who was an animator trainee at Walt Disney productions. Burton came up with his adventurous idea but could not get it made, subsequent directorial hits brought more clout. Burton also produced or directed other fims in similar style as Frankenweenie and Corpse Bride. Burton hired Henry Selick who made a very competent direction who equally directed Monkeybone, Caromine and James and the giant peach.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
14,moonspinner55,Exquisitely-detailed ghoul-fest,6,6 August 2006,"Stop-motion animation technique brings life to tale of Halloweentown, whose residents get bitten by the Christmas bug and move into Santa's territory. Co-producer Tim Burton, who also conceived the story, obviously loved the Rankin/Bass holiday specials from television, smoothly updating those productions with modern razzle-dazzle, creating amusingly ghoulish creatures who glide across the screen fluidly. The only area of the film that needed strengthening was the story, which falls flat in places and is particularly mean to poor Santa Claus (although kids didn't much notice or care). Henry Selick's direction is lively and Danny Elfman (the singing voice of the Pumpkin King) composed a wonderful song-score. Fun for game adults and older children. **1/2 from ****",The Nightmare Before Christmas
15,paul_haakonsen,"Entertaining, fun and lots of spirit...",7,4 December 2019,"This stop-motion-animated movie from 1993 that came from the crazed mind of Tim Burton is indeed a classic unto its own right. And it is one that should be watched just around the Christmas holidays.The story is pretty good, and it has an abundance of absurdity to it that just makes it so lovable and fun to watch. The story, shortly summarized, is about Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, whom has grown weary of the same routine year after year. He stumbled upon a doorway to Christmas Town, and comes to see things in a whole new light.Now, there is an abundance of singing and dancing, while it is still stop-motion-animation, here, so it might not be in just everyone's taste. But most of the songs quickly grow on you and some are downright catchy ear-hangers. Especially the theme song, now who can't claim to be able to sing along to that one?The characters in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is an abundance of memorable characters, each with very unique and memorable features and traits. Which definitely helps putting character and flavor to the movie.The voice acting in the movie is good, and they have a good ensemble of talented performers to do the various roles and characters, such as Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Glenn Shadix , Paul Reubens, Ken Page and Catherine O'Hara.The style of characters and sets/scenes is just fabulous. It is very much in the archetypical spirit that we know from Tim Burtons movies, with lots of dark, gritty colors, crooked things, outstanding and memorable things. It is hard to detail, but once you see it you know what I am talking about.Keep in mind that the theme and the majority of all scenes are dark and may contain elements that might be deemed scary or disturbing to very young viewers. But it is all in the spirit of Halloween, so it shouldn't really be a big deal.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a movie that finds its way to my media player once every year around December. And this year I introduced my 9 year old son to it. And he liked it too.My rating of this 1993 Burton classic is a seven out of ten stars.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
16,Quinoa1984,"One of the best films of 1993, highly re-watchable",10,14 December 2003,"I was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn't scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.

17,tavm,Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous spooky good time!,8,8 November 2007,"Saw The Nightmare Before Christmas a couple of days ago with a friend who was a little down in the dumps. Neither of us had seen this before so it was a pleasant surprise for both of us as we put on our 3-D glasses to watch Tim Burton's classic stop-motion animated film. Technically, Burton didn't direct this since he was busy making Batman Returns at the time but even with Henry Selick listed as director you can see Tim's hand-prints in every frame. With a voice cast that includes Paul Reubens (as Lock), Catherine O'Hara (as heroine Sally and Shock), William Hickey (as Dr. Finkelstein), Chris Sarandon (as leading character Jack Skellington), Ken Page (as the scene stealing Ooogie Boogie), and Danny Elfman, who's also composer of the movie's songs (as the singing voice of Skellington, Barrel, and the Clown with the Tear away Face), this is one of the most humorously spooky movies I've ever seen. What Jack does to Christmas, you have to see to believe! While the 3-D was impressive in the beginning, I forgot about it after a while and just let the story and music entertain me. My favorite part concerned the Halloweentown band trying to do their version of ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" which ends up sounding pretty somber! So for anyone interested in Burton's version of a Holloween/Christmas hybrid, The Nightmare Before Christmas may be for you!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
18,Coventry,The biggest fun a movie can give you !!!,9,2 October 2003,"I hate myself...This movie has been out since TEN years and I never bothered to watch it earlier. ""Totally not my style"" I thought. Well, I've seldom been more wrong...This movie is everybody's style !!! I think I'll start watching it every year now on the 24th of december...( What can I say, I'm a traditional person :-D ) No seriously, I loved this movie. It gave me a warm feeling, plenty of laughs and a good old portion of sentiment. Heck, I even almost caught myself on singing along. I can assure you this means something !Actually, it's one of the few times the singing in a movie isn't annoying. Tim Burton's style is well presented in this story. Only he can tell a fairy-tale in such a macabre and morbid way. The atmosphere comes very close to that other masterpiece of his, Edward Scissorhands. The coorporation with Danny Elfman only makes the whole finished project more terrific.SPOILERS !!!!!!!!! The story is about Jack Skellington. The pumpkin-king of Halloween town. In this cute little world, a large amount of horrible creatures prepare the celebration of Halloween. After the annual holiday, Jack is a bit disappointed and takes a long walk. He ends up in Christmas town. This village is similar to Halloween town only they're responsible for the preparation of Christmas. Jack is so enthusiast about this that he wants to introduce this idea in Halloween town. Jack is set to replace ""Santa Claws"" and he will ride out to give presents to the children on Christmas evening! END SPOILERS !!!!!!! The characters in this wonderful story are very memorable. The wicked Dr. Finklestein on top. He looks like an evil version of Duckman and he opens his metal skull to scratch his brains. Very funny ! The female he created, Sally, is adorable and she's the greatest tribute to ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" I've ever seen. Many other great references to classic horror films and I always appreciate things like that. The Boogieman, the Mayor, the witch...all these characters deserve their share of credit but I think I'll just stop here and finish by saying that this movie is highly recommended. Favorite ""rewind""-scene: Jack tries to explain the concept of Christmas to rest of his town through a song. They don't see the whole point of it and wonder why this whole thing doesn't involve death or horror. Hilarious !!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
19,sunwarrior13,A Tim Burton Film,10,23 October 2012,"For those who never thought Disney would release a film in which Santa Claus is kidnapped and tortured, well, here it is. The title is Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, which should give you an idea of the tone of this stop-action animated musical/fantasy/horror/comedy. It is based on characters created by Burton himself.It tells the story of Jack Skellington, a being from ""Halloween Town"" who opens a portal to ""Christmas Town"" and decides to celebrate the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the film score and provided the singing voice of Jack, as well as other minor characters. The remaining principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page and Glenn Shadix.Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of Santa Claus. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Jack assigns Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town. Against Jack's wishes and largely for their amusement, the trio deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake.Christmas Eve arrives and Sally attempts to stop Jack with fog, but he embarks into the sky on a coffin-like sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, guided by the glowing nose of his ghost dog Zero. He begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts only terrify the recipients. Jack is believed to be an impostor attempting to imitate Santa, and the military goes on alert to blast him out of the sky. The sleigh is shot down and he is presumed dead by Halloween Town's citizens, but in fact he has survived the crash, landing in a cemetery. Although he is depressed by the failure of his plan, he quickly regains his old spirit, having come up with new ideas for next Halloween. He then rushes back home to rescue Santa and put things right.Meanwhile, Sally attempts to free Santa, but is captured by Oogie. Jack slips into the lair and frees them, then confronts Oogie and unravels his outer covering to spill out all the bugs that live inside him. With Oogie gone, Santa reprimands Jack before setting off to deliver the right presents to the world's children. He makes snow fall over Halloween Town to show that there are no hard feelings between himself and Jack; the townspeople are confused by the snow at first, but soon begin to play happily in it. Jack reveals that he is attracted to Sally just as she is to him, and they kiss under the full moon in the cemetery.A stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.This cautionary fable may be a little too twisted for little kids but anyone 8 or older will spot the friendly glint behind jack's empty eye sockets.But nevertheless,it is a work of grand visual wit, clever songs, funny gags and genuine pathos, it is perhaps the greatest stop-motion animated film ever, a painstaking style of model animation that computers have all but completely done away with.The dazzling techniques employed here create a striking look that's never been seen in such sustained form, making this a unique curio that will appeal to kids and film enthusiasts alike.Finally,Tim Burton magic with just a touch of scariness that it makes it a must-see.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Therefore, when he returns to Halloween Town, he implores his fellow citizens to come up with their own version of Christmas. As one is likely to imagine, he doesn't quite ""get it"", at least when it comes to his idea of good gifts. To add to the situation, Santa Claus (who Jack and others think is named Sandy Claws) is abducted, and when Jack fills his place, chaos erupts.Producer Tim Burtons' imagination is in full bloom here, and is vividly realized by director Henry Selick. The animation is slick and gorgeous. There are a wealth of stylish visuals, both in Halloween Town and Christmas Town. The characters and their designs are delightful, from Jack to Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara) to the evil scientist (voice of William Hickey) to the fiendish Oogie Boogie (voice of Ken Page). Caroline Thompson (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Corpse Bride""), wrote the screenplay, with Michael McDowell (""Beetlejuice"", ""Tales from the Darkside: The Movie)"" credited with the adaptation. Another frequent Burton collaborator, Danny Elfman, supplies the many catchy songs (this viewers' favourites are ""What's This"" and ""Oogie Boogie's Song"") and also performs the lovely singing voice of Jack. The eclectic cast also includes Glenn Shadix (who voices the mayor) and Paul ""Pee-wee Herman"" Reubens (who voices Lock).Some younger children may not take to a lot of the more freakish designs and characters, but otherwise this is fine family viewing, with a fairly trim story and running time (77 minutes all told).One point of interest for people may be deciding whether to watch this during the Halloween season, the Christmas season, or both, for that matter.Eight out of 10.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
21,Doylenf,The Pumpkin King that stole Christmas...,7,4 May 2007,"Since Tim Burton is the very definition of the word ""weird"", it's no surprise to me that THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (which I resisted seeing up until now), is richly imaginative and entertaining in the way it puts a special twist on the holiday spirit of Halloween and Christmas.Instead of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, we have The Pumpkin King (Jack) bringing horror to the Yuletide holidays and kiddies everywhere by riding Santa's sleigh and depositing horrific toys to frighten kids in a manner usually reserved for Halloween. Of course, in the end, the real Santa is allowed to reappear (after being held hostage) and allowed to bring his special brand of cheer to a world momentarily deprived of Santa and his toys.It's all richly dark and scary (for kids), imaginative, and visually stunning with so much to watch at any given moment that it becomes almost a strain on the eyes to follow all the cleverness accurately without a pause for breath. In other words, it's what I would call a very ""busy"" film, but certainly an enjoyable one if you're in the mood for quality animation of this kind (stop-motion models).All I can say is the Disney studios never released anything remotely like this sort of dark fantasy when I was a kid, when everything was geared more to the lighter side with darkness only rearing up in the form of witches or dragons--and the songs were simple, catchy tunes that people could sing afterwards. That, for me, is the big drawback here. Danny Elfman's songs are devoid of any special sort of charm and certainly can't be called memorable. They work within the context of this story, but not apart from it.Nevertheless, this is undoubtedly a richly imaginative piece of animated art and well worth viewing whether young or old.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
22,preppy-3,Very inventive,8,11 February 2008,"A stop motion animation musical conceived by Tim Burton.

He wants to run Christmas too but just doesn't realize that Christmas isn't Halloween. Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara), a stitched together creation, realizes that Jack is wrong and tries to stop him.Bizarre movie (to say the least) but a definite one of a kind. The stop motion animation is beautifully done and some of the visuals are incredibly inventive and effective. Also the songs and music (by Danny Elfman) are lots of fun and perfectly fit the movie. The ""Boogie Oggie"" number is a highlight. My only problem with this is a problem I have with other Tim Burton films--it's a bit too dark. I know Burton likes it that way, but this is aimed at kids and I can see some of the younger ones easily being scared of this. Still it's tuneful and there's always something to look at. Also it doesn't overstay its welcome at about 75 minutes. I give it an 8.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
23,poolandrews,Terrific animated fantasy film.,7,23 December 2006,"The Nightmare Before Christmas starts on Halloween night in Halloween town where Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon & Danny Elfman) & the various other inhabitants of Halloween town are celebrating another highly successful night, however the celebration is tinged with sadness for Jack as he has become bored with Halloween. While out walking in the woods Jack comes across a doorway which leads to Christmas town where the inhabitants are busy preparing for Christmas day in less than two months time. Jack is enthralled & captivated by what he sees & is determined to add his own ghoulish touch to the festive celebrations, Jack manages to convince his fellow Halloween town inhabitants to help him in his audacious plan including the kidnapping of Santa Claus & the making of lots of twisted Christmas presents that he intends to deliver himself on Christmas Eve...Directed by Henry Selick The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those magical children films that should be enjoyed by kids of all ages, well possibly... The script by Caroline Thompson was based on a story by fantasy filmmaker Tim Burton & at only 75 odd minutes in length the youngster's won't get bored. The Nightmare Before Christmas is hard to categorise, it's certainly a children's film but it has a twisted dark edge to it although not a sinister or nasty one, is it a film for Christmas or a film for Halloween? I'd say it's smack bang somewhere between the two, I'd also say it's a throughly entertaining, charming & delightful film that really should appeal to the kid in all of us. Most of the film revolve around it's cool songs which show plenty of imagination, are pretty catchy & they actually help drive the story forward. I did feel it was a little compromised at times as it tried to walk the line between family entertainment & it's dark twisted side & it's not that mainstream so unfortunately maybe not quite everyone will appreciate it. The character's are both imaginative & decent enough & there are some fab musical numbers in it.Director Selnick does a good job but maybe it's the actual animator's which deserve more of the credit. The first thing to say is that The Nightmare Before Christmas is an almost completely stop-motion animated film where model puppets are shot one frame at a time together with some CGI & each character is brilliantly brought to life, from the main star Jack to even the lesser character's like the Vampires everyone is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail, tremendous care & great personality. The sets are also fantastic, from the spooky Halloween town to the bright Christmas town The Nightmare Before Christmas looks beautiful throughout & is a technical marvel. Brilliant stuff all the way & there are some truly fantastic scenes & set-pieces in here.With a supposed budget of about $18,000,000 I must admit that sounded a lot of money to me although I don't really have much of an idea of how much something like this would have cost, technically it's faultless & it's as simple & straight forward as that. It was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects but lost out to Jurassic Park (1993) which is fair enough I suppose... The songs are well delivered & are very well written. The voice acting is good & each character really does have their own personality, you'll love each & every one of them.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a top quality film & as far as I'm concerned there's no doubt about that but I'm not sure it has great replay potential & it's with a slightly heavy heart that I also think it's not a film for everyone, definitely recommended all the same though. Re-released in 2006 in a computerised 3D version into digital 3D theatres, whatever they are...",The Nightmare Before Christmas
24,CinemaSerf,Dark Magic and Christmas fear!!!,7,7 November 2020,"This is a cracking animation fantasy centring around ""Jack Skellington"" - the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. When he feels all just a bit deflated after one celebration, he happens upon Christmas Town and encounters Santa Claus preparing to bring jolity and happiness. ""Jack"" sends a few of his rather stupid henchmen to kidnap Santa, takes his place and proceeds to deliver Christmas gifts that... well... are not exactly typical. Can Santa be rescued in time?? The animation is wonderfully detailed, dark and enjoyable with plenty of characters including a mad scientist as well as a mummy, the two-faced mayor and plenty of witches and demons. Not for the first time, Tim Burton shows a visionary imagination that I couldn't help but smile at - and coupled with a marvellous score (and lead vocal) from Danny Elfman we are presented with a thoroughly engaging Christmas story with a bit of a twist. Interesting that in the cinema recently, it struggled to hold the attention of the youngsters which was a shame.

However, for Jack it is just more of the same, and is becoming boring. Then he stumbles across Christmastown...Reasonably good fun. I don't care about Halloween so much of the ghoulishness in the background was wasted on me. However, the whole ghouls-take-over-Christmas theme was quite original and lead to some quite funny moments. The music generally keeps the movie rollicking along and it is quite short, thus does not overstay its welcome. On the negative side, the plot does seem rather random and silly at times.

26,Boba_Fett1138,A great achievement but could had been way more entertaining.,7,16 October 2005,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a perfectly professionally made movie with almost flawless looking stop-motion animation. However as entertainment this movie is flawed, due to its simple story and a pace that is a bit too fast for the movie.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has some highly fun and amusing characters in it and that also is the strongest thing of the movie. Jack Skellington is a nice and memorable main character but it is the Mayor that mostly steals the show in this movie. The movie is filled with tons of odd looking- and acting monstrous characters. Oogie Boogie is a cool villain but he unfortunately doesn't get an awful lot to do in this movie. The characters are fun but the movie itself isn't halve as much as fun. There are just a few laughs in it and in general the movie is simply too short. Because the movie is so short all of the scene's come and go too fast after each other. The story is told too fast and because of that things aren't always build up nicely or correctly. Because of this there also are some plot holes in the movie. The movie should had been maybe at least 10-15 minutes longer. It makes ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" a bit of a movie that is most certainly not bad but has many missed opportunities in it.Even though the movie isn't directed by Tim Burton himself, it still has 'Tim Burton' written all over it. The visual style and characters are definitely Burton material. There is plenty to enjoy for his fans, in this movie. The music and songs by Danny Elfman are also what gives this movie a 'Burton' kind of feeling and atmosphere. The music by Elfman is good and the songs, even though no Oscar material, are enjoyable and quite memorable as well.It certainly is a professionally made and good looking movie but the story could had used some more work and the movie should had been longer, to build up the scene's and characters better. It still is an enjoyable movie to watch but it could and should had been way more entertaining.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Nightmare Before Christmas

28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,From the imagination of Tim Burton,8,24 June 2006,"I have seen (too) few of Tim Burton's films; Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow and the two first Batman films... all of them display dazzling visuals, Gothic style and an eery mood. I try to search out as many of his works as I can find, but they are hard to come by in my area. Therefore I was happy to find that a friend of mine had this to loan me. Burton created an amazing, enthralling and engaging world here. Never having been terribly into Christmas and never having celebrated Halloween(not being American), this movie had less impact on me than it would most viewers, I guess. The character of Jack Skellington (and his conflict) was an interesting one. I've never been terribly into musicals, but this one really had me intrigued and watching closely. The score by Danny Elfman is excellent. The plot moves along nicely, never losing your interest. The dark, Gothic tone of the film is incredibly absorbing. Though Tim didn't himself direct this(due to his commitment to the second Batman movie), but you can tell his involvement in the creative process. His influence is unmistakably visible in each shot. The colorful(or colorless, depending on how you look at it) characters are plentiful, diverse and fascinating. The DVD features a good commentary by Henry Selick, the director, and Pete Kozachik, the director of photography, and it has a lot of interesting information on the animation process. Lighting and production values are exceptional. So rich color palettes were used to create all of these vastly different worlds within the film. I remember watching most, if not all, of this a few years ago, at Christmas, as it was aired here... though upon watching it this time, I realized that I could remember very little of it. I doubt I 'got it' back then, and to be honest, I'm afraid I may not have, this time, either. Still an enjoyable fable, playing with the two holiday celebrations, and a creative thrill-ride from start to finish. I recommend this to all fans of Tim Burton, Gothic style and animation. 8/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

When he comes across Christmas Town he has the idea that maybe he could create the same type of atmosphere in Halloween Town and deliver Christmas just like Christmas Town does.We're treated to many ballads as the Halloween version of a Christmas plot unfolds. We're reminded of the follies that accompany good intentions and naivete. And we're reminded of being appreciative. This dark musical comedy has Tim Burton's stamp all over it.

This ain't your standard Disney fare, but is rather a morbid and hilarious movie that I watch every Halloween season. The songs by Danny Elfman seem so-so upon a first listen, but they get better on multiple viewings too.

31,AlsExGal,Artfully combines two very different holidays,9,19 October 2010,"Who would ever think that a musical about the overlap between Halloween and Christmas would work? However, it does work with the songs not exactly being Christmas - or Halloween - classics, but fitting the dark mood of this film perfectly.The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace ""Sandy Claws"" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -""I'm only an elected official here! I can't make decisions!"" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is ""You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having."" You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as ""Beetlejuice"". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
32,ferguson-6,The Pumpkin King,8,20 December 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Somehow it's been a full 20 years since this groundbreaking film was released. It's a rare combination of cult and holiday, and even all these years later, it's incredibly entertaining. It shouldn't surprise anyone that the lead character is a societal misfit who means well. After all, the story is based on a Tim Burton poem.While watching the film, what strikes me is that this was a totally unique and creative world designed by Burton and director Henry Selick. Mr. Selick is a stop-motion expert known also for Coraline (Oscar nominated) and James and the Giant Peach. Complimenting the fantastical look and characters are the witty songs penned by Danny Elfman. Mr. Elfman is now one of the most prolific and successful composers working in the movie industry. At the time, he was better known as the front man for the party band Oingo Boingo (his Batman score changed that!).Since Pixar took over the animated world, we have come to expect major stars as voice actors. In Halloween Town, we instead get Danny Elfman (singing) and Chris Sarandon (speaking) teaming up for Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Catherine O'Hara is effective as Sally, Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman) stands out as Lock (of Lock, Shock and Barrel). The two most outstanding voice performances come from the late William Hickey as Dr Finkelstein (mad scientist), and Broadway star Ken Page as bad guy (and worm-infested) Oogie Boogie.There has been debate on whether this is best served as a Halloween movie or Christmas movie. The desire and hope to bring positive change to the world seems to fit the Christmas spirit, but the goblins and ghouls are sure to provide a nice scare for young kids. Especially fun are the ""new toys"" created by the work crews in Halloween Town as they prepare for a good will holiday they don't quite understand.Whatever your preferred time of year, this one is to be appreciated for it's creative look and imaginative story and songs. Rather than being created to sell toys, this 3 year production changed the standards for animation films ... that's the gift that keeps giving every year!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

34,The_Void,Superb Gothic animation with a thin plot,7,7 November 2004,"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is a visually spectacular tour de force of Gothic styles and themes, bound around a simple children's tale. The story follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween Town, who one day while walking in the woods stumbles upon Christmas Town; a town where, you guessed it, every day is Christmas. Jack doesn't quite understand the concept of a celebration where nobody is frightened or killed, but he decides to have the celebration in his town regardless. While plotting, he also decides to kidnap Santa and deliver Christmas Town's gifts himself this year...much to the dismay of the local children, who aren't too pleased about receiving the gifts that a skeleton from Halloween Town brings them...This movie was actually directed by Henry Sellick, but it is obviously Tim Burton's film. His style is rampant throughout the film, and it is clear that this could only have come from his mind. The animation on display here is magnificent; the style is very unique and it blends very well with the Gothic theme. Where the film falls down, however, is on the story side and, more notably, the delivery of the story. The story is very linear; I understand that this film is predominantly aimed at children, but even children's films can be more expansive than this; the film also really should be more expansive as Tim Burton has created a whole world with many unique and interesting characters, yet only a handful are allowed to shine. Burton (and his composer, Elfman) seem far too keen to pack the movie with songs. I have no problem with this, but the songs here are really rather dull. The majority of them have little more than one or two lines that are sung over and over and considering that the film is packed with these songs; it gets old fast and more dialogue would have worked better.Overall, Nightmare Before Christmas is a nice film. The animation and style are amazing and it has lots of nice moments; but it is let down by a thin story and poor delivery. Horror fans will have fun spotting the tributes, and I don't doubt that many children will love this film, as will many adults; but it could and really should have been a lot better, and I have to say that it left me cold.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
35,Mr-Fusion,Christmas Town? Hmmm . . .,7,20 December 2014,"No one saw THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas securing a solid pop culture standing, but it certainly has. And that makes me happy. There's some unexpected heart to this movie - at the very least on a technical level (you can see it was a labor of live with the staggering attention to detail and amazingly fluid animation, particularly in Jack's spindly limbs). And I love that, at its core, it's about a misguided scare king trying to extrapolate the meaning of Christmas from its various parts (complete with a scene in the lab). To top that off, it all goes horribly wrong. How often do you see Santa totally pi**ed? This is a winner for its songs alone, but it's also a high watermark in stop-motion animation.

Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town"". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it.

It used to boast, ""From producer Tim Burton!"" and his influence is very clear - extremely Gothic visuals. And, for a children's tale, some pretty scary stuff! Overall this is style over substance, as are most films associated with Burton. He rarely delivers great stories and instead relies on fairytale clichés (Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, etc.).There's nothing wrong with this. It works because his films are so nice to look at.This is a fun movie with good visuals and an interesting twist on a familiar tale.

40,sddavis63,Memorably Quirky But Lacking In Substance,3,4 January 2012,"Tim Burton has a history of putting out as either producer or director (he's the producer here) of rather quirky movies, and this may well be his quirkiest. Quirky it definitely is, and unique and original as well. But one can't give a lot of points just for being originally quirky. Somewhere along the way a movie has to entertain; it has to have a strong plot. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (as intriguing as it is) doesn't do that. There's enough here in terms of story to make maybe a 10-15 minute short film. Stretching it out for over an hour and a quarter is too much. I found the whole thing got tiresome rather quickly.The story revolves around the character of Jack Skellington - a skeleton inhabiting an animated nightmare of a place called Halloween Town. Halloween Town - as the name implies - is totally fixated on Halloween. October 31 is its one and only reason for existing, and it's appropriately populated by a collection of ghosts, goblins and various and assorted other monsters, including Jack - a skeleton who is the pumpkin king. But Jack one night accidentally falls through a door in a tree and discovers Christmas Town - a place as fixated on Christmas as Halloween Town is on Halloween. Fixated by the idea Jack returns home with tales of the place and then chooses to return to kidnap Santa Claus, and then takes his place on Christmas Eve, delivering ghoulish Christmas presents to boys and girls around the world. But when he discovers that his presents haven't brought the joy that the real Santa's presents bring, he resolves to fix things by returning the real Santa to his rightful place, while he returns to his place as pumpkin king.I realize there's an important message here about being yourself, and not pretending to be something that you're not. And watching this and its assortment of memorable characters is certainly an experience. I just didn't think that it made for a very good feature film. (3/10)",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Then suddenly he is sucked into this magical place called Christmastown, where everything is happy and merry, and he learns of the existence of Santa Claus, who brings joy and happiness to the children on Christmas Day. His heart filled with a wonderful new feeling, he has Santa kidnapped and with his own Santa costume goes back into Christmastown to take his place. But it doesn't quite work out...With all the big hit animation films Pixar bring out nowadays, some may have forgotten this little family film from Touchstone Pictures that came out nearly 15 years ago. With all the wonderful films Pixar bring out now and all the amazing things they can do, it just leaves you feeling that this never got all the appreciation it deserved at the time.This is a wonderfully dark, twisted tale that could only have come from the mind of Tim Burton. He's tried to make a more family themed film with this, using a peculiar type of animation instead of filming it live. They use a similar type in the new Lloyd's TSB ads and it certainly works for the theme of this film.It's more for kids, of course, but grown ups will still appreciate the fine work on display from all involved. Some complained at the time it may have been too scary for kids but there's nothing overly unpleasant here that can't be explained away to young minds. Looking back, and seeing what they can do today, it's quite a work to behold. *****",The Nightmare Before Christmas
43,Pjtaylor-96-138044,'Twas the night before Christmas and one thing was certain: everyone thought this was directed by Burton.,6,24 December 2018,"'The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)' is perhaps the only example of both a Halloween and a Christmas movie all in one (as well as being one of the only true examples of the former). It's a splendidly strange stop-motion musical that blends the horrific with the holiday cheer, the spooky with the snow angels and the macabre with the mistletoe in a decidedly delightful, certifiably classic, brilliantly Burton-esque way (though it's not directed by the big man himself, instead unmistakably being a Selick-helmed affair). It isn't incredibly compelling, nor especially memorable when it comes to its music. It also suffers from some strange pacing issues and doesn't quite feel cohesive as a whole. Still, it's almost instantly iconic thanks to its weird, genre-confident visuals which are brought to life wonderfully, one frame at a time. 6/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas
44,g-bodyl,Halloween Plus Christmas Equals......Fun!,8,17 March 2015,"The Nightmare Before Christmas was produced during the heyday of Disney's Renaissance period and it is another example of a Disney classic. Now this isn't as strong as the Lion King or the Little Mermaid, but it's serviceable enough. This concept was created by Tim Burton and throughout the film, we can see his visionary touches. The visuals are very creepy and I also liked the music. The concept is a genius idea as we see what happens when Halloween and Christmas is combined. Henry Selick's film is about the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town named Jack who is not happy with the continuous tradition of Halloween. Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and falls in love with Christmas. Jack decides to get his buddies at Halloween Town to join in the festive spirit....but it may be a big mistake. The film doesn't feature a big voice cast at all, as the movie is mostly song. But composer Danny Elfman sung many of the songs and I thought he did a very good job. In any case, we do have talent from Chris Sarandon to Catherine O'Hara in this movie. Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is another strong movie for Disney. It's not perfect by any means, especially when it comes to the writing. The movie seemed to grow stale towards the end, so we must be thankful for the incredibly short running time. But in all, this was a very entertaining film thanks to the vision of Tim Burton. My Grade: B+",The Nightmare Before Christmas

47,A_Different_Drummer,Elfman takes on Phantom ... and Wins!,10,1 December 2013,"Part of my mission on IMDb is to identify films that are not given their due ... this pretty much qualifies. Danny Elfman, in the single most astonishing work of his career, takes on PHANTOM OF THE OPERA .. and beats it. I have seen Phantom both in live theatre and on film. It is brilliant but flawed. There are gaps in the story. Some of the songs don't work. None of that applies here. Plus, Sir you-know-who did not actually sing his own songs in Phantom! Here, Elfman did! Not only is this Elfman's best work but (this is a tougher call, given the quality of the man's output) this could be Burton's as well. Mesmerizing from the first frame to the last. It is a story about hope and ambition, a cautionary tale, a lesson in fixing the messes you make, and even a love story. Catherine O'Hara steals every scene as Sally, a tribute to her voice actressing and to the animation also. Kindly note that TWICE AS MANY IMDb users have penned a review as there were ACTUAL REVIEWERS in the mainstream who tackled this. This should be a high 9+ on the IMDb. For me it is a one-of-a-kind film that defies comparison, and all it knows is how to entertain. Rating 17/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

I know we have a DVD of the film in the house but never got around watching it but thanks to Putlocker, I did manage to get to see the film!I found the movie very weird because of the characters not showing much emotions shown on the faces and the whole film really looks as if I'm looking at stoned people who wants to ruin Christmas. I felt that was my impression really.The only thing good about it was the music, it really gets ya to really sing along and jump around.

49,CuriosityKilledShawn,Xmas Comes to Halloweentown,6,19 December 2010,"I abstained from Nightmare Before Christmas for years because (much like The Goonies) it has just been forced into popular culture, where I don't think it belongs. Neither film was massively popular or a critical success on their original release, but somewhere along the line the spirit of the films were hijacked.I hate seeing forlorn-looking, middle-class emo teenagers wearing Jack Skellington T-shirts as much as I hate the same crowd yelling ""Hey you, guys."" Were they even born when these films were made? Back to the film itself, it's a rather simple tale of a Halloween-themed world being exposed to the magic of Christmas. Jack Skellington and the denizens of Halloweentown welcome the magic, but no one really seems to understand that the macabre of Halloween and the Spirit of Christmas are utterly incongruous. I suppose this is a commentary on the inconsistency of what the public desires and how we are all easily programmed to like what the media tells us to like.The thin story is interspersed with several, generic Danny Elfman melodies and songs. The characters are amusing, especially the Mayor of Halloweentown, who's double-sided head periodically rotates between happiness and despair. And the atmosphere is also very nice, but I'm undecided if it's a Halloween film or an Xmas film.Overall, it's good, but not great. It's more like The Trap Door than it's like Wallace and Gromit, but still a pleasant distraction for the Xmas season.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
50,ironhorse_iv,"What's this!? This is a good movie, sir.",8,22 December 2013,"Nightmare before Christmas is a movie that you can watch both on Halloween and Christmas and the time between them. The Nightmare before Christmas is often mistaken as a Tim Burton's film. While Tim Burton did indeed produce and helped write the story when it was first thought out as a poem. It was director Henry Selick that made the movie that most people all love. I will give mad props to Selick and the hundreds of animators that work on this 74 minutes film as the stop motion in this film is amazing. There were little to minor mistakes, that aren't very noticeable. The movie tells the story of Jack Skellington (Voice by Chris Sarandon), a skeleton from Halloween Town whom is having a identify crisis, he is tired of celebrating Halloween. In a state of depression, he wanders off into the forest, only to finds himself in Christmas Town. He found the holiday very fascinating and decides to steal that holiday instead; that leaded to deadly consequences. I think there is a lot of symbolism in the film that mirrors how modern society Christmas is so different than the original holiday in which it was based on. There are several trees with special doors on them by their symbols it is clear they are portals to other holiday worlds. However, Jack finds it difficult to come up with definitions for these symbols. His followers are also unfamiliar with these themes can only relate them with what they see in their normal Halloween culture. Jack has an abstract definition that he has learnt through books, but he never gets a chance to live and experience the meaning of Christmas. This leaves him with an unclear vision, and therefore an unclear understanding how it works. Like Jack Skellington, modern society know little of what Christmas is really about; only knowing it as the capitalism materialism ritual form. Thus, Christmas have become less about spreading love, and more on what society deed is what it an expression of love. Modern Christmas due to appealing nature, has began to become too big and popular to the point that it over-lapped the other holidays. While this might seem like a good thing, it does disinterest or lost of others cultural traditions. The film took inspirations from older stop motion television specials classics like 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with its style. I like how Halloween Town, looks like something out of a German Expressionism film. The score in the movie is amazing by Danny Elfman. I love all the songs in this film from 'Kidnapping the Santa Claws', 'Sally's Song' to ""What's this?"". All of them are beautiful to the ears. The songs have often been cover over the years by bands like Fall Out Boy, Korn, All-American Rejects, Flyleaf, Panic at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, and others. I think the Fall Out Boys is the best cover. The movie might seem a bit too scary for little children. Hints why Disney decided to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner. Due to the popularity of the film, Walt Disney Pictures has reissued the film annually under their Disney Digital 3-D format from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3-D. I saw the 2D and 3D versions, and I don't see much of a different, really. The supporting cast was very interesting. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake is one of the best Disney villains ever. I don't find the character as racist as of some members of NAACP due to its jiving and dancing nature. Oogie Boogie is a bogeyman type creature, not Black-face. That's total nonsense, NAACP. It's weird in a way, that Catherine O'Hara voice Sally: A rag doll-like creature that is Jack's love interest as Sally doesn't sound like O'Hara at all. Glenn Shadix as Mayor of Halloween Town: An enthusiastic leader who conducts town meetings was hilarious with his wild mood swings. I just didn't like the Santa Claus's character. He seems like he was a jerk who is tired of Christmas. Overall: With excellent writing, stop-motion animation, legendary soundtrack, stunning visuals, wonderful story, likable characters, with little flaws, it's truly a classic.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
51,The-Sarkologist,How Halloween twists the beauty of Christmas,9,17 October 2013,"Even though this film was not directed by Tim Burton, I guess one should give him the credit for it as he helped write and also produced it. I guess the reason that he did not direct it was because it was an animated feature and he wanted to use a director that was far more skilled at animation than he was. In any case, this film still has a very Burton look to it with the twisted and dark scenery and the tragic characters. Even so, this movie is actually directed at children, and seems to be designed to introduce them to the world of the tragedy.The movie is about Jack Skelington, the Lord of Halloween Town. After a rather successful Halloween, he is depressed because he has lost all direction in life. All his life seems to be is haunting and scaring people at one time of the year, and even though the entire population of Halloween town looks up to him, he really does not want to do it anymore. In fact, he wants a career change.He thus goes on a walk out of Halloween town and finds a small grove of trees with doors in it. He enters the door shaped like a Christmas tree and finds himself in Christmas town. Upon seeing the wonders of this town, he decides that he wants to take over Christmas, so he has Santa kidnapped, and sets all of Halloween town to work to create his own Christmas. The problem is that Halloween town is not experienced and what they end up creating is a twisted and disturbing version of Christmas. This is the tragedy of this movie, Skelington seriously wishes to do something new, but ends up destroying the joy that the holiday was supposed to thing.I guess there is little in the way of themes in this movie with the exception of stick at what you are good at. But the movie is tragic in this sense because Jack Skelington has ended up doing what he has done because he has become bored and wishes to escape, but cannot. Even though the ending is happy, and Skelington gets the girl, there is still the underlying pain that Skelington is really back where he started, as when he tried to take over Christmas, he failed badly.This is a brilliant movie: the visuals and the music are superb. In fact, the music is by Danny Elfman, one of Burton's companions that seems to do the music for all of his films. It is a shame though that much of the population do not see the beauty behind Burton's films.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

54,Rodrigo_Amaro,I liked it but...,6,20 December 2010,"...I probably missed something while watching ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" because I didn't find anything so special as people claim to have seen it. It's good overall, very watchable but I really didn't felt the hype of this animation. And the tragic thing that I heard was people saying that the only people who'll enjoy this film is the ones who watched since they were kids and grow up watching over and over again. Fine. I watched it more recently, I'm young but not a kid but I still think that a movie can and must win all kinds of audiences otherwise it's just silly and forgotten.The concept, the story of Jack a scary Halloween creature that discovers Christmas and gets involved with the holiday but doesn't know its meaning quite well, is very original, funny. Perhaps more suitable and interesting for a live action film than a animated feature. This is a cartoon for kids but at the same time it's not, it's dark, kind of creepy. And a movie idealized by Tim Burton wouldn't be a Burton film without Danny Elfman's songs. Sometimes the songs work quite well, other times it's annoying and overlong.Perhaps the aspect that bothered me on this film, or the thing that didn't make me enjoy it more than I wanted is the direction of the film in charge of Henry Selick. Selick directed one of the worst films ever made, a tiny awful film called ""Monkeybone"", a waste of time, space, money, completely misguided film and since then I was afraid of watching something directed by him. Here in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" he was good, knew how to direct and control the stop motion technique, and was able to capture Burton's ideas. But had this movie directed by Burton himself, with more control on things this would be a better and greater film as it is. Burton is present here but not as much as his presence in the wonderful ""Corpse Bride"" (which I enjoyed so much more).The voice casting was very good although they haven't included any famous actors behind the characters voices. The great special effects were nominated for the Oscar (lost out to the undefeatable ""Jurassic Park""), the soundtrack is good, has its great moments most notably the song ""This Is Halloween"" played at the opening, that song should have been nominated for an Oscar.Again, I wasn't so excited as many people claimed to have been while watching this experience. It's good but not great. I've seen better animated films and that's only my opinion. Now I'm gonna have to face many people who suggested the film to me, and they were so thrilled while talking about it, and when they ask me what did I find about it I'm gonna frown my face a little, say it was okay, and they're gonna kill me for doing that. But that's life! 6/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas
55,Dr_Coulardeau,Let's dance with the devil,10,3 October 2015,"The Story itself is a perverse well ending distortion of all festivities children love into a nightmare. Children adore Halloween, even though it is dedicated to wintry death, the ghostlike dead, sour witches, menacing wizards, all kinds of dangerous beings that only revel in the enjoyment of death for themselves and for everyone else. On the other hand Christmas has become the celebration of sweet gifts, sugary presents, honey-like offerings of love and friendship to children and to everyone we love and love can only exist in life. Or Can it really?Some sort of rivalry emerges in the minds of these Halloween monsters with Santa Claus and Christmas. So they use their great hero, Mr. Jack, to kidnap Santa Claus and to replace him with himself and his own presents that are necessarily obnoxious and disgusting and aggressive and ugly and repulsive, and many other things along these lines. He creates a real revolution in the world of the living who just pick up their weapons and start shooting and finally manage to bring that Mr. Jack and his sleigh down, but not down into their living world, but down into the world of the dead, that is to say the world of Halloween.But down there a girl, in fact some kind of a rag doll made up of pieces sown together has fallen in love with this Mr. Jack, and sure enough her love is a long story of pain, suffering and pangs of fear and anguish. Mr. Jack does not see that love and is not even, interested in love. Mr. Jack is only thinking of how he could entertain his living dead community with some antics and pranks performed on the living that are not yet dead.But since a miracle is always possible, that miracle happens and Mr. Jack after having been shot down from the sky back into his cemetery and tomb comes up again in his ghoulish world and discovers they are on the point of killing both Santa Claus and the sweet rag doll that had tried to liberate Father Christmas who had not been able to escape. Strangely enough Mr. Jack has met with a real epiphany somewhere between the sky and his burying vault and he actually saves the day by sparing Santa Claus, giving him his sleigh and his rein-deers back and everything can go back to normal, or can it?The story is nothing that will last forever. The animated film, the animation itself, in other words the film in its visual dimension is a mind-stirring adventure. Tim Burton is an expert at transforming anything into its opposite and merging the two together and turning the most repulsive being into a real darling. Here he manages Mr. Jack who is like a human-looking daddy-long-legs into a real darling that becomes lovely and lovable when he is performing the worst practical jokes on children. This is possible because the only reaction of the living is to be afraid, to run away or to turn around and attack in order to kill. Why don't the living take what they are given without forgetting that you must not look a gift horse in the mouth and you must enjoy the gift because any gift is always a sign of love and it comes from the heart. There is a nostalgic and melancholy tone in this film as if Tim Burton regretted the fact that living humans, that is to say all humans, cannot accept those who are different, the intentions of these beings, though they come from the heart even if they may be surprising. Human beings are so narrowly enshrined and engulfed and embalmed in their fear and limited normative world that they are no longer able to see what love is when it comes from someone who does not do it the same way as them. It is sad.The other marvelous fact is that the whole film is sung and accompanied by music. Danny Elfman has made a prodigious work in this film. Without the music the whole film would be so sad, so dark, so bloodless and spineless that it would not be able to stand up by itself. This Christmas story, after all, or Halloween story if you prefer, is just as sad as Scrooge and yet with some sweet star light all along. Of course what's more, like Tim Burton, Danny Elfman is a great borrower and you will recognize here and there some tit bits coming from far away and other films, other music, at times his own attached to some other film. It is discreet and no children can catch the nuggets, but with some experience we can and that just sounds fascinating.I am sure your grandchildren might like it, even if you may find it a little bit somber. Do not forget children always enjoy a trace of fear and a piece of supernatural emotion, just as much as they love a trace of sugar on their pastry and a piece of Turkish delight, even if it opens the door to Narnia.

56,filipemanuelneto,"A ""stop motion"" milestone",7,28 June 2016,"This animated film for adults and adolescents focuses on Jack Skellington, the most notable citizen of Halloween Town, and the unexpected trip he made to the Christmas City, where he discovers the Christmas spirit without, however, understanding it. Directed and written by Tim Burton, the film features the voices of Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey and Glenn Shadix.This is one of the most famous animated films in stop motion and was even nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects due to the quality of animation achieved. Tim Burton has talent, especially for films considered strange or out of standards. Horror or mystery themes are rather visited by the director in the form of animations (""Corpse Bride"" is the most striking example). In this case, it addresses the celebration of Halloween, a popular holiday in the English-speaking countries, which has begun to be observed also in Latin Europe, timidly, for cultural import of the ""mass media"" (in these countries people celebrate the All Saints Day).The script is very good, funny and directly clashes the two holidays. The characters are imaginative and made with great care. The voices were quite well most of the time. Its noticed how Burton were engaged in the project. Very meticulous, he argued for the greatest perfection possible in the film. The sets and visual effects were at the highest level, playing with the most popular objects of Halloween and Christmas. Photography can displease because of low contrast, but I believe it was the best that could be achieved in 1993, and the film, if it were made today, with digital technologies in filming and editing, would have been a rather different picture. The soundtrack, in charge of Danny Elfman, is excellent. He also composed all the songs that are sung in the film. Some of them stays in the ear, others are quite moving, as the songs interpreted by the ""rag doll"" Sally.For all these reasons, this movie is a reference in contemporary animation, and is suitable, in particular, for lovers of the scariest day of the year.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
57,leplatypus,What's this? The dream about Christmas (cinematheque) (vhs) (screen),10,4 May 2012,"As ""Hook"", this is a movie that i have discovered first by its soundtrack, having bought the import during a family trip to Paris in 1993 (the same where we have seen ""Schindler""). After opening it, I was surprised to see a booklet of songs, having just expected a score from Danny. At the listening, I find it wonderful, all the more than Danny is a great singer as well. Frankly, i don't remember my feelings when I watched it at its release, except than i bought the VHS later. Now, this is the movie that opens the Burton's festival at the Cinematheque, thus i can tell today.For me, it stands as a unique and inventive piece of imagination, sublimated by the score, an incredible art and an astounding craft. It's dark but funny as well (I love the one-eyed mummy), frightening and tender. The characters show a lot of soul and it's such amazing for just plastic ones. I still don't understand why Danny's musical effort has been snubbed at Oscars because he delivers such great themes and lyrics! The story is a jewel because the idea of a magic place made of holidays is just totally fairy tale. If the action is sometimes a bit vague (what's is the secret of X-Mas?), the screen is so full of details that it's a non-stop feast for the eyes. At last, the movie is paired with ""Vincent"" (a bit too sad) and with the ""Frankenweenie"" that is maybe the best short I have ever seen: as in ""Nightmare"", it's filled of emotion and it has all the themes that Tim would film in his long career!My conclusion is that Tim and Danny should have done a ""Nightmare 2"" instead of ""Corpse Bride"" where the alchemy doesn't repeat.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

As much as this is Burton and Selick's film, it is Elfman who reigns supreme. Not only did he compose the eerie score and write the memorable songs, he also provided the singing voice of Jack. The majority of the film's charm comes directly from Elfman's wondrous talent. The stop-motion animation also enhances the film's unique aesthetics and adds an additional layer to its ghoulish personality, especially that haunting moon sequence (just gorgeous!). Whether it be Sally sewing her detached limbs back on or the Mayor's head rapidly switching to different faces, there are plenty of frightening qualities that come across as endearing rather than harrowing. And that's all thanks to the simple yet effective story, spreading the magic and joy of Christmas. Unfortunately its short runtime does mean that the final ten minutes were wrapped up absurdly quickly, especially the underdeveloped villainous Oogie Boogie and undercooked romance between Jack and Sally.

Conceptually birthed by gothic master Tim Burton and brought to life with the most incredible vision and detail by Henry Selick, it stands as an incredible marriage of creative energy and top-notch artistry.Released in 1993, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" actually predates the collaboration that truly saved Walt Disney Pictures - Pixar's ""Toy Story."" Both films were groundbreaking in their own right - ""Nightmare"" for stop-motion and ""Toy Story"" for computer-generated animation - though as the latter became mainstream, the former continues to be underrated, even today. Regardless, both films show the world-building ingenuity that we've come to expect from animated films in the 21st century.What helps keep ""Nightmare"" timeless and relevant, however, is that it's steeped in holiday spirit. Halloween and Christmas are two holidays that evoke their own special, unique energy and Burton's story pounces on marrying their two wildly different aesthetics. It's Selick of course, who really sees (and seizes) this opportunity in bringing Halloween Town to life with aplomb.Of the film's many vivid components, however, its story doesn't hold up as well nearly 25 years later. Fortunately, at an unusually brisk 76-minute runtime (likely due to stop-motion's time-consuming nature) it doesn't need to. The film can afford to survive on its whimsy, artistic sight gags and inventive musical numbers. That said, it's not among the more emotionally compelling holiday-themed films either. Yet anyone who has ever been in position to be jealous of Christmas or idyllic depictions of Christmas celebrations might identify with Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon, singing vocals by Danny Elfman) and his longing to do something different and truly extraordinary. Or if not Jack, then Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a Frankensteinian creation longing to serve her own desires for once, not just that of her maker, the Evil Scientist (William Hickey). Helping us better acquaint ourselves with these characters are Elfman's songs. Although most of them do serve an expository purpose, a few take a moment to bring us closer to Jack and Sally.The musical nature of ""Nightmare"" shows the film's ambition. It's hard enough to make a film requiring this much detail, let alone set it all to music. Elfman and Burton have been a perfect pair throughout their respective careers; Elfman simply gets the fantastical gothic tone Burton has made his career on. His songs are a great match for the material, even if you can't recall how most of them go in the same way you can the songs of the traditional animation musicals of that time period.In family entertainment, story generally proves to be most important. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a remarkable exception, getting by on its tone, visual effects, creative world-building and the Halloween and Christmas spirit. At times when it feels like a glorified animated short film, best to just remember all the ground it broke as the first mainstream and widely successful stop-motion animated feature.~Steven CThanks for reading!

O'Hara (Beetlejuice, Home Alone) voices Sally, a ghoulish girl who likes Jack, the late, Hickey (One Crazy Summer, Christmas Vacation) voices an evil scientist and the late, Shadix (Beetlejuice, Heathers) voices the mayor of Halloween Town.

66,FiendishDramaturgy,Enjoyable But Overrated Burton Animation,5,8 April 2007,"While this story was creative, it was not original-there have been similar inter-dimensional/realm travel plots throughout cinematic history. The animation is not the masterpiece it is played up to be, the dark Disneyesque songs, and the Gothic Tim Burton theme combine to make this something we've never quite seen before, while it is still reminiscent of scores of other works...Beetle Juice for one, which is another well-received Tim Burton Gothic rom/com with the darkling edge.In my opinion, this is one of the more over-rated animations ever. James and the Giant Peach came out about the same time, and it was much better done, but without the Gothic story and setting.Enjoyable, but overrated.

67,freemantle_uk,A Musical Delight,10,23 April 2011,"The Nightmare Before Christmas was a big hit when it first came out in the early 90s and has had generations of fans ever since. In 2006 there was a 3D re-release of the film and it has become a cultural icon: even people who have not seen the film knows elements of it, you can buy merchandise and hoodies with Jack Skellington and I even met a girl at a costume party dressed as Sally from the film. It has even be parodied a number of times.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon/singing voice Danny Elfman) is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Ever year he leads frightening festivities and he does it successful. But he is growing tired of his role and he longs for something fresh. After wondering off, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and after seeing the joy and happiness of this world Jack decides he wants the creatures of Halloween Town to take part. He gets the creatures to prepare everything and kidnaps Santa Claus (Ed Ivory), but Sally (Catherine O'Hara) has a vision that his noble plan will end in disaster.The Nightmare Before Christmas came out of the mind of Tim Burton, starting as a poem before being expanded upon. This is one of Burton's best films, which is ironic because he was only the producer and created the story. But The Nightmare Before Christmas is still very Burtonsque in its look, very dark and Gothic look. Henry Selick is a great stop motion animator and his designs are great for the film. The animation flows brilliantly and I particularly like how the characters moved.The story is simple and very focused, and Selick delivers a fun fast paced film. It has a short running time but it works and Danny Elfman wrote and song some brilliant songs. The songs are energetic, fun and simply delightful and it what you would want from a film like this. They are catchy but more importantly well written and fitting to the animation and the events of the film. The Nightmare Before Christmas is also funny, whether it's a funny line or a set piece like with the Easter Bunny. Even if you do not laugh out load this is a film where you will have a smile throughout.The characters are also great, being developed and likable. The creature designs are wonderful and imaginative, whether it's the main two characters or many of the supporting characters, like the Mayor or the wheelchair mad scientist. There are influences of other works, like Frankenstein, classic Universal monsters and classic children's fears and stories. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a creative film, with wonderful art, a great Gothic design and is just an uplifting experience.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
68,Stevieboy666,My favourite animated movie,8,24 December 2017,"I can remember watching this at the cinema way back & being thrown into a magical place. Have now just revisited but with my son and in the comfort of my own home. An animated, musical love story that beautifully combines Halloween & Christmas. Based on characters written by & also produced by Tim Burton but NOT directed by him, I do feel that adding his name as a pre-fix is slightly misleading, but just a minor quibble. The fact that I have a The Nightmare Before Christmas 2017 calender hanging on my wall is testament to the film's enduring popularity.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
69,dee.reid,"Burton's ""Nightmare"" is a dream come true",10,10 December 2004,"By 1993, director Tim Burton was such a successful filmmaker in Hollywood that he was able to return to one of his most beloved early projects, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" It's certainly an inspired movie, as it is also very weird, and when I say ""weird,"" I mean it's distinctly Burton.Even though it was directed with enough competency by Henry Selick, this groundbreaking stop-motion animation film is Burton all the way, as it contains ample ""esque"" qualities that make this ""Nightmare"" uniquely his vision.As the film opens in the twisted, ""Burton""-esque village of ""Halloweentown,"" Jack Skellington, who is dually voiced by Chris Sarandon and longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, is celebrating another ""horrible"" Halloween. You'll be shocked and amazed at some of the town's inhabitants, who include jazz-playing zombies, Four Tenor-like vampires, a wolf man, and a wheelchair-bound scientist who occasionally opens up his cranium to (literally) scratch his brain; his creation, a Frankenstein-like scarecrow named Sally (Catherine O'Hara), yearns for contact with others and is quite fond of Jack Skellington.But Jack's quickly growing tired of the same old routine year after year, and because he's so downtrodden with boredom, he ventures into the dark forest outside the town's borders, and accidentally stumbles onto the wondrous, jolly world of ""Christmastown."" Enticed by its splendor, he decides to bring back his discovery to the residents of Halloweentown, who of which are just as shocked by Christmas as he is. Jack gets the brilliant idea to pose as Santa Claus but hires three mischief-makers to kidnap the real Santa so he can share his own, misguided vision of Christmas with an unprepared world.Painstakingly and meticulously crafted, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a beautiful and wonderful film from start to finish. The most famous image of this film is the cover art, which features Skellington eerily silhouetted against a full moon while he stands atop a coiled hill that overlooks a desolate graveyard.Burton is such a wonderful director, who had already brought us one unique ""esque"" vision after the other, especially with the first two ""Batman"" films and ""Edward Scissorhands"" behind him as of '93 when ""Nightmare"" was made.10/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas
70,drqshadow-reviews,Elfman and Burton's Finest Partnership,9,26 December 2012,"Tim Burton is one of only a few creative minds who's able to handle creepy, adult material in a way that's not just appropriate, but also downright appealing, to younger audiences. Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Edward Scissorhands are all great examples of this trait at play, but of the lot I think this is his most timeless creation - which is odd, since it's the only one he didn't direct. Like the very best fairy tales, it's adventurous and unusual, taking outlandish concepts for granted as a means of sucking the audience into its own private corridor. The plot is predictable and natural, but also doesn't sacrifice its ability to throw the audience for a loop from time to time, and efficiently straddles two holidays in a manner that never feels forced or exploitative. Of course, the visuals are remarkable, bubbling with character, but the music is where it really hangs its hat. Danny Elfman has never felt more naturally at-home in the Burton universe, and considering the pair's long, storied history together, that's quite the achievement. The tunes are occasionally just a bit too catchy for their own good (I've been humming them for the better part of a day now) but that's a small price to pay for a modern fable this good.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
71,CubsandCulture,Probably Burton's best film.,10,3 December 2019,Yes this is a Burton's film. Yes I am aware that he was not the director. But as the producer and the creator of the story and characters he had a singular impact on the final product. More to the point it feels like a Burton film. In fact it feels like THE Burton film. It has all of his hallmarks in design and atmosphere. It even has his typical weakness in story and narrative. This is the film I would show to someone experiencing Burton for the first time. It is dark whimsy personified.This is a classic holiday film and Elfman's score makes it highly re-watchable.

74,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Timeless classic,10,15 December 2015,"Tim Burton/Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas is very special in the sense that it can be re-watched and apreciated at both halloween and Christmas, which I always do. It's such a classic that it's catchy songs, distinct characters and boundless imagination have ingrained it into the collective consciousness of pop culture for eternity. It paved the roads of animation with its innovative, eye candy stop motion animation (my favorite style) and lit up the musical genre with its crowd pleasing ballads of pure holiday joy. By now anyone who hasn't seen this and doesn't know the plot really needs to rethink their life choices, but for those few lost souls who haven't seen it, I'll go I'll to the plot a bit, because I love talking about it. In a far off fantasy realm called Halloweentown, the residents toil endlessly all year for their annual festivities. They're a wide variety of whacky creatures, including werewolves, bicycle riding clowns, witches, ghouls sand so many more. A gaunt, spindly gentleman called Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon, with Danny Elfman seamlessly providing his singing voice) is the top dog in Halloweentown, the 'Pumpkin King'. But he yearns for more, and laments the mundane, everyday slog of halloween. On a forest walk he discovers portals to the other holiday realms, and unwittingly tumbles headlong into Christmas Town, with his ghostly dog Zero. We then are treated to one of the most charming sequences in any animated film ever, as he discovers an adorable host of elves, reindeer, snow, and all kinds of brightly lit festive delight that he's never seen before, as he excitedly belts out my favourite number of the piece, 'What's This?'. In his elation, he hatches a plan to kidnap Santa Claus and use him to spruce up his hometown and give it that Christmas cheer for fora change. Of course his scheme backfires in hilarious, poignant ways and he learns along the way. He's joined by Sally the rag doll (Catherine O Hara), and the neurotic Mayor of Halloweentown (Glenn Shadix) as well as a whole impressively designed host of creatures too numerous to name here, some of my favourites being the mischievous Lock, Shock and Barrel, as well as villainous Oogie Boogie. The film is pure magic, with song after song stirring your heart and sticking in your mind long after ft er the credits. This Is Halloween, Making Christmas, The Oogie Boogie song to name a few are pure gold. If there's ever after terrestrial cinematic time capsule fpr generations down the road to unearth among the rubble, this one has top priority for a spot. It's simply magic.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Viewing it for the first time in 2013, it blew me away. Visually, it seems to be more detailed than most of the films that have been made since. Some of the songs are pure classics, and I'm guessing that I'll be hooked on more of them after a few more listens. For some reason, I expected it to start strong but not really go anywhere, but that was a misconception. There is nothing wrong with the story--no plot points that bother me, and a satisfactory resolution. I see why Oogie Boogie is so popular--his song was stuck in my head for quite a while afterwards. The characters are memorable, maybe iconic--well designed and performed. As much as I enjoyed it, I'm glad they never did a sequel--it should remain self-contained. Glad I finally took the time to see it.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

In the years since it's release it has been imitated but never fully duplicated.These days it has really built in popularity and I'm happy about that, a little sad it's no longer the special little thing it was but I'm thrilled people are coming around on it.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
78,Steffi_P,"""With all our tricks we're making Christmas time""",8,23 December 2011,"Stop-motion animation has been around almost since the beginning of cinema, but this was the first time the form had been used for a full-length motion picture. Just like cell animation sixty years earlier, the claymation we see here had been employed for pre-feature shorts or blended with live-action, but hadn't really been taken seriously as a facet of the cinematic medium. This is one of the good things about having popular mavericks like Tim Burton in Hollywood – they can use their mainstream bankability to push through projects the studios wouldn't normally touch with a bargepole.Burton didn't actually direct Nightmare Before Christmas. He instead produced and came up with the story outline, but this doesn't make much difference as far as the finished production is concerned. This is perhaps the most archetypal Burton story, the ultimate tale of scary looking outsiders trying to fit in with the bright and happy world outside and failing beautifully. There's also that familiar look of both characters and scenery (Burton was always heavily involved with the design of his movies) – spindly figures, wild hair, black and white stripes, curling fronds like gnarled fingers. There's been a depressing trend in recent decades of making horror characters seem comical rather than scary, and The Nightmare Before Christmas, with its mix of the grotesque and the cartoonish, is a (probably unwitting) flagship for this. It's a shame because it's essentially the dumbing-down of kid's stuff. Children's movies were better when they could be properly frightening.Something that really helps The Nightmare Before Christmas work is its being a musical. At first hearing Composer Danny Elfman's skittering melodies don't seem suited to singing, but then you realise just how much story and characterisation is carried in those lyrics. It's all a bit reminiscent of Lerner and Loewe's musicals, in that the songs are very much used to move the story along. And the tunes – while not exactly ones that are easy to sing along to – are rather pretty. They're also highly evocative – ""What's This?"" fizzes like a snowstorm, ""Sally's Song"" feels tender and sad, ""Jack's Lament"" is by turns proud and melancholy. Oogie Boogie's bluesy number injects a little bit of fun to kick off the final act of the movie.And we shouldn't downplay the contribution of actual director Henry Selick. Selick takes this stop motion feature with a cinematic approach, using close-ups, camera moves, tilts and the like, to dramatic. The level of detail to the sets is exceptional, and there is a no-expense-spared look one would not associate with the shorts this medium has typically been used in. Most importantly however is the personality that goes into movement the characters. At ten frames a second, this isn't exactly smooth, but there is a wonderful texture and life in stop-motion that you don't quite get in other forms of animation. This is probably the biggest gift that The Nightmare Before Christmas has given us – the championing and reinvigoration of this seemingly dated art form, ironically in the very decade that CGI became the predominant animation method. It paved the way for many more claymation movies, which is undoubtedly a good thing.And as a final thought, I'll just mention that stop motion is an incredibly easy form of animation to do at home. All you need nowadays is a digital camera and the right software (you can do it with Photoshop), plus of course a bit of patience and imagination. It doesn't have to be clay models – you can animate object you like. Have fun..!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
79,aidanratesmovies,"There has never been anything like it, and nothing ever will be again",9,4 November 2021,"A weird and wonderful animated adventure unlike any other- The Nightmare Before Christmas shines in artistic brilliance, originality, and just plain fun. I honestly couldn't try to describe this film to you if I tried, much less the plot of it. Needless to say, it being the brainchild of Tim Burton, the film is full of macabre humor and visuals, and a very versatile style. The animation is fantastic and still holds up as some of the best stop motion films of all time. The songs are catchy and the world is so exuberant and thought-provoking- you are bound to get lost within its craziness. I also love the little details of the film, the setting, the visual gags, and how much thought is given in to each character. An unpopular opinion maybe, but I absolutely adore the character of Oogie-Boogie, and find his voice and look very pleasing. The film does have some slower moments, and some repetitive ones. But despite its flaws and lack of a consistent narrative path- The Nightmare Before Christmas is an endlessly charming endeavor into a blend between two of my favorite communities.

83,Spleen,The triumph of stop motion,10,30 July 1999,"There's life in stop motion yet.  Burton and Selick's film is a fine retort to `Toy Story'; or at least it would have been if `Toy Story' had been made first.  Fluid, three-dimensional animation in a completely designed world - that's what the two films have in common, but `The Nightmare Before Christmas' looks undeniably better.  Partly it's the more imaginative art direction.  Partly, also, it's just the fact that there's something enervating about digital effects, and something special about using real, physical artwork, and photographing it.  I don't know how well the world of Halloween will stand up over the years, but no-one will forget what it looks like.The plot alarmingly resembles that of a Rankin/Bass TV special, but with more teeth.  Jack Skellington, ruler of the land of Halloween, falls in love with the land of Christmas, and decides to conquer it.  The difference between `Nightmare' and its dismal TV cousins is that the land of Halloween really is a grisly place.  (Gorgeous, but grisly.)  Jack Skellington is a gentle ruler with an imperfect hold on power.  (Santa Claus, by contrast, is not quite the innocent he appears to be.)  It all ends a little too soon: I would have liked to see more attention paid to the story after all the fun scene-setting.  Still, it's a delicious movie.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

86,nycritic,When You Don't Want the Traditional Christmas Movie.,10,10 January 2006,"Thank God for stop-motion animation and the creative genius that is Tim Burton because any other technique would have diminished its surrealistic landscape. But, however kid-friendly THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas appears, this is a somewhat disturbing tale that children under the age of ten may not like because of some of its subject matter, specifically a scene in which Santa Claus gets tortured by the Boogeyman and children have a frightening experience with Christmas presents that turn deadly.Relying heavily on HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas, the story tells of how Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown is in a rut because every Halloween is the same old thing. By accident he stumbles onto what seems to be a portal embedded unto a tree which lands him in magical Christmastown -- a place which enchants him, a place where ""Sandy Claws"" is revered as its gift-giver. Here he gets an epiphany of an idea: he decides that he wants to celebrate Christmas the Halloween way, all in good spirit, and decides to kidnap Santa Claus, but Sally, the rag doll who loves him, has a strong feeling that this will not turn out well and must find a way to stop him, particularly when Oogie Boogie, the Boogeyman, enters the scene with nasty intentions.This is, quite simply, a beautiful film despite its dark and borderline disturbing tone which arrive late into the story once Jack Skellington decides to go on his frightful crusade to bring Halloween into Christmas unto an unsuspecting world. However, the film is really in good cheer and even a ghoul as mean as Oogie Boogie proves to be quite harmless. I do believe, though, this is a film to be watched closely and with a child spirit in order to appreciate its technical wizardry: Jack Skellington's eyes say it all: when has a skeleton looked so childlike and full of wonder? And who but a child could create the havoc stemming from a prank instead from meanness? Like I said -- this is a stunning film, and one the family can view on not one but two holiday seasons.

88,Matt_Layden,Classic Before It Became Popular Again.,8,20 July 2009,"Re-watching this classic might hurt the original viewing for some. The animation is not as smooth as the recent flicks like Corpse Bride or even Wallace and Gromit. Still, the originality and musical entertainment is still there. I had a friend who loved this movie, then the recent popularity with kids wearing clothing from the film apparently ruined it for him. How does that happen, don't ask me.NBC is a film that is indeed a classic and rightfully so. The animation may be stiff today, but I think it works for the world they've created. These aren't humans we're seeing. It's horrific creatures from the mind of Tim Burton and it has his stamp all over it. Seeing two worlds collide, such as Halloween and Christmas, is marvelous to see. Watching Jack as he first enters Christmas Town is like watching a kid discover the world around him when he learns to walk.The musical numbers are catchy and serve the story well. The film is a lot faster paced then I remember. It flies by really quick and before you know it Jack is delivering the toys of horror to kids all over town.The Oogie Boogie man is really well done and is still scary today as he was when I first watched this film. The voice over work is crisp and alive with emotion. It's not just some celebrity lending their voice to an animated film, it's skill voice actors doing their thing.The originality and entertainment factor in this film are high and you can see the passion the filmmakers had in bringing this nightmare alive. Burton gets a lot of credit for this film, so much that many people mistake him for the director. Instead it was Henry Selick, the director of the film Coraline.

NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA.I saw this film in 1993. I was a huge ""Beetlejuice"" fan and with Tim Burton behind this film I knew it would be a fun film. I had no idea how much I would enjoy this.The Nightmare Before Christmansis deeper, darker and more brilliant than ever -- just as Tim Burton originally envisioned it. Can Christmas be saved? Bored with the same old scare-and-scream routine, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, longs to spread the joy of Christmas. But his merry mission puts Santa in jeopardy and creates a nightmare for good little boys and girls everywhere!This is one of the best films Disney Animation has ever made. Yes t was weird & scary images throughout but that was the plan. The original songs composed for this film are also very clever. Those songs to this day are still under appreciated. Listen to the lyrics. That not only help move story along but they are also the funniest things in this film.I think people are so unaware that in 1993 that Disney kind of disowned this film. The marketing push by the studio was very small! In fact Disney did not put there name on the film. They released under their ""TOUCHSTONE PICTURES"" label! After the film became popular Disney finally put their name on the film (and removed the Touchstone Label)! Eventually they incorporated the characters into Disneyland's popular Haunted Mansion attraction for Halloween time. This is a well made film. Watch & Enjoy!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

92,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Creepy and fun little animated movie,8,25 October 2014,"Okay, I've noticed that the reviews listed as ""most helpful"" are those that rated this movie a 10/10. While it is a movie that I'm sure appeals to the audience of dark humor and such, 10/10 seems like an unfair rating to give to a movie that isn't as perfect as its reputation. Still, this is a pretty good movie, and it can't be denied that it has a very original plot for its time of production.The Nightmare Before Christmas tells the comedic and creepy adventure of Jack Skellington and Santa Claus. Jack is a living skeleton of sorts, and the ""king"" (celebrity) of the fictional Halloween Town, where Halloween was invented and morbid and eerie yet very friendly creatures of all sorts reside, from clowns to black cats to vampires. Halloween Town is ruled by an overweight cone-headed, two-faced mayor, who closely resembles a demonic Patrick Star. Each year the town has a Halloween contest to see who in town is the scariest, and Jack is outvoted once again. Bored of the same routine every year, he doesn't realize that he has an admirer, a scarecrow named Sally who doesn't exactly have a free and adventurous lifestyle herself. She was built by a mad scientist and is forced to be his servant.One day Jack wanders off and ends up finding the glittering, exciting world of Christmas Town, where life is cheerful and happy and the exact opposite of his own society. He makes it his goal to bring Christmas to Halloween Town with the help of three mischievous, disturbed children, and to replace Santa Claus as the bringer of Christmas to the human world. While Jack's intentions are good, his methods aren't, and soon Santa is is danger of being murdered by a gambling addict cloth man.I was a big fan of this as a little kid. It was my first experience with a movie that wasn't all about happy, jolly, pink hippie-happy stories, and I was eventually able to recite the script word for word. What it took me a few years to realize was that this isn't the only creepy movie out there. Many reviewers have rated this above The Addams Family movies, Tim Burton's Beetlejuice franchise, Stephen King's books and movies, the 1988 detailed Japanese movie Akira, the German 1994 cat movie Felidae, the realistic nuclear war movie Threads, R. L. Stine's Goosebumps and many other morbid movies I never would have watched had I always assumed this was the best of 'em all.I loved the original characters and soundtrack by Danny Elfman, unfortunately many Tim Burton movies have the same formula and get a little tired after a while. I don't hate this movie, I really like it, but I'm not a die-hard Tim Burton fan, either.

98,gizmomogwai,Wouldn't you like to see something strange?,7,25 October 2013,"And now the movie that made us debate endlessly: ""Are we supposed to watch it on Christmas or Halloween?"" Obviously a brilliant concept from the guy who dreamt up Vincent (1982), The Nightmare Before Christmas' idea of blending a kid's two favourite holidays has attracted and sustained a fierce cult following. The basic idea is that holidays are places, and when Jack Skellington, king of Halloweentown, stumbles into Christmas Town, he feels a need to take it over. See, he's tired of Halloween, what anyone would feel if they were living the same holiday everyday. If he spent time in our universe and discovered we celebrate Christmas three months straight, he'd no doubt grow weary of it, too.In spite of being a Tim Burton fan, Nightmare Before Christmas wasn't regular viewing for me- I watched it once when it came out, and I may have been a bit young for it. Some things, like talk of Santa Claus being chopped up, are kind of freaky for a kid who, you know, still believes in Santa Claus. But as well, watching it now for the first time in years, the movie is lacking in a few areas- namely, the songs. One guy I went to university with complained ""This Is Halloween"" was the only great song in the movie, the rest was like nails on a chalkboard to him. Actually I'd say ""Sally's Song"" is great, too- a memorable, hauntingly sad tune I've been humming to myself for years. Beyond that, some songs are just forgettable- I just watched it, and I can't even remember what it sounded like when Jack decided to take over Christmas. What does ""Making Christmas"" sound like apart from the chorus? Other songs have elements of quality in them but drag on too long (""What's This?""). So yeah, for some kids, and adults, it would be a drag to see this movie. I love villains, but Oogie Boogie was also very underwhelming (""Let's make him a gambler! Why not?""). The mad scientist was a lot more interesting.Still, there's little denying the merit in the creativity, or the strange yet beautiful look of the stop motion animation. No wonder this movie has its fans.Happy Halloween.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
99,emasterslake,One of Tim Burton's Best Films of all time,8,3 November 2005,"I first saw this movie back 12 years ago on VHS at some daycare I use to go to.This movie is directed by the same guy who did Batman, Batman Returns, BeetleJuice, and Edward Scissorhands: Tim Burton.What's great about this movie is it's unlike any holiday movie, you'd ever see. Let's say the plot to it is similar to the Grinch only with more Gothic humor to it.It involves an intro to a place where holidays originated from. Each door leads to a certain holiday, this one focuses on Halloween and Christmas. The leader of Halloween Town is Jack Skellington aka Pumpkin King. He's the town hero/favorite. He does the honor of leading and making the Holiday as great as it could be.But he's been doing from year after year, that he's tired of doing the same old thing. So he walks through the woods till he approaches several Holiday doors. He ponders and wonder what they lead to, but not sure which one to check out. Till he spots the XMas door which caught his attention and is willing to see what's in it.He goes in and before he knows it, he's in a different land which amazed him and wants to know what it is by examining the way it's celebrated and done, but ends up stealing it for himself and Halloween Town to create their own XMas.This is a one of kind film to see. It's all done with Stop Motion animation. Story written by filmmaker Tim Burton. Contains numerous and memorable characters and songs to admire.Made a lot of merchandise out of it too.

101,Beta_Gallinger,"An overall charming combination of Halloween and Christmas, albeit a little overrated",8,6 December 2010,"This is a very famous stop-motion animated film, one which achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success. I first saw a trailer for it probably around the time of its release, or shortly after, and could tell right away that its title was obviously based on the title of the classic 19th century poem, ""The Night Before Christmas"". However, I never watched any of the film until December 2007 (I think), but even then, I only saw a bit of it. I didn't actually watch the whole movie until last year, just a few days before Christmas, even though it appears it was originally released for Halloween in 1993. With that first viewing, I was disappointed, and certainly didn't understand the massive appeal, but with a second viewing nearly a year later, it did get better.All holidays have their own separate worlds, with entrance portals in trees! One of these worlds is Halloween Town, which is inhabited by different types of monsters who celebrate Halloween every year with a good fright. The leader of this celebration is a skeleton named Jack Skellington, but another October 31st has just gone by, and he is tired of the same routine year after year. His woes send him wandering out of town and into the forest, where he comes across the entrance to Christmas Town. He opens the door and is sucked in, but really likes what he sees on the other side. The other residents of Halloween Town have been wondering where Jack has gone, but he soon returns, much happier than he was when he left. He begins to share his knowledge of Christmas with the other monsters of the town, hoping to get them to help him celebrate this holiday for a change, but they can't seem to fully understand it.The intro of this movie shows us the place in the forest where each of the holiday entrances are located and features an opening narration by Edward Ivory. This narration is far from perfect, as Ivory tends to speak too fast. The intro is followed by the film's first musical number, ""This Is Halloween"", which is a pretty good and intense song to start with. The stop-motion animation makes ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" a visual treat, with well designed sets and figures. Christmas Town looks gorgeous as we watch Jack discover it, and I wish more scenes took place there. A number of characters stand out, including Jack Skellington, voiced well by both Chris Sarandon, who provides his speaking voice, and Danny Elfman, who provides his singing voice. Most of the voice acting I can't complain about, and that includes Edward Ivory as Santa, as he is definitely better in that role than he is as the opening narrator. The musical numbers can be a little weak, and mostly aren't really that memorable, but I guess they could be worse. The film does feature a decent amount of suspense, and there are some pretty humorous moments, such as the mischievous Lock, Shock, and Barrel accidentally bringing back the Easter Bunny to Halloween Town instead of Santa.Before I watched this movie last December, I thought there was a good chance it would be a ten out of ten in my book, just like it is to so many other viewers. However, that certainly wasn't the case for me, which became clear shortly after I started watching. After that first viewing, I wouldn't have been able to rate ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" any higher than a six, as I found it to be a severely flawed mess, and after that, I couldn't hope to ever be able to rate the film higher than an eight. Fortunately, it now is an eight out of ten for me, so watching it a second time did help, and the film didn't seem so messy to me this time. I still can't join those who consider this 1993 animated blockbuster to be an absolute masterpiece, but I can recommend it. It may be too scary for really little kids, but for older kids and people in other age groups who like stop-motion animation, are Tim Burton fans (he had a major part in this, even though he didn't direct it), and want an entertaining film that combines Halloween and Christmas, this highly imaginative fantasy could be well worth it. You could probably watch it around October 31st OR December 25th and find that it really fits in with either occasion, which is not something that can be said about any other films I know of!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
102,jhclues,"Magic, Tim Burton Style",10,21 January 2002,"With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'), Thanksgiving (`Home for the Holidays'), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' directed by Henry Selick.	Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no `rush' in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into `Christmas Town,' and discovers something new (`What's this?  What's this!')-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  `And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!'  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!	Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his `nightmare'-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.	Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.	The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, `The Nightmare Before Christmas' is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies. Tim Burton style.  I rate this one 10/10.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Danny Elfman has pitched the songs to match Skellington perfectly, especially when he first sees Christmas Town ""What's this?"" The animation may feel slightly dated with CGI taking over the genre but the features on the DVD including the making of will leave you feeling heart warmed and inspired by the work and effort the team went to in order to achieve the visually stunning Oscar nominated effects.The plot is very enjoyable. However there are slight shortcomings when an important decision becomes an instant realisation. For example the 'what to do about Christmas' dilemma. Nevertheless the dialogue is likable and is told with that charm of fantasy verses reality that Burton does exceptionally well.The songs are always upbeat and all the characters get a chance to sing and shine, giving the picture a creative diversity. Jack's explanation of Christmas to the town of Halloween is a particularly annoying part with other characters disrupting the flow of the song.But this is a minor flaw when you have the classic well recognized ""What's this"" discovery song, not to mention a wonderfully colourful moment from Oogie Boogie. These two songs bring the light out of the darkness and are the finest moments of the film.The humour doesn't live up to recent Burton animation The Corpse Bride but the characters in this animation are far better. The imagination and darkness of the picture should not be discouraged and should be applied to more animations.The direction gives a charm that isn't horrific but pleasantly spooky and is therefore suitable for the whole family. The likability and humanity of the characters also help give this picture a relaxing and enjoyable realisation that isn't to be missed.The Nightmare before Christmas has been recognized as a 90's classic with its catchy songs and a good plot that is memorable if not the sharpest and funniest you will ever see.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

105,fernandoschiavi,"Technical elements aside, the film is able to please the whole family, saying that people are what they are born for",8,3 June 2021,"The Halloween City has its customs greatly exalted by its residents, peculiar individuals who hum in all corners. All spread the spooky spirit through their shapes and features: the rolling heads, sticky worms and sharp teeth through the shadows. This is definitely a magical place that few would like to visit. But what does all this have to do with Christmas? This is precisely the questioning of the protagonist of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".Considered the ultimate celebrity of his city, Jack Skellington (played by Chris Sarandon, from the series ""Orange is the New Black"", and Danny Elfman, composer of ""The Simpsons"" and ""Justice League"", among others) is one of the organizers of Halloween. Every year he and the ambiguous Mayor (Glenn Shadix, ""The Ghosts Have Fun"") organize the festive plight the locals so love, spreading the dark spirit around the world. But Jack is in one of those phases of life where everyone questions themselves. On a walk in search of what may be his epiphany, he discovers a peculiar colored door: green, shaped like a tree, with colorful acorns and a star at its tip. Jack discovers Christmas Town.When we think of horror aimed at children, The Nightmare Before Christmas is the first work we imagine, always associated with the name of Tim Burton. Despite not being exactly a horror movie, we have, in the creation of this universe, a fantastic gothic feeling that assimilates many of the worst nightmares that children have, without ever causing repulsion, but without being easily digestible by them. For the kids Jack's Strange World frightens as much as it delights, allowing the tape to be an unforgettable milestone in their childhood. The name of Tim Burton, producer of the film, although not related to the direction, the responsibility of Henry Sellick, remains quite highlighted and in a fair way, as he has credit for the creation of the story and the world, with an aesthetic signature clearly his own. . Most interesting of all, in a behind-the-scenes thought, is the information that the film was produced by Skellington Productions, in a joint venture with Disney Studios. The reality is that, on second thought, it would be extremely complicated for a work with a villain composed of disgusting insects and worms to be directly linked to Disney, which is very different from the company. The creativity of Sellick and Burton, at least, is free from any ties, ready to give rise to a remarkable musical work, with peculiar and extraordinary characteristics in several of the areas in which we can analyze the work.The construction of the world, above all, is one of the great initial successes of the filmmakers. The stop-motion technique, while in other cases it would be an ally for image creation, here it is the basis for what is manufactured in terms of the universe. No wonder that Tim Burton and Henry Sellick would be involved in other animations with this style, such as The Corpse Bride and Coraline and the Secret World. Stop-motion is ""weird"" in itself, deforming nature in a way that doesn't make it rejectable, but extremely special, not to mention charming. Skeleton Jack's Strange World (Chris Sarandon) is an impressive visual composition, giving rise to a stunning contrast when, later, we see the work's protagonist, saddened, discover another universe, and, consequently, discover Christmas. We're talking about a scrawny being, contradicting himself when his posture is so elegant, but his ability to be terrifying is revealed later as he converses with some demonic children in his world.We are so used to thinking of terror, haunting or dark as elements aimed at an adult audience that we forget, or deny the fact that children can also feel fear and, in many cases, like that of little Izabel who discovered a new world to her. Coming across a film about a talking skeleton, much more than frightening or terrifying, ended up highlighting a universe where the different is also appreciated and does not cause any surprise or discomfort, but it becomes loved. Along with very few other examples of animations with details characteristic of horror, The Nightmare Before Christmas integrates small lessons and messages to a film whose visual aspect enchants and surprises precisely because we are so used to accompanying enchanted princesses or inanimate objects coming to life. Here, good intentions can lead to chaos, but knowing we made mistakes is part of the trajectory, and repairing our mistakes becomes even more important than admitting that we made mistakes. It's what we do with our mistakes that counts and, no one can deny that Jack, while creating the greatest chaos that Christmas has ever seen, was sincere and humble enough to look for a way to repair his mistake.Tim Burton's story, at first glance, is not intended to reflect on the breaking of stereotypes, although, in the path he decides to navigate, it begins a subversive thought, in which a monster is capable, as well as any person, of fall in love with a festivity that you didn't know before. The doors are theoretically open for exploring the new. We actually have, despite this anti-conservative surface, a split with thoughts of social integration. Each little world in this created universe is far from the other, reaching the point where the union between two different ones, Halloween and Christmas, causes chaos and not harmony. The onslaught is somewhat tragic, whereas Skeleton Jack fails to translate Christmas into the creatures of Halloween City, failing to be the character Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) who ultimately fixes the mistakes made by the protagonist. Tim Burton's cinema is, in a way, excluding, but not with a malice, arising, however, from a more saddened and pessimistic view of reality. By being seen as different, Tim Burton ends up looking at his own characters, sort of versions of himself, like Edward Scissorhands, and putting them apart from society, which cannot, even at the end of the story, accept them. Children, for example, completely reject Jack's gifts in Strange World.As good a fable as it is, this film takes us to Jack's questions when he finds himself creatively exhausted. On the other hand, we follow the rag doll Sally (Catherine O'Hara, ""Frankenweenie""), whose curiosity complements what the Christmas spirit means so that it never becomes repetitive: a little creativity here; a bit of curiosity over there.But the big difference is in the direction of Henry Selick (""Coraline""), who takes us from Halloween City to Christmas City, composing characteristics of the characters, which are intertwined in the feelings of scary and cuteness. In this story, the stranger not only doesn't fit, but allows himself to be many things. But the central issue in this permissiveness is the problem of putting it above all in favor of self-acceptance. The protagonist Jack has a crisis with Halloween because he should accept himself and so he could also love himself and also be able to love. Soon the character Sally has her narrative counterpoint parallel with her visions, being oppressed by the scientist who created her, in her capacity to self-destruct and build, apart from empathic understanding. She is the symbol of love that the screenwriter is so fond of, as can be seen in the writer's work in the film ""Edwards Scissorhands"". She, Sally, puts fatality in front of Jack's fake, emulative, blind belief. Because in your project there is the ego, even if it glimpses your image, believe in the simplicity of recreating Christmas. The result is that with immoral means, even the convincing innocence in Jack's work, it still doesn't determine his understanding of what Christmas is, much less what happiness is, since the film is almost a theft of festivity, with each party having its way of being happy.Because ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" recreates the Christmas spirit with the traditional gothic touches of Burton and Selick, without failing, with that, to lose its essence. Counting on the subtlety of the director and the inventiveness of the creator of this story, the apex of the film is precisely when we discover that the Christmas spirit here is also present in the union of individuals, whoever they may be. But what moves the most in the film is Sally's platonic passion (voice of Catherine O'Hara), a kind of monster of Frankenstein who is treated like a daughter by the mad scientist Dr. Finklestein (voice of William Hickey), for Jack. The most sensitive songs are on account of Sally, but the best ones are on account of Boggarts (voice of Ken Page), including the best musical number too, with a backdrop full of fluorescent colors. By the way, the entire art direction of the film is fantastic.Technical elements aside, the movie's greatest asset is really its brilliant story. Able to please the whole family, the tale of the skeleton who wanted to be Santa Claus for a day takes us back to the famous popular saying that people are what they are born for. In Jack's case, he passes on and renounces his status as the horror king in search of a world he has discovered and idealized and which he thinks is happy in it. And it will be from this new perception that he will look back and value his own universe and his real condition, as well as all of Burton's characters who look for nothing but ways to be happy. And isn't that exactly what we're all looking for? And that we are often blinded by the discoveries we make and only later realize the reality? That would be a good thought for everyone who comes to see the movie. Analogies aside, The Nightmare Before Christmas works very well as entertainment. A great movie that came from the imagination of a great character creator and excellent storyteller.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
106,itamarscomix,Always one of my favorites,9,19 November 2011,"I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time when it was released for the first time; I was nine years old. Growing up in a country where whatever knowledge I had of Christmas and Halloween came from American TV, I missed a lot of the jokes and a lot of the references, but I enjoyed the colorful characters, zany adventure and dark slapstick. I loved it.I watched it again when I was 16 and going to art school, during a lecture about adult animation. This time I enjoyed the stylish design, the meticulously made stop-motion animation and the infectious songs. Loved it.And I watched it for a third time when I was 22 and studying design. I now knew the careers of both Henry Selick and Tim Burton back to front, and could appreciate just how much of a landmark the film was for both of them. I could also appreciate the subtle pokes at American culture, and the clever homage to both classic animated Christmas specials and German expressionist cinema. Loved it.I now tend to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas approximately once a year. It's not a tradition or anything, I still don't celebrate Christmas or Halloween. There just always seems to be some good reason to watch it, as it's one of the shortest, quickest, and most enjoyable of my all time favorite films. And I enjoy it every time. It's wildly imaginative, beautifully animated in stop-motion animation that isn't likely to age any time soon, gorgeously designed and wonderfully scored. It refused to acknowledge the idea that an animated film has to make a choice between kids' and adults' animation; it's directed at mature and intelligent kids, and at young-at-heart adults, two years before Pixar started making films that made the same choice.Most of all, The Nightmare Before Christmas remains one of a kind. Burton tried to recreate the magic with Corpse Bride and failed miserably. It's funny, it's filled with sarcasm but also surprisingly touching and idealistic. It's the best movie Tim Burton never made, and it will always be one of my all time favorites.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
107,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,A terrifying classic full of wonder and imagination that captivated us back at the 90's,10,29 October 2013,"Growing up in the 90's, I never heard of Tim Burton until a few years later, as a teenage, I watched most of them, but while some of his films are good, I think that the best Burton film would have to be this, a stop-motion animated film about a pumpkin king who turns Halloween into Christmas.Now, when I had the VHS copy of this film, I got really terrified at most parts in which they're very scary, but to my surprise, it was a well-put together film and it's a classic that still holds up to today on it's 20th anniversary. My only nitpick is that it's a bit too short, but there's a lot of good things about this classic.The story is original and a nice concept that is well-done. The animation is great and the visuals are solid. From Halloween Town to the North Pole and everything else is detailed very nicely. The character models are great and the characters themselves are great too. Not to mention the voice acting for the characters is really impressive.Chris Sarandon and Catherine O'Hara as Jack Skellington and Sally, the rag doll, are great and the romance between them is so cute. The other characters are well-voiced, but Oogie Boogie steals the show for being an entertaining villain voiced perfectly by Ken Page (who voiced King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven). The singing voice for Jack from Danny Elfman is great and in fact, the songs are very catchy in an animated musical since the times of Disney.""This Is Halloween"", ""What's This?"", ""Sally's Song"", and ""The Oogie Boogie Song"" along with others are catchy and memorable to this day. The music score from Danny Elfman is great with a mixture of dark, Gothic, whimsical, and comedic that is done perfectly well. The tone is solid too with it's dark and scary moments and it's hilarious and light- hearted moments.Overall, A Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic worth recommending to those who haven't seen it yet before Halloween will end and will always be a classic to those who grew up with it.

108,Atreyu_II,Not a Holiday film like the others,5,12 November 2011,"While this movie may be great for those who don't want the traditional Christmas movie, it was a little too much for my tastes. Maybe I'd have to be a real fan of Tim Burton's work to truly appreciate his ""nightmare before Christmas"".Like it or not, one can't deny that this movie has no lack of originality and weirdness (the director's specialty). It surely was innovative for its time and looks unique even now - although it may have gotten some inspiration from the director's own 'Vincent' (1982).The visuals are great, original, strange and eccentric but the creatures are of bad taste: deformed monsters, undead people/monsters, ghosts, goblins, werewolves, witches...",The Nightmare Before Christmas
109,mario_c,It has a very simple plot but it's visually stunning,7,30 July 2013,"This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and ""worlds"" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mind and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genre Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
110,Mightyzebra,One enjoyable Halloween film!,8,3 November 2007,"Capturing the eye and and the attention of the watcher, this film has a magical, somewhat scary quality. It has beautiful puppet animation with skeletons, ghouls and even pleasant things such as Father Christmas. The songs are very imaginative - bouncy yet flowing and not necessarily rhyming. The characters are also very engaging and lively - especially Jack Skellington himself and Oogie Boogie. The plot keeps twisting and turning in a good way as a plot should - and many things don't happen that happen in many children's films, past and present. One flaw of this film is that it is a little scary and this may put off young children. This film also feels surprisingly short - despite being a full-length feature film. Otherwise, a perfect Halloween and Christmas film! :-)The main character is Jack Skellington, a skeleton, who is extremely good at scaring people at Halloween. He lives in Halloween Town, with vampires, werewolves and other scary creatures and people. Jack wishes for some other life where he does not have to hear screams and scare people and that is when he discovers the wonderous Christmas Town...A good treat for every person who likes animated films -especially those who are aged 7 and up.

111,TheOtherFool,They should play this every year 'round Christmas time...,8,3 April 2004,"...but, in fact, as far as I know, it's never been played on Dutch TV. Such a shame, as it is one of the best Christmas' movies of all time.Meet Jack Skellington, a (you guessed it) skeleton who lives in Halloween-town and makes kids scare on Halloween, year in year out. But Jack wants something more in life, and finds out about Christmas. Now that's a fun holiday! So he decides to kidnap Santa and take over his role. He does it with the best intentions (as far as kidnapping goes), but everything goes wrong... The kids aren't really happy with the presents (as they are more like scary monsters instead of Teddy bears) and Santa winds up in the hands of the evil Boogyman. Is there time to turn it all back?Tim Burton's characters and ideas are really amazing. Though a bit scary for the youngest, Halloween-town looks great. The story is really touching and the songs are some of the best the movies ever gave to us (Danny Elfman not only wrote the music, but sings on this one as well!). It's one of those movies you actually want to end well. Watch it and maybe you'll fall for it too...8/10.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
112,Movie-12,One of the most memorable holiday classics of all time. A visual masterpiece. ***1/2 out of ****.,9,14 March 2000,"THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS / (1993) ***1/2Starring the voices of: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, Ken Page, Ed Ivory, and William Hickey Directed by Henry Celiac. Written by Michael McDowell. Running time: 76 minutes. Rated PG (for horrific images and some animated violence).	Tim Burton seems like the only being on the planet who could come with characters such as the ones found in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" The feature is literally a tale likely to be found in a child's dreams. It creates a world of its own, inhabiting unforgettable characters and events that should be shared with generations. This film is a visual masterpiece; a movie that deserves to be a holiday favorite for some time to come.
	The atmosphere director Henry Celiac captures in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is truly breathtaking. The cities and setting in which these characters live are visually perplexing, yet descriptive and develop the production's mood perfectly. We, as audiences starving for originality and imagination, are able to enter a scope so believable and unrelentingly convincing we lust for every last minute of it.The movie's protagonist is Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of the holiday town of Halloween. Jack is the role model for much of the cities population. The only problem is that Jack has been around for ages, parked in a town where every single year builds up for a conventional holiday, Halloween. This character has grown depressed and saddened by the routine living style he inhabits. We learn of his passion for new events and a and new life through a musical number that is both effective and engaging.Later on that vary night, Jack wonders off into a nearby woods and stumbles upon an area surrounded with magical doors leading to specific holiday worlds. Jack, blooming with curiosity, enters Christmas town: a joyful, happy place with snow, glitter, children singing, and colorful lights decorating the village in its entirety. Jack is mystified by the glamorous atmosphere, and rushes home to tell the Town of Halloween about his adventures.	We realize the internalconflict is Jack's boredom of routine. This becomes more complex when he tries to figure out the meaning of Christmas. The external problem comes later in the plot, where we predict an uneasy disaster upcoming due to his intentions of recreating Christmas in Halloween style.Other key characters are Sally, the puppet-like creation of an angry professor, the city's Mayor who has a head for both his good and bad personality, the Oggie Boogie, the film's villain who is everything we ever dreamed of regarding a diabolical animated bad guy, and the inevitable character of Santa Clause.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not necessarily a children's movie, it might be too strange or fanatical for the very young. It is certainly a musical production, and at times, I felt that the songs replaced essential development. However, the musical numbers are challenging and memorable, containing passion and emotion. The picture is a walk into the mind of some of the most wildly imaginative filmmakers of our time. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is titled wonderfully, although the film is truly not a nightmare, but a dream--a dream brought to life on the big screen.

113,griffolyon12,A truly imaginative experience!,10,24 October 2007,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful film. The original story was sprung from the imagination of Tim Burton, but has a slightly lighter tone than his other works. The Nightmare Before Christmas takes places in the town of Halloween where every inhabitant is a monster, or creature of sorts. The story follows Jack Skellington, a skeleton who is also the Pumpkin King and is a highly gifted scarer, he is viewed as the town hero. Jack is getting tired of Halloween and one day he stumbles into Christmas Town. After this Jack obsesses over Christmas and decides to try and recreate Christmas in Halloween Town.The film is wonderfully directed, and the script is very intelligent and funny. The voice acting is all really top notch. This movie is one of the most imaginative films I've ever seen. Each frame is full of magnificent wonder. The real showstopper is the music by Danny Elfman, in case you don't know this movie is a musical. All of the songs are well sung and are very catchy, you'll be singing them for hours (my personal favorites are: Jack's Lament, Poor Jack, and What's This). Danny Elfman's voice suits Jack perfectly, he is a very good singer.Overall this is a great imaginative film and is very, very fun. If you haven't seen it yet you need to try and get your hands on a copy, you wont regret it.Score: A 10 out of 10!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

I've never seen stop-motion photography like this before. The film is simply a marvel to the human eye. The score by Danny Elfman is amazing and is the most beautiful component of this film. Since nobody makes musicals anymore, it's always nice to sit thru a well made animated picture because it harkens back to old Hollywood musicals. Danny Elfman is one of the most brilliant composers working in film today and this just might be his masterwork. What a pure and magical film.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

116,RossRivero99,One of Burton's very best films,9,17 October 2014,"The Nightmare Before Christmas from my perspective is supposed to be a parody of the classic and poetic Christmas story Twas the night before Christmas. The movie is an animated character study about Jack Skellington (voiced by Danny Elfman) who is the king of Halloweentown who tries to visit another town by the name of Christmastown but does not understand what the idea of Christmas is. Burton is funny with the way he describes his characters with his first clay-mation movie and how he makes them come to life, but it was a huge surprise to me that even though Tim Burton wrote the screenplay to this film the big shame is that he didn't direct it as well but don't get me wrong Henry Selick still did a good job with directing this movie. The acting in this film reminds me of the acting in the clay-mation film Mad Monster Party (1967). But in the end it is one of the best movies of 1993 as well as being one of Disney's great animated triumphs along with the Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and much much more.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
117,meydiana-65242,"Spooky, Musical Cartoon Movie!",10,8 March 2021,"This movie is awesome. Very few people I know have the patience to take all of the frames required for even just a minute. I know how long it takes to animate something because I have experience in that form of film making, although I made three minute YouTube videos and not a whole movie. There's also a lot that can go wrong when animating, such as the figure falling, even if it's held down.
It also has outstanding songs. Songs like ""This is Halloween"" And ""Town Meeting"" show how the town thinks, while ""Jack's Lament"" and ""What's This"" show how jack feels for most of the film. My favorite song from this movie, though, is Oogie Boogie's song. There's something about how he sings it that makes it better every time I hear it.

121,SquigglyCrunch,Great Visuals Shadowed by Poor Storytelling,6,27 December 2016,"The Nightmare Before Christmas follows Jack Skellington, a skeleton leading Halloween town who, after having another successful Hallowe'en, discovers Christmas and becomes obsessed with introducing the holiday into his world. The visuals are, to be expected, great. It's a creepy Tim Burton clay-mation movie, what do you expect? The way in which it is done screams the 90s, but despite it's age it holds up very well regardless. The soundtrack is a lot of fun, specifically the opening song. The rest of the songs are worked into the movie very well, and I never dreaded listening to any of them when they did come up. Furthermore, they actually contributed to the story in most cases, so I had to listen anywayHowever, without the visuals this would be a very poor movie. The writing is unnatural a lot of the time, and it features an incredibly forced, out-of-nowhere ending scene. On top of that, there are several points throughout the movie where certain events happen for no reason. Jack and other characters know things they never had the opportunity to learn. Sure, we as the audience can piece together that they went to some other character and figured it out, but because that is never shown and it is somewhat important that they do because of how it will affect the story, I have to assume that they didn't happen and that the writers just didn't know what to do because they were running out of time. Despite this, I more or less enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't say it's good, but it's worth a watch. I'll probably never see it again, and in the end I wouldn't really recommend it.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
122,elicopperman,An Entertaining Tribute to Two Distinct Holidays,7,20 October 2018,"I don't think I need to describe this film, since everyone knows that this was the brain child of Tim Burton while he was working at Disney. Sure, Henry Selick ended up directing it and not Burton himself due to his busy schedule, but there's a reason everyone calls it a Burtonesque masterpiece. Only someone as strange as him could've thought up an idea for a film where both Halloween and Christmas come together to tell a story. Now with all of that said, I totally get why people love this movie, but I personally deem it as just enjoyable more than anything else.Right off the bat, the animation really makes this movie come to life. The numerous creatures of Halloween Town look like they came right out of the mind of an imaginative soul obsessed with the macabre, and they translate very well to stop-motion. In addition, the character animation is quite fluent and lively, as each distinct spook acts differently from one another depending on their physical appearance. The contrasting sets consisting of the creepy and dark looking Halloween Town and the bright and colorful Christmas Town also deserves much praise for the usage of strong lighting and cinematography. Also, the moments of composited hand-drawn animated ghouls add a variety of styles to the film without going overboard.That being said though, as beautiful as the film looks, the story itself is not as strong. The film centers around the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, who wants something new besides celebrating Halloween. Once he discovers Christmas, he wants to embrace the holiday but then ends up realizing the grass is always greener on the other side. This kind of story is really weak in concept, and the plot itself is rather practicable. However, the execution is what elevates the feature, as it's told through musical numbers and just exploring the fantasies of each holiday. The film manages to blend holiday cheer and grim humor together to build off the conflicting views of the two dreamlike lands through creative visual artistry and gags.As for the characters themselves, Jack is well meaning in his desire for something new, but his ambitions make him too naive for his own good. It's funny how Disney tells us that we can do whatever we dream when this film's moral proves that isn't always the case. Sally works well as the film's pure voice of reason by desiring excitement while being concerned for Jack's well being. The other characters range from demanding yet too self obsessed like Dr. Finklestein and the Mayor, to malicious and annoying like Lock, Shock and Barrel, to bland yet wise like Santa Claus. The only other memorable character in the film has to be Oogie Boogie, mainly due to his delightfully charismatic performance reminiscent to that of a Cab Calloway performance in a Betty Book cartoon, although his motives don't seem to be fully touched upon.Lastly, the songs by Danny Elfman work as both storytelling devices and entertaining melodies on their own. Some set the mood of the individual fantasy world like This Is Halloween or What's This, while others establish the characters and their inner feelings like Jack's Lament, Sally's Song and Poor Jack (yeah, the titles suck, but what can you do?). But without a doubt, the song that steals the show is Oogie Boogie's Song, as it displays the coolest and most creative visuals in the entire film whilst being highly entertaining and camp in its own regard. No matter how you feel about any of the songs, nothing else could have elevated the paper thin story as much as them, for they add all the necessary momentum and entertainment value needed for a film like this.So overall, while I wouldn't put The Nightmare Before Christmas on as high of a pedestal as others would, I still find it to be an entertaining experience to watch during two different times of the year. Even if the story is relatively simple and the characters are hit or miss, the originality expressed through the visuals, comedy, music and mix of the aforementioned holidays makes the whole feature worth a watch. I hope whoever loves this film has the time of their life rewatching it again during this month...or in the next two months, give or take. As for me, while I have seen better animated films in the horror fantasy genre, this still reflects the fun side of Halloween and Christmas like never before.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

In Tim Burton's latest production, the film is about two worlds joining together in a wrecking mayhem.Jack the Pumpkin King is the leader of ""Halloween Town"" where every Halloween, his band of misfit monsters would go and scare all the children in the world; as much as he's fed up of scaring people, Jack wants to find out about the other traditions that people celebrate and finds out the Christmas is the one he likes as he sees the snow dropping from the sky, to a decorate Christmas tree with children playing inside houses, he wants to adopt the tradition into the Halloween world where everything is chaos as the little monsters kidnap Santa Claus and take him hostage where Jack takes the place of Santa putting monsters in stockings.

125,baileycrawly,A Certified Classic,10,11 August 2020,"As a young child who never really fit in anywhere, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas was really my gateway into the zany, dark mind of Burton and Elfman. The first time I watched this movie was like taking the very same journey with Jack, only instead of trying to find something new and exciting, I was trying to find where I fit in and where I belonged, and I quickly found myself at home amid Tim Burton and his creations.This is another one of those cult-following-years-later kind of movie and, honestly, it deserves its second life more than perhaps any of the others. It may have come out in 1993, but Selick and his team, in partnership with Tim Burton, created a truly amazing masterpiece. The sets are so carefully and lovingly constructed, down to the very last minute detail which creates an immersive, creepy atmosphere that is both spooky fun for kids and alluring nostalgic comfort food for adults. The animation is so meticulously crafted that it's easy to forget you're watching a stop-motion animated film - especially one from 1993. Stop-Motion is a hit-or-miss format that can easily be as much of a distraction from the film as it is an addition, but it serves to perfectly add to the charm of the film in this case.
The music for this movie is exquisite as well. Of course, having Oingo Boingo's Danny Elfman at the helm, it's almost guaranteed to be as close to perfect as you could possibly get. In this musical film where the songs play an integral part, the songs are not only infectiously catchy and appropriate to each scene, but they were also written by Elfman without ever actually seeing cuts of finished film. Burton would meet with Elfman and discuss what was happening in the movie, and then Burton would go away and get a song that corresponded with that a shorty time later, which is a testament to Danny Elfman's genius. Between the two of them, they created something that will outlive all of us.The plot is paper-thin, but that's because it's all it needs to be.
Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, gets tired of doing the same old thing over and over again, so he decides to go out in search of something different. He quickly decides to take over Christmas, but it's not long before he realizes that the grass isn't quite as green on the other side as he may have thought it was.It's a very simple story and a simple message, and it's something that's every bit as important today as it was the day it was written.It's quite rare for a movie to come along that got this many things right, whee you can watch the movie without pointing out multiple errors and instead just enjoy it. From the very beginning on VHS to the most recent HD digital transfers, this movie has been a special experience that I've cherished and loved going back to again and again and again.Plus, it's acceptable to watch at both Halloween and Christmas, with a pumpkin spice beverage and then a gingerbread one.

126,chrisbrown6453,Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a technical marvel.,6,18 June 2002,"It is doubtful that you have ever experienced anything quite like it. Whether you'll like it or not, however, is a highly personal matter. It is 74 minutes of stop-motion animation, and that may prove to be 70 minutes too many for some. At first, it is fascinating to watch this brilliantly visual fairy tale unfurl. After the novelty wears off, however, there isn't all that much to rivet your attention. The music by immensely talented Danny Elfman grows wearisome, and the songs all sound pretty much alike. Just when you're about to doze off, however, another marvelous visual (such as a multicolored snake swallowing an aluminum Christmas tree) smacks you in the face, and you're hooked once again. The Nightmare Before Christmas tells the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Land, a skinny skeleton named Jack, who discovers Christmas Land quite by accident. This bright and cheerful sugar plum place is a far cry from Jack's dark world of ghouls and goblins. He is impressed and decides to make Christmas his own holiday. Santa Claus is kidnapped, and soon Jack is airborne in a sleigh guided by Zero, the red-nosed ghost dog, delivering gifts to kiddies around the world. Too bad some of these toys bite back and are scaring the wee ones out of their wits. Will Jack come to his senses in time to save Christmas? Will Santa be saved? Will Jack finally take notice of the adoring Sally, a rag-doll version of the Bride of Frankenstein? Will young children have nightmares after seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas?

127,DavidSim240183,A marvellously ghoulish Christmas fable,10,11 November 2006,"Tim Burton really is one of the great filmmakers of our time. What makes him so unique is the fact that he creates offbeat, quirky films that still speaks to a mainstream audience without compromising his vision. Nearly all of his films have been big hits, and the ones that haven't have gathered cult followings to become just as popular. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perfect example. It performed poorly at the box office when released in 1993, but over the years it's gathered considerable popularity with a diverse audience. And so it should.The Nightmare Before Christmas is an extremely unusual film because unlike other holiday themed classics, it pulls off with effortless regard the seemingly impossible task of combining two completely disparate holidays, Christmas and Halloween.This is quite an ingenious creative decision, because it's a film that doesn't just lend itself to one particular time of the year. It fits in perfectly on 31st October and 25th December.Also it is a true classic. An extraordinary variety of creative talent went into its production. Despite what some advertisers would have us believe, TNBC was not directed by Burton, although his vision is always ever-present. Henry Selick was the man who directed. And he did a superb job.TNBC has the honour of being the first feature-length stop-motion animated film. And its clearly an environment Selick knows well. The animation lends the world of HalloweenTown a fantastical, unreal look. As well as scored superbly by Danny Elfman, providing 10 classic songs, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wondrous flight of fancy that positively soars.Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King (voiced by Chris Sarandon) is the lord and master of HalloweenTown. A sort of stick figure skeleton with a heart of gold, its been his job to oversee Halloween year in and year out. But now its gotten to the point where it gives him no satisfaction. Until one day, he stumbles across a grove in the woods with trees with different doors and symbols on them. Jack goes through the one with a Christmas tree on it, and is deposited in ChristmasLand.Jack is overjoyed and mesmerised by the bright lights, endless good cheer and mountains of snow. When he returns to HalloweenTown, he spreads the word to the citizens they will be taking over Christmas this year. But Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), a patched together woman made by a Frankenstein like doctor, has a premonition that Christmas will end in disaster this year if they go through with this. But Jack is so sure of himself. And has Father Christmas kidnapped so he can take his place.The people of HalloweenTown put together their own idea of Christmas presents. Which consists of giant snakes, evil ducks and severed heads. When Jack sets off on Christmas Eve, it goes exactly as Sally predicted. Jack wouldn't hurt a fly, but he unwittingly turns Christmas into a night of terror and mayhem.The Nightmare Before Christmas really is a fantastic fable. Imaginatively realised, Tim Burton has fashioned a world so unique and fascinating, it would take multiple viewings to savour all the details. HalloweenTown is an extraordinary metropolis of striped corners, curlicue hills and Gothic horrors. It probably wouldn't be half as entertaining if it were simple hand drawn animation. The fact that its stop-motion makes it seem all the more magical.All of the characters are memorable. Jack is an amusing character, as well as someone who has equal parts pathos. As usual with a Tim Burton film, his sympathies are with the outsiders. Jack is someone who has a world all his own to lord over, a world of freaks, misfits and outcasts. But when he discovers the more normal world of Christmas, he longs to be a part of that world. And ends up being shunned by it when he turns it into a mockery of what it represents. The latter half is like something out of Gremlins. An endless parade of escalating chaos, disasters and utter lunacy.Sally is also a likable character. Sort of similar to Edward Scissorhands, with a nasty habit of her parts coming off, and having to be sewed back on by her master (a man with a hinged scalp that allows him to wrack his brain, literally!). Her unrequited love for Jack is touching, and all the more remarkable considering it was accomplished through stop-motion.Special mention should also go to the Oogie-Boogie Man. He is Jack's arch-enemy. A living collection of insects and bugs that lives in a cross between a ghost-train ride and a casino. The Oogie-Boogie Man is a wonderfully malevolent creation. His final fight with Jack is both tense and well orchestrated. Complete with playing cards who have real swords!It all ends on a suitably happy note with Jack seeing the error of his ways, Father Christmas cleaning up the mess he made, and Jack rediscovering his love for both Halloween and Sally. Their final scene illuminated in front of a full moon is beautiful and shows what stop-motion can be capable of when given the chance.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful confection. Endearing characters, terrific songs, and a perfect running time ensure boredom is kept at bay, and pure fun and enjoyment is had.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
128,lagudafuad,wonderful,8,25 December 2012,"Ironically this is my favorite of all Christmas Cartoons, I cherish each time I spend watching this movie, it is my all time Christmas recipe to a Merry Christmas. Leave it to the team at Halloween Town to make jingle bells sound dead and horrific. Based on a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a musical fantasy horror stop motion animation, which features the Stop Motion director Henry Selick (James and The Giant Peach and Coraline 2009).Disney first decided to make this movie as a short 30 minutes TV movie, but later decided to go ahead and make a full length animation but released it under their Touchstone Pictures Distribution name and not under their Walt Disney name because they feared, since it was a dark horror animation it will not be well received. The Nightmare Before Christmas became a hit critically and commercially, and Burton has had a time convincing Disney to drop the idea of a sequel whenever it came up.The movie plot is about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, who was bored of doing the same thing over again, year in year out he has remained the pumpkin king, so on one lonely stroll he stumbled on Christmas town, saw the joy all around and decided to give Santa Claus a vacation, by kidnapping him, and he breathed a new dawn into Halloween Town where they will take over Christmas and Halloween it up.Due to Burton's busy schedule working on Batman Returns he was not available to direct this movie so Henry Selick was called upon to do the honors. The maker constructed 227 puppets for the film and Jack himself having close to four hundred heads to display his speech and emotions. With most of the film being songs, the voice of Jack was played by Chris Sarandon for speech and Danny Elfman the film's composer provided Jack's singing voice.The Nightmare Before Christmas was a critical success as previously said, holding a rating of 96% in Rotten Tomatoes and making over 75 million dollars in the box office, compared to its 18 million production cost and due to its wide acceptance Disney has reissued the film under their Disney Digital 3-D format, it then became the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3-D.Here is a classic Christmas drama about Santa coming to the rescue, Jack Skellington and the crew of Halloween town, are always ready to welcome you whenever you come watching, just be careful to stay away from the Oogie Boogie man, and buy this DVD.www.lagsreviews.com",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The scene where Sandy Claws lets it snow in Halloween town tells me that there is no 'bad holiday' or 'better holiday'. Each holiday celebrates different traditions and emotions. I do not have to find 'deep meaning' as Jack Skellington tries. It is what it is; I just have to enjoy Halloween and Christmas.Halloween is related to fear, creepiness, and loneliness, and by Jack Skellington saving Sandy Claws at the end to save Christmas for all, the director treats those feelings neutral, no negative connotation. Just as Jack is not the villain in this movie.

For a movie to be ""bi-seasonal"" like that, to me, is an amazing thing. And this semi-Tim Burton venture is not just for kids, it's for anybody. The story, while geared to two particular seasons, is accessible all year 'round, and the stop-motion animation will both take your breath away and leave you sympathetic to the devoted geniuses who had to pose the little figurines for each frame. Generally, this film's naysayers come from two places: they either dislike Tim Burton or dislike stop-motion (or animation in general).

134,OttoVonB,Certified 100% Pure Burton,10,1 March 2002,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is the most ""Tim Burton""-y film ever made, which is slightly unfair, as it was directed by veteran animator Henry Selick. Yet it represents nothing less than the fullest, most successful expression of his style and themes, not to mention one of the finest animated feature films ever made.The citizens of Halloween Town are in a bit of a funk: they need something new. Our hero, Jack, the Pumpkin King, stumbles across a portal to Christmas Town and returns entrances, having misinterpreted everything about that other holiday, and decides to import it back home. A hilarious degree of failure ensues.Beyond it's original story and wonderful characters, It's hard to understate how important this film is: Tim Burton's style has always been distinctive but never before or since has the world of animation allowed an artist to explore his style to its limits on such a budget and scale. The animation and visuals are top-notch, a jewel in Selick's already distinguished career. The design is what really makes this endure, and the inventiveness on display sets a new standard. Also pulling more than his usual weight is Danny Elfman, who composes and performs songs more memorable than anything in Disney's recent catalog, as well as his finest score.Even if you manage to overlook the virtuoso craftsmanship on display, you are left with a great tale, and characters you will fight hard not to fall in love with, particularly as they insist on not learning from any of their mistakes.Just do yourself a favor, and see it now!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
135,La Gremlin,An all-too-rare treasure.,9,9 March 2001,"One thing animators are able to do is create entire alternate universes from scratch.  And, sadly, they very rarely take advantage of this ability.  The best animated films are like travelogues filmed on location in other worlds, and one of the most downright astonishing of these worlds is to be seen in ""the Nightmare Before Christmas"".This would be an amazing movie anyway because of it's stop-motion animation, a dying art if there ever was one.  However, the story, characters and music are equaly memorable.  It doesn't hurt that Halloween and Christmas happen to be the two bookends of an annual period of holiday season euphoria for yours truly.  This, of course, is one of the movies I always must watch every holiday season to get myself in the spirit.Be sure to get the ""Special Edition"" video, by the way.  It's letterboxed and includes the two Tim Burton shorts ""Vincent"" (which looks excactly like an Edward Gorey book come to life) and ""Frankenweenie"" (a sublimely hilarious tribute to Shelly).",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The voice acting is a bit funny from time to time bit the songs, story and visuals are all perfect. You can really tell the work they put into the film. Watching it I saw so many small intricacies and I had to remind myself it was all stop motion. They really are putting in all that stuff just to make it look cooler. The story is unique and the parts with Boogie truly are still a bit scary even today. I remember watching it when I was younger and thinking he was scary then and a small bit of it comes back to me know when I watch it.

It is dark, it is gray, it is kinda spooky and kinda Frankenstein meets some Disney cartoon. It is especially notable in the two main figures in it. And the figures of them and everyone else in the film is just awesomely done! Hands down, it is perfect.I may not be sure if it is appropriate for the kids and if they would understand it, but for adults it may be a bit 'too childish' if you only expect some scare or to be more 'mature' ( though I guess the main theme of love is mature in itself).The only thing that I did not quite like ( though it is not that I disliked it completely) is the singing / musical part.

139,jldmp1,Worlds In Collision,6,19 February 2006,"Another collision of the Burton visual world vs. the Elfman musical world.Here, by giving directorial control away, Burton's vision suffers an irretrievable loss of focus. Halloween, of course, has no musical narrative to accompany it...so all we as a society have are movie ideas (Rocky Horror, all the monster features) to hold it together. Before movies, all we had were literary ones (Frankenstein, Bram Stoker). This is Burton's home world, lacking real people, but encompassing 'puppets controlled by minds'-- a world of art.Fundamentally, Christmas is a musical world -- Elfman's milieu -- just think of any Christmas song and all the imagery you need is there. The literary/movie narratives just accrete and grow bigger each year, a 'snowball'. In modern times, the exterior has been all crass commercialism -- the visuals rooted in musical notions ('jingles').The collision is oil vs. water -- you can shake it, but eventually the mixture separates. Burton, the Pumpkin King, has to resign to his fate. This is the necessary essay before the successful marriage achieved in ""Corpse Bride"".",The Nightmare Before Christmas

On the one hand, the stop motion techniques are brilliantly done and the voice cast works well together. Even the peculiar songs from the film are quite catchy.But then again it is a bit too dark and sometimes, downright creepy to be considered a Christmas movie. The characters are unique and it is cleverly written, but it is very cold hearted and probably won't appeal to the young.I still have mixed feelings but many of the other users seem to have enjoyed the film.

141,refresh_daemon,A good film; just don't expect a masterpiece,7,14 November 2006,"I'd never seen this film until recently, although I'd heard a lot about it. After watching it, I can safely say that it has a dark tone to it, and yet also has a place for some degree of warmth. It's not a black-hearted or darkly spirited movie. It's a children's film. It's also a musical. A stop-motion musical with things that go bump in the night and their attempt at Christmas.I have to say that the imagery in the film is striking. The entire look of the piece is instantly memorable and the songs and dialogue and everything else really just come together in such a way that it's a complete vision being presented. The end result isn't a masterwork however. It lacks the resonance of a real masterpiece of expression, rather being more of a cute and enjoyable, even if limited, spectacle.This was clearly an inspired work, visually, but the story is a simple one: the pumpkin king finds his awesomeness in Halloween boring, discovers Christmasland and then the story proceeds from there. But the end impact of the film doesn't have a lot for Jack and the residents of Halloweentown and Jack is the only character that really develops (and not a whole lot).But it has a couple fun songs, plenty of wonderful visuals and doesn't particularly grate. Jack is the second best expressive stop-motion character that I've seen, after Nick Park's Gromit. A good film; just don't expect a masterpiece. 7/10.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
142,Jacques98,A review written for anyone who didn't grow up with this movie.,6,30 October 2008,"I'll just put it this way: I didn't grow up on The Nightmare Before Christmas and, honestly, viewing it now, I don't get why it's so hyped up. I can understand how someone who saw it in their childhood, or even someone who saw it when it first came out, would consider it classic, but for someone who didn't, it just seems forgettable. I saw The Corpse Bride before seeing this, and I thought it was better in every way imaginable.I'm not going to smash childhood memories and trash the film, because, really, there is nothing wrong with it. It's imaginative and fun, with a great plot and interesting characters. Unlike Tim Burton's live-action movies, there is very few clichés. The fantasy word he creates is rich, vivid, and unlike any other.Now why I didn't like it: For 1993, the animation was top notch. For 2008, anyone first coming into this movie is going to think it looks pathetic, which I did. It just takes you away from the overall experience. On an animation scale, comparing this to Wall-E is like comparing The Blob to Transformers. It's such a huge gap, it's almost impossible to ignore.It lacks a high entertainment value. Why? I don't really know, but I have read other reviews that agree with me. Maybe it would have been better if it wasn't a musical.Except for a few songs, a lot of the songs just aren't . . . good. Some of them even felt gimmicky and there to characterize (such as Oogie Boogie's song). The majority of the songs are just unnecessary and don't drive the plot or characterization whatsoever.Overall, being someone who literally just saw this movie for the first time a few hours ago, I was let down. I can understand why people who grew up with it would love it, but those people also need to understand why people who didn't may not enjoy it as much. I personally prefer animated children's horror such as Monster House over this because it has higher entertainment value.6/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Now, I have seen this numerous times! My cousin gave me his DVD and now this is ""our"" movie-we discuss it a lot. I can't count how many times I have seen it-it's probably double digits! However, i must say that little kids should not see this until they are about 6 or 7, or until they understand that it is just a cartoon and not real. Songs like This Is Halloween or Kidnap The Sandy Claws and countless images throughout the movies can scare children-hence why it was one of the few Disney movies of the time to get a a PG rating.

144,Darkjak007,Hail to the pumpkin King,8,1 November 2021,"Directed by henry Selleck The nightmare before Christmas takes us to a world where all the holidays coexist in the same universe. Through a magic forest through magic doors we enter the world of Halloween town where, it's Halloween 24 seven everything is dark morbidly Gothic and creepy. It's here we meet the pumpkin king himself jack Skellington who everyone adore and respects for keeping the spirit of Halloween alive and well. However Jack himself feels That after year after year of doing the same routine he feels that his life has grown tiresome and bored he wishes for something different. That's when he accidentally comes across one of the doors that leads to Christmasworld. Where he discovers the concept of Christmas and Santa Claus. Now Jack inspired wrapped by Curiosity wants to hiJack Christmas, and tries to show the world his meaning of Christmas. Honestly I could say what pretty much you've heard from anybody about this movie. The visuals are stunning, it's animation was unique at the time for a feature length film. That to the point ended up launching a small side genre for stop motion animation. The songs are memorable and its characters are memorable. I'm sure you probably heard all that. Despite all those things being true there are still things to be said about the film. It is unique It takes the two most polar opposite holidays and mix it in a unique story that surprisingly works. If anybody tried this now a day it would just not happen. It's been stated that Burtonout right doesn't want any sequel
to this, because he sees it pointless and would possibly tarnish this film. This film is a one shot thing that could never be captured twice. I like that it doesn't really feel dated even after all these years alot of the dialogue does come genuine with having to resort to such things as pop cultureal references. There are quite some clever in jokes like the mayor literally being a two faced politician. When speaking of the character Jack himself while unknowingly in the the wrong,about taking over Christmas he does have good attentions, and he tries to grasp the concept. All he really wants is this something different in his life it doesn't make me a bad person. Though I do like how he basically says screw it I'm not gonna try to understand it, I'm just gonna do my own thing and it make it better. Jack's actually voice by two actors Chris Sarandon does the speaking role, and Danny Elfman who wrote the songs and score, provides the singing voice. Another of my favorite Moments in the movies when you meet oogie boogie. The whole song number he has stands out to me personally. The rest of the songs they're all difference in their style mirroring each other. From this is Halloweens more dark and spooky and then you have what's this? Which is all bright and colorful really makes it look like you've almost jumped into a completely different story. Though this is the only song that is dark but also tries to mix color in there with the glowing neon and the casino theme. I also just really love oogie boogie I honestly wish he was in more of the movie. That really part of the small issues about the movie it really not that long only like an hour 20 minutes. Certain things like oogie just feel tacked on and brush aside. Such as Jack and sally romance she's a very nice character and rather sad if you think on her situation, but the romance between them is pretty one-sided. I guess that is the overall idea of the film is Jack grows as a character, and realizes want he has. Overall the film is great and while it won't appeal to everybody it does hold as a staple in animation for its creative concept and style. It a film always great to put for the holidays or even whenever.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
145,noahgibbobaker,Amazing visuals and interesting themes.,8,20 November 2020,"Henry Selick's the nightmare before Christmas is phenomenal in many way's, but I don't like the plot all that much. I love the story, I love the themes, but I was never completely investing in what these characters were trying to accomplish.Now I'll get into the good stuff, that is what everyone wants to hear about this movie. Easily my favourite part of the nightmare before christmas is the visuals, I loved all the character design, set design and it all just looked beautiful, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. The animation has aged very well, I found it really charming and it fit with the visuals so well. My favourite scene is when Jack Skellington is singing after coming back to halloween town on halloween night, he stands on the iconic curled up tree thing and it starts to roll out and he walks down it. If you've seen the film you know exactly what I'm talking about.I loved the songs, although I didn't find them as catchy as other people think they are. I found it really impressive that Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon both played Jack Skellington, if I didn't know that both of them voiced him I would have assumed it was one person, it was seamless.I thought this was a really funny movie. Mispronouncing Santa Claus as Sandy Claws is not only funny, but shows how everybody, except for Jack Skellington and Sally, think in halloween town. They haven't experienced joy or happiness because that's not they're job. They scare people, Santa Claus delivers presents, the children in Christmas town open the presents, and the children in halloween town kidnap people and hang out with the boogie man.Another thing I loved was the contrast from the miserable and dark halloween town vs the bright, happy looking christmas town.The surface level themes are pretty great messages to send, especially to a younger audience. It's about embracing who you are, the grass is greener on the other side sort of thing. There is also a kind of interesting deterministic interpretation I had as well. Jack Skellington tries to steal christmas because he wants change, but ultimately he is scary and he wants to scare people, he wants change but he is the way he is and there's no changing that.If you're wondering what deterministic means, basically determinism is the idea that everything is predetermined by previously existing causes. Personally I don't agree with this theory, but I don't fully agree with free will either.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Style over substance could be the best description of what to look out for; so much eye candy, so little plot.""Nightmare"" does not fall into this cliché. This film is absolutely wonderful; the best ever to come out of Tim Burton's creative brain. It's a knockout.The story is truly an original one: what would happen if the Pumpkin King wanted to take over Christmas, too? Starting from there, all sorts of individual implications come out. Why did Jack want to do that? Why was he sad, lonely and depressed? How come the characters are so real that they are not good or bad, merely human, when they are made out of clay? What would the love of Sally be able to accomplish at the end? And how would the nightmare be finally solved?This film solves all this questions beautifully, in a stunning land, where human feelings abound. There is obsession, passion, love, loyalty, courage and humility to be found everywhere, all within the bodies of these wonderful puppets. That a film so artificial can be so profoundly human and moving is no small feat. This is one of my ""10"" movies. Simply perfect.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Astonished by the happiness environment, decides to kidnap Santa and make a Hallowe'en Xmas. A delicious animation musical, full of adventures, love and a refined Gothic black humour. It leaves us the idea that we have to find our place in the world and be happy with it, not trying to be what you are not. This is the main idea, but it is told to us in Burton's way, that is with a very dark humour and in a funny and scaring world. The job of doing it by stop-motion technique makes that the esthetic is unusually good and different to usual, which makes the story more touching; in addition to the enormous work that is working in this way.

I think is one of the most imaginative directors. He had great movies (except ""Planet of the apes"" and ""Sleppy Hollow"").""The nightmare before Christmas"" is the story of Jack, a skeleton who lives in Halloween town. But he is so tired of screams, ghosts and monsters. Suddenly, he discovers a new world for him. The Christmas town. Now he want live the Christmas too ... but the problems begin here. With the incredible music of Danny Elfman, the story of Tim Burton is one of the most imaginative tales of all times.With the wonderful ones Catherine O'Hara and Chris Sarandon, this lovely movie had certain characteristics imposed by various influences. For example, Vincent Price. The short ""Vincent"" is an ode to his Tim Burton's inspiration. ""Vincent"" uses the same techniques of ""The nightmare before Christmas"". I believe in that time nobody saw it come.The characters like Jack, Sally, the mad scientist, the faces of the mayor, the evil children's, the witches, Santa and the villain Oogie Boogie are unforgettable.

The reality is they had no idea that they had one of the best films the studio has ever released. Tim Burton was the executive producer of this film. He came up with the idea. However in 1992 he released ""Batman Returns"" and that film got major backlash for the dark tone it had/ ""The Night Before Christmas"" has a dark tone to it but it is very very funny. Most of all it has the best original scores to ever be made for a film. In this film Halloween Town, is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington (""The Pumpkin King"") leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town."" Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his (somewhat limited) understanding of the festivities to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Things go wrong very fast when Jack start delivering his idea of Christmas Toys. After the film was released on Home Video the film really started to gained a foothold on audiences. Once they saw it ""They loved it"". Then Disney finally put there name on the film after the film became such an icon of not only ""Halloween"" but ""Christmas"" as well.

This fantasy story suggests that each holiday has a world of its own outside the boundaries of society, and two of those worlds collide in this movie: Halloweentown and Christmastown. The result creates an entertaining story of discovery and exploration.Meet Jack Skellington. Though he is not the mayor of Halloweentown, he has a huge influence over the inhabitants as he practically runs Halloween. Something is missing in his life though, and nobody can understand this except for Sally, a woman held together by stitches who is basically a slave to her creator. When Jack comes across Christmastown by mistake it gives him a sense of great wonder and hope. Sadly, when he tries to explain his feeling of warmth and happiness this world has created for him, the inhabitants of Halloweentown are only interested in whether the holiday Christmas has any scary aspects.The premise is very unique and sends a good message to children. However, while the story may be intriguing the dialogue seems to be simplified in order to target the attention span of children whereas good family films would challenge children to grasp dialogue with intentions that do not involve moving the plot forward or dialogue with vocabulary that is challenging to them. The way conversations or dialogue is handled in this film is slightly better than dialogue in The Polar Express (which isn't saying much).The art direction of the film is not for everyone, but while it is dark it is not creepy enough to scare children easily. Well, maybe very little children, but certain characters like Jack or the goofy mayor with two faces keep children distracted from the Gothic style of the movie.The best aspect of The Nightmare Before Christmas by far is the music. Each musical number is given great attention by Danny Elfman and the other writers and proves to be a very effective story- telling device within the film. If there's anything the audience will remember walking out of the film it would undoubtedly be either Jack's sad song about lacking meaning in his life, or the very upbeat and popular ""What's This?""This isn't your typical family film, but it has redeeming qualities and proves to be a very good musical.3.0/4.0",The Nightmare Before Christmas
154,karl_consiglio,Sweeet.,8,9 December 2006,"I enjoy Tim Burton's movies very very much, except for his Planet of the Apes but thats another commentary. His imagination is wild. This film, done mostly in stop motion is a masterpiece. Both children as well as adults can enjoy this film. I believe that in making this film which must have taken a hell of a lot of work Tim Burton remains faithful to his childhood sense of genuine wonder which can be pretty infinite really. Its a warm family film if you ask me, very sweet and very special. Its a classic which remains imprinted in you. Ooh yes i definitely recommend. Jack Skeleton rocks. This is Halloween vs Christmas. Shame I thought that Americans have come to believe Santa to be the king of Christmas and the Easter Bunny as the head of Easter, turning their backs on the truth of what these festivities are all about.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

157,Gunn,A Masterpiece that gets better every time you see it!,10,4 May 2009,"This film is an audio and visual treat. It delivers masterful animation combined with great music and fabulous songs. Danny Elfman is an under-appreciated and underrated film composer who creates wonderful music in multiple films and has yet to be awarded for his terrific work. Here in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" he really shines with catchy tunes and a magnificent score. The visuals are unusual and brilliant and Tim Burton's crew deserves high praise for their fastidious work and meticulous animation. Burton and Michael McDowell have created a truly unique story and director Henry Selick puts all these elements together with perfection. The characters are unforgettable: Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King (Voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon), Sally the Frankenstein-like doll who pines for Jack (Voiced by Catherine O'Hara), nasty Dr. Finkelstein the mad scientist (Voiced by William Hickey) and other ghosts, ghouls and vampires are wonderfully created and performed. It is a classic that will only improve with age and viewers will catch something new on every viewing. The Blu-Ray DVD is absolutely stunning.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
158,patrick_dunne,"Appealing to a certain crowd, but enjoyable and fun nonetheless",8,20 October 2005,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great story about a skeleton named Jack who wants to make Christmas. Why? Well, Jack accidentally stumbles upon this place, and is magically transported to Christmas Town. Jack is the king of Halloween, but Christmas is something new. Jack falls in love with the new place and decides to make Christmas. So, the misunderstood skeleton and his ghost dog persuade the town to prepare for Christmas. However, their plan doesn't go as it should of been, but I won't spoil anymore of this movie.Tim Burton usually makes strange movies, and this is no exception. However, it isn't so strange that you can't understand it. Tim Burton's classic story of Jack Skelington (that's his full name) is probably one of the best Disney movie and great for Christmas. (You can watch it on Halloween too, but then you'll get all excited for Christmas. It happens to me.) It has some drama, great music, interesting looks, and a good story too. The only main downside, is the unique story, takes no twists or turns, and the main appeal in the music.Oh well. The Nightmare before Christmas is still a great cult.RECOMMENDED 8/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

162,ThreeGuysOneMovie,Check out Disney's Haunted Mansion between Halloween and Christmas,10,3 June 2012,"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring except for a skeleton. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that Sandy Claws would soon be there.The children were nestled all snug in their beds. While visions of ghosts and goblins danced in their heads, and Sally in her stitched head and I with my pumpkin, had just settled down for a long winters dread.When out in the graveyard there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my coffin to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a demon, tore open the shutters and started screaming.The moon on beast of the new-fallen snow, gave an eerie glow to the objects below. When what to my horror should appear. not a hero, but a red-coated skellington and his ghost dog Zero.With a rail thin driver, as pale as clear gelatin, I knew in a moment it must be Jack Skellington. More rapid than devils, his courses they came and he howled, and cried and called them with revel.Now Mayor!, now Mummy!, Now Vampire!, and Witch! On Hyde! on Oogie! On Boogie! and Retch! on the top of the mausoleum! to the top of the dungeon! Now Dash Away! dash away! dash away all!As the dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky, so up to the castle tops the dragons they flew, with a sleigh full of dangers and Jack Skellington too.And then in horror, I heard on the roof the clawing and scraping of each horned hoof. As I drew in my hand and was turning around, down the chimney Jack came with a bound.He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with spiders and soot; A bundle of horrors he had flung on his back and he looked like a hangman just sharpening his axe.His eyes were sunken in his face so scary! His cheeks were like white roses, his nose like white cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like an unholy host, and the beard on his chin was as white as a ghost.A stump of a pipe he held in his visage most dire, and the smoke it encircled his head like pyre. he had a small face and no discernible belly that shook when he howled like a bowl full of poison jelly.He was skinny and horrific a right scary old beast, and I shuddered when I saw him as he looked deceased. A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, soon filled me with dread.He spoke some frightening words, and then got busy, and filled all the stockings, with horrors that made me dizzy, and laying his finger aside of his nose, up the chimney he rose.He sprang to his sleigh, to his horde gave a yell, and away they all flew like the cobwebs in hell. But I heard him chortle, ere he drove out of sight, Happy Nightmare Before Christmas to all and to all a good-night!The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite animated films of all time and a glimpse inside the head of glorious crazy man Tim Burton. This a wonderful watch, all year-long but especially between Halloween and Christmas. If you ever get the chance to check out what Disney does with the Haunted Mansion, at this time of year, please check it out its amazing. I can't recommend this film enough as I completely love it, and would suggest this film highly to everyone reading our blog.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
163,caseynicholson,A Fun Halloween Tale--But Basically a Musical,7,15 November 2016,"I had never seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" until this year (2016). It came out while I was in high school, and I think at the time I was going through a ""I'm too old for cartoons and kids movies"" phase. I'd been wanting to see it for several years now, but every year Halloween would come and go and I would miss it.In fact, that's one important thing to know about this movie. Before I saw it, I always wondered if it was better to watch at Halloween or at Christmas. I'd now answer that question with a definite ""Halloween"". The movie is about a character from a village that is oriented around a Halloween theme who wanders off one day and discovers a series of portals to other holiday-themed towns. This takes him to Christmas-town, where he decides he wants to bring Christmas back to Halloween-town. But, before it's all said and done, he discovers that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and that the holidays don't mix well. That being the case, the movie has a lot more Halloween-oriented characters than Christmas-oriented ones, so definitely watch this during the former season.Another thing you might want to know going into this movie so that you'll get the most appreciation out of it is that it is in fact NOT an animated film. Or at least it's not a cartoon or a computer animation. Rather, it's stop motion. All of the scenes in the movie were shot on site, with props that were used to make the set. Taking that into consideration certainly adds to the appeal of the movie, and it really is quite a feat for filmmaking.As for the story and the plot of the film, it's not terrible. Indeed, the plot itself is somewhat becoming and certainly novel. However, the movie relies heavily on music and song, making it basically a musical film. Musicals are my least favorite genre of movie (even though I realize it's a very popular thing to do for a kids movie), and so it was hard for me to get into this film.Still, all things said and done, I have to give this movie a strong 7/10 stars. It's certainly a fun, well made film. Just not in the upper echelons of my favorites is all.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

168,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"A visual treat for the eyes, and an involving fantasy for the mind",10,4 February 2005,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic animated by Tim Burton. This movie is filmed in one of the most grueling filming techniques possible, stop motion animation. The animation is the most stunning stop motion animation I've ever seen in a movie, and that alone is worth the price of admission. The visual genius of Tim Burton is a treat to look at. The story is a very creative look at holidays and another type of story of how they came to be. This movie takes Christmas and puts a Halloween twist onto it. In some ways this is like the opposite version of The Grinch, and has some similar elements to Rudolph.The voices of the characters is also very good. Composer Danny Elfman provides the singing voice for the main character Jack Skellington. The characters are very memorable, and they are also very unique.The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite films of all time. There isn't one time during the year that feels complete without this movie. Despite being focused mainly on Christmas and Halloween, this movie can be watched during any other time of the year.Unfortunately, the popular store 'Hot Topic' has been selling Nightmare Before Christmas clothes just to make boat loads of money. Half of the people wearing the clothes haven't even seen this magnificent film, they just want to look ""Goth"" or ""punk"". Hopefully, people still realize that Nightmare Before Christmas is a great film and not just an icon to Goths and punks.Some younger kids may get scared by the Halloween creatures, but everyone else will fall in love with this movie from the time of the opening shot to the time the end credits start to role. If you haven't seen this movie, you should see it now. This movie is actually meant more for adults, meaning that adults can relate to the story better than kids can. Go ahead and watch this movie if you haven't done so already.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The Nightmare Before Christmas is filled with wonder and terror and laughs and reflection. It is the perfect movie to end Halloween on and start the countdown toward Christmas.This was my second time watching this film if my memory serves me correct. And I have to say, I did enjoy it more than I remember doing the last time. The Nightmare Before Christmas is so unbelievably imaginative that it just baffles the mind. Every creature in Halloween Town is unique and scary in its own way. Every song is rather wonderful and filled with meaning.This movie also manages to be exciting from start to finish. There isn't a dull moment to be found. Even the slower singing scenes are fun because of the fantastic lyrics that each song has. And outside of those, the movie is constantly going forwards. Every scene and sequence feels like it's just the perfect length, and the 76 minutes that this wonderful film lasts, fly by.As I'm sure you can tell, I absolutely love this movie. I can't imagine going a Halloween without watching it. It is the perfect ending for the day and it puts me in a great mood.

171,moviemattb,One of the Greatest Stop-Motion Animated Movies Ever Made!,10,24 December 2014,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is one of those movies that is part of my childhood, and never I find this movie boring or get sick and tired of it. The movie is about a talking skeleton name Jack Skellington who is getting tired of Halloween, and is wanting to do something totally different. So, he discovers about Christmas and decides to try it out. Jack gets the people of Halloween Town to make Christmas, and does for what he has to do on his own. I really love this movie, and it is a heck a lot of fun to watch. I always remember this movie from beginning to end. Tim Burton has created these extraordinary characters that are fun and interesting to look at; so, here he really achieves it. I know he didn't direct this movie, which, of course, the movie is directed by Henry Selick who would go on directing ""Coraline"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" He does a fine job directing this movie as well as keeping faithful to what Burton envision it. However, when you watch this movie, it really feels like a Tim Burton movie if Burton may have ghostly directed it or something like that. Chris Sarandon does a great job for voicing Jack Skellington as well as Catherine O'Hara for voicing Sally. Everyone in this movie for voicing these characters all did great on their own. The designs of the sets and characters are so darn remarkable, and the the stop-motion animation is incredibly well done. The songs and music by Danny Elfman are really far beyond from being good; they are so memorable like ""This is Halloween;"" ""Making Christmas;"" ""What's this?;"" etc. Many of you would like to know if this movie is either a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie; it just depends on what you make of. To me, personally, I think its both and I always get in the mood when it comes to both Halloween and Christmas at the same time. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out!

Danny Elfman was at his peak in composing the soundtrack for this enchanting fantasy, musical.

The film also has some nice song's from Danny Elfman (He did the music for Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride). The character's were also interesting including the villain, Oogey Boogey (Yes, it's a weird name. But hey, it's Tim Burton).

176,TheSeaLion,A nightmare that I want to never watch again,2,11 July 2014,"At a mere seventy-six minutes it feels like two hours. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a stop-motion animated film that has some beautifully flawless animation, creative designs for creatures and locations, and an interesting premise to it, but barely anything happens within the entire running time. The film is filled with uninteresting characters that are more action than motivation, songs that do not convey much, and some parts that are never explained.Starting out in Halloween Town, the festivities of another Halloween end, but for the Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon) has grown to be tired of Halloween, and goes walking through the forest. In the forest, he comes across a group of trees with doors designed in the shape of holiday objects on them. Jack goes through the Christmas tree shaped door and ends up in Christmas Town. Jack returns to Halloween Town with his knowledge of Christmas, wanting to make everyone else in town understand it.From this point on, the plot gets too complicated to properly explain because Jack's plans on what to do with his new knowledge of Christmas changes every ten minutes. First, he wants to inform the town about it at a town meeting. Then, he wants to make Christmas happen by kidnapping Santa (Edward Ivory) to keep him out of the way. There is no motivation to back up why Jack is doing any of this, yet he still does it, making him more action than motive. When he brings Christmas to the human world, he brings Halloween instead with terrifying presents, but there is no reason why he should have done this.The musical numbers in this film are some of the most useless parts of the movie, which makes its very short run-time feel long. There are several musical numbers throughout the film, many of them several minutes long, and they barley convey anything. In Jack's song at the beginning of the movie, all we learn is that he is tired of Halloween, but that song runs for at least three minutes. Other songs gives out no information about the characters or is working towards a plot point, it is basically just a pointless musical number that are redundant. The opening song is all of the monsters singing about what they are and how it's Halloween. I'm confused. What are all of these creatures? Just have them each tell me what they are in a few stanzas of a song and then we'll put it all together to make a four minute song. That'll get it across to the audience.How the worlds operate is never explained, nor does it make any sense. It is never stated specifically how the worlds are connected or if the other worlds are even aware of the other worlds existences. Jack apparently has no idea about the other holiday worlds, but the Christmas world knew of the human world. Then, all of the worlds are shown to be connected through some doorways in trees, yet Jack gets from the human world to Halloweentown via an entrance in a graveyard later on. Jack also flew into the sky while in Halloweentown in a sled pulled by skeleton reindeer, which would not fit through any of the doors or into the graveyard entrance, so how did he get to the human world? Even with all of these other problems, the most surprising of them all is how pointless several of the characters are. Sally, as I mentioned above, is supposedly the second most important character in the whole movie after Jack, but she is pointless. All she does is run away from her creator, the Evil Scientist (William Hickey) and have a premonition involving Jack's Christmas. She also has a pointless romance with Jack that literally comes out of nowhere at the end and is pointless to the characters and the story. With Sally being pointless to the story, it also makes the Evil Scientist who made her pointless to have in the film.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a movie that I'm barely sure of what happened in it. So few things of importance actually happens in the movie, and when they do, there is almost no motivation behind it. Bad musical numbers, pointless characters, action over motive, and set in a world that makes no sense of how it operates, this film is a nightmare that I want to never watch again.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
177,smashattack,"Nice idea, but poorly executed.",5,8 September 2002,"Jack Skellington is the King of Halloween Town.  He reminds me of a cross of The Neverhood's Klaymen and Skullmonkeys'... well, skullmonkeys.  Mr. Skellington has a great voice, too.  He's tall and thin, just what all women want in a guy.And atop his shoulders is a skull.To put it plainly, Jack Skellington is really cool.  His voice actor, Chris Sarandon (The Princess Bride's Prince Humperdinck) is marvelous.  His singing actor, Danny Elfman, is one of my favorite composers.But this review is not about Jack Skellington.  No, unfortunately, I have to talk about the movie as well.  Spoilers may arise.  If they do, forgive me.I enjoyed the concept of The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Jack Skellington is bored with Halloween and wants to try something new.  He stumbles into Christmas Town (and sings the best song in the movie... I'm guessing it is titled ""What's This?"" but I could be wrong), where he finds strange, yet not so frightening ideas.  This sparks a new motive for Jack--improve Christmas!Now, from here on out, there are SO many things this movie could do.  Yet it doesn't do much with it.  For most of the film we see them preparing for Christmas and, to be quite honest, it gets rather boring.  The clay is really fun to look at but it's not enough to keep one interested.  The movie doesn't have enough story.  The plot is great, yes, but the actual events could have been better.The climax is pretty exciting, what with Jack facing Oogie Boogie (is that his name?) and all.  But that was hardly enough!  The confrontation was very short.  It was intense for the few seconds it occurred, but was like Attack of the Clones' climax.  Cut way too short.I found the characters creepy and frightening--my stomach churned at the sight of some of them.  Greg Proops, marvelous actor in Whose Line is it Anyway?, is in there somewhere, but I couldn't hear is voice.  Pity.  He wasn't in it enough.I'd say that The Nightmare Before Christmas is excellent and very enjoyable, but I can't.  I'd love to, but I can't.  The singing was tiresome (except for that one song I mentioned) and the story too shallow.  I'm going to say it was fair, but not one to drool over.  Not awful, but not all that great, either.Although I would suggest it.  It's nice to see once or maybe even twice.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

If you don't like musicals you will hate this film but even I, who is not a big fan of English language musicals (because the songs are usually bad), found this film to be great. The stop motion animation was the best part about this film; the world we get transported to is one that is intriguing, dark and grueling. This will definitely scare your kid if they watch it when they're 5 or 6 but if they're 8 years old they've seen enough so that this film will be just fine to introduce them to the wonders of Christmas. There was one bad song in this film with the three delinquents singing it.

180,native_girl333,"Jack, Sally and Lock, Shock and Barrel",10,20 December 2007,"There is no question about the fact that Tim Burton is genius. Inspired by Burton's poem Jack Skellington and Halloween town was brought to life by Disney and director Henry Selick. The original score is made by brilliant Danny Elfman who is responsible of music sequence of Jack Skellington. For example Chris Sarandon and Catherine O'Hara provide the voices in this magical and dark-savvy movie.Jack Skellington is a beloved Pumpkin King of Halloweentown. One day Jack gets sucked in a far different world when he accidentally discovers a door to Christmas Town. Jack decides that Santa Clause which he thinks is called Sandy Claws might need a vacation so Jack will ""kindly"" make the holiday happen by replacing Santa with himself. No one really knows what Jack is up to except Sally, a masterpiece rag doll of Dr.Finkelstein. Sally is secretly in love with Jack... Can she stop Jack's intentions which may seem cruel but only on point of view of Christmastowners? The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't a normal animated picture. It may not please everyone but for melancholy and horror-romance lovers it is a special treat! Another amazing piece from Tim Burton's mind is of course The Corpse Bride which Burton also directed himself. Despite the dark surroundings Jack Skellington and other brilliant characters are very lovable. There is always a lesson to learn. Why try to change somebody else's life just because you think they would enjoy it...",The Nightmare Before Christmas
181,motrous,The Nightmare Before Christmas,10,14 April 2021,"Nostalgia certainly plays into this one. Other people have rightly pointed out some flaws. But that doesn't change the fact that I've seen this movie more time than I can count and could turn it on right now and not get bored. Danny Elfman is what really makes this movie, though.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
182,GuyCC,One Of My Most Enduring Favorites.,9,23 October 2003,"I felt it fitting to review this on its 10th year anniversary, especially around Halloween.  This film has remained one of my all-time favorite films, with its characters, music, and story.  It's a whimsical tale that retains its charm with every viewing.The tale is a simple one: Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, tires of his title, and wants something more in his life.  Something new to inspire him.  After an all-night walk through the woods, he stumbles upon a forest clearing with oddly shaped doors in the trees.  Upon opening the Christmas door, Jack is whisked away to a new world.  And there, the magic begins.Actually, the magic begins within the first few seconds of the film's opening, but it is Jack's discovery of the unknown that makes the film have a fun (if macabre) feel, as the well-intentioned skeleton makes a mess of something he works so hard to offer as a gift.Visually, this film is unlike anything seen in a long time, and certainly not in the last 10 years.  The character design of Jack is still one of my personal favorites (elegant and graceful), and the other characters all have their own personality, even if regulated to a background scene.  There's only one real ""bad guy"" in this film (Oogie Boogie), and even his method of being menacing is simply being a master showman with a penchant for odds and gambling.  Stop-motion is an almost all but lost art form, especially in this modern age of CG special effects, and when you really watch how much effort was put into making this film, you can't help but appreciate it all the more.Musically, this is one of Danny Elfman's finest.  Spooky and somber, but light and at times invokes a sweetness to its nature, including the long but silent romantic intentions between Jack and Sally.  The music invokes a fun feeling to the film, and the lyrics are clever and playful.The story is very simple, but it was also inspired by one of Burton's short stories, which explains its basic premise.  The story was stretched out to make a feature length film, but any minor quibbles are easy to look over as the film is just such a wonder to watch and listen to.Overall, this has always been one of my favorite animated films, and I've been so glad that Disney has been starting to give it the attention it deserves, instead of still regulating it to the popular, but obscure cult following that a film like ""TRON"" has.A beautifully stylish film that fails to diminish no matter how many times it's viewed.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
183,dskywalker0,"Might be overrated, but it's a classic for me",10,28 February 2021,"This is an incredible film, one of my all-time favourites for sure, so wonderfully weird! What I love the most about it is that, if anyone had listened to Sally, none of the mess would've even started: Sally is an underrated wisdom symbol. This film somehow manages to send good messages, even though there are absurdities such as children who kidnap people, and I love the vibe of everything that comes from Tim Burton. I don't think I'd watch this with my child, but maybe with teenagers and adults it's still a hit.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
184,Animated_Antic,A very creative and memorable movie.,10,2 October 2017,"It's kind of amazing how ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" became such a huge phenomenon. When it was released in 1993, it was released as under Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner as the company believed that it would be too scary to be released under their own image and the film didn't do as well because of that even though it was still a decent hit at the box office. The film then got a huge cult following to the point where Disney has since moved the film to it's own image and now generally accepts it as one of their own. Having watched it for the very first time, I can see why it's loved by so many people. It's a very imaginative and creative movie with a nice simple story, great animation, likable characters as well as some fantastic songs.The famous holidays of the world are divided into separate towns and celebrate their cheer on their one special day every year. One of these towns is Halloween Town populated with witches, vampires, werewolves, mummies, witches, you get the idea. The leader of the town though, Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon and sung by Danny Elfman) is getting tired of doing the same routine the residents do year after year and dreams of doing something new. He then accidentally stumbles upon the world of Christmas Town and tries to show the residents of town the idea of the holiday, but all fail to grasp it. Jack then gets the idea of taking over the holiday and asks the citizens to gather materials to turn the holiday into a ""Scary Christmas"", even going to the point where he kidnaps Santa Claus, (Ed Ivory) himself. What happens next I'd rather not say.Because the film is not very long, the story is actually very simple and easy to explain. It also is very original as well because it has so much imagination and creativity thrown into it. The worlds that they live in are so imaginative that you just want to explore and get yourself lost in. The animation is top notched. The stop motion is pretty seamless and the characters design look very expressive as well as colorful that even for the citizens who live in Halloween Town don't look all dreary and gray. The animation was so good that it got the film an Oscar nomination for it's visual effects. The character are also great. They have very expressive personalities and are very likable as well, particularly Jack Skellington. But by far the best part of the entire movie are the songs. Written by composer Danny Elfman, they are very memorable and like a good musical should, advances the story. The song ""Kindap the Sandy Claus"" in particular,  got stuck in my head the day after I saw the movie.  That's the sign of some good music. If I had only one flaw with the movie, it would be the way to these portals work. They're not clarified how these towns works and it really confused me when the characters would enter one world and then come back without showing how it works. It's really a nitpick though.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a great example of a Halloween (or Christmas) classic. The story, animation, characters and the songs are so memorable and creative that I'm glad the movie is getting the attention it should. I could see somebody being disappointed by the movie if they're building it up to be something big and fantastic, so if you're planning to watch it for the very first time, have your mindset to a short and humble film rather than the former. That's what I did and I certainly enjoyed it.P.S. If you plan to watch this film for the very first time and want the best picture quality, be sure to watch the version with the Disney logo in front of the film and not the Touchstone logo as the latter's quality is so poor that it can become distracting.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The songs are fun (if not as catchy as the ditties in a typical Disney animated flick), the animation is top notch, and the story is as inventive as any ghost story I've ever seen or read.  Jack Skellington is a great character (and his little dog too!), while Catharine O'Hara (who can do no wrong in my book) adds a sweet charm to the story as Sally.  What a great film to watch with kids, HOWEVER, the really little ones might be too young for a scene which depicts Santa Claus in jeopardy.

187,Teknofobe70,One of the best animated musicals of all time,9,8 May 2005,"The first inspiration for this movie came when Tim Burton was walking past a shop window and saw the Halloween decorations being taken down and replaced by Christmas decorations. The peculiar image of Santa and his reindeer matched with the ghouls and goblins and Halloween sparked off an idea for a creepy poem, which eventually become an ambitious feature length project made entirely with stop-motion ...Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is the most popular figure in Halloweentown -- a town populated by figures such as Mr Hyde, the Wolf Man, a mad scientist and assorted ghosts, goblins and mutants. Every year they come together for the soul purpose of scaring everyone, and then wait 365 days until next Halloween. But this year is going to be a little different ... while wandering through the woods, Jack finds a portal to a place called Christmastown, and watches as Santa and his elves make presents and prepare for this years festivities. Fascinated by this, Jack comes up with a plan to 'hijack' Christmas, kidnapping Santa and having the citizens of Halloweentown make lots of unusual presents for him to deliver on his skeleton sleigh ...While this movie is adapted from an illustrated poem by Tim Burton and superbly directed by Henry Selick (James and Giant Peach), the real star of the show is Danny Elfman, who scores most of Burton's movies. He wrote the score and the lyrics for ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", and also performed as the singing voice of the 'hero', Jack Skellington. The quality of the songs and the music is above and beyond what anybody could have expected from this movie and, strange as it sounds, this is actually my favourite musical of the last twenty years or so at least. Songs such as ""This is Halloween"", ""Jack's Lament"" and various others are masterpieces of high-class Gothic music, and the tunes will stay with you for a long time afterwards.The voice-over cast are all top-class, with performers such as Chris Sarandon (The Princess Bride), Catherine O'Hara (Lemony Snicket) and Glenn Shadix (Heathers). And the look of the film is just fantastic ... it's a real visual treat, and that alone is reason enough to watch it even it it wasn't for the great music and captivating story. Tim Burton was so enthralled by the creepy stop-motion animation here that he used it again in ""Mars Attacks"", and in his 2005 movie ""The Corpse Bride"", which looks very similar to this one.It's dark and it's wonderful and it's more than slightly disturbing ... next Halloween, you have to watch this movie.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The plight of poor Jack Skelington as he longs for something new is something that everyone can identify with.

189,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""Surprised, aren't you?""",9,23 March 2014,"One of the many pleasures about this film is that there is not a single recognizable landscape within it. Everything looks strange and haunting. The movie, which tells the story of an attempt by Halloween to annex Christmas, is shot in a process called stop-action animation. In an ordinary animated film, the characters are drawn. Here they are constructed, and then moved a little, frame by frame, so that they appear to live. This allows a three-dimensional world to be presented, instead of the flatter universe of cell animation. And it is a godsend for the animators of ""Nightmare,"" who seem to have built their world from scratch - every house, every stick and stone - before sending their skeletal characters in to inhabit it.The movie begins with the information that each holiday has its own town. Halloweentown, for example, is in charge of all the preparations for Halloween, and its most prominent citizen is a bony skeleton named Jack Skellington. One day Jack stumbles into the wrong entryway in Halloweentown, and finds himself smack dab in the middle of preparations for Christmas. Now this, he realizes, is more likes it! Instead of ghosts and goblins and pumpkins, there are jolly little helpers assisting Santa in his annual duty of bringing peace on earth and goodwill to men.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Tim Burton film in the sense that the story, its world and its look first took shape in Burton's mind, and he supervised their filming. But the director of the film, a veteran stop-action master named Henry Selick, is the person who has made it all work. And his achievement is enormous.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

191,nmholland,An Amazing Animated Film With Compelling Characters and Superb Music,9,22 June 2016,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is directed by Henry Selick (no, not Tim Burton), and is the story of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, and the leader of Halloweentown. After years of seeking something more than simply scaring people annually, Jack eventually wanders off in thought, and stumbles across Christmastown. He decides that Christmas is a superior holiday to that of his Halloween, and sets up a plot to overthrow Santa Claus and control Christmas as his own, with good intentions for the special day of the year.Growing up, The Nightmare Before Christmas was one of my favorite movies. I had every song memorized (except for ""Something's Up With Jack,"" I could never remember that one), and loved every single character in the film. Rewatching it recently, it isn't a perfect film, but it sure is a really good one. From the fantastic music, to the compelling characters, to the incredible stop motion animation, everything about The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply amazing.To start by jumping in, the hands down best thing about Nightmare is the music. The music, composed and partly sung by Danny Elfman (voicing Jack when singing), is absolutely fantastic. Almost every song is excellently written, and choreographed (with small figures on tiny sets, may I add). However, the music is also where my one problem lies. There is one specific song, called ""Making Christmas,"" a song in which doesn't hold up a fight against the other songs in the film. To be completely honest, it isn't a bad song, but, in comparison to the other songs, it stands out tremendously. Besides that one song, however, the music is superb, and a soundtrack worth buying.The characters, along with the actors who voice them, is another astounding thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas. Jack Skellington is, in my opinion, one of the greatest animated characters of all time. He stands up there with Grumpy (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), Simba (The Lion King), and Woody (Toy Story). He is perfectly well rounded, and is a flawless example of a character that literally anyone can relate to. The entire audience can find at least one attribute of Jack's that that specific person can communicate with. Jack Skellington is one of my personal favorite animated characters of all time.All of the other characters are great as well. Sally, the rag doll, and Jack's sort-of love interest is an amazing character. Her insecurity on whether or not Jack's plan of owning Christmas is a great attribute that adds a subtle layer of conflict between her and Jack. The actress that voices her, Catherine O'Hara, does great with her character, especially in the song she sings, entitled ""Sally's Song."" The main villain of the film, Oogie Boogie (or the Boogie Man) is a very clever choice for a villain for a movie that takes place in ""Halloweentown."" His weakness, which I won't spoil, was a brilliant idea to add to the film, and gives a layer of humanity to a seemingly unstoppable villain. His voice actor, Ken Page, does amazing in both speaking and singing. Every other supporting character is great as well, but just aren't filling as big of roles as the three actors/characters mentioned.The stop motion animation is nothing but the best. For every second of film, around 12 shots were taken of the small sets. That is absolutely incredible. The time that the filmmakers spent on getting the exact right shots and movements is substantial, considering it took three years for the film to be completed. For every person involved in the filmmaking, I commend you on the excellent job you did, this coming 23 years after the film's release.In final conclusion, The Nightmare Before Christmas is an amazing animated film, a great holiday film, and an excellent movie all around. I implore anyone, except for a hand full of small children, to check out this film; it's, simply put, brilliant.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The story is excelent, and the actors worked well together and sounded like they had LOTS of fun making the movie.  As to it being too dark to be a Christmas movie (as I have seen here), well that is a matter of opinion.  It is a little dark (as a lot of Burton's best movies are), but I still consider it to be a good Christmas movie.  The story is all in good fun, and in the end, all sides get their way.

It is one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time. The score by Danny Elfman truly is magnificent. The characters are all unique and individual, plus the sets and lighting works wonders too. Yes, the story is a little weak, and perhaps the songs are a little too random, but these are all wiped out of consideration by the sheer wonder of this movie!

Since The Nightmare Before Christmas (TNBC) is a musical, this means that the majority of dialog sounds like it was written by a bored 13 year-old for a junior high school musical. For example, from a song with the lame title of ""What's This?"": ""What's this? What's this? There's color everywhere!--What's this? There's white things in the air!--What's this? I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming!--Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair!--What's this? What's this? There's something very wrong!--What's this? There's people singing songs!--I want it, oh, I want it, Oh, I want it for my own!--I've got to know I've got to know,--What is this place that I have found?--What is this? Christmas Town, hmm...""Or how about""Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws--I wanna do it! Let's draw straws.--Jack said we should work together--Three of a kind, Birds of a feather--Now and forever, Wheeee--La, la, la, la, la""Or: ""This time, this time--Making Christmas, Making Christmas--Making Christmas, making Christmas is so fine--It's ours this time And won't the children be surprised--It's ours this time--Making Christmas, Making Christmas--Making Christmas Time to give them something fun--They'll talk about for years to come--Let's have a cheer from everyone--It's time to party""Elfman has impressive credentials and has done memorable theme songs and soundtrack work before. And, while I enjoyed his band Oingo-Boingo back in the '80s, their songs were conceptually clever but lyrically simple. And while Oingo-Boingo's songs like ""Only a Lad"", ""Little Girls"" and the like had catchy hooks, the tunes he wrote for TNBC are instantly forgettable. With a better songwriter and lyricist, TNBC could've become a classic, up there with ""The Grinch who Stole Christmas"" or ""A Charley Brown Christmas"". Instead, it has to settle for being a visual cult film, with memorable-looking characters and sets, but nothing memorable to say.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

It reminds me of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" to a certain point, in that this is a movie made for adults with the ability to tap into the children they once were, rather than their inner children. There's a difference, you see. But rather than being slyly creepy, it's eerily beautiful. I've seen this movie several times, and like it a little more each time. The scene where Jack falls from Santa's sled and lands in the arms of a stone angel in a cemetery gets me every time I see it, as does the sad-romantic duet. When was the last time you were so moved by animated characters, not to mention clay-mation ones! Burton and Elfman make a great team.

Back then I was into horror and demented stuff like that, now I'm about 100 times more into horror and demented stuff like that (Johnny the Homicidal Manaic for those of you who know what that is). The Nightmare Before Christmas is something that I'd like to actually see happen someday, but I know it won't. Tim Burton kicks off this one with the lovely introduction ""This is Halloween"" theme song and goes from there to introduce characters. Soon we find out that the king of Halloween (Jack) is sick of doing the same thing every year and wants something different. So after the party Jack wanders off into a section of the woods he's never seen and comes across trees with symbols on them. Jack ends up falling into the Christmas one and discovers a new holiday he is eager to celebrate. Soon Jack gathers the whole town and introduces them to what Christmas is. The only person who wants to stop him is the girl (Sally) who loves him. Sally has a bad feeling about all of it after holding a small twig and watching it burn in her hands. The only thing Jack needs to do to complete his plan is capture Santa, the Big Red Man himself. The movie is really good but it's really short. The music is done well for the most part, the songs didn't get stuck in my head but that's not always a bad thing.

201,Blazehgehg,I wish I could love this movie more.,4,2 November 2021,"As a pathological lover of Halloween, this movie should be right up my alley. This is Tim Burton at peak goth, with every single monster and creature looking iconic. Danny Elfman knocks it out of the park with a soundtrack that defines October. It's tremendous.But there are some very large problems that drag it way down for me.One, I'm a hardcore ""I don't care about Christmas until halfway through November"" kind of guy. Every year, retailers push harder to put Christmas stuff out earlier, and this movie gives them the best excuse -- when Halloween stuff shows up in Wal-mart in September, Disney and Tim Burton say it's okay to put out Christmas, too. This movie links the two holidays in a way that makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to think about elves or Santa or snow in October.But the real issue, the one that stands out the worst, is the message this movie presents: stay in your lane, or you'll ruin everything. Jack Skellington dares to venture outside of his comfort zone, to broaden his horizons, and it's a disaster. He displays a childlike curiosity with something new and interesting, and his reward is destroying the holidays for millions. There's no redemption for him. He makes a mess out of Christmas, gets sad about being a failure, and goes back to doing Halloween. Roll credits.The only redemption we get is Jack's vow to make next Halloween ""even better,"" but there's no pay off for that. We don't see next Halloween. We also barely see Santa save Christmas, too. It's a legitimately disappointing ending to a movie that's not quite chocolate and peanut butter for me.If I'm in a Christmas mood, I want something warm and fuzzy, which NBC isn't. If I'm in a Halloween mood, I want to be as far away from Christmas as I can get, which I can't do here. All I am is frustrated with this movie.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

It is one truly unique musical that should be seen by everyone at least once. The characters are well acted and this is probably one of the best of Tim Burton's films.

Well I know I've been known to play the entire soundtrack on loop for the entire month of October. Danny Elfman really perfects the haunting and enchanting tone of the tale that is Nightmare Before Christmas. Honestly, I think I may have seen the movie maybe a dozen times, but listening to the soundtrack, yeah, that's gotta be at least hundreds of loops. Oogie Boogie's song and Jack's Lament would definitely be in the top three songs along with This Is Halloween.And just a side note to add to audio, the casting was well done. Shout out to Ken Page, Catherine O'Hara and Danny Elfman for carrying the movie with their awesome voice acting.While this is Tim Burton's first Animation, Nightmare Before Christmas is an overhaul of the artistic Burton style seen in movies like Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. While Burton animations are far and few in between, all three of his animated features are stop motion, which definitely works best for Burton's designs.At the time this move came out, Burton was already making a name of himself from his earliest works. Though I believe Nightmare Before Christmas to be the single most greatest culture impact Tim Burton has ever achieved in his life. Jack Skellington is to Halloween what Jesus is to Christianity. Merch is almost guaranteed at any Hot Topic, Spencer's, or any other nerdy store. The Pumpkin King is the face of the holiday as much as Tim Burton himself is. And the mix of the two biggest holidays is practically the most celebrated crossover of all time. This movie basically owns the last third of the year.

He attempts to bring the jolly spirit and key pieces into Halloween Town, and assumes the position of Sandy Claws (Santa Clause) in his search for fulfillment and novelty. This film always instills a sense of wonder and excitement, as the audience is carried along on Jacks shelter-skelter ride, and one shares his infectious thirst for adventure. As a musical, the story is supplemented with various songs and musical themes, repeating at key moments to emphasize characters, events, or themes and moods that are important to the audiences perception of the storyline. The dark, yet upbeat songs provide a pleasing ambiance of mundane horror, as life in Halloween Town supposedly is. I find the romance between Sally and Jack to be rushed and a bit trite, but fits with the classic structure and nature of the film.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

207,FilmFreak94,Tim Burton Storytelling At Its Finest,10,23 October 2011,"Tim Burton wanted to work on Nightmare for years but couldn't direct it due to filming Batman Returns. So he got someone who shared in his artistic style, Henry Selick and together they made one of the best animated films of all time.Nightmare Before Christmas takes place in three worlds. Halloweentown, Christmastown and our world. The story is about a skeleton brilliantly named Jack Skellington who is tired of always scaring people and wants more out of his life(or lack there-of). While walking in the woods he stumbles across a circle of trees with doors to other worlds. He enters the Christmas one and is immediately swept away by the bright and colorful atmosphere of Christmastown. He returns to Halloweentown and tells all the other citizens about it. They soon decide they should try Christmas for themselves. Only one person/rag doll experiment thinks this is a bad idea, Sally who is smitten for Jack(and him unaware of it).The citizens try their best but all they can make are scary toys to give to the children. At one point Santa Claus himself is taken to the resident bogeyman, Oogie Boogie after Jack borrows his hat to complete his costume. As Santa Claus is about to be forced to play a deadly gambling game, Jack goes out into the real world to deliver the presents. Things go horribly wrong and soon the citizens of the real world call the military to shoot the impostor Santa Claus down. Merry Christmas right? This film is magnificent. It's perfect to watch on Halloween or Christmas or anytime of the year. The characters are each unique in their own way and the songs in the movie are all extremely catchy and wonderfully orchestrated by Danny Elfman. Personally I can't think of any flaw in this film. Even with the relatively short run-time of 76 minutes the pacing is still pretty good and nothing really seems to drag on. This is just one of those movies you could watch forever and never tire of. Only Tim Burton could think of something this insane and awesome.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
208,amethystwings32,have yourself a very scary Christmas,10,20 May 2012,"Once upon a time there was a town called Halloweentown ! Where everything is Halloween, all year around ! Then Jack Skelington the Pumpkin king of this dreary and creepy little town. Had a wonderfully awful idea why not, celebrate Christmas and make it ours. There in lies the title , The Nightmare Before Christmas. A dark and gloomy spin on the classic poem. 'Twas the Night Before Christmas', that only Tim Burton himself could deliver! Such a twisted tale,of meshing Christmas and Halloween together as one! In this hauntingly delightful musical. About kidnapping Father Christmas, and putting his own spin on the holiday! But his plan takes a frightful turn for the worse, when the toys he created terrify and turn on the little kids! All of that sinister planning of his crashed and burned! My favorite character was Sally , a kind hearted rag doll held captive by a mad scientist! Who in the end won over the black hearted Jack! I love this this movie ! It combines two of my favorite holidays together. In a off colorsort of way!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
209,quin1974,Tim Burton on steroids,9,19 December 2000,"What do you get when you give Tim Burton the chance to let his imagination run wild without the limitations of real-life shooting and setbuilding etc.The Night Before Christmas is the answer.Everything in this movie looks absolutely stunning. Tim Burton had a field day designing this incredibly handsome puppet movie. 'Cause that's what it is, if you hadn't noticed this before. The mistake is easily made because the characters move so fluently that after a while you forget you are watching stop-motion animation.The story is about the king of Halloweentown, Jack Skellington who is tired of doing the same thing each year after year after year. Scaring people doesn't fulfill his desires anymore and he wants out. His wishes are met and he finds a portal in the middle of the woods with access to the various towns of the holidays, Easter, Thanksgiving, St. Patricks Day, and of course Christmas. He enters the portal and is thrown into the serene and happy world of Christmas Town. Here he first experiences what the world could be like when people are jolly and happy. He wants this, too, and he decides to steal Christmas and make this his new job.That's where everything goes wrong, the people in Halloweentown cannot understand what Christmas stands for, and they give a twist to Christmas that the children in the world will not soon forget. Jack kidnaps Sandy Claws (Santa Claus) and poses as the New Santa. One girl has a premonition that everything is going to go wrong, Sally tries to convince Jack that he should call the whole adventure off, to no avail. The rest is history...The art direction is absolutely stunning, it will take several viewings to grasp all the details in the scenes. The songs are beautiful, especially the ones by Jack (voice of composer Danny Elfman himself).The real treat in this are the supporting cast, these are so funny and well-done that they almost steal the show.One problem: The relationship between Sally and Jack is not worked out properly to my idea, this could have gotten a little bit more attention in the script. And how did Sally know that Santa was imprisoned by the Boogie Man?Apart from these minor setbacks, this is a movie to cherish on i.e. DVD and watch over and over and over and over. It is up there in the ranks of Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, and James and the Giant Peach (Selicks other stop-motion flick)9/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas
210,watto124,"A great, fun, and addictive film.",10,2 October 2001,"The first time I saw this movie back in 93', I didn't like it that much. Then, a year ago, I viewed it again and my eyes were opened to one of the most charming, catchy, fun, artistically brilliant films I've EVER seen. The animation is absolutely uncanny. It marvelously sets a mood that has no equal. Danny Elfman, one of my favorite composers, really busts his butt to pull the music and lyrics off and he succeeds gloriously. One of the most exquisitely composed movies of all time. I know ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is only an hour and fifteen minutes, but it certainly seem much longer than that. That is because there is not a dull moment in the whole movie. It dares not to take take a breath and slow down. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going, and going, and going. I cannot stress enough how much eye candy the film contains. I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, it would have been quite a visual experience. Tim Burton's style is apparent throughout, and there's not much lame, sentimental, Disney-esque stuff in it. What is there is a small ozone layer of warmth that envelops the whole package and delivers an original, heart-warming, and visually breath-taking masterpice of cinema. It is, and will continue to be a classic of epic proportions. A masterpiece.       10/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

This movie took a lot of work and it shows. Jack is such a wonderful character. The music is excellent. When the opening music starts it pulls you into the story. It's rare that I see a movie that stirs my childlike imagination. This movie brought back all my anticipation as a child. I remember how exciting it was every holiday waiting for the x-mas programs to air on TV. With the advent of cable and VCRs I feel sad for the kids who won't get to experience that joy, but I am sure they have their own experiences to look forward to. I thought it was amusing to hear people complain about how ""dark"" the movie was. I asked them what they thought Halloween town should look like? I pointed out how bright and festive X-mas town was. That usually shuts them up. If that doesn't work there is always duct tape. ;-P",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
216,Welly-2,A Dream!,10,21 July 1999,"This is as good as it gets! Tim Burton has produced a classic. Never say 'animation' and assume it is a secondary artform again! This film has wit, wisdom and wonders that will improve on each new viewing. The music, though not immediately addictive, will soon get into your bones and have you whistling for the rest of the day. Even the standard of the voices becomes somehow appropriate and enjoyable after a while. The characters are magnificent, especially Sally's wheelchair-bound maniac of a father, and the whole idea that the characters of Halloween could have a go at hi-jacking Christmas is such a good one that Tim Burton must have sat up in his bath and shouted Eureeka when he thought of it. Don't miss this...and don't watch it just the once.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

218,CheshireCatsGrin,A true must see for all Halloween fans,10,12 December 2004,"I am not a big Tim Burton fan, but this movie is in my top 3 of all time. Perhaps the fact that Halloween is my favorite holiday influenced my opinion, but I doubt it. The more I hear and read about this movie, the more I love it.Based on a parody of the famous ""Night before Christmas"" poem by Moore that Burton wrote and illustrated while employed at Disney, this idea was stagnant for many years prior to filming. In many ways this was a good thing, technology was able to catch up to Burton's ideas.In NBC, we see our hero Jack Skellington, aka The Pumpkin King, depressed as another Halloween passes. In the background we hear the residents of Halloween Town celebrate another wonderful holiday. But Jack is sad. The only one who notices is the Rag Doll-style woman Sally.Other characters, including many town-monsters, are introduced. We meet the wonderful mayor with two faces, the evil scientist and his assistant, three local children and our evil boogie-man.After an accident, Jack develops a plan to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"" and give presents out for Christmas in place of Christmas Town. You will have to view this movie to discover the rest.The claymation is not what I expected, it was of a high quality and the movements are not jerky like the old Christmas Specials. Danny Elfman's music has little resemblance to his work with Ongo Bongo and ""What's this?"" (which Jack sings when he discovers the colorful world of Christmas Town) is closer to a tune mixed from Cabaret and The Music Man. The voices match the mouth movements nearly perfectly. This was a project from the heart and all the little touches to make it 'just' right show this fact.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
219,andynortonuk,a work of genius,10,31 August 2002,"This has to be the first and one of the best Tim Burton films I have watched when I was a kid. Surprisingly, the movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special.It's the breath-taking 3D stop-motion animation! This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probably the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are positioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that explains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.A work of genius!Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch! Tim Burton is truly a cinematic genius for coming up with such a fantastic idea and make a fantastic film out of it! He should, in 10 years times, receive an honourary Academy Award for his brilliant film career. With a film like this he should be very proud of what he has achieved  in this film alone!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
220,matthewnoorman,Visually stunning and brilliant musically,8,21 October 2020,"Love the claymation and visual effect of this film as well as Danny Elfmans amazing soundtrack.
A twisted humorous tale that none other than Tim Burton could write. The thing for me that holds back this from being one of Tim Burtons best is the characters themselves although Jack comes full circle and realizes his wrong doing, for how crucial a character he is there seems to be little development of his character and especially the development of his and sally's relationship. Their love story is the ying to the films yang. Its an important element of the film that comes up underdeveloped.
Overall a marvellous film thats flaws are minimal and its bright spots are unique and impressive.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
221,nucksfan4life,An amazing film!,10,28 May 2002,"This is a visually stunning film. The stop-motion animation is so beautifully precise and detailed. I fell in love with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" the first time I saw it. It is a masterpiece. The animation would be a waste if the story were poor. But not to fear...Burton provides such an original story of holidays having their own little towns with citizens working to stage our various holidays. This makes for a great storyline. The music is also stunning, with a beautiful vocal and instrumental score provided by the great Danny Elfman. I had the soundtrack within an hour of seeing the film for the first time. This movie was given special status due to it being the first feature length stop-motion animated film in history. However, the movie is so amazing that I think the special status would still have been given had ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" been the 17th feature length stop-motion animated film.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
222,griffin84,What's This??,10,31 October 2003,"This has always been one of my favorite Halloween movies.  Even if it isn't scary, the brilliant claymation and design of Halloween town is truly amazing.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon/Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old scares and traditions of Halloween, yet feels as though no one in his kingdom of Halloweentown would understand.  One night while walking, he stumbles upon a collect of doors, each leading to a different world ruled by a certain holiday (a heart-shaped door for Valentine's Day, a shamrock for St. Patrick's Day, etc.).  However, he becomes completely mesmerized by the Christmas door and, upon discovering the world of Christmastown, finds what he believes he has been missing for so long.  However, no one in Halloweentown can truly understand Christmas.  Suddenly, Jack gets the idea of having his fellow goblins and monsters take over Christmas, and things go topsy-turvy really fast as children are given gifts of shrunken heads, vampire teddy-bears, man-eating snakes, the list goes on.  During all of this, the real Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) is held captive in Halloweentown by the Oogie Bogie Monster (Ken Page), who has plans to eat Santa before the night is up; and Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a living rag-doll who has fallen in love with Jack tries to save Christmas before it's too late.This truly goes as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces, not to mention a timeless classic that looks at both Christmas and Halloween from a totally different view.  The music is wonderful, with catchy songs like `What's This?' and `Kidnap Sandy Claws'.  Danny Elfman has always been one of my favorite composers, and the soundtrack to Nightmare Before Christmas is a true credit to his name.  Regardless if you're more of a Halloween or Christmas person, be sure to check this one out.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
223,Tyler_R_Weston,"Strange story, strange characters, strange film. I love it.",10,20 August 2003,"Nightmare before Christmas is an instant classic of Touchstone and Disney. Burton was always the master of weird things such as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. But this one is his greatest yet!! And this film makes an interesting appearance in the classic game, Kingdom Hearts. I never get tired of watching it and Jack is one of the most confident characters I've seen in any movie. Oogie Boogie is a great villain with his mischievious kids, Lock, Shock, & Barrel. This film has interesting characters and story. Halloween and Christmas is kinda cool. Except that it means Devil's Night vs. Christ's Birthday. Well, this film wasn't that evil. it's just all for fun. Besides, the citizens of Halloween Town are actually nice in a creepy way.

224,stiv-7,The Grinch gets outdone!,9,4 November 1999,"This is a personal favourite. Although credited to Henry Selick, Burton's fingerprints are all over this, and like most Burton films, it gets better with repeat viewings. My only quibble with the video version is the opening narration. I can't remember exactly, but the narration on the soundtrack CD is by Patrick Stewart, and is vastly superior and more extensive than what is contained in the VHS version, and I seem to remember that Stewart's narration is contained in the theatrical release. Oh well, it doesn't detract too severely from the film, which is so subversive and twisted as to make ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" look like a fairy tale. Here we have a dark protagonist who wants to appropriate Christmas not because he wants to make the world as miserable as he, but because he thinks he can make it better. His misguided attempts to bring Christmas to the masses in his own unique way are so blackly funny, and such a refreshing change from the commercialistic style of the Santa Claus myth, that when he is ultimately thwarted, we feel sad that he didn't succeed; not because we're sick and degenerate, but because the current children's Christmas myth is so stifling, we all feel it could use a good kick in the pants. The Grinch cops out on this level and turns into a complete cheeseball. Long live Jack Skellington, and may his follies cause us to reexamine our own Christmas traditions.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Then I saw the film and fell in love with it. I had never seen anything like it. It is wonderful! The script is great, the acting and singing are great, the stop action is great. And it is quite humorous. I cannot gush enough about this movie. My favorite character was Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. He has a great idea, he just didn't know how to make it work. I also liked the love story between him and Sally the rag doll. From the beginning you can tell that she is in love with Jack; he does not realize his feelings (or hers) until the end. And the Oogie Boogie scenes are a hoot to watch! This movie also has addicting and memorable songs such as 'This is Halloween,' 'What's This?,' and 'Kidnap the Sandy Claws.' You will be singing them for a week after!If you haven't seen this movie, see it. It is a must for Halloween and the holiday season.

227,JoshSharpe,Creative and unique,8,2 September 2012,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to combine the holidays of Christmas and Halloween? If so, Tim Burton answered it in 1993 with his release of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". The film opens in Halloweentown with shots of ghosts, skeletons, vampires, and witches. Jack Skellington is the pumpkin king and a highly respected citizen. He is lonely and sad, though, because he wants something more than scares and frights. When walking through a forest, he comes across a door that takes him to Christmasland and he instantly knows; this is what he has been looking for. What he decides to do is this: replace Santa this Christmas and put his own spin on things. To do it his own way. This movie, inspired by Tim Burton's poem, is enchanting to look at and the animation is unbelievable. However, don't be expecting a lot of Christmas cheer in this holiday story because it is lacking in that aspect. Also, being a Christian, I found the lack of any mention of the birth of Christ disappointing. However, Christmas is portrayed as something special, so much so that Jack can't even explain it to his friends. And that in itself shows that Christmas is not a regular holiday like any other. Jack's intentions also are good, for he wants to give and make people joyful. Though it is not perfect, I still think it is quite a good movie, primarily because of its creativeness and originally, both of which are qualities that always appeal to me. I also highly recommend reading the original poem or even better, listening to Christopher Lee read it with the animation and art from the movie. You can watch it on Blu-ray or DVD and I actually enjoyed even more than the movie. I also found it on YouTube. The poem itself is available in a beautifully animated storybook that I will be sure to purchase.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

229,Fredichi,Brilliant concept beautifully executed.,10,5 April 2000,"This movie is brilliant. It isn't just a family film in that it's isn't just for kids or the PG crowd. It's dark tone will appeal to adults and mature audiences. However the dark tone is nothing a child can't handle or probably even notice. The movie is about Halloween!!!!! So stop with it's too dark. If you don't let your kid out on Halloween then fine don't let them see this. Go back to your 24hr brain-wash coddle fest. Stick to Barney and most of the Disney catalog.But if you like to feed you and your child's imagination GO SEE THIS MOVIE!This is the Disney movie that Disney rightfully should not claim as their own. However, it is more Disney in spirit than any Disney film produced in the past twenty years.It is innovative and original. Disney is not anymore. Only productions made outside of their creative stranglehold are any good. (This and the Toy Story movies).Visually, this has to be the most original animated movie ever. Only Tim Burton could of done this and thank god he did.I have watched this movie about ten times and every time I find something new. Something you parents might want to keep in mind, when your child wants to watch this again.
I usually hate songs in movies but these are catchy and kind of sarcastic so they aren't the dreaded formulaic - bad - Broadway wannabe- bathroom break - catnaps that are usually present in EVERY Disney animated movie of the last 11 years.
This movie drips with creativity and heart. Down to the tiniest detail you can tell the animators put their soul into this. Instead of the assembly line animation of Disney's latest merchandising juggernaut.If you like Tim Burton see this. If you are tired of being patronized by Disney see this. If your kid has any kind of imagination and intelligence, shut off the Lion King and make them see this.
Note: DVD has a great picture and sound and is the best way to appreciate this landmark and classic animated film.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
230,rogerdozier,Love this movie,10,1 December 2018,I almost forgot how great this is. A one of a kind true delight to watch,The Nightmare Before Christmas
231,moviegeek310,Weird and not very likable,4,28 December 2007,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has been called a Halloween classic by many respected reviewers, yet after seeing it in 3-D re-release, I don't see what is so special. The story is this; the king of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, has become bored of the same old thing every year, so after wandering through a haunted wood he comes upon Christmas Town. There he discovers what he has been missing all along: warmth and joy. So Jack kidnaps Santa and tries to make Christmas happen himself. Here's the thing though, it's a kid's movie, so it was very boring for me, but if I was a little kid I would've been scared silly of this movie. The visuals are dark and quite Gothic, and the main character is a lanky skeleton with dark holes for eyes.I must say, even though the visuals are Gothic, they are stunning. The whole movie is done in claymation so what they did is amazing. The opening sequence ""It's Halloween"" is a great song to introduce the movie with great eye candy, but all that quickly gets tiresome as you start to realize how truly weird and twisted it all is. Even Santa and Christmas Town looks somewhat creepy with a Gothic touch, it's slightly depressing. All the songs are in minors and flats which sets the overall tone, and none of the songs, except the above mentioned, are any good. You're probably thinking, ""I'm a big Tim Burton fan though, so I'll like it!"" Wrong! I'm the biggest Tim Burton fan ever and I didn't like it. Plus, contrary to popular belief, this film is not directed by Burton, he only produced it, it was directed by veteran clay puppeteer Henry Selick. And the script was mediocre, not bad, but not particularly good either.The only other sequence I liked was the signature picture of Jack in front of the huge full moon. Otherwise, the 3-D was nothing special, though it does add some nice depth perception and makes you feel like you're watching it all in a box. The only reason I'd recommend this movie is if you already have seen it and loved it, or you like twisted, downright weird and boring movies.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
232,zurnd,Think of It As Rudolph Mixed In With The Works of Edward Gory,10,1 March 2013,"I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
233,GingerStarWarsnerd,"An okay film, not terrible, but not great either",5,30 June 2019,"One of Tim Burton's most popular movies. It's okay. The plot line is silly and is kinda strange when you mix two completely different Holidays despite the movie title. The characters were strange. This movie isn't very creepy so it won't scare young ones too easy. A pretty family friendly film. Overall, it's okay but not that entertaining.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
234,TheOneManBoxOffice,Has every right to be considered a movie milestone.,10,22 September 2013,"We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by ""Batman"" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make ""Coraline"") that really caught our attention. That film was ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"".The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet.Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing ""Batman Returns"" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama ""Ed Wood"", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole.The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled ""Nightmare Revisited"", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do.Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better.Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called ""The Watcher in the Woods"". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

236,bbSouthstreet,A True Tim Burton Film,10,2 August 2001,"I was five years old when I saw this movie and after that the words Tim Burton rang in my ears as one of Hollywood's most eccentric directors. Whenever I hear that a Tim Burton film is coming out I think of The Nightmare Before Christmas and how wonderful it is. The story is very original, the scenery is wonderfully Gothic and the characters and animation is to scream for. Another thing about this film are the songs. They're so twisted and funny that I can't help but hum, whistle or just sing them word by word and musical note by musical note. So in conclusion, The Nightmare Before Christmas is what you would get if you were to put the minds of Edgar Allen Poe and Dr. Seuss in a blender. You get a beautifully dark and wildly bizarre film about Santa Claus, dancing skeletons and what goes bump in the night.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
237,GoldenBlunderbuss,A feast for the eyes and ears ... even if it's not technically a Tim Burton film,8,31 July 2018,"An ambitious stop motion film which sees Jack the Pumpkin King journey from his native Hallowe'en Town to the neighbouring Christmas Town. When he attempts to bring the joy of the festive season to his horror-happy friends, they love it ... only because they've got the wrong end of the stick.The 76-minute film sees Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King in charge of the annual celebrations in his native Hallowe'en Town, lose motivation to do the same thing year after year. Stumbling across the neighbouring Christmas Town one evening, he attempts to introduce his old friends to his finding of presents, decorating trees and Santa Claus ... only for them to taint his explanations with their Hallowe'en-saturated imaginations. In the end, he gives them what they want to hear to the detriment of the habitants of Christmas Town, Santa Claus and Jack himself.Originally intended as a 30-minute Christmas TV special or a short film adaptation of a three-page poem written by Tim Burton, executives felt it was ""too weird"" for Disney to make and so it was shelved. After Burton's successes with Beetlejuice and Batman, the studio agreed to make it into a feature-length stop motion with Henry Sellick directing given Burton's commitments to the new Batman Returns at the time. At one stage, the team knew the story but not in its entirety - all eleven songs in the film were written before a word of the screenplay was on the page.Once you say it's a Tim Burton film, people know what to expect - a loner main character, twisted architecture and bizarre character design. All of the above are in abundance in a film some might say this is the most Tim Burton film ever made, despite him not being in the director's chair; he's credited as a producer instead. It's hard not to think of The Nightmare Before Christmas as the most surreal of Burton's films given the almost boundless potential afforded to the production team of building a miniature world with all the gravity-defying structures and unfeasible character design instead of creating it all at a 1:1 scale.It's not going to be a film for everyone (I showed it to people at uni and most of them hated it) but it's built a cult following in the 24 years since it came out to give it the wider audience it never had upon its initial limited release. One gripe is that some of the lyrics in the slower songs are thrown in to get the point across rather than making it a song that flows. That said, it's still a film guaranteed to put a smile on your face from the first viewing for the story to the latest for the amazingly attentive details hidden in the corners of every frame.Best Quote: ""Just because I cannot see it, doesn't mean I can't believe it!""",The Nightmare Before Christmas
238,mr composer,"A Halloween Film, Not a Christmas film",10,8 August 2003,"I loved this film.  My first experience with this in the theaters was not so great.  First of all, although it features both Halloween and Christmas in the film, it is to me a Halloween movie.  This is such a more thrilling movie at that time.  Nevertheless, when this released where I lived, it was just before Christmas, and that didn't go to well.  Plus, it was a late-night showing on a weekend in a theater packed with loud drinkers.  So I didn't get too much out of it.  But as soon as I saw it in my own home, around Halloween, it became apparent what a great film this is.  The story is highly creative, and the characters are awesome.  Beautiful animation, Tim Burton, and the multi-talents of Danny Elfman (who wrote the music, lyrics, and sang at least three parts) put this over-the-top.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
239,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,The debate continues: Is this a Halloween or Christmas movie?,8,22 October 2020,"It's been a few days now and I still have the music stuck in my head. Danny Elfman not only composed the score, not only wrote the lyrics, but also sang the voice of Jack Skellington. (What a legend.) The music is without a doubt my favourite part of this movie. Not to mention the creative character designs, spectacular set pieces, and excellent direction, which made me occasionally forget that this was all done with stop-motion animation. It also surprisingly adds some dark and twisted adult themes, which was unexpected for a kid's movie. (But I loved that.)On the other hand, the short runtime of 76 minutes makes the movie feel rushed at times. Some characters change their motivations all within a short period of time, and you have no choice but to buy it. For instance, Jack hijacks Christmas, realizes he ruined Christmas, and now he needs to save Christmas, and this happened all within a few minutes. As well, Jack and Sally's relationship felt very one-sided. Sally liked Jack, but I never got the sense that Jack liked Sally. Besides some elements feeling rushed, this is the perfect Halloween/Christmas movie to get you in the mood for either holiday.Score: 8 out of 10

240,theblackscythe,"The ultimate holiday crossover, and a landmark for animation.",9,10 November 2014,"*I personally consider this to be the ultimate November movie (combining the holidays of October and December), and that is why I have written this review now in particular. The reason this film is so highly lauded is how it merges to beloved times of the year together. Nightmare does this in ways which extend beyond the lavish aesthetic, the atmosphere of both seasons permeate the film throughout. The creepy joy of Halloween and the whimsical timelessness of Christmas are perfectly balanced here. It could stand alone for both seasons, but manages to stand for them both. This is a huge accomplishment. The films flawless atmosphere comes from it's excellent musical score, perhaps Elfman's very best, and it's outstanding stop motion animation. Laying down the foundations for stop-motion films to follow, the stunning colours, expression and imagery here are truly amazing and hold up well today, despite Henry Selick's own ambitious follow up stop-motion films. I must in particular praise the film's palette, a trait which is held by most of Selick's films.The film's story is also classic. Simply told, but incredibly effective. This is largely due to the myriad of enjoyable musical sequences spread throughout the runtime, all of which contribute to the story and tell it's tale largely through the music itself. The story is also made stronger by the film's great cast of talent voice actors and singers, who work a fairly predictable story into narrative magic.It almost feels like this film has always existed. It so perfectly encapsulates two seasons and is so classic in its imagery and storytelling, it is hard to imagine a world without Nightmare. A milestone in animation, musicals and holiday classics, and the perfect ambassador for the dreary month of November.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

When in fact, the creatures from Halloween Town decided to do Christmas instead of Halloween. And the results, were shocking! LOL! There were so many shocks and scares on such a jolly occasion.The movie impressed me when I saw all the holiday occasions: Valentine's Day, Easter, Christmas and Halloween. This impressed me because, this was how Jack the Pumpkin King got to see what Christmas was about, behind that Christmas door, there was a blazing Jack O'Lantern for a sun in Halloween Town and ""Lamp O' Lanterns"" for lam-posts.

Don't think anyone thought that until the release of this Halloween/Christmas classic.

Its stop- motion animation entertains with a seemingly effortless ease, though quite a lot of painstaking artistry was required to bring the world of Jack Skellington to life. It's the story of Jack, the ""Pumpkin King,"" who is essentially the physical embodiment of the spirit of Halloween. After yet another successful Halloween, Jack wanders away from town with his dog Zero, tired of the holiday he has mastered and seeking a new sense of purpose. He stumbles into ""Christmas Town"" and decides to give the people of Halloween Town a new project. Though not overtly political, Nightmare has a progressive quality, both in terms of the daring vision it brings to the screen and in its themes. It's a film about struggling against the boundaries of your environment and pressing for change. And even though Jack's attempt to usurp Christmas is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, he's not wrong to seek new possibilities, and he emerges from the experience a changed skeleton. He's revived and renewed, and with the help of Sally, who loves Jack for who he is, he realizes his ambition was driven by selfishness.

The story is about Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon/Danny Elfman), the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown who, being tired of tricks and treats and all the scary elements that make up Halloween, decides, while walking with his trusty sidekick Zero (whom I affectionately call the Orange-Nosed Ghost Dog!), to explore a new world. That new world was Christmastown! After being enchanted by the wonders and joys of Christmastown, Jack devises a plan to take over Christmas and fill Santa Clause's shoes (or as Jack calls him, ""Sandy Claws""). In doing so, he get's the entire town involved by putting a Halloween-like twist on Christmas (making ducks with razor-sharp teeth, dolls with no heads, etc.), and he get's the mischievous prankster trio of Lock, Shock, and Barrel to ""kidnap the sandy claws."" At first, the trio hillariously kidnaps the Easter Bunny, but the second time, when they do kidnap Santa, they send him to Oogie Boogie, the villain of Halloweentown, and then, more chaos ensues! This movie, even though it's animated and might not exactly be scary, it's very dark and creepy compared to most animated features that were made before and around that time frame. That being said, it was so dark that Disney, who originally produced and was going to release this film, had to back out and release it under Touchstone Pictures. Even though it's not slated under the Disney canon, it still has all the elements of a Disney classic: great story, great music score/songs composed by Danny Elfman (my favorites are ""This is Halloween,"" ""What's This,"" ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws,"" and ""Making Christmas,""), and some of the most amazingly imaginative characters ever animated such as the two-faced Mayor of Halloweentown (voiced by Glenn Shaddix), the mad scientist of Halloweentown Dr. Finklestein (voiced by William Hickey), and Jack's rag-doll of a girlfriend Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara). My favorites are Lock, Shock, and Barrel! If you by any chance haven't seen this amazing motion picture classic in the last 18 years it's been out, what are you waiting for! Watch it when it comes on T.V. again this Holiday season or rent it if you come across it! I love this movie and it's one of my favorites! Definitely a Classic!

Later in 2009, ""Coraline"" (a fantasy movie based on the novel that was written by Neil Gaiman) was also directed by Henry Selick, where he worked as a producer too. A poem, on which 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is based upon, was written by Tim Burton in 1982, but the production only started in 1991 with a budget of $18 million. The famous song for this movie, which is called ""This is Halloween"", was written by Danny Elfman in 1993.The main character, Jack, lives in a Halloween Town, where many other monsters also happen to live. Jack is interested in Christmas Town, which he finds unexpectedly, and learns all about Christmas, which he thinks is amazing. Eventually he wants to celebrate Christmas with just himself, the other monsters, but without Santa.

252,SnacksForAll,"An Overrated, but Visually Beautiful Classic",4,25 September 2005,"Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has gone from a cult status to mainstream classic with 20-somethings (and others) who have fond childhood memories of this film.In true Tim Burton form, however, ""Nightmare,"" is certainly visually stunning, bursting at the seems with raw imagination, and, of course... grossly over-hyped.Once you get past the remarkable and unique animation and visual style, what you're left with is a rather boring tale that you'd frankly have to be under the age of 12 to truly enjoy (I was 11 when I saw it, and didn't like it then, either, so go figure). Sure, the premise is wonderful on paper: The ""king"" of Halloween, akin to Easter's rabbit and Christmas's Santa Claus, becomes disillusioned with Halloween and discovers Christmas, becoming inspired to take over duties for Santa Claus...but royally jeopardizes the new holiday he has grown to love when he kidnaps Saint Nick.Yes, it's definitely a cool idea. To see it play out over the course of an entire feature length film? That's something else entirely. Especially if that film happens to be, essentially, a kid's film (and despite the spooky visuals and dark tones, let's not kid ourselves, this IS a children's film). What starts out as a great idea for a plot turns into a boring and predictable ride through a world you can't wait to get out of. The musical aspect, which is a large part of what makes this film, is another complaint. I'm sorry to say it, but these songs are largely laborious to endure -- contrived pieces that drone on annoyingly and seem rather uninspired. Normally, I'd let this sort of thing go, but when the music is such an integral part of a film (and this film IS a musical), it's hard to ignore. I'm sure many would disagree with me on this, but think about it -- besides the decent ""flagship"" track (""What's this?"") are you really going to catch yourself humming any of the songs from this film after only one or a few viewings the way you hum tracks from Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR or TOMMY? I don't think so.Yes, the film is annoyingly over-hyped, overrated, and to some extent, overdone. All negativity aside, though, I do think this makes a wonderful children's' film -- surely, one of those special flicks we can all relate to that stick with us and perhaps even shape us when we see them in those magical and formative early years. As I mentioned above, the visual style is unforgettable and the tone and feel of ""Nightmare"" accomplish what I believe Tim Burton set out to achieve (as far as ""tone and feel"" are concerned). This is definitely one I think I'd been better served to watch at the age of 4, 5, 6 or 7, but unfortunately it came out a few years too late, I suppose.For kids -- a winner.

256,LLinus,Lovely,7,5 August 2013,"A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
257,moviemonster92,"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas""",7,17 August 2006,"Henry Selick has directed some great funny animated movies such as Mokeybone, and James and the Giant Peach. So when he teamed up with Tim Burton, they made a great animated classic. Much like Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Tim Burton's The Nightmare before Christmas has been a Halloween/ Christmas tradition for many years, thanks to an imaginative and funny script from Tim Burton who wrote it. The plot is as old as time: Jack Skellington (Chris Sarrandon) is the skeleton King of Halloweentown and is getting tired of the same old routine every single year. So one day while taking his ghost dog Zero, he stumbles upon the door leading out of his world and into Christmastown. Not knowing much about Christmas he decides to bring Christmas to Halloweentown and in the essence destroys the holiday for every one, all the while trying to save his girlfriend Sally the Rag Doll (Catherine O' Hara) and Santa Claus (Edward Ivory) from the clutches of the evil Ooogie Boogie Man (Ken Page). Over the years this has become an animated classic among kids and adults and has been celebrated throughout the years. The voice talent is great and strong for this movie and keeps the plot flowing. The animation and visual effects are great also. All in all, a very celebrated Halloween/ Christmas animated musical family film.3 out of 4 stars",The Nightmare Before Christmas

A dark place full of weird and wonderful characters who spend the entire year planning the next halloween party, with Jack looking over the proceedings. Then after one quite frightful halloween, Jack realises that something is missing in his life, and whilst walking through the woods he comes across a door that leads him to the world of Christmas town, a place bright and happy. Jack finds the place awe inspiring and when he returns to his home of Halloween, decides to bring festive cheer with him. The characters are brilliant, as is the music and gags. Children will love it, adults will love it, quite possibly a classic animated film for the ages",The Nightmare Before Christmas

262,I_am_Jacks_Revenge,This is classic Burton; one of his greatest,10,26 August 2007,"Tim Burton is terrific. He is awesome at animation, no matter how weird his movies might be. I mean, take a look at Corpse Bride; creepy, but good. Then there is Edward Scissorhands, which I haven't seen yet. I hear it's also good.Anyway, the plot: You know the holidays? Christmas? Easter? Etc.? Well, there are actually towns where they originated in a place in the middle of the woods. Where? We may never know. We enter a tree with a door shaped like a pumpkin. Guess which holiday? Halloween. We fall down the dark hole until lights show and every scary creature we have ever seen in movies, books, and blah blah blah are singing a song about Halloweentown. Enter Jack Skellington, the mastermind of the eerie parade and the scariest of all of the residents. There's only one problem: he is not satisfied, because it's the same every year. The only one who really understands him is Sally, who is made of many different parts. She is really kept grounded by her creator, the doctor. He is, what we might say, overprotective. Either that, or he just doesn't want her out of the house. When Jack leaves the town with his ghost pet dog Zero, he discovers the doors that we were introduced to at the beginning of the movie. He goes by the door shaped as a pine tree with decorations. He opens it, and falls in. He lands on the snow. He is so amazed by the colours and no one is screaming, no one is about to be scared, and everyone is happy. He is so enlightened by this town, he takes the idea back to Halloweentown and tells everyone about it. Everyone is somewhat confused that there's nothing scary about it. The big guy who runs Christmastown, Santy Claus, as they call him, doesn't know what'll happen. Jack calls Boogie's boys to bring Santy Claus to him, and to leave the evil Oogie Boogie out of it. But with the three Boogie's boys, they'll never keep that promise. My favourite song of the whole movie is the ""We'll capture Santy Claus"" one that they sing.I'm not going to say anything else, but this is a good movie, in my opinion.

After finishing It, I had a couple thought. First of all, the animation is a feast for the eyes and the music is phenomenal. Tim Burton is an artistic genius and the effects and music were thoroughly satisfying. That being said, I felt it was way too short. The action rose and fell far too quickly, and the high drama at the end felt forced. The crux of the plot came to easily and too soon. If they had made it a little longer and deeper, the film would be perfect. But that should in no way stop you from seeing this. It's a great spooky Christmas flick for your older kids and parents.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
264,davidtkd-25249,The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993): Henry Selick's Masterpiece,10,1 February 2018,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy drama starring Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickley, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, and Glenn Shadix. The Plot: Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon), a resident from ""Halloween Town"" who stumbles through a portal to ""Christmas Town"" and decides to celebrate the holiday with disastrous consequences. The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, when Burton was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Burton's ""Vincent"" in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to contemplate whether to release The Nightmare Before Christmas as a short film or a 30-minute TV Special. Many years passed, and Tim Burton developed thoughts about this project more and more over time. He made a deal with Disney in the year 1990. The production for the movie started in July of 1991 in San Francisco, California, USA. Disney decided to release the film through the Touchstone Pictures banner stating that they thought that The Nightmare Before Christmas would be ""too frightening for kids."" The film was a huge success, grossing $76.2 million over its theatrical run on a budget of $18,000,000. Danny Elfman's film score and his singing voice for Jack is absolutely amazing. This is for sure director Henry Selick's masterpiece and his best film. It was nominated the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the first for an animated film. An absolute masterpiece and my favorite christmas movie and holiday movie of all-time. 10/10.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
265,julcltr,"Amazing, just amazing",10,7 March 2009,"I'm actually amazed. Every movie that I've seen that was directed (or even produced) by Tim Burton was not bad at all (well, with the exception of Planet of the Apes). But still, I hadn't seen this one until recently.You know, if I saw this seven years ago, I would have been scared out of my wits. I first saw this three months ago when the DVD was being re-released, and it was actually better than I expected. I didn't think that it would be a musical, and I am a huge fan of them. I think Danny Elfman has done his best work on this movie (I also think he does an amazing singing voice for Jack Skellington). Since then, I became an official fan of Tim Burton. I can't wait for his next movie!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
266,david-1976,It's the music!,10,6 November 2006,"I love Tim Burton movies in general, but I think that this one is something special. Not only do I like the characters and the story, but since there are already a bazillion comments about those things, I'd like to point out the prodigious gifts of Danny Elfman, who wrote the songs and the score for this film. He's amazing.Of course, anyone who loves ""The Simpsons"" as much as I do is already an Elfman fan... and as Jack Skellington you can hear just a hint of the singing voice of Sideshow Bob!But it's the music that just blows me away. It ranges in style from the 1920's Kurt Weill- Bertolt Brecht adaptations (right down, on occasion, to the rhythm banjo and mournful alto sax), to the Russian composers, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich, all done with a sense of humor and homage that keeps it fresh, unlike, say, Kander and Ebb, who keep writing Weill-Brecht material to the point that there's more of their music in that particular style than there is by Weill, who figured out by the 1930's that it would only go so far, and who wrote some of the great tunes of the American theatre, as well as the incredible and underrated opera ""Street Scene.""Elfman is a film composer whose work ranks with the best of (and this is high praise, indeed, coming from me) John Williams, Bernard Herrmann, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold.

268,ochoamanuel21,Instant Classic,9,12 October 2010,"More of a soundtrack than a movie, but that is not really such a bad thing when all 11 songs are top notch! The plot for this one is simple, Jack the king of Halloween is tired of his holiday and is fascinated by Christmas that he decides to replace Santa to experience the joy of Christmas although him and his people don't fully understand the elements of the holiday and instead terrorize the town with a mix of Halloween and Christmas. There a total of 11 songs with the first one reworked at the end along with the romantic Is Never Meant To Be to Is Meant To Be, although I can safely say that the first song This is Halloween and the villains' songs Let's Kidnap Sandy Claws and Oogie Boogie are the most entertaining, as always in animated features the villains have the best songs. The funny aspect about this movie is that is the perfect movie to play on Halloween and Christmas as well although I'd incline more with Halloween but it does have that Christmas spirit in the number What's This? and at the end of the movie where Santa wishes Jack a Happy Halloween and Jack replies with a Merry Christmas. I also love how they show the main character's growth when he admits the spectacle of Christmas but to also accept his place as the king of Halloween and how they both appreciate their holiday at the end of the film with that exchange of Happy Halloween and Merry Christmas, classic. Although I'd like to say that the movie is perfect, it does have some flaws. The main one is that Oogie Boogie deserves more screen presence as he was the best character in the movie with the best musical number but the audience only get to know that he is a gambler and one of the most feared in Halloween Town, although his death is extremely anti-climactic as Jack just happens to stumble on a loose string and pulls on it therefore releasing all of his bugs and killing him, lame. It would of being nice to see Jack and his goons terrorize the town at the beginning as well when they praise him at the beginning so we can see how Jack behaves as the Pumpkin King. Also, is never stated but one can safely assume that the town that Jack visits as Sandy Claws and the one that is fixed is the real world but it can also be Christmas Town for that matter since the elves look similar to the children but this last complaint is just a nitpick. My verdict is to definitely buy this movie since it's both a Halloween and Christmas classic and it belongs in any collection.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Like no one else, he captures beauty in the most horrible places and the most terrible looking creatures, and he warms our hearts with that beauty.In The Nightmare Before Christmas again he transforms a nightmarish world into something cheerful and insanely merry, where there is always a place for love. It's this inversion of probable scenarios and the complexity of the main characters, in opposition to the supporting ones who are usually type characters, that makes the world of Tim Burton's creations so appetizingly interesting for children as well as for adults.And don't forget the delicious songs by Danny Elfman, for me the best and most subversive musical creator in Hollywood.

I was a child when this movie came out and I personally loved it at that time. I am reviewing this movie now in 2016 for the young generation of today.I have a young son and his two friends were over, we were looking through movies to watch and they all decided on this. We got maybe 20 minutes in and the CHILDREN...not me, decided to turn it off. This movie simply does not stand the test of time.Some have said the animation is very good...well by the standard of today it is not, also gauging by the kids reactions the first comments were 'this looks old'. The camera is jerky and hard to watch, the scenes are all dark and bland,""halloween town"" looks like a little cardboard set (not in a cool stop motion animation type of way). The animation department could never fit more than a few characters on the screen at the same time.I do not really know how this movie became some cult phenomenon but watching it with children in 2016 it is flat and boring. The animation is underwhelming and stale. I like the songs but the kids did not.I give it one out of ten because children will simple be bored with a movie like this now. We switched the choice to Power Rangers Christmas and they all liked that a lot more.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Using stop motion for a musical/animation movie is the first of his witty and inspiring moves in this piece of art. It makes the movie look creepy and in some way a little ""disabled"" which certainly suits the overall thematic. The story is fantastic. Halloween is not evil - it's just...weird. And Christmas isn't any better - it just...different. The music is not annoying as it is in some animation movies (and I'm not talking about Disney, I'm talking about other ones) and it's...well...Danny Elfman. You'll realize: I can't seem to find the right words to say how beautiful I find this movie. It's a ten and one of the best films ever. A masterpiece of entertainment, art, and film-making.

276,avi-greene2,A definite milestone in stop-motion animation that everyone should watch.,10,1 November 2016,"So I know it's a little late to be writing this review on a Halloween themed animated movie, but I was watching it the other day on my VCR and thought that it was absolutely fantastic. There are WAY too many things I like about this movie, but I'll just name a few. First of all, I think the soundtrack composed by musical genius Danny Elfman is engaging and very impressive, and my particular favorite songs are ""This is Halloween"" in the beginning and ""What's This"" that Jack Skellington, the main male protagonist in the movie, sings when he accidentally slips into Christmas Town. I also love all the different varieties of characters seen throughout the film, including the mayor of Halloween Town who has two different faces (one being happy and one being sad) as well as a spider necktie, Dr. Finkelstein whose name is supposed to be a parody of Frankenstein (he's not so nice), and Sally the Ragdoll who was created by Finkelstein and is Jack Skellington's girlfriend.But to me, the most significant element of the nightmare is that not only is it a movie based on Halloween, but also there's a lot of other elements that have a tremendous amount to do with Christmas, as the title suggests. Before the climax of the film, all the citizens of Halloween Town help make a new Santa outfit for Jack where Sally sews his hat, and then later Jack, along with his ghost dog Zero, leave Halloween Town via sleigh and help save Christmas when all the boys and girls there receive scary and frightening toys that end up chasing them and waking up their parents when they're sleeping. Sadly he ends up falling into a cemetery, but there's a secret passage that takes Jack back to Halloween Town when Sally and Santa Clause are in trouble and are about to be stewed by the villain in the movie, Oogie Boogie who is very cool, but also very spooky and creepy. In the end, the good kids in Christmas Town get regular toys that don't magically come to life and chase them, and Jack and Sally end up together when they kiss on the top of Spiral Hill.For anyone who is curious as to where 3-D animation originated, this is definitely an animated hallmark of a film to check out, and I particularly recommend that people watch it on Halloween or on Christmas as I did. You may think that ""Toy Story"" was the first ever 3-D animated movie in history, but think again because you'd be wrong. While ""Toy Story"" is considered the very first computer- animated movie, this one is actually stop-motion animation which is also in 3-D. This is a movie that will not only delight you and make you become addicted to its soundtrack, but it will also take you to a magical world from the incredible imagination of Mr. Tim Burton.Anyone who hasn't seen this yet, DEFINITELY SEE IT FOR YOURSELVES!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Well Jack discovers Christmas and tries to make it his own. What makes this charming story so special is a technique called stop motion is used, the whole movie is made up of singing and movie dolls.

278,StrayButlerReturns,Enchanting holiday romp with something for all...,9,4 February 2010,"A 75-minute charmer of a motion picture that transcends age, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas should be part of every household's annual Christmas traditions. Everything a movie-goer has come to expect from the imagination of Tim Burton is presented here in stop-motion form: it's bursting with visual majesty, populated with lovably morbid creations and filled with ornate Danny Elfman compositions. It's an instant classic which bears the esteemed title of being the first feature-length stop-motion animation picture. Certainly paving the way for other greats like Chicken Run and James and the Giant Peach, The Nightmare Before Christmas manages to capture the undeniable Christmas flavour which is blended perfectly with the maudlin imagination of childhood.The story revolves around a straightforward premise: each season has a town (there's Easter Town, Christmas Time, Halloween Town, etc), and none of these towns knows of each other or their respective festivities. Jack Skellington (voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon) resides in Halloween Town, but upon completion of the same old annual routine he grows bored, and loses faith in his own holiday. After Halloween night, Jack saunters off into the woods and stumbles upon a door leading to Christmas Town. He is so taken by the concept of Christmas that he takes it upon himself to take over Santa's duties for the year.Jack Skellington is a uniquely-designed bunch of bones who inhabits a fantastic world brought vividly to life with the first big musical number; This is Halloween - an energetic, sumptuous feast for the senses. The Nightmare Before Christmas contains some of the most ornately detailed and expertly captured shots in the history of stop- motion, and animation altogether. There's so much eloquence in the visual ""voice"" the film exhibits, and each shot is so rich with an almost immeasurable amount of creativity that there's always something eye-catching to focus on. Tim Burton's shooting schedule for Batman Returns conflicted with the long, arduous three-year shoot for The Nightmare Before Christmas, so he hired stop-motion veteran Henry Selick to tackle the directorial duties. Burton may have receded to producer status, but every frame resonates with that distinctive Burton sensibility. As one watches the film and marvels at the visual splendour, one can't help but admire the fantastic, painstaking job Selick and his team did of bringing Burton's vision to life.As it turns out, holiday commercialism is to thank for this film's existence. Burton reportedly got the inspiration for his poem on which the film is based when he witnessed a store taking down a Halloween display and replacing it with Christmas merchandise. The jarring exposition of Halloween and Christmas was all it took to inspire Burton to write a tale of Halloween Town and Christmas Town; two phantasmagorical cities. The Nightmare Before Christmas also showcases one of Burton's key influences: German expressionism. The dark, foreboding sets, high-contract lighting and stark angles (also seen in Burton's Batman movies) harken back to German films of the silent era, such as Nosferatu, Metropolis and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. If there's a flaw, it's that the story is a bit too simplistic and drawn- out, with occasionally sluggish pacing.The Nightmare Before Christmas follows the tradition of employing music and songs as a means to progress the narrative. As this is a Tim Burton movie, the songs are provided by his frequent collaborator Danny Elfman (who used to be the lead singer for Oingo Boingo, but found a far more successful career as a film & TV composer). The music and visuals of The Nightmare Before Christmas are inseparable. Elfman's first-rate compositions support the visuals in grand style; whether it's a tender moment, a celebratory scene, or a frightening sequence. Fortunately, the songs are both memorable and catchy (don't be surprised if you feel the urge to sing while the music assuages your ears). Elfman also provided the vocalisation of Jack Skellington's singing voice, while Chris Sarandon voiced Jack during the dialogue sequences. Another well- achieved role comes in the form of Catherine O'Hara's honest and eclectically sweet Sally. This handmade character, stitched together by a half-hearted creator, shows the most human of emotion in Halloween Town.Parents wondering if The Nightmare Before Christmas is suitable for their children should know that the frightening aspects of the picture are nicely blunted by humour and Elfman's music. Jack Skellington isn't the frightful creature one would assume him to be...he's just a misunderstood hero. There are so many enchanting sights and sounds to behold within this cinematic tour de force that there's not enough room for anxiety and fright. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a fun holiday romp with something to offer everyone. For the children, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adolescents and adults, it's an opportunity to experience some good, hearty entertainment while marvelling at how adept the animators have become at these techniques.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

I'm not sure what words have not already been used - brilliant, charming, amusing, wonderfully inventive, enjoyable. Creative masterpiece isn't going too far, I don't think. Let me add that I'm a mature adult (very mature!) and like some others I wasn't sure I'd like this based on the concept and cover art. But I was totally captivated by it from the opening number.What seems to me to be the most remarkable aspect is how this appeals to an inner core inside all of us. It operates on a subtle and almost sublime level for me - it captivates my imagination and carries it along. There are many details to enjoy on subsequent viewings, all of which simply add to the surreal enchantment. The music and lyrics are simply remarkable. Don't be surprised to find yourself humming a few bars from them the next day. One other thing I enjoyed is that unlike many popular songs the lyrics are never blanketed by overwrought orchestrations. You can quite literally hear and understand every word of the songs - and such clever lyrics they are. They add so much to the story and the understanding of the characters, more so than almost any other film.It's hard to find enough positive words for this - I gave it 10, the only 10 I've given out.

Very few exist outside. The only ones I can name are Polar Express, Shrek, Iron Giant, and this. Nightmare is brilliant. Each camera angle (yes I am referring to camera angles in a stop-motion movie) is brilliant. They movie the camera unlike most claymation/stop-motion animated movies. Danny Elfman took a 7 star movie and used the music to perfect it. All characters are likable. The plot is brilliant. Tim Burton's poem is awesome. Everything looks cool in a strange and surreal world. The only flaw is how quickly people figure things out. Considering its a kids movie that can be let go. Other than that this movie is flawless. I am fourteen and I still love it. 10/10. My favorite film of the 90s",The Nightmare Before Christmas
284,Natenbox62,Both my favorite Halloween and Christmas movie (convenient!),10,31 October 2014,"I seen this movie like dozens of times already, and I never got old from it. This is the first movie that I have heard of a man named Tim Burton, who done films like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and Batman (1989).Anyways, the songs in this movie are so catchy. The first song 'This Is Halloween' is personally my second favorite song to use on Halloween, the first being Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'. The visual style of the movie might not be look innocent but it didn't cross the extra line of being too scary for your children. Plus, it looks amazing. The characters were memorable, the animation is fantastic, and again, the songs are just so catchy.It may not the best movie I've ever seen, but man it had a big impact on me when I was a kid.Score: 10/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

I remember telling my friends at school my own ""stories"" of some of the characters. To this day, I still love it.Everything about this movie is excellent, great, beautiful, every positive word you can think of. The songs, the animation, the characters, everything! Let's start with some of them.The songs are excellent and they should've been nominated for an Oscar for Best Songs, and it should've won! My favorite song is Sally's Song, which is just too gorgeous for words. I also love This is Halloween, Kidnap the Sandy Claws (that song is hilarious), and Oogie Boogie Man, which reminds me of a Ray Charles song.The characters are great, too. Jack, who is wise and independent; Sally, who is gorgeous, sweet, and kind; the Mayor, who's chatty and talkative; Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who are mischievous but friendly; Dr. Finkelstein, who's usually grumpy all the time; and of course, the Oogie Boogie Man, who's evil.The animation is gorgeous, not like anything else I've seen. The movie was made in the early '90s and it has the most spectacular animation of any animated movie made in the '90s! This has been one of my favorite animated movies for a long time and it still is. In fact, when I get older and have a career in show business, I'll release an album where I sing songs from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". You'll soon see! This is a great movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. Great job, Tim Burton!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

""Don't fill your emptiness with something which can only cause more.""

He arrived back to Halloween Town and showed the residents his findings, but they fail the idea of Christmas and compare with everything to their ideas of Halloween. So Jack's obsession leads him to take the role of Santa and invade Christmas Town with his legion of ghouls separate from the Christmas in Halloween Town is the real world where normal people celebrate these holidays.I will say this movie is pretty awesome, especially the characters and the special stop-motion effects, another fact is the Jack Skellington puppet had about 400 heads for different facial expressions.People wondered if it's a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie, but it said they can both watch it on these holidays.Tim Burton couldn't direct the movie cause he was busy shooting Batman Returns and hands it to Henry Selick .Danny Elfman does the music and provides Jack's singing voice.I loved this movie so much and I can watch it both on Halloween and Christmas. 🎃👻💀🎅🏻🎄🎁",The Nightmare Before Christmas
288,peqdavid5,The film that changed animation for ever,10,13 December 2008,"Childish in the surface, but very mature on the bottom. Stop-motion animation finally became a reality and a success on year 1993 with Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". This movie was destined to reach the top, it had a high-grossing feature manufacture and a critically-acclaimed film nature. Burton's dark and unique view of reality was fundamental and, maybe, the element that made this movie work. Nevertheless, few people give credit to the real element that catalyzed the whole project: Danny Elfman's beautiful soundtrack. Songs were catchy, were deep and were a total hit, not only on movie music's world, but on international level.It was Elfman himself, that gave the unforgettable voice to Jack Skellington. Even though, much of this film's economical success was a consequence of Disney's publicity.

This is really beautiful.The characters (I love the mad scientist), the humour, are good and typical from Burton. The plot is also pretty good, Some of it seems to have inspired the  ""Monsters Inc"" (The uglies are all in one world, with reversed values).Unfortunatly, the Disney's influence spoils the movie. SONGS ! Songs ! Songs ! A lot of songs. Too much of songs ! (boring, despite the fact I love the Elfman's music). And in contrary of ""Beetlejuice"" there is not a single moment with real fear. It's like ""Monsters Inc"", only for the kids. But ""Monsters Inc"", at least, had the good idea to avoid ""songs"" to reach the adult audience.The ""style"" remains the only reason  to watch this movie (for an adult). But this is a movie to watch, if you can keep a childhood spirit. Because I think this is more about ""Christmas"" than ""Halloween"" !6/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

And every time he came to my home asked me to play the movie (Italian version, but very good even compared to the original)and it was like a drug, every time I was continuing to watch again and again the film and was never tired of it.

Then. he find the Xmas celebration, this causes a great impression to him. Thus this is arming a magical film, with dark characters as much as charmers. With gorgeous scenes on stop-motion animation, Burton as a creator, Sellick as the director, bring us a story about love, fantasy, dreams, and good intentions, despite of our characters come from Halloween Town.Burton teaches to us how to create stories on a dismal atmosphere, but with a kind essence, all his filmography show it (Edward Scissorhands, The Corpse Bride, BettleJuice, The Big Fish, etc.).

In my opinion, it wasn't even close to best; it was the worst. It was really scary, horrifying, unfunny, nightmare-inducing, horrible, and every other negative scary adjective you can think of. Even though the movie wasn't really that violent, I was so darn scared of it. I couldn't smile at all when I was watching it. It was just that scary. It should have been rated PG-13 instead of just PG. I'm never watching this movie ever again, no matter how much I want to. Please don't watch this movie. Go watch something else.

294,nimbleweevil,"Visually enchanting, musically entertaining, and way, WAY too memorable...",7,14 February 2005,"Anyone who is remotely acquainted with me has probably heard me whine that some movie I saw - and I see a lot of them - just wasn't memorable enough, that I'd forget it in a few years. I saw ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" for the first time at the age of three. Nearly twelve years later, I began dating a young man who was obsessed with it, and I saw it again. Between these two time periods, I remembered the movie far more clearly than I would have liked. A movie isn't worth seeing if you aren't going to remember it, but this one was so bizarre, it stuck out in my memory a bit TOO much.Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon) is a...thing...that is eight or perhaps ten feet tall and yet appears to weigh about the same as the average school textbook. He's also the ""Pumpkin King"" of a place called Halloweentown, where the distinguishing feature of the residents is that they all look like they recently walked through the mosh pit at Lollapalooza. It is not uncommon to see heads flying around without their bodies or Frankenstein-like creations running around loose or anything out of your childhood nightmares. No wonder Jack is kind of depressed. So when he quite by accident stumbles upon a place called Christmastown, and decides that he would like to bring some Christmas spirit to his homeland, things get a little messy. For one thing, his idea of Christmas cheer is to have Santa Claus kidnapped by another...thing...called Oogie Boogie (Ken Page) and pose as (a rather anorexic) Saint Nick himself. Are you scratching your head yet? You're not alone. There are...things...in Halloweentown which literally scratch their brains.Other main...things (characters)...include Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a Rocky Horror-or-Frankenstein-style creation of a mad scientist who is the object of Jack's romantic affections (and vice-versa); Lock, Shock, and Barrel (Pee-wee Herman, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman) (Jerry Thorpe fans are picketing outside), three evil little sidekicks who do a good deal of eyebrow-raising, and the Evil Scientist (original, huh? I needed that) who created Sally in the first place. And Santa Claus. But that poor man's been tortured enough.The music is catchy and well-written, the animation is stellar, and the cast dovetails perfectly with the roles. Tim Burton has proved time and time again that he's quite an original director. But some stories are just too weird to get out of the campfire circle, and this might be one of them. Most people I know over the age of thirty-five will curl up like boiled shrimp at the mere mention of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" Therefore, while I myself thought it was an entertaining piece of film, I'm not sure it's fit for the public at large. There are some things the world just isn't ready for. Mr. Burton, I commend you. You are way before your time.Grade: B",The Nightmare Before Christmas
295,andriy-tanatar,A solid Xmas film,8,20 September 2005,"Tim Burton showed that you don't have to be Pixar or use ""high-end"" technologies to produce original cartoon. In fact, this one beats most of the recent CG movies visually. Extremely well animated, very imaginative background design and songs. Lyrics are at times hilarious, and at the very least amusing.The film revolves around the concept of ""halloween"" guys trying to make Christmas with predictably failed results. I have to say that the plot itself is somewhat cliché, but, probably, I've just seen too many of such movies. Execution is very nice, though, primarily due to an incredible amount of work that went into details. Another big minus is that it is too short by modern standards, a little over an hour. 8/10, with points deducted for length and plot.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was.

The stop-motion animation in this movie is incredible. I also think Danny Elfman's score, music, and lyrics are outstanding. Henry Selick does a great job at making this movie look great.The story is unique. It deals with Jack Skellington, the Pumpking King of Halloween Town, getting tired of doing the same old things. He discovers Christmas Town, and immediately falls in love with it. He wants everything to do with it, and attempts to bring Christmas to Halloween.
For a movie that is supposedly aimed at children, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is actually quite dark at times. Just listen to one of the songs from the movie called ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"" and you will see what I mean.
To sum it up: ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is one of my favorite ""family movies"", if you want to call it that. It is funny, dark, has great music, amazing visuals, and a unique story. I recommend this movie to everyone.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

This film is so nostalgic for me, and I felt this film deserved a spot on this list. This film is actually not directed by Tim Burton, it's directed by Henry Selick, who also did ""Coraline"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"". Though, Tim Burton did create the entire story and all the characters. This movie has some of the greatest music ever put in a film, especially ""Jack's Lament"", which is my favorite track. Danny Elfman voiced Jack's singing voice, but they had Chris Sarandon do the dialogue. The film is beautifully shot, and contains some very impressive stop-motion.

Most of the songs move a little to slow and I got bored after a while. The story is very simple. But that isn't really that bad, taking it's supposed to be a family film. I say this might be a little to scary for the younger kids. I would save this for 8 and up. But that is the great thing about this. It has enough scares & humor to keep the older viewers happy. While enough of the normal cartoon stuff, to keep the kids happy. And this is the only film to my knowledge that can be watched for Halloween & Christ-mas. But the best thing about this movie is the gothic feel. I love that about Tim Burton movies. Even ""Ed Wood"" felt a little gothic with the black & white.

I did my best and by God I really tasted something swell."" That lyric doesn't fit the pattern of the song. It throws the rhyme scheme out of whack. My theory is that the original lyric was ""Well, what the hell? I did my best and by God I really tasted something swell."" This fits in perfectly with the pattern. My guess is that this was the original lyric but it got taken out because ""they"" didn't want ""profanity"" in the movie. Anyway, the next time you listen to this song think about it.

Also it has to be of the greatest stories I have ever watched and one of the greatest musicals ever. I loved this movie from the moment I watched it when I was four and to this day it never fails to move me. Danny Elfman has a fantastic singing voice that I am shocked that he is not in many musicals. Chris Sarandon has a wonderful talking voice for Jack and the other cast members are amazing in their roles. The movie it self looks great and I think that no one could have captured Christams town the way that this movie did.

The eerie yet fun loving mood he creates is wonderfully immersive, and is amazingly done. The stop motion animation for this movie is done so well, it flows just like CGI for the most part. The story, characters, and setting are all so real you feel like your there.Jack Skellington is a spooky, lovable guy. He travels to Christmas town and tries to bring Christmas to Halloween, without really knowing the meaning of Christmas, thus making a disturbing combination of the two.

Completely stop-motion but with a unique edge and a much well developed storyline.

I wanted to know what the fuss was about. I mean, if loads of people like something, it's got to be good, right? .....Right? Less than 3 minutes into the film, I was sitting there thinking ""So...People think this is the best animated film ever?"" I was struck instantly by the animation. It's dire. So amateurish. I've seen cartoons done by first-year animation students and they are sensational compared to the animation in this film. The animation is 'sticky', usually far too slow (especially with 'shock' reactions), and it's just... argh. It bugged me so much. I'm sure there are going to be people who either think ""What are you talking about?"" (to them I say: Watch it again and bear this in mind) or ""Oh, don't be mean. Stop-motion is very hard and they must be applauded for their efforts"" (to them I say: No it's not. I've got loads of experience with stop-motion. It's simple if you know what you're doing). Sure, the models are fine, no, the models are great, it's just that they didn't do a very good job of giving them 'life'.Now I shall discuss my views of the plot. I must admit, I didn't pay as much attention to the film as many fans would have, but there was something that confused me greatly (among other things, but this one just plain annoys me). Sally is, effectually, the doctor's slave, and is never allowed to be away from the doctor (and is often locked up) so she doesn't get a good taste of the 'outside world', and yet she evidently had managed to develop a good friendship with Jack before the film's setting.Wait, what? Is that just bad script-writing, or am I simply not seeing the apparent obvious? I don't quite understand how someone can be emotionally separated from the rest of the community, yet manage to maintain a friendship with one of its members.Other than that *ahem* possible inconsistency, the idea of the plot is very good. It is very imaginative. I don't have any problems with it. This film, as we all know, is also a musical. Now, normally with musicals I sit there thinking ""Oh God, there's another song coming up"", but with this film, I found the songs tolerable; they became part of the film and, quite simply, the film almost survives on these songs. As for the voice acting, that was also very good, and the actors must be praised for making a decent job of it.In conclusion, good story, maybe, but great cartoon? I don't think so. There's certainly nothing about it to make me feel like going around saying it's the best cartoon/animated film ever.

319,FernandoRainer,Taste of nostalgia with questionable characteristics for the animation theme,8,16 March 2021,"Every detail is beautifully animated, the story is fun all the time, it's a great idea to mix feelings and holidays across worlds in a physical way, but despite being such a perfect film in relation to animation, despite being a classic in these requirements and in others, such as the gum and impeccable soundtrack, I can say that the story itself, which is the most important aspect of a film, does not stand out in comparison to the other aspects.
Yet it is an extraordinary film, to be missed and a nostalgic taste in the roof of the mouth, it is to laugh and produce bright eyes through a childlike aesthetic, totally trash and obscure, characteristics that can be questioned before being made into a film of the animation theme, but it worked very well for this film, so it is really worth watching.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

321,adavis-6,Rare Artistry,9,27 January 2003,"Nightmare Before Christmas was a ground-breaking movie for what it did in the way of animation, and for the bizarre plot line that had never been done before, nor will probably ever be done again.  After all, who would have thought such a thing as a skeleton taking over Christmas?I don't think a lot of people `got it'.  It is difficult for some to just sit back and appreciate something for it's artistic value alone.  So many look to be spoon fed 100% excitement during the entire hour an a half of any film before they like it.In my humble opinion, almost ten years later the film holds up.  I believe that its value is in the creativity of both the screenplay and the musical score.  This is true art.  Tim Burton and Danny Elfman were able to put something very rare together with this movie.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
322,sadclownrep,Elfman at His finest,10,17 February 2004,"I have been a huge fan of this movie since it was first released.  For the first bunch of years, I primarily enjoyed it for the animation and story. However, in the last couple of years, I find myself coming back to it for Danny Elfman's music and lyrics.If you've never noticed how certain exceptional composer weave character themes throughout a movie, you could do worse than to start your study of music in cinema with this film.  Witness how variations on Sally's theme accompany her throughout the film - or how strains of Jack's early lament repeat in several of his songs and appearances.Katherine O'Hara, who did such a nice job singing in the 2003's ""A Mighty Wind,"" is really an outstanding vocalist.  Here, she sings for both Sally and Shock and is quite excellent as both.  Elfman sings most of Jack Skellington's songs, as any fan of his early band Oingo Boingo will notice. 
Anyhow, the movie is a delight, the soundtrack even more.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King in the land of Halloween and wanders out into the woods because he is bored of celebrating Halloween every day. He finds doors in the woods that lead to holidays like Easter Christmas. Jack is most interested in Christmas and is wonder-struck with this wondrous snow-filled place with presents and lights; this leads him to steal Santa Claus and his plot to bring Christmas with Halloween ultimately fails. This is a movie that needs to be remembered for its unique concept and beautiful stop-motion animation. I watch this film every year during Halloween and Christmas and never get tired. The songs are so creative and just wanna make you jump along and sing with them. You feel like you are in the movie too - both in Halloween Town and Christmas Town. The details in this film are very present and the attraction between Jack and Sally, a rag doll, just adds depth and character to the overall feel of the movie. I will never get tired of this movie! I love it so much!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

I like this movie because Jack thinks he can celebrate Christmas in Halloweentown and itd be the same exact thing, even going as far as kidnapping ""Sandy Claws"". I like it because in the end, Santa says ""Happy Halloween"" and Jack says ""Merry Christmas"" so they both acknowledge the other's existence. My other favorite character is Sally. She wants so much to be with the rest of the townspeople she'll poison Dr. Frankenstein as much as possible so she has a chance to escape. Zero is also cute, a ghost dog with a red nose- kind of like a dead version of rudolph.

Usually it is all formula, but when Tim Burton has something to do with the movie, then you know that it will be different. People complained that it was too scary for little children. Hence the word NIGHTMARE and the PG-13 rating. It is there for a reason. But this was a very fun movie, had a great soundtrack that I bought. Danny Elfman should have been nominated for music and songs. His music and singing were terrific.

331,grdontom,Just plain fun!,7,27 July 2009,"The thing I found hardest to take about The Nightmare before Christmas was classification. When watching a film I like to know as early as possible what I am likely to be in for, so I can prepare my mood so I am most likely to enjoy what is in store. This is a film where I struggled. From the opening I was stuck in a peculiar state of purgatory with words and concepts swimming around my head. Is this a musical? Is it a cartoon? Is it horror? Is it something that can just be put under that special label of ""Tim Burton thought of it"". I felt once again like I was being sucked into the old debate of whether a Jaffa Cake is indeed a cake or a biscuit. The one thing I am certain of is that it was visually stunning, and the script and voice acting left little to be desired.The method used to capture the puppets movement and emotions is surprisingly expressive and emotive, while the majority of the songs are infectious and will force you to crack the sort of smile you normally reserve for those precious moments when someone you know well truly surprises you. As is to be expected some of the songs are a little less stand out and detract from the atmosphere slightly, but nothing film breaking. The real stand out character for me was the delightful cameo of the bogeyman, whose appalling yet endearing persona was a treat.Now let's talk about what this film isn't. This isn't a film that you should take too seriously. It is very light on plot and those expecting anything more than the most basic fairytale story will leave bitterly disappointed. It also isn't very long, but this really does work in its favour, leading me nicely onto my closing thoughts.Touching back on my point of classification, this film cannot be classified as it is in defiance of all common genres, but this didn't trouble be at all like I had imagined it would. The short length of the film lends it to have a relentlessly fast pace meaning it has an uncanny knack of holding your attention and keeping you fully immersed. The way it has been shot is so interesting that it matters little that the plot cupboard is bare. The Nightmare before Christmas is a short trip into fantasy land, where the strangest things happen and you are in kept awe almost constantly. Although not without its flaws this is definitely a welcome diversion from most other films developed on this side of the world, reminding us all not to take ourselves too seriously.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
332,dvallet-20927,"since I am dead, I can take off my head",10,9 July 2015,"This movie holds a special place in my heart as the best animated movie I've ever seen. Originally director Tim Burton was set to direct this movie, but due to his work with Batman Returns, stop motion director Henry Selick took over as director while Burton remained producer. I'll be honest, this movie gets more pumped for Halloween than Christmas, it has great atmosphere for both seasons but it may have something to do with the sets for Halloween town and Danny Elfman's Oscar worthy score that have that dark and Gothic feel to it. What I like about this movie is how the plot pays some homage to classic Christmas tales, I mean Jack Skellington being Santa was definitely inspired by the Grinch. The story is about the king of Halloween, Jack Skellington who has grown weary of doing the same thing every year until he comes across a strange place in the woods with trees that represent every other holiday and thus he discovers Christmas. Intrigued, he wants to bring this holiday to his town, however he doesn't quite understand the meaning of Christmas and his ambition and ignorance causes it to backfire. Jack might be the scariest hero ever,why? He's a skeleton, sure he's a nice guy but if he can make you scream like a banshee and jump out of your skin, I'd run. As I said he's ambitious a little ignorant and nice guy, but he's also intimidating for a hero, but hey Halloween, right? Jack's voice is provided by composer Danny Elfman (singing) and Chris ""Humperdinck"" Sarandon (speaking). Elfman gets a little more credit because I'm pretty sure he has more singing lines as opposed to speaking, both actors are perfect for the part in my opinion. Originally they asked Sarandon if he'd sing but he didn't believe he could and thus Elfman got the singing role. Jack also has the love interest, Sally voiced by Catherine O'Hara. Sally is the smartest character in the movie, from drugging her master, making a potion, jumping out a window and stitching herself up, and seeing a vision of Jack's Christmas. She feels empty because she really has nothing but being trapped and part of the emptiness relates her to Jack because he's depressed and weary. Jack decides to take Christmas and has Oogie Boogie's henchmen kidnap Santa and unknown to Jack they take him to Boogie. Eventually Jack goes out into the night to deliver Halloween made toys to kids for Christmas and it goes wrong and the military takes action and shoots him down and he accepts that he is the pumpkin king and goes to rescue Santa and Sally from Boogie and give Christmas back to Santa as he goes to fix Jack's mistakes. Jack returns to Halloween Town as Santa fly's by and wishes them a happy Halloween, Jack realizes how much Sally cared to fix everything and thus they fall in love at the end. I still think the movie holds up really well, the stop motion is phenomenal, the voice acting is great, the songs are amazing, the score is Oscar worthy, the characters are good and a lot are famous Halloween monsters. The romance felt a little shallow I admit, at first I felt Sally fell for Jack because he's just awesome, but it does establish a little connection. I still see this as a Halloween movie and it's atmosphere and score get pumped to dress up and scare people. I also see this as the best stop motion animated feature ever made, I love this movie and whether it gets you excited for Halloween or Christmas I think you'll find enjoyment in this move. I'm gonna grade this movie an A+!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The soundtrack was much more effective and contributed to the effect. Even the Disney logo in 3-D was impressive. Our showing was accompanied by a preview of a 3-D film, action adventure, coming out next year. It was also very impressive, as it was created with 3-D in mind. I think this represents another paradigm shift in mass entertainment. As the 8 track gave way to the cassette, the cassette to the CD, I believe that this marks the beginnings of the transition of conventional 2-D to digital 3-D.

Directed by Harry Selick, it tells the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington.  Bored and disillusioned with an endless round of frights and tricks, he takes a late-night stroll through the world of holidays, and arrives in the morning in Christmas Town.  Amazed by the new splendour of this land, contrasting so sharply with his own, he hatches a plan to hijack Christmas and make his own version...Unsurprisingly, it was written by Tim Burton, the master of twisted comedy. The visuals are fantastic, and the dark humour which pervades the whole piece never misses a beat.  Danny Elfman provided a suitably dark, gothic score to complement the ghoulishly surreal imagery, so it succeeds as a musical, too, with enchanting tunes and bitingly clever lyrics.In short, a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. 10/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas

It shouldn't be confused with normal animation at all, it is a far better production and filming technique. Most viewers will become totally entranced into believing that you are actually there participating along with the characters. The characters are astounding from conception to their manifestation. Their colors and shapes, from their original being to the multiple morphs that they might become, are without equal! I don't plan on reviewing the storyline, but these characters have stayed with me, permanently etched in my mind, ever since first seeing the film. I try to watch this movie every year at Halloween with friends, and am always as entertained as the first time! It is that great of a movie to be watched annually, like ""Its A Wonderful Life"", and someday could be considered as one of the best productions ever of it's genre. It is also a fabulous distractional movie for your kids; they will watch it over and over for weeks on end, enamored with each of the hundreds of characters, colors and songs.

Easter had The Easter Bunny is Comin' to Town and Here Comes Peter Cottontail (which ironically, contains a scene set in Halloween).

This new release was an impressive display of digital projection and 3-D rendering technology. Mad props to the folks at Pixar. I can totally see all movies being digital 3-D within 10 years. Home theater systems are getting so large nowadays there's little technology incentive to go to the cinema otherwise.

After years of the same spooky Town's holiday, Jack craves adventure and becomes depressed because of his tiresome attitude. After one particular Halloween, Jack stumble into a new part of the forest where he observes a circle of trees, each with a holiday printed upon its door. Fascinated by the door with the decorated tree, which glows in front of him, Jack enters Christmas Town in search of his wish. He is so bewildered and confused by his experience that he stretches to science to understand the concept of joy and laughter and Christmas. The only one who sees through Jack's crazy ideas is the unique Sally who loves Jack but fails to help him see sense. Jack resorts to the twisted idea of taking Christmas and making it his own. The ending is beautifully inevitably but involves Jack fixing what he destroyed and rescuing Santa Claus, who was rudely kidnapped by the Oogie Boogie Man.The Nightmare before Christmas is my all-time favourite movie. The animation is filled with unforgettable songs and music by Danny Elfman. The story is simple yet stunning and no one can help falling in love with each and every character in Halloween Town. The opening is a narration that prepares the audience to an extent that there is little that could draw them away from the screen. What struck me as awesome about the music is how every song or instrumental section is vaguely variated on another which quite subtly warms you the songs before you even hear them. The most genius tune is the simple construction of Sally's song, which has various variations throughout the movie. The only real complaint is that it is a very short film...but over-all that seems to be a positive quality as it has not failed to impress from my experience.

Yeah, it had a controversial look to some Catholic church as it was being Satanist to the Lord, but they don't seek anything pass that, and it's not trying to say a nasty creed about anything. After all, the lesson is that you can't change something; otherwise it best to be alone. This displays a good message to children because it has that emotion to move people. This is something that the family may enjoy one night while getting the popcorn ready. The setting is so cool that Tim Burton makes the background as festive as possible. Disney movies aren't as bad as it seems. I would grade this movie a A- because it definitely shows a creativity that displays a message, and a symbolical meaning to the society. This is an art-house film because it's definitely a movie that could stand on it's own with a deep meaning.

The music was fabulous and clever and I even bought it.Now, the christmas after that i bought the video but never fully understood it. Seven years later i decided to watch it again, as Tim Burton is now my favourite director. His films all have a twisted sense of humour with a rather horrific undertone. I am now 14 and appreciate the film for all it's worth. The animation is stunning and in it's time must have been top of the line. The Music which rightfully won an Oscar is still as powerful and twisted as ever. And the humour is razor sharp with a very satirical edge. ITV have decided to show this film at 11.20pm and although I think this is too late i don't think it should be shown before 8.00pm. The film is rather disturbing for young children. My Cousin still won't watch it, and I think it might destroy many child's view of Christmas, but I still think that every family should Own a copy. I Can't wait to see what Henry Sellick can do with Monkeybone and this film reinforces my view that Tim Burton should have been the one to remake ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!""!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
353,e_mclachlan,so beautiful it will make your heart bleed,10,5 November 1999,"The Burton/Elfman team did it again. This film is a must-see for Halloween, Christmas, and any other time of the year. Not a single point of weakness, this is as good as it gets and tops any expectation. Poetic, humorous, visually stunning, multilayered, a musical masterpiece and so beautiful it will make your heart bleed, this film is rather dark amd tragic however and not entirely suitable for the youngest among us. I don't think it ever was intended to be. A stunning poetic interpretation and a personal favourite.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

356,sillias,I've never seen claymation used like this.,10,20 July 2000,"This piece was one of the best applications of stop-motion that I have ever seen.  The beauty was in the simplicity of the shots, along with the vivid imagery.  I've never seen a children's story so perverted, simply by the choice of setting.  Oh, what a beautiful piece.  I adored this movie like nothing I have before.  Cartoons just don't hold the same magic that they used to; this movie changed my perceptions of what it meant to be ""animated"".  If you couldn't notice, I loved it.  Watch it.  A lot.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

This movie is fantastic and the soundtrack is superb. The fact that you can watch this movie both during Halloween and Christmas is so cool. All the characters and environments Tim Burton made are spectacular. The story may be a little weak, but the actual scenes where they are singing make up for it. It's amazing how good this movie is.10/10",The Nightmare Before Christmas
358,skeletonakajoe,Highly Interesting,10,27 March 2007,"Title says it all - this is one of those movies that makes you say, ""huh."" But, you like it. The worst thing I ever heard someone say is that it's okay. Understandable - the movie is animated, and a musical. If you don't like either, you won't like this film. But if you can appreciate good music and cool animation/effects, then you will find this movie likable. It's not overly predictable, but not, ""Oh my god! I had no IDEA he was going to do that!"" I don't want to give away a lot of the plot and highs of the movie, but I will say this - I recommend this to people above the age of 5 (they (people the age of 5 or below) might consider it to be scary). It's fun, has comedic moments (put it this way - when it's meant to be funny, it succeeds), although not intended really as a comedy, but more of an interesting watch that makes you wonder, ""What would I do if I were Jack Skellington?""",The Nightmare Before Christmas

360,Kimbeez,"""Nightmare"" is a dream",8,8 October 2003,"What a delightful film! ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. There aren't many movies out there that appeal to both children and adults, and this is a shining example. Nothing is sugar-coated or saccharine, but there's a nice blend of innocence and dark humor that everyone can enjoy. I saw ""Nightmare"" when it arrived in theaters when I was 12-years-old. Nearly 10 years later I'm still enjoying it on television and video. This film has everything: wonderful characters that support and enrich each other, an excellent soundtrack, and a humorous and moving story. I would expect nothing less from the likes of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, who did an astounding job on this film. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially fans of Tim Burton's other films or people who just enjoy a good and well-told story.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
361,sodapopbabe281,This movie was excellent,10,29 June 2005,This movie is awesome! People may think that the graphics aren't that great but that's the exact way the creator of this movie wanted it to be. I absolutely love the theme of this movie because it has two of my favorite holidays in it Christmas and Halloween. It's absolutely amazing at all the things these monsters think of especially Jack Skellington he has some great ideas and he always gets into trouble he should listen to Sally more often. Sally is my favorite character because she is smarter than any of the monsters in Halloweentown and she makes better choices I would run away from that hideous professor too. This is a great movie if you haven't seen it you really should. The Nightmare before Christmas rocks!!,The Nightmare Before Christmas
362,taxidriver45,You Will Love the Nightmare,10,26 July 2005,"Jack Skellington, aka the Pumpkin King, is a skeleton who is in charge of planning out Halloween. He lives in a place called Halloween Town which is inhabited by ghouls and monsters who eagerly count each day until the next Halloween. Jack longs for something different and discovers Christmas which is ironically the polar opposite of Halloween. Jack and the rest of Halloween Town decide to give Christmas a try. Underneath the main plot of taking over Christmas, there is a love story between Jack and Sally. Sally is a creation of the Evil Scientist. She also longs for something different just as Jack does, but feels his plan will not work.The visual aspect of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is probably what it is most remembered for. This is the first movie to consist entirely of stop motion animation. Stop motion animation is one of the hardest things to do, and it takes a very long time. You would have figures or something else and you would take a picture of them. Then you would move them slightly and take another picture. You would repeat this over and over. I believe each second of the film is about 24 pictures. Different images, such as Jack and Sally on the hill, will stay with you for the rest of your life. The music by Danny Elfman is another factor which makes this movie great. Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is an excellent movie for all ages.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
363,jadenb-22327,Best Movie Ever,10,29 April 2018,"Ever since I was very little, this has been my favorite movie of all time. I absolutely love Halloween, it's everyday for me, and this movie is, as many would probably argue, the most classic Halloween movie of all time. Not only that, but it can also be watched at Christmas time, though I see it as more of a Halloween movie because even though there are Christmas scenes and the movie takes in November and December leading up to Christmas Eve, with only the first portion of the movie being on Halloween night, even the Christmas scenes in the movie have more of a Halloween vibe to them than Christmas. The movie follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who after years of the same routine of scaring people, gets tired of this and finds out about Christmas. In his efforts to celebrate Christmas in Halloween Town, instead of celebrating it in a joyful way, they turn it into a fright filled holiday. The stop motion animation is outstanding in this movie, as well as the displays. Each Holiday Town shown in the movie, Halloween Town and Christmas Town, capture the feelings of each holiday so well. Christmas Town is very bright, happy, and joyful with many stripes and bright colors. Halloween Town has a very dark, depressing, and eerie vibe, with oddly shaped gothic buildings, tombstones, and lots of blacks, greys, and oranges. The music in this movie is also amazing. There is only one true Christmas song in the movie which is ""What's This"" song by Jack Skellington when he discovers Christmas, but it stills helps establish the feel of Christmas time very well. There's many bells, harps, and other light hearted music in this song. All of the other songs in the movie are Halloween songs, and they are amazing. They each have very dark and creepy sounding instruments used, such as violins, cellos, saxophones, and other instruments of that matter. This movie is an absolute must see for any Halloween fans or anyone looking for a great movie to watch around Halloween.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
364,FamousCookie,One of my absolute favorites!,10,30 November 2006,"Nightmare Before Christmas has recently been popping up more often. Unfortunately I find it showing up in stores like Hot Topic and Spencers which gives people the idea that it's only appeal is toward the types of people who shop there. But actually I see no reference from the movie that would make it show up on clothing and basically everything in those stores as opposed to any other. I personally do not like either of those stores and yet this movie has been a favorite of mine since I can remember. It came out in 1993, the year I was born and I would watch it nearly every day. I specifically remember my sister yelling at me because she had seen it so many times and didn't want to watch it again. She would always complain ""This again?"" And I would just nod my head enthusiastically and continue to hop around dancing and singing.The Nightmare Before Christmas combined two of kids favorite holidays to make a brilliant story. Although the holidays could not be more different that is what makes it so wonderful. Not to mention the romance story to it and the lovely end scene where Jack and Sally finally get together. That was always one of my favorite scenes. You will see characters that you are familiar with and new characters along with an allusion to Dr. Frankenstein which I found scary as a child but I now find absolutely hilarious.It truly is a great movie and has brilliant songs that are practically classics. I can't say that I love all of Tim Burton's odd creations but this one most definitely struck my fancy.10/10 for this one!!PS - Please note that I have nothing against the stores Hot Topic or Spencers or anyone who shops there. Two of my best friends shop there on a daily basis so please don't take anything in this review offensively :)",The Nightmare Before Christmas
365,djfpiano,Tim Burton's Best,10,22 October 2006,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time for many reasons. The movie is full of a special dark whimsy and the music is great. The animation is amazing and it is easy to forget that the characters, which have a wonderfully strange and unique design, are stop-motion animation (which really is a dying art form). The movie, which has often been linked with the Goth subculture, is by no means scary and (the non-3D version, although I have never seen the 3D one) will frighten only the most cowardly children or those that are going through a ""fear phase"". The movie focuses on Jack Skellington, the mind behind Halloween, who, after the annual celebration, becomes bored of the holiday and wants something new. After wandering in the forest, Jack stumbles upon Christmas and becomes infatuated with the holiday. He brings the holiday back to the Halloween-citizens, who do not fully understand the holiday, and Jack decides to take Santa Claus's place and chaos ensues. It is up to Sally the rag-doll, who loves him, to save Jack from making a big mistake. This movie has an entertaining plot and although it is only an hour long, the movie contains elements of a musical, a comedy, and a love story and is Tim Burton's best, only comparable to Edward Scissorhands.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
366,minxymermaid666,Awesome,10,5 March 2006,"The nightmare before Christmas - aimed at young kids yet teens and some adults still find this movie highly enjoyable and that's a quality that you find in very little films these days. Even though the nightmare before Christmas was released thirteen years ago, it still has a cult following. With nightmare before Christmas merhcendise going at rather high prices, the movie must have been a big hit ! Tim Burton is a superb director as he directed great movies such as : charlie and the chocolate factory (2005) Edward scissorhands and Corpse bride.The adventure of Jack Skellington trying to bring Christmas to halloween town is simply classic plus, the ending wraps together nicely for younger children. I think that the nightmare before Christmas if a feel good film with a deceiving title. =)",The Nightmare Before Christmas
367,Mallgur,The best musical ever!,10,10 March 1999,"This really is the best musical ever! The score is absolutely marvellous. The voices are perfect for every character, even the ones that are not supposed to be beautiful. As for the film itself, the story is a brilliant display of imagination, the director's job is perfectly executed. Every character seems to live beyond the screen, if it weren´t for the terrible weight of reality you could believe they were real. The lyrics and dialogs/songs are matchless for musicals. I must say now that I hate the normal musicals. Always the same moochy love-story, the same lame dialogs and the unreality of the way songs just pop up in the middle of a real dialog. In The Nightmare Before Christmas everything is perfect. And I mean everything! Just see it!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Because this is the only film I've seen that seemed to do everything right. Even films like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Fight Club' or 'American Beauty' had their (small) flaws. What can I say? I've never liked musicals, and I doubt I ever will (although 'South Park' was very funny), but this movie seems to owe most of it's greatness to it's songs.Well, that and the story, the characters, the stop-motion animation, etc. Like I said earlier; Everything about this movie is brilliant! See it if you haven't already!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
370,capndawg,"Unless you hate animation, you'll love this film.",10,26 December 2000,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is charming, disturbing, enlightening and distributed by Disney.  Since the 1960s, rarely, if ever, would I have associated any of the first three descriptors with the company in question. It is a tribute to Tim Burton and Henry Selick that they could even attempt this feat, much less accomplish it.The story itself explores the notion of humanity's greediness in that the main character, Jack Skellington, the scariest (and therefore, worshiped) creature in Halloween Town, falls upon Christmas Town after finding himself unsatisfied by being the scariest once again: it's lonely at the top. After finding out that another holiday as different and exciting as Christmas exists, he attempts to make it his own by talking the inhabitants of Halloween Town into taking over Christmas for the year.  Jack wants what can never be his.The stop motion animation is awe-inspiring even to this day, seven years later.  It is clear that the movie was time consuming and a labor of love. In addition to the fact that it was visually stunning, the animation proved itself necessary as the plot unfolded for many different reasons.Danny Elfman performs at his usual virtuosic level as a composer and adds to it as the singing voice of Jack Skellington.  The music is ""catchy,"" complex and moving.  One can live vicariously in the Burton world upon listening to the soundtrack alone.The first time I saw the film, my initial thought (as an aspiring young music theatre actor) was that this would be a great Broadway show; however, I realized that the interpretation from stop motion animation to live action would have to lose something.Tim Burton fans have likely already seen this movie, however, many of us may have been put off by the fact that Michael Eisner footed the bill.  If you're a Tim Burton fan and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the service of seeing it.  There are some familiar items in this movie  (i.e. the black and white color scheme from Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow, and the black and white striped worm from Beetlejuice) that  you'll enjoy seeing. You'll also just plain enjoy the movie.If you're a human being and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the favor: see this movie.

374,Nightmare1,100% A+ all the way,10,10 June 2002,"This is the best movie I have ever seen and many of my friends think so too.  Just about anybody would love to see this film of a place where every day is Halloween, and every night, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, dreams of something more than all the tricks and treats.  After a long night of scaring the daylights out of everyone, Jack is bored, depressed, and longs for something more.One night, while wandering around in the forest, he discovers a Christmas tree door that leads to Christmas Town.  Now, it's only too obvious that Jack loves this idea where you make people laugh instead of scream, but he and his ghoulish friends don't quite get the concept.  (Those of you have seen this movie know what I mean.)Besides the animation and story, the music is just awesome.  Without Danny Elfman's songs and music, this movie would just dissolve into nothing. Danny has a way of picking just the right notes and instruments for each beautiful scene, and his voice is just GORGEOUS.  (Good ol' Danny sings for Jack, Barrel, and a few other characters.)  Man, that guy is TALENTED!!!!!!!!!My final reason for just eating this movie up is Tim Burton's cast of characters.  I'm not going through the whole cast, but I will use Jack as an example.  You can just look at him and know that he's just bored and curious and wants to obey his inner desire for something new and exciting.  He never meant to scare those children half to death, but wanted to give them a good time.  And I've had the biggest crush on him (and Lock) since I saw this movie for the first time.Overall, this movie desrves a 100% on everything, from animation to the story.  If you have not seen this, you are a poor, deprived soul.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
375,Mike0x,"A fantastic, original and musically superb masterpiece",10,25 December 2004,"This is possibly the best animation film I have ever seen, including new candidates such as ""The Incredibles"". It uses an extremely tedious stop-animation technique and does not appear to rush any of the animation sequences at all. The story is about Jack the pumpkin king who lives with in Halloween town with various other nefarious characters. Jack grew bored with his mundane life of scaring people and ventures into the woods where he finds a portal leading to Christmas town where his adventure begins.It is not just the compelling storyline or impressive animation which makes this a fantastic film, but it is the musical aspects of the film. There are many fantastic songs in the film such as ""Jacks Lament"" however the most original and brilliant song has to me ""What's this?"" For me it captures the curiosity of a child and really brings Jack to life.It is a fantastically original and beautiful film and I hope many others see it as I have done and appreciate its genius and enjoy its music.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The music was well done when he directed it, also the voices were well chosen, Jack had a good voices. This is the unique Christmas movie that Disney has aired and that I like. The plot was a bit used, but Tim knew how to fix it and make it look cool and good. I remember the first time I saw this movie I just loved it. In the scale of the 10 stars, I would give this movie 10/10, besides I can't describe how awesome this movie is. This one, and moulin rouge are my only favorite musicals.

381,radiofreechristy,An all time favorite,9,11 September 2005,"I can't accurately explain how I feel about this film. Easily one of Burton's finest, Nightmare tells the tale of Jack Skellington, the unspoken ruler of Halloween Town. Jack, the Pumpkin King, has tired of the yearly celebration for which the town owns its name, and longs for something more. On a long, lonely night, he literally stumbles upon Christmas Town, filled with lights and pleasant sounds and completely absent of death. On his return to Halloween Town, Jack, enchanted by this new place, attempts to explain its splendor to the rest of Halloween Town. It is lost on almost all of them, except for the lovelorn Sally, who longs to be closer to Jack. Eventually, the town's inhabitants come around and, in response to Jack's request, make Christmas theirs for the year. Danny Elfman and Tim Burton never disappoint, and the marriage of Elfman's music and voice with Burton's production is nothing short of magical. The characters--the confused leader Jack, the hopeful and lost Sally, the villainous Oogie Boogie, and (perhaps most delightful of all) Boogie's cronies Lock, Shock, and Barrel, to name a few--are beautifully fleshed out and entertaining beyond description. This film takes you in and does not lose you its full running time. It is one to go back to again and again; there's always something new to pick up on, a twist you hadn't quite caught. A children's film, and yet considerably darker and more mature, The Nightmare Before Christmas can catch anyone's eye, no matter how old or young they are. I'd recommend this to, well, the world at large.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
382,Scuzzos,"Fresh, fun, exciting, all those positive adjectives that a movie should be",10,21 June 2008,"This is a very special film on several levels. On a personal level, this is the first movie I ever truly fell in complete love with as a child. On a technical level, ""Nightmare"" is really an achievement because making a 76 minute film with claymation in 1993 probably was a nightmare comparable to what the production crew of ""Jaws"" faced. On a musical level, this is the best movie-musical of all time, in my opinion. Danny Elfman's score is one of the best ever written. Also, this is a milestone film in terms of story and characters. If ""Nightmare"" were filmed in live-time without the music, it wouldn't have the magic that put it #3 on my list, but it would still be a well developed, quirky story. As I say in every review, the most important part of film a film is its character development and its finale. Henry Selick and Tim Burton take characters that seem very unlikeable and make them personable. I actually think that the humble love story between Jack and Sally is the most romantic love story in film history. It's innocent. The entire film is innocent. A child could sit down and appreciate this film as I did, or an adult could do the same. It's colorful in a literal sense and a figurative sense. Also, ""Nightmare"" has the greatest opening sequence of all time, in my opinion. ""This is Halloween"" is undeniably creepy, and all of our Halloween archetypes spring to life before our eyes, promising an exciting hour and 15 minutes. Boogie is one of the most delicious villains of all time. He's just so rotten, you have to love him. His song with Santa Claus is priceless--there's something about the boogeyman singing a jazz number to Santa Claus that fills me with glee. Despite the darkness of the Halloween theme, Burton and Selick bring unimaginable beauty to the screen. Christmas town is straight from a child's (or Tim Burton's) dreams. The ending is also beautiful, but we won't talk about that in a review. The whole point of going to the films is to be taken somewhere that you can't really go. If there ever were a film that does that, this is it.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

This stands as one my favorite movies of all time. Tim Burton's artistic eye is absolutely amazing and he allowed the world to view one of the first stop motion animation masterpieces. Not to mention that Danny Elfman(as always)did an incredible job with the score. The characters are very dynamic for animated characters. You fall in love with the naive Jack and the rebellious Sally.I was scared to death of the oogie boogie man when I was a kid but never the less I would watch it and rewind it and watch it again until I fell asleep or had to go down for dinner.A film most definitely worth owning.Tim Burton is truly a master of stop motion animation on the big screen. One thing that confuses me though is I could never quite decide whether to put it in the Christmas category or the Halloween category. This is truly a film that everyone in the family can enjoy. I give it a 10 out of 10 because it has all the makings of an artistic animation genius.,The Nightmare Before Christmas

I remember being 7 years old and this movie came out. It was not your typical animation ""kiddie"" type story. I was lured in by this being something different. This gave kids at the time a window into the macabre and adults something to marvel at as well. The stopmotion was beautifully constructed and that alone, anyone can appreciate.I've seen many articles and debates about the plot. What is the message of the story? Is Jack a hero or villain? Are we teaching kids not to pursue something new?So, these questions may be more closely connected than we think.
Jack is actually a very deep character. He is, for lack of a better word, human - in the sense that he does yearn for something better than what he has - when he has it at his fingertips he does what a lot of people do. He gets tunnel vision on this one goal and very selfishly pursues that goal. He does not take the time to consider who this affects along the way.I think people portray this behavior quite often. Someone wants a better job, house, etc...
If you want something badly enough and it's in your grasp, people may step on some toes to get there - not thinking long enough about who it affects until it's too late.This is what makes Jack the deep and totally relatable character that he is. He's too layered to call him a ""hero"" or ""villain"". My best analysis is that he's good guy at heart, but has some very poor judgment about how to pursue his vision.Anyone that's ever exercised some poor judgment can relate to the story of Jack Skellington. And will also have tons of fun along the way - the music, voice acting, art direction, etc... all will be taken in to enjoy.I now watch my son marvel at the movie with the same intrigue I had. It's really special.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

When he opens the one with a Christmas tree on it, he is thrown into Christmas Town and for the first time sees love.Jack is bewildered by this love and decides to try to get all of Halloween Town to enjoy it with him.  What happens of course is a series of follies and mishaps, and a great ending to cap off one of my favorite movies of all times.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
388,trigger-26,Beautifully done.,8,27 September 2000,"As a long time fan of the burton-elfman combination, I watched this movie with a certain childish glee.

389,leighwill,"Darkly comic animation from Tim Burton, a great film.",8,5 January 2001,"The plot is simple as Jack Skellington is feeling uninspired in his role organising the scares for Halloween. Then he discovers Christmastown and is enchanted by the magic so he decides to kidnap Santa and hijack Christmas. The beauty of the film is the seamless blending of the excellent stop-motion animation and the great Danny Elfman score. Also the neat little touches make the film watchable again and again. Although, as you would expect from Tim Burton, this film is quite dark it's great comic touches, like the accidental kidnapping of the easter bunny, give it a good sense of humour.I find it hard to see how anyone could dislike this film. Although some people I know have not given it a chance saying they dislike musicals, I don't really like musicals but I loved this film. So unless you detest anything with even a hint of musical I seriously recommend giving this a try.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
390,Shock-13,"Enthralling film, but more Lock, Shock and Barrel needed!",10,3 January 2001,"The Nightmare Before Christmas has captivated me with its crazy and sinister animation, its haunting soundtrack and its horrific yet enchanting characters. When it was first released in the U.K., the trailers terrified me and I refused to go and see it. However, I have now aquired deeply sadistic humour and so relish in such brilliant and infectious songs like ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"". My friends and family now get exceedingly annoyed by my attempts to recite the musical score on car journeys etc. The sets and props are amazing and painstakingly detailed-just take a look at Santa's list and the Halloween/Christmas plans. I only have one complaint; there should have been more appearances from Lock, Shock and Barrel: a thoroughly malevolent trio.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
391,argraham,The Corpse Before Bride,10,26 September 2006,"Tim Burton's first full-length animation filled to the brim with so much emotion. Tim, Danny,and Henry have created the best film ever (along side Corpse Bride of course).The music is fantastic, and it is disgusting that Danny Elfman did not win any Oscar. The animation is ahead of its time and is so well crafted. the voice acting is brilliant and is probably one of the greatest voice ensembles for an animation ever. the set design is almost the same creepy yet fantastic one that you would've seen in Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish and also really envelops you in a whole new world.I love this film mainly because of its emotion and well-developed characters, and i wish the 'Best Animation' category existed back then, as it would have won for sure.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

But that is in the past , and now i can truthfully say that this is my most favourite animated films ever, i think it beats ANY Walt Disney films. This film is just pure brilliance, the music score is superb and just fits so well with the story and animations, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman , are just the perfect duo.

A M.U.S.T for Tim Burton fans AND Holiday films fans! Danny Elfman and Tim at their BEST! The picture, the characters, and above all THE MUSIC is something you cant find in any other film! You may also like Corpse Bride if you like this, always thought of these 2 films are very similar, but the Nightmare Before Christmas is the festive big brother of Corpse Bride! Maybe not appropriate for very young children, because it has a lot of Halloween themes too, but thats really up to the parents to judge! I'd love to see this with my children someday tho!

the greatest, and most heart-warming animated musical motion picture of

(And of course to see a walking and talking skeleton, you might have some idea what it does to a 7-year old boy's mind, it's just amazing!!!) And now in the gates of adulthood I've concentrated more on songwriting and music. Danny Elfman is GOD!

And Burton's style--as always--is remarkable: sometimes cute, sometimes twisted, always nothing short of amazing. The abundance of campy humor and an innocent journey of personal discovery for the protagonist, Jack Skellington, make the film entertaining for younger viewers, while sometimes-unnerving visuals and dark motifs appeal to an older audience as well; truly a masterful blending of themes. I first saw the film in theaters, when I was eight years old, and I must say, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' still remains my second favorite musical of all time, just behind the classic 'West Side Story.'",The Nightmare Before Christmas
404,cnaphan,An inspired classic,9,27 March 2003,"One really has to marvel at the inspiration that went into the art design in this fantastic movie. Everything in halloween town is deliciously crafted and it gets better with every viewing. From Jack's tower, to the Pumpkin Patch to that ""holiday hub"" area, and of course, Christmas Town.The humour comes from many sources, both from dialogue and many visual gags. Most results from the clash between cheery Christmas Town and creepy gothic Hallowe'en Town. They aren't evil, they just like creepy, frightening things! Repeated viewings allows you to pick up hundreds of other things, since each scene is packed with details. (I love when the Mayor uses Jack's doorbell: a wailing scream is heard instead of a bell) It always cracks me up seeing how the other Halloween residents just don't ""get"" the idea of Christmas and end up botching everything!I've heard people complain about the plot being simple and trite, but I think it's so packed with originality and musical numbers that it would be difficult to stuff anymore complexity into it. The ending is simply magnificent with the defeated Jack in the graveyard. I always thought the moral was great too, delivered in perfection by a musical number: ""Well, what the heck, and if I tried my best, and by God, I really tasted something great! And for a moment, why, I even kissed the sky and well, at least I left them some stories they could tell, I did!""Truly, a one-of-a-kind movie!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
405,Afakaz,"Watch it again, it grows on you",10,18 July 2003,"Well, I'm not going to give a plot summary, since that's been done to death. Nor am I going to give a complete cast list, though I might mention a few. What I'm going to do instead is talk about my experience(s) with the movie, and what I think of it.  Warning, I may quote lyrics QUITE a bit.
For a LONG time, I don't even know how long, a friend of mine had been bugging me to see this movie.  I'd hemmed, and hawed, cause I had no real interest in seeing it.  Then I found out that Danny Elfman, of Oingo Boingo fame, not only was in it, but did the entire score, and I said ""YES!!"".  I wound up seeing it, and though it was interesting(and OH how I marveled at the stop-motion animation[I hesitate to call it claymation, cause I use that as a derogatory term for very obvious and jerky stop-motion animation]), it wasn't really anything spectacular.  I shrugged, and moved on.  When I mentioned to one of my friends that it wasn't that impressive, he said, and I quote: ""Yeah, I was the same way the first time.  Watch it again, it grows on you"".  So I did.  And the second time, I thought ""Hmm.  Some of the songs are cool, I guess."".  So then I watched it a third time, and thought ""Wow, this is pretty great!"" Then a fourth.  And fifth.  The first time was a bit over a month ago, and I'm up over a dozen now, including twice in the last 24 hours.The songs are amazing.  Well-written, well-performed, energetic, and CATCHY. They get stuck in your head, and they stay around.  Trust me.  I've got ""What's This?"" running through my head this very minute.  Danny Elfman is simply a god.  There's even a reference to one of Oingo Boingo's songs, Tender Lumplings.  The choreography that goes with them in the movie is also awesome.  In fact, one of the things I say is a sign of a good musical is that when you hear the songs, they make you think of the scene, and Nightmare Before Christmas DEFINITELY does that.  Also, it does what I know Andrew Lloyd Webber does, and I'm sure a number of other composers do, but I haven't bothered to look it up, which is to re-use tunes, even if it's only in the background, throughout the entire movie.  I very much like that.As for the animation...  It's simply amazing.  Not necessarily up to the CGI of today, such as Finding Nemo, or even Toy Story, but considering that it's 10 years old, it's pretty amazing.  Watching it in the reflection in my monitor this morning, it actually DID look like CGI.  I can't even imagine how long it must have taken to make.  And there's so many details in things, it's impossible to catch them all.  I didn't even notice til my eighth time through that Zero's nose is actually a tiny Jack-O'-Lantern, and even then I had to have it pointed out to me.  Many little things like that, and Oogie-Boogie's lair, and it's just amazing.Also, you empathize with the characters.  You do feel Jack's pain in Poor Old Jack...  And then, as he gets his spirit back near the end of it, you find yourself just as elated as he.  You can feel his glee at preparing Christmas, and you're in the same state, because you just can't help it. It's that energetic.  Lock, Shock, and Barrel are also very cool, they're the little scamps who capture Santa.  They amuse me every time.I think I've gone on long enough...  In short, it's a very good movie. I'm totally in love with it now, and I'm planning on buying the soundtrack as soon as I can.  DO watch it.  I give it 10/10, my highest rating.  Enjoy, all.--Afakaz",The Nightmare Before Christmas

This film was rather disappointing because i would have expected more from Tim Burton but it is still a really good film just not up to his usual standards. it kind of felt like what pixar would do if they ever went into claymation, mild, rather simple story line and (sorry to say but) overrated. i know many people will disagree with me but i just felt more could have been done to make it one of his great films with that unique touch of genius to the characters but since its already been made i'll settle with it.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

We thought it would be great to see it on Halloween this year (2006) on the big screen in the digitally remastered 3D version. The film opens with some new and startling computer generated 3D graphics that is right in your face - as good 3D should be. Then the main feature starts of the remastered movie. It is flat to the screen but has depth going back - kind of like it was happening in a fish tank the front of which is a screen away. The film only leaps out at you on one or two occasions.

The animation is revolutionary and flawless. you won't find a better example of puppetry and animation in Hollywood. The music is divine. not only are the vocal performances of this film wonderful, but the composition and overall flow and sound of the film's music and sound effects are what make this movie. The viewer is enticed into the story from the very beginning and their attention is held throughout the film. The imagery that the film contains is ironic and somewhat creepy which adds to the effect of the story and keeps the viewer entertained.

This movie wasn't terrible - the music and animation were very good - but what this movie lacks is any kind of importance in anything. Sally had basically no character, but the movie acts like she's important. Sally's relationship with the main character Jack Skellington was also completely forced. They had absolutely no chemistry with each other, the only time they even talked with each other was when Sally was warning Jack about how his desire to become Santa Claus was a bad idea. And speaking of him wanting to be Santa, that's the plot of the movie.

I must say my favorite part of the whole movie is when Jack is depressed and sings in the cemetery. That part of the movie gives me butterflies every time I watch it!

It captures the essence of Christmas and Halloween all in one. The plot of this movie is about the king of horror, Jack Skellington, who leads another successful Halloween celebration for Halloween Town. Jack, who is voiced by Chris Sarandon and Danny Elfman, is having a hard time being content with his life. After leaving the celebration, Jack happens upon a mystical circle of trees in the woods. He enters the tree that has the most appealing design on the outside and discovers the beautiful Christmas Town. With his newfound interest, Jack implores the mayor, who is voiced by Glenn Shadix, to help him bring Christmas to Halloween Town. Sally, voiced by Cathrine O'Hara, also wants to see Jack's dream come true but doubts that it will give Jack the happiness he seeks. Jack decides that capturing the Santa will be precisely what he needs to perfect his plans to bring Christmas to Halloween Town. Amid all Jack's plans, Lock, Shock, and Barrel, voiced by Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman, help Oogie Boogie, voiced by Ken Page, thwart Jack's plans by kidnapping Santa right before Christmas! Jack takes over Christmas in Christmas Town by giving the children gifts made by the citizens of Halloween Town. His plans do not go as planned, and as a result, he must make it right by freeing Santa, the only one who can bring back the true Christmas spirit to Christmas Town. This film captures what it truly feels like to be lost and in search of meaning in life.The actor's voices bring each character to life. Sally and Jack's kindred spirits are brought together as they each spend moments of solitude singing of their desire for something more. When they finally come together, their voices dance and create this beautiful feeling of harmony. These two characters were struggling with sadness and loneliness. It was not until Sally found Jack singing in the graveyard that she realized he was so similar to her. From the dialog to the sad music, this movie bared out the curiosity and the journey that can unfold from wanting more in life. Similar to Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, the main character, Victor Van Dort, is in search of what he wants in life. His shy behavior is nothing like Jack's outgoing personality, but he too wants more in life and goes on a journey in a different world.The music in this film does an excellent job of drawing out each character's emotions. When Sally attempts to escape the tower with her creator inside, she sings a song that makes you feel her sadness. She wants to leave the Evil Scientist, voiced by William Hickey, because he does not let her see the world. An excellent camera technique used in this film, in a couple of scenes, is the use of silhouettes. When Jack and Sally stand at the top of the curvy hill, singing their duet, their silhouettes are highlighted by the moonlight. This scene shows their two souls have finally found what they were missing, each other. The significance comes from the fact that they are the only two ""living"" beings in the pumpkin patch; the vibrant light is shining on them, and they are no longer alone. One last technique that brought life to the theme of the film is the lighting. The gloomy darkness that covers Halloween Town captures its bleakness and horror. However, when entering Christmas Town, we can see that there is this sense of happiness and hope. Jack's journey to Christmas Town and back, ultimately brings him to the conclusion that leaving home is not always the answer to finding happiness. Many people feel lost and alone in the world; sometimes, the best thing to do is remember what you have and how lucky you are to have the people you have in your life.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
425,alexroyden,Best film ever made!,10,30 August 2006,"This movie is just impossible to sum up, it is gruesome yet beautiful, completely messed up but inspired, it is so original, like nothing made before or since. Tim Burton movies are so different from anything else in the industry, and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is, if not THE best, then one of them certainly. Although it is a kids' film it holds so many concepts for an adult audience, that in reflection you wonder why on earth you let kids watch it. It has so many levels, and the stop-motion animation just adds to its effects. The film is philosophical and brings forth intriguing ideas for the audience, a definite must see if you haven't already.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

427,moonpower07,My reasons why this my rules!,10,6 May 2001,"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen by Tim Burton. The characters are awesome and the worlds are something never seen before. The story twists the classic Christmas stories and the traditional Halloween jazz in a work of art. In an attempt to improve Christmas, it nearly gets ruined by one of the greatest characters to ever grace the silver screen! If you can't tell, I think Jack is wicked cool. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. And why not? The character development is extremely well done. You've got everything from a slightly tortured main character, a girl to shy to say that she likes him, three mischievous children, and a two-faced mayor. I can't really say enough about this movie. It's a delight to watch over and over again. I love the fact that it's not something little kids would like. It makes you feel that you can enjoy it with out a five year old talking about how cute the swamp creature is. All in all, this movie rocks!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
428,itsdashortys,Awesome,9,31 October 2006,"I cant get enough of this movie, I've been watching it since i was three.Even though it took me till i was older to grasp the meaning it manages to captivate me every time. It relates to people in real life. We live in daily routine and sometimes we just get sick of it, and the same concept applied to Jack in this movie.Think about it, for Jack to go from a gloomy death ridden place to a magical world full of fun,light, and laughter had to be something exciting and utterly different for him. Well after his adventure in Christmas land he goes home to Halloween town in hope of spreading all that he had witnessed in Christmas land such as opening presents and toys but no one seems to comprehend the beauty in all of it.While Jack is wrapped up in the meaning of Chrotoem's and taking over it he is completely oblivious of Sallys warnings and love. In the end Jacks plans become a disaster.After everything falls out of place, is when Jack realizes that what hes been doing in Halloween town is whats right for him, and that what he did was wrong. The songs in this movie match perfectly with every character so well that you tend to feel for them as if they are real you get a better understanding of their personality.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Some great quotable lines (""And...frog's breath!"")...amazing songs (what else would you expect from Danny Elfman?)and truly unique characters. While Toy Story and other animated movies may have generated more box office success, they shouldn't have. The set design, animation and storyline make this a top-notch production. I absolutely love this movie. It's great for the whole family. My wife and I watch it while carving pumpkins each Halloween. It's a tradition! There may be some scenes that are a little too scary for very young ones. But kids 8 and up will absolutely love it. The storyline has Jack Skellington, the hero of Halloween, deciding to spice things up this year by trying his bony hand at Christmas. So, with good intentions he has Santa Claus kidnapped and Jack sets off to give Christmas a unique twist this year. Only problem is, no one is ready for a Skeleton Claus in a thin red suit and fake beard. Not to mention the horrifying gifts left under the tree! Jack's nemesis, Oogie Boogie is a great character and provides one of the most memorable songs/scenes in the movie. You'll have to watch it to find out how Jack saves Christmas!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

432,karatekrab,Excellent movie,10,2 November 2006,"This is one of my favorite movies, especially for the music. Songs like ""This is Halloween"", ""Jack's Lement"", and ""What's This"" really get me and my friends singing. I like the fact that when Oogie sends lock, shock, and barrel to get Santa and they end up bringing back the easter bunny. Also how all of the elves were setup and how they look makes me laugh. I'm just confused about the fact that in the song ""What's This"" Jack Skellington (main character) says the elves are throwing snowballs instead of heads. What i wonder, is HOW DOES JACK KNOW THEY'RE CALLED SNOWBALLS. I mean, isn't the whole points of the song the fact that Jack doesn't know what this place is until he hits the pole and sees Christmastown. I also like the characters in this movie, like zombies, ghosts, aquatic monsters, vampires, etc. My favorite song would have to be ""This is Halloween"". I own an iPod so i have iTunes so i listened to that song like, 51 times the day i got it. I like Jack in the Santa costume and the fact that he thinks his name is Sandy Claws. Well, i give this movie a definite 10 out of 10 and a QUADROOPLE thumbs up. The imax 3-D made the movie even better, but the classic none 3-D is still excellent. If you go see a movie anytime soon i would definitely go see this. You'll be singing the songs for years to come.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

434,psilva,Best Musical Ever!!!,10,28 December 2001,"I never liked musicals. They were always stupid love stories with silly characters who started singing in the middle of the road... This one is really different.For once the characters are puppets which makes it easy to watch them sing and dance for no apparent reasons. Then there is the music. Danny Elfman has come up with the best original soundtrack for a musical ever. I am no stranger to other famous musicals like My Fair Lady and such, but the best versions of these soundtracks were always made by third parties, usually jazz musicians. Take for instance the version of ""On The Street Where he Lives"" by Peggy Lee. Much better than the original. Also, the voices are superbly cast. Even if they are by no means what we usually consider beautiful voices, they fit the characters and the feeling the actors put to the wonderfully written words is astounding. The movie itself is gorgeous, in a dark, funny kind of way. Tim Burton has outdone himself. The story is imaginative, original and has something to do with an original subject and not the usual, boring, silly, overused, tiresome, and artificial Hollywood-made version of love.Those of you who are really incapable of loving this movie deserve my pitty and sympathy. It must be really sad to live in a world with no fantasy.As for all the others who haven't seen it. For your own sakes and mental growth, see it!!!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The story mind you is not horrible, but not very good whatsoever, and is strictly for children to enjoy. Characters are average, besides Jack who actually is very likable. There's a mad scientist, main female, dog, main antagonist; the works. The reason I give it an 8 is because its an animated musical, and mainly because of the Opening Song and a few others. Its pretty cool to watch around Halloween (or Christmas) and watch the first, very addictive, song on Youtube a bunch of times.

440,jasonistheking,Tim Burton and Danny Elfman Team Up to Deliver Again,9,5 February 2018,"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas follows the story of Jack Skellington (voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon) as he becomes disillusioned with his role as the Pumpkin King and wants more out of life. This is a tale that everyone can understand in that many times throughout life, people are simply not as satisfied with where they are. Jack is joined by the rest of Halloweentown in his quest to introduce Christmas to the residents. The residents blindly follow Jack's lead with the exception of Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara). Throughout the film, Sally tries to get Jack to follow his normal path, as Christmas is already being handled by the residents of Christmastown.
Each character in Christmas town is themed after a different aspect of fear, and they tend to blend together well. As fishmen, vampires, and even a clown with a tear away face group up, each has their own part to play in the film. Because this is a claymation style musical, music and sound is everything to the plot, and it is done in a way that gets the songs stuck in your head so that you will find yourself singing along during any viewing after the first. This is because of Danny Elfman who wrote the score. The score itself fits a Tim Burton film and likely is because they have worked together many times in the past.
During The Nightmare Before Christmas, it is impossible to ignore the similarities between this and Betelgeuse not only because of the team up of Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Catherine O'Hara, and Glen Shadix (The Mayor of HalloweenTown), but also because there are subtle nods in the animated film as well. During one scene with the main antagonist, Oogie Boogie, there are a pair of dice that landed on snake eyes. Out of the holes in the one die slithers a snake that looks remarkably like a miniature sand snake from Betelgeuse. This quick nod along with Jack dressed in a black and white pinstripe and coupled with the score that is reminiscent of Betelgeuse is enough to instantly bring back thoughts of both movies. 
The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't entirely without fault, however. There are times where you can visibly see the wires holding certain bats or other props in place, however the use of light is such that is tends to mask the majority of the flaws. In some cases, you have to look hard to see them, even if you are told they are there. The motif of fear is presented at the forefront, which makes sense given that the main setting is Halloweentown. This does present itself in Jack as well. Jack isn't simply discontent with his position in life, he comes off as being afraid that being the King of Halloween is all he will amount to in life. I believe that is his impetus to find a new passion. 
Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a fun-hearted musical about a guy just trying to chase a dream. With a solid score of musical numbers and an art style that isn't often seen in cinema, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great family movie that is fun to watch at any time of the year.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
441,maxkeogh15,"One of the most timeless animated features to of have ever been made, Burton's creative Masterpiece",10,12 May 2008,"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the most stunning animated films I have ever seen. Both for the time when it was released, and it's film-making style of animation which is stop-motion clay animation, has broken barriers well and truly that has never been seen before in the type of animation. The visual design in Nightmare is truly something to see, creating a very clever sense of mood and feel, due to it's brilliant use of colour such as the dark and grey colours of Halloweentown creates it's spooky debonair feel, and the bright colours of green and white snow create the feel of holiday cheer in ChristmasTown.It's not just the visual design and feel of Nightmare Before Christmas truly makes it an Oscar winner. It's really about the increasing level of depth that is portrayed in the leading characters: Jack Skellington and Sally: The Rag Doll. The songs and general speaking parts of both Jack and Sally contain songs a lot about how they truly feel about the lives they lead in HalloweenTown, and go on really an emotional journey to discover themselves, such as Jack, when him and his sleigh gets destroyed, Jack truly finds his inner self, and that is what makes Nightmare Before Christmas stand out from all the rest.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a true breakthrough in animated films, and truly shows how it should be done.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

The Nightmare Before Christmas has truly pushed the creative limits of the staid yet classic art form of stop motion clay animation, and truly highlighted to us the creative genius that Tim Burton has been internationally renowned as.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a film that uses it's music and general style of film-making to create a character's thoughts and mind. Such as when Jack Skellington sings about a longing feeling that he cannot find, he stands on top of a hill, in the night, and the moon reflects on his figure moving around in the scene. Danny Eflman's moody but arguably deep lyrics and musical score truly emulate Jack's feeling. Both the dark atmosphere of the shot, and decidedly gloomy music makes Jack's mind lost, unclear and cannot see what he truly desires for. The Nightmare Before Christmas therefore becomes a truly iconic and deep experience for any moviegoer to witness.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and one of my best as well.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

448,phenson47,Who Says You Can't Enjoy a Halloween Movie on Christmas?,10,4 February 2011,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a classic at its best. The movie opens on Halloween town celebrating their latest terrors of Halloween night. Jack Skellington, voice-over by Chris Sarandon and Danny Elfman, finds himself disconnected from the buzz of success and wonders aimlessly in loneliness. He finds himself in front of a door, a door shaped like a colorful Christmas tree. Curiosity gets the better of Jack and he finds himself lost in snow, surrounded by trains, lights, and little elves making presents. A feeling overcomes him, a sense of excitement. The story takes off from there! Jack returns to town, distributes Christmas jobs for all, neglecting the warnings of disaster from Sally, his quite love, voice-over by Catherine O'Hara. The theme of this film takes a focus on the style it was presented by director Henry Selick and producer Tim Burton. It has the unique touch Burton leaves with all of his films; it is quirky, inimitable, and has a set of qualities about it you only see from his films. Sound is a major player in the techniques of building the theme. The style of musical presentation is dominant in the film and emphasizes the uniqueness of the films creation. There are upbeat songs, dark songs, sad songs, and excited songs. When a doorbell is rung in Halloween Town, it is not a bell but a shriek. When the snowflakes sweep Jack away there is an attention getting sound of sparkling that comes alive. The lighting also played into the theme. Halloween Town was gloomy, gray, and dark; while Christmas Town was bright, cheerful, and lit up. This holds true when Santa Clause is kidnapped and brought back to Halloween Town and he is a shining ball of happiness and rosy cheeks against the steel gray feeling of the town. Shadows of the animated characters were created and presented in a way that a real shadow would play off of a real person. The attention to detail is remarkable, right down to little puffs of smoke coming from the trains, and shadows from lights running across the characters. Looking at all of Burton's films, his animated ones are definitely a style all of their own. When movies like Corpse Bride, James and the Giant Peach, and 9 aired in previews – it was easy to say 'Burton had to have a hand in that'! His unique style is what creates his themes and makes him stand worlds apart from other writers, producers, and directors.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

452,gogreeneaglesfan,In my top 5 favorite movies of all time,10,30 May 2012,"I have never liked stop-motion and clay things, but this is one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie is so fluent, I couldn't tell it was stop-motion and obviously it is so beautifully done. Anywhere you look there is something to behold. Also, the characters look incredible and how they even move alone is really fascinating and cool. Jack moves a lot like a spider, and Sally is clumsy (like me!). It's so cool to just look at.Beside from visuals, the music/lyrics I believe are incredible. This is Halloween is so fun with clowns who can tear away their face and monsters hiding under your bed while remaining not frightening for children. Jack's Lament is such a wonderful song with a touching message we all know too well: getting tired of the same old thing. Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones/An emptiness began to grow/There's something out there, far from my home/A longing that I've never known. Some lyrics from Jack's Lament (my favorite song in the movie.) When Sally sings her little song, I almost cry; it is so emotional. We established the songs are amazing.The plot is so original and creative; I can't helped to be drawled in. Who else would think of a Halloween Town person discovering Christmas other than Tim Burton? And the characters are some of the most interesting I've seen. Jack Skellington is so easy to relate to, lovable, and so determined, making him one of my favorite characters of all time. I'm not ashamed to admit I have a necklace of him.

Tim Burton covers every aspect of Halloween. The music by Danny Elfman is fabulous and very catchy. Once you watch it, you will want to watch it over and over again. One thing I liked about this movie is that, you get to see three different worlds. It isn't focused on just one particular holiday like some are.

456,jl-dixon,A milestone in animation and Christmas movies,10,4 December 2011,"I was a child when I first saw this movie. My father has always been a big fan of Tim Burton, and he couldn't wait to show me this on our brand new VHS. I didn't understand the movie at first because I was so young, and for years I didn't appreciate how much effort went in here. Now that I have actually developed taste, I can share with you my opinion on this revolutionary masterpiece.The plot of ""Nightmare"" is based on the Tim Burton poem of the same name. It's about a Skeleton named Jack who is the king of HalloweenTown, a place where the only holiday is Halloween. Every time the celebrations end up the same, and the whole year is spent preparing for the next Halloween. Jack, being in charge of all this, gets bored and decides that he is no longer going to bother with Halloween. He travels away from town with his ghost dog, Zero, much to the town's dismay.After days of travelling, Jack discovers a group of doors, each one acting as a portal to the different towns representing each holiday. Intrigued, he opens the door the ChristmasTown, and discovers his new favourite holiday. Jack returns triumphantly to HalloweenTown, telling everyone (through the medium of a song) to prepare for something new and exciting: Christmas. As one would expect, the people of HalloweenTown have rather dark visions of Christmas, and with an evil monster named Oogie Boogie in the mix, something's bound to go wrong! The whole movie is brilliantly presented in traditional stop-motion animation, with all 227 character models looking as they should; either bright and colourful Christmas workers or spooky Halloween creeps. Every character, however scary, is lovable from start to finish The music is pure genius and each line falls on top of the backing like brandy on a pudding. Danny Elfman does a great job as Jack's singing voice, which is expected considering he wrote the songs and therefore knows exactly how they should sound.Considering all these great elements of a movie, I would definitely dub it as a must-see and my favourite Christmas movie of all time. I watch it every Christmas Eve and will no doubt do so for years to come.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

He has a very distinctive and amazing style was it comes to film production and concepts for films. I just wanna know how he manages to get Johnny Depp for his movies, LOL.I love him as well and his kooky sense of style and sometimes questionable interpretations and almost forgot his inspirations. The scores for his movies are amazing as well, I just watched a special with I could not even tell how many piece band with an amazing conductor doing various scores from his different movies, I don't know if he always uses the same same orchestra but OMG!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

459,kentousa,Holiday Lost in Translation,8,19 October 2013,"Nightmare Before Christmas is something that truly never before seen. A carefully made film, Nightmare Before Christmas brings you a musical with a cinematography that brings realness that animated films cannot capture, and a playfulness that live action films cannot replicate.The themes of searching for a raison d'etat, wonder, disappointment, and self-realization make the music lively and meaningful. Sophia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is similar in feeling lost and searching for anything to have a passion for. Also, just like ""Lost in Translation,"" the main character, Jack, fails in his ambition and achieving his desires. But in that failure and disappointment, he finds what makes him happy and worthwhile in living.If you're looking for an unconventional holiday film (whether it is for Christmas or Halloween) or just an introduction to the world of Tim Burton, this is the movie I would recommend.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

I guess its a child-hood thing. The movie expresses great understanding of a child's point of view of Christmas. Young children don't really know why we have Christmas, and this movie gives it a quirky twist. Zero is my favorite character. This ghost-dog, brings so much reality to the screen for those of us who need something real. It sounds funny saying a ghost-dog gives something 'reality.' But I feel that it really does. I really do wish that they made more movies like that now-days. But i have no doubt that any movie will ever be as great as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas.""

The story, the soundtrack and the animation are superb. It's just perfect for all ages, a must-see movie. I'm so happy Tim Burton and Danny Elfman teamed up to do this movie because it's truly a masterpiece. Sometimes I still can't believe it's a Disney movie. Anyway, I haven't found a movie like this one in years so, I consider it a treasure in the history of film making. If you haven't seen it yet, well, what the heck are you waiting for??

""Grups"" will appreciate the mixed traditions and great juxtapositions throughout. The vampires (like others) are both about 75% cute, 25% menacing. The role of the two-faced mayor is a cute archetype for all all political types. So many cute side characters flashing in and out it is wonderful. On repeated viewings, the opening number reveals more and more of the story. The animation in fantastic throughout. I wonder when someone will create a stage musical version. I (and many friends) would pay to see that. I think that (with creativity) it could be a fine stage play.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

A door with a shining sparkling tree. Unable to resist his curiosity, Jack enters the door and into a world so unlike the one he knows - happy, gleeful, everyone enjoys themselves, it's so full of color, laughter and life - run by a big red man called ""Sandy Claws"" (or Santa Claus as we know him!) Jack on returning home, decides that instead of having his subjects prepare for Halloween - they'll prepare for Christmas as Jack has decided to take the joy of Christmas and give it to Halloween - this year HE will be the one to make millions of Children happy. Sally however has a feeling that this isn't going to go as smoothly as Jack would like. Jack meanwhile has Santa Kindapped, and orders that he be taken to place where he will be comfortable, and to be kept away from ""Oogie Boogie"" the Boogie Man for Santa's own safety.Also - unfortunately for Jack and the people of Halloween - they don't understand that what makes them (Zombies, Vampires, and Ghouls of Halloween)happy, and what makes human children happy are entirely different things, and wind up creating some... rather sick and dangerous toys. And when Oogie gets his hands on Santa and Sally, Jack realizes that the consequences of his actions have gotten desperately out of hand.The animation of the movie (Stop Frame Animation - I'm learning how to do that this autumn!! ^__^) is SUPERB, the character models are amazing and it runs so beautifully and suits the story it's telling so well.The music is very suitable too, and we have such a variety of great singers and songs - particular favourites of mine are ""Jack's Lament"" at the beginning and the ""Oogie Song"" - the Oogie song just reminds of the great Black singers of the passed which just bowled people over with their talent! The characters are very lovable, and Jack especially is very likable. Despite having Santa kidnapped his intentions ARE good ones (all he wants is to be happy and to make others happy)he's naive of the world beyond Halloween which people just take for cute silliness, and he's got an awesome singing voice! It isn't a scary movie - some of the Halloween townsfolk models may give you the creeps, but they aren't scary. The humour is lighthearted and fun, the story is amazing to watch. It is at times a dark movie but people love that stuff - yeah you've probably seen Jack around on some Goth girls handbag or wristband as he has become something of a Goth icon, take it as a sign that Jack - and this movie rock and go watch it if you haven't!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Well, when one of the best writers/directors gets together with one of the best composers, and Disney, I don't think their are any bad things anyone can say.

I sold my video taped version and hope to see it on DVD.Most impressive were the Burton's archetypal images joined with Danny Elfman's musical composition and the ultimate opera they achieved. A Jungian representation of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Bach's Mass in B-Minor"".In many ways we are sew to gether and patched up, in one way shape or form, and each of us in our own way hope to discover the land of Christmas and its true meaning.Each of us participates in our own way to proceed from the mundane thru the arcane. Mr. Burton and Mr. Elfman have in their own unigue way created amethod to proceed from the ordinary to the extraordinary. They took a simple theme and gender, and there their individual and combined insight transformed it to reflect each persons dream to become something, or someone greater then they're parts, then they're past, then they're whole.The tension points in the film are exquisitely brought forth by Elfman's voice and composition. The entire is carried by the visual images of Burton and audio expressions of Elfman.The entire deserved an Oscar, for each. And I look forward to perhaps a return of both of them to again to an animated opera.Just in the future, please release it in full-screen DVD.David",The Nightmare Before Christmas

All of his work is just amazing! It was some what a horror movie, but yet it wasn't quite too scary for, say, a two year old. And all of the songs were wonderful! The story and the plot couldn't have been better, but I have to say, there could have been a better or more explaining ending. The ending kind of leaves you wondering whether or not the two (Jack and Sally) finally DO end up together or if the Mad Scientist splits them apart or what!?

I especially love the love affair between Sally and Jack, who knew a skeleton and a ragdoll could be so romantic?!

And even though he is a skeleton, Jack Skellington is inquisitive, breath-taking, and incredibly sexy ;)! The movie also contains awesome musical scores performed by Danny Elfman (also works with the Simpsons) and Catherine O'Hara (in this year's Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events).

471,amandalrad,Nightmare Before Christmas Review,9,27 November 2013,"This movie is a Halloween/Christmas themed movie. It includes Jack Skeleton who is getting tired of the holiday, Halloween. It also includes Sally who is a rag doll, a ghost dog that is named zero, a mad scientist, Oogie Boogie who is made of bugs, and more. Jack walks through the woods and finds other holiday doors. This includes Easter, Christmas, and Thanksgiving. Jack decides that Christmas is the best option because he loves the costume and the idea of giving presents. He tells his town that is called Halloween town, that they are doing something new. This makes for the scene of having a comical yet hardship kind of movie that I quite enjoy.The children are told to steal Santa Clause so they way Jack can be Santa. The children take Santa Clause to Oogie Boogie the boogie man. The town makes presents, a costume, a sleigh and a reindeer. The reindeer is Zero, the costume is made by sally, and the ghouls and monsters in the movie make the presents.At the time of Christmas everything is all set for Jack to deliver the presents. This doesn't go well for Jack because the children don't like their scary toys and complaints are made to the police. The police start to hunt down Jack and nearly kill him. He gets back to Halloween Town safely but Jack has to save Sally from Oogie Boogie who took her and Santa. This happens during the scene of when Jack is delivering presents and getting hunted by the police. Jack ends up saving Santa and Sally by defeating Ooggie Boogie.Jack and Sally get Santa home safely and Halloween Town is back to normal. Jack then sees Sally go into the graveyard and follows her. They profess their love for each other and the movie ends under the moonlight with them embracing each other. This is a great movie and a classic one that I thoroughly enjoy.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Jack stumbles upon Christmastown and learns a lesson of who he is, and discovering himself. This movie is Romance, fiction, inspiration, action, adventure, and family all in one. I would give anything to be a resident of Halloweentown (or maybe just being able to meet Danny Elfman). =)I give it ONE HUNDRED out of ten. Sally (the rag doll) is secretly in love with Jack, but is not confident to tell him so.

473,bookaddict1,Love,10,27 December 2013,As a little kid I watched the same old Christmas movies and I grew to hate them. This was probably the first Burton film I can remember seeing and I've never gotten tired of it and it is both a Christmas and Halloween movie. If you haven't seen it then you're missing out. The movie itself is amazing but knowing that it is clay animation and not animation makes this film so much more amazing. It also amazes me how the idea for this didn't come from a book but from the man's head. You also need to watch the special features and see the things Disney took out and his other ideas. Burton is swimming in talent. Disney didn't think the young audiences could handle everything so be sure to check it out.,The Nightmare Before Christmas

475,tharley85,Tim Burton at his best!,9,4 November 2015,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is an animated film that tells the story of the Night Before Christmas with a twist. The film follows Jack Skellington, voiced by Chris Sarandon, while he tries to recreate Christmas Town in his home town, Halloween Town. Already bored with being the scariest person in Halloween Town, he tries to turn the horribly scary Halloween Town into the cheerful, happy Christmas Town after discovering Christmas Town through a portal deep in the forest. Unfortunately, the townsfolk see this is not such a good idea way before Jack realizes it. After Jack's Christmas early and in disaster, he learns to embrace what he does best and helps Santa save Christmas.This film shows that people should always be true to themselves. Although Jack was looking for something new, Sally, Jack's friend/love interest who is voiced by Catherine O'Hara, always appreciated him for who he was. Even though Jack's obsession with recreating the spirit of Christmas caused him to change for the worst, Sally stood by him. Sally hoped that Jack would realize he is his best when he is the Pumpkin King. Despite her pleas, Jack continued to create Christmas in Halloween Town and set himself up as the new Santa Claus with the enthusiastic townsfolk's help. Initially excited and hopeful, the townsfolk began to realize they aren't cut out for bringing cheer and happiness. Jack's realization came after his hand-made sleigh fell to the ground in a fiery blaze. He understands that he is the Pumpkin King, decides to turn things around, and help give the world the Christmas they deserve.From the very beginning of the movie, lighting was used to set the mood for Halloween Town. The town's buildings and the townsfolk were created and shown in tones of grey. The shadowy lighting helped emphasize the dark and dreary atmosphere that the townsfolk called home. Even in the light of day, the town was still only lit in a tone of grey. When Jack made the trip to Christmas town, the town was bathed in colors and shiny lights. This made Christmas Town feel brighter, warmer, and more inviting. It also helped the viewers experience what Jack felt upon first experiencing the town. The wonderment he felt was also translated into one of the best songs in the film, ""What's This"".Despite how Jack took the time to painstaking create his version of the things he experienced in Christmas Town, he could never quite get them right. His true self always shone through. Once he realized what made him his best, he was able to enjoy preparing the next Halloween again. The saying goes ""the grass is always greener on the other side"". This is what Jack able to realize.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

To this day I have not yet seen a film (in my own opinion) cover such an interesting concept. It does really start to interest me when I start to think, what would happen if just for one year, Halloween was combined with Christmas? I also wonder, what would have happened if the Film had not have been the success it was? However Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the founding films when it comes to the full length stop motion film. I know it was not the first film to use stop motion, but this was the first film to take it to that kind of extent. To finish, I also love the characters and musical numbers and scores as well. When I think about it, this is a film everyone could find something to like about it. it has: Romance, action, thrills, musical numbers, and not to mention an amazing story.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

When Jack brings this idea back to Halloween Town, people are hesitant at first to follow, but after being convinced they go along with it. When things start to take things for the worst. Jack must do what he needs to save everything from the problems that he caused to begin with. The music in the movie fits well and shows emotions that the characters have. It gets the point across to the viewer as to what the character is feeling, however there are a few songs in the movie that do not fit at the time they are placed. The music shows what is happening at the time but they are not the best at seeing the character for whom they are and why they are doing, what is asked of them. There is some foreshadowing in the songs that give clues at what happens once something takes place in the movies. With the foreshadowing taking place in the songs, it helps the plot of the movie move along to the next scene that is taking place. The development of the characters throughout the movie show a change in personality and how they come across. In the beginning of the movie Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is in charge of all Halloween's that take place in the world, however after Halloween is over he feel like something is missing.

481,freet-96335,"From the mind of Tim Burton, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Claymation adaption of ""The Night Before Christmas"".",10,2 August 2015,"From the mind of Tim Burton, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Claymation adaption of ""The Night Before Christmas"". Directed by Henry Selick the film features the voice acting of Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon both playing the part of Jack Skellington, Catherine O'Hara as Sally, William Hickey as the Evil Scientist, and Glenn Sadix as the Mayor of Halloweentown. The film was a groundbreaking Claymation production that features thousands of tiny clay figurines that needed to be posed and moved hundreds of times each just to create one scene.The Nightmare before Christmas takes place in a world with different mystical towns for each holiday, such as Eastertown, Halloweentown, and Christmas town. Jack Skellington, the king of Halloweentown, stumbles across Christmas town and is immediately infatuated with it despite not fully understanding what Christmas is, or what it means. The movie centers around Jack's growing obsession with this newfound holiday and how he can incorporate it into Halloweentown. Song and dance is one of the key components that progresses the story throughout the film, however, the Theme of The Nightmare Before Christmas is the internal battle that Jack Skellington is fighting. It is apparent from the onset of the movie that he has an empty feeling inside and is trying to figure out why. His obsession with Christmas is an attempt to fill that emptiness and reinvigorate the passion he once had for Halloween. There are several points in the movie that Jack is forced to stop and question what he is doing and why he is doing it. He has a very difficult time understand why he is so captivated by Christmas. The characters that push him through the movie the most are Sally, who portrays the good innocent side of the battle Jack is fighting, and the Evil Scientist, who pushes Jack in a darker more maniacal direction. Jack's internal battle is much less serious than films that would share this central theme. Typical plots in this category sometimes involve depression, drug or alcohol addiction, or serious family problems.Nearly all of the cinematography within The Nightmare before Christmas is, or was, extremely fresh and exciting for viewers. The movements of characters due to the Claymation process was slightly unnatural but in a very interesting way. The film employs a varying types of lighting techniques to transition from scary Halloweentown creature to scary Halloweentown creature. Varying degrees of framing allow for most of the inhabitants of Halloweentown to seem almost casually terrifying. Viewers are quick to forget that many of this town's inhabitant are the stuff of nightmares and it would take outsiders being exposed to them to bring that point back to light.Overall The Nightmare before Christmas was superbly done and became an instant cult classic. 22 years later and it is still a great film to watch with a very unique premise. In this day and age, a unique plot is something that is difficult to come by. The story, the Claymation, the cinematography, and catchy songs that the character regularly burst into all create a very memorable film that is worth re-watching time and time again.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

Even the minor characters that didn't speak felt authentic! I loved the children the fatty, and the demon child. Personally my favorite character was the Demon (the red one). There were twists, and turns, and most everyone was dead. That added to the effect of the town of all hallows eve. the most surprising part was when jack was shot down (which sucked). The songs were simply delightful, which makes this my all time favorite When i watch this it gives me the impression that doctor Seuss had an evil (but slightly more realistic) twin.

However, during this Halloween season, I wanted to get into the spirit and figured this movie was the best way to get into the mood of the season. In 1993, Tim Burton released this astounding, grungy film. This movie provokes imagination in people of all ages. It is an animation film and also a musical that features creative songs that will be stuck in your head for days! Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King in Halloween town. The whole town thrives off of scares and making sure each Halloween is more frightening than the last. It is Jacks job to provide the frights for the entire town. However, once he discovers of a place called Christmas town, he is intrigued and thinks that all of Halloween town should try and pull of Christmas. Jack goes as far as hiring young children to kidnap Santa Clause. This scene is equipped with a catchy song ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"" that you will find yourself humming long after the movie is over! Jack's Christmas doesn't go completely as planned. The Claymation of this film proves to be of high quality. The theme of staying true to yourself and remembering who you are is a great message to young children, but also individuals of all ages. I can relate to the monotony that Jack faces. I think everyone has felt bored with the same old routine at some point in time. However, it is important to stay true to yourself, even in moments of boredom.

The director of the film is Tim Burton. He creates a dreamlike world that is truly unique. The story takes place in a town called Halloween Town. It is filled with monsters, vampires, werewolves, and other scary deformed creatures. It is a dark and creepy looking movie, yet it isn't the slightest bit scary. Burton does a great job of making scenes humorous when they're getting suspenseful. The main roll is a man named Jack Skellington, who leads the town to celebrate Halloween. He eventually gets tired of his everyday life style and seeks something new and different. Jack wonders off and finds these doors with different holiday symbols on them. He opens the door with a Christmas tree on it and he gets pulled in. This town is completely opposite of the town he has known his whole existence. Christmas town is happy, colorful, and everyone is cheerful. Jack quickly goes home to Halloween town to share his experience he had with the town. Later in the movie he tries to capture ""Sandy Clause"" and bring him to Halloween Town to take over Christmas.This film has excellent camera angles for being filmed in 1993 and being a stop- motion film. The lighting that is used throughout the film is High Key Lighting. Many of the scenes are shot in darkness or in silhouette. This adds to the dark situation the film is portraying. In one particular scene Jack is climbing a mountain and his silhouette appears on the huge moon behind him. This makes Jacks character seem large and powerful. The motions of the characters are seamless and entertaining. Overall this is a very enjoyable film that is intended for almost everyone. The non diegetic sound throughout the film is excellent. Each song is catchy and you can't help but sing along. The animation of the characters and scenery are original and fun to look at it. Watching the film, I never even noticed it was stop motion. It was so captivating and fun to watch.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
486,seanbaker1,Too good to be animated!,10,31 July 2005,"One of the best animated movies of all time, by the amazing Tim Burton. It's not actually directed by him, but it's still really Burtonesque and, anyway, he wrote the story. It's basically about a skeleton called Jack, who lives in Hallowe'en Town. Eventually, he gets bored of the same old everything, everyday, and goes wandering in the woods. There, he finds Christmas Town. He loves it so much he decides to bring it to Hallowe'en Town and have a different holiday. The rest involves skeleton reindeer, an evil wreath, a kidnapped Santa, Igor, and, of course, a fat kid, running down the landing. The movie's a musical, a comedy, a stop motion animation, and a Christmas present or Hallowe'en treat for everyone, except little kids who might get frightened by the brilliant, Gothic characters and sets. There's even an old woman getting attacked by a wreath! Heh.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
487,Guns_Go____xx_BANG,Excellent Directing Performance,10,31 July 2005,"I think this is an excellent movie which deserves an outstanding 10!!! Tim Burton did a wonderful job on The Nightmare Before Christmas!!! The characters so vibrant and life-like, each adapting their own personality with out a flaw. This will always be my favorite movie, I cant wait for Corpse Bride! After seeing the way Johnny works with Tim in Charlie and the chocolate factory, I cant wait for more! The clay work phenomenal, down to the details in the grave yard. Voices matched perfectly with the characters. The music is much different than other musicals, more mysterious and grasping. All that hard work and time turned out to be a giant success! Clothing, dolls, posters, and the DVD/VHS its self now a major part of the industry. I believe this magnificent movie is here to stay on all of the TNBC fans list of favorite movies ever, including me! So if you have not yet seen this movie, i suggest you do!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
488,musetta1021,One of Burton's best,9,1 August 2005,"There's really not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I'm of the opinion that Tim Burton is a genius. The visual style of this film is so simple and a dark kind of exquisite. I actually cared about the characters, something that's rare for me in an animated film. There were so many little nuances in the film that I just adore. But my favorite thing about the movie is Danny Elfman. His singing voice is absolutely beautiful and it just furthered my belief that he's a genius musician. The score is just exquisite. There's really not much more I can say about it, except that it's a true masterpiece and is right up there with Edward Scissorhands.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
489,jackiegerdne,"Terrifying good, slightly dark and timelessly charming fairytale",8,28 February 2016,"There is Christmas movies. There is monster films, There is animations and also musicals. Then there is the ultimate - and probably the only one - combination, Nightmare Before Christmas. Tim Burton (story/producer), Henry Selich (directng) and Danny Elfman (compositor) works terrifyingly good together to create this slightly dark, charming fairytale that will please both children and adults.The story follows Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. He is the creative genius behind the Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrifying than the last. However deep inside he feels that his life is lacking meaning and he longs for something more than the familiar horrors of Halloween Town. A longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes he has never witnessed before. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas. But the others in the towns realise the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.In an age where Disney dominates the world of of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film using a much more traditional animation style and a huge amount of imagination. I think it's nice to have something different out there. The basic plot is a great little fantasy with a very dark heart to it, that make it much more enjoyable, just because it has that edge to it. Nevertheless 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is filled with warmth and happiness - especially from the protagonist Jack Skellington - just not the traditional kind. It is a musical so it has a lot of catchy and fun song throughout the film. The voice actors are great and in my opinion really succeeds to incorporates the characters they voice. The effort that evidently have been put down to make this film is admirable and the small details in the background are stunning. It's a timeless visual masterpiece that has a lot of charming details like vampires with umbrellas to look at. For me personally 'Nightmare Before Christmas' have a lot of nostalgia to it since I have watched it year after year always around Halloween time. Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (although can be too scary for the youngest ones) and never ignores one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairy tale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered and watched ideally around Halloween or Christmas.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
490,mel-kellett,Wonderful....Magical,10,8 August 2005,"This movie was indeed magical for all ages. I love the fact that instead of taking a princess tale, with butterflys and always smiling faces, they made it a dark tale, yet romantic, some comedy, and had a great adventure! This movie could not of been made better. I think that anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing out! The next thing that was so great about this movie is the characters, that is a big plus. Because they made each character have their own personality and own scare tactics. For one, Jack is a caring sweet, sensitive guy, he doesn't appear that way at first, but then again he is a skeleton! Sally is yet a gorgeous doll(in the Halloween world) and all she wants is good for people. I think Tim Burton did a wonderful job at keeping all his creations for the movie ""non-scary"" but yet ""scary"" Tim Burton.....you have my 10!",The Nightmare Before Christmas

When I was a kid I thought it was very disturbing and I didn't like the story or any of the characters. Now as an adult I feel the same way. It doesn't even have any comedy to make it fun.

This movie, a first in cinematic history, led the way for other greats. It has a superb storyline and memorable characters that will leave you laughing, crying, and in shock. I don;t want to say anything that will ruin it for others, but I will tell you this; of all the ""animated"" movies i've ever seen, The Nightmare takes the cake. I've watched it every year during Christmas, and it's brightened up my gloomy little part of the world. I just hope it does the same for everyone else out there. Watch the movie: You won't regret it!",The Nightmare Before Christmas
497,k1tty_katt230501,Tim Burton genius,10,10 October 2005,"I think Tim Burton hit the button on so many levels with this movie, the characters are completely flawless and hold all abilities for you to want the story to continue or watch a prequel to the movie to understand more about them. The plot is simply complicated as it is controlled around each character involved and plays on not just a child's imagination but a grown man's dreams. The musical concept was something i was controversial about until I heard it for the first time and I must say bravo as the lyrics are above even Disney's usual standards. Overall if you love genius' and their work, you'd watch this movie and never feel disappointed.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
498,PrincessBarb88,Great Movie,10,23 October 2005,"This movie is often misunderstood. Jack Skellingtons intention was never to ruin Christmas, the towns folk just couldn't understand that. He wanted to make a happy Christmas but happiness was not business in Halloweentown. Anyways, the visuals in this movie are outstanding at the least and the music is excellent. I recommend this movie to everyone. My niece just saw the movie for the first time, and even though its more than 10 years older than she is she adores it. She insists Jack will be her husband. Basically, I love this movie, and you will too. Tim Burton out did himself with this one. Its one of his best works. He also just came out with another movie of the same visual effects called ""The Corpse Bride"" which I haven't seen yet.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
499,itsmeimnothiding,brilliant,10,4 December 2005,the way Tim Burton brings a dark scened evil-looking animated movie and makes it into a masterpiece full of happy-go-lucky advice and characters that say whats truthfully on their minds is amazing. i adore this movie!! TIM BURTON NEVER STOP DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST. everyone is pleased and enjoyed by seeing jack; sally is mysterious and adorably put together; the mayor is hysterical; morals in the movie are high; they set a tone for 'jump right in there' or 'do what you think will make you happy' and 'do something completely out of character'. Surprise people by doing your best in something you don't know anything about. Try new things. If you think you may enjoy something: DO IT. Money and effort is only meant for success in something you love. This movie enchants me every time i watch it and i would recommend to all to pick it up and take the time to watch a Tim Burton film!,The Nightmare Before Christmas
500,hargro-11026,Jack learns to be himself,10,10 December 2017,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is focused around a skeleton whom everyone calls Jack the Pumpkin King, he is voiced by Chris Sarandon but sang by Danny Elfman. Jack finds that he is starting to become bored with doing the same thing every year for Halloween and wants to do something different. Jack and Zero start to wonder around and found a forest with different holidays with doors as the holiday theme, he gets dragged into the Christmas one. There he is amazed with all the different lights, sounds and everything that is different compared to his Halloween Town. Its bright, cheery and festive. They really capture everything with all the different angles they show us from him peeking into the window and seeing the elves kissing under the mistletoe, him jumping around on top of the houses, riding the carousal and finally you see from Jacks point of view then he is looking at the sign for Christmas Town. When he goes back you can feel the difference because in Christmas town it was fun and festive, lights everywhere and the moon looked brighter while lighting up the town while Halloween Town is more dark and dreary, having an overcast to make it feel dulled down. It is a stop motion animation, so the lighting is different than a motion picture, but you can still see the different lighting techniques that help make this movie stand out. They use low-key lighting and high-key lighting though the movie and this is where you can really see the difference between the towns, but they do use a lot of side lighting to instead of just a light overhang. This gives you the impression with the shadows and making it feel a bit darker.Jack does different experiments and decides that he is going to take over Christmas. Giving out different jobs to his fellow towns people on how to make Christmas better then before. He asked Santa to be brought to him, unharmed but the kids decided the best place to keep him comfortable is with Oogie Boogie. Sally, voiced by Catherine O'Hara, tries to tell Jack that what he is doing is wrong. But he doesn't listen and continues to do what he wants, making Halloween toys, and having his own costume. This leads him to ruin Christmas for everyone and being shot out of the sky. After a clear moment in the graveyard he realizes that he is The Pumpkin King and he great at being himself, not someone else. He races off to rescue Santa and Sally from Oogie Boogie, who is trying to get rid of them. Jack saves the them both and Santa tells him to not take over his holiday again and listen to Sally. Christmas was saved with Santa fixing all Jacks mistakes, and Jack is happy to be The Pumpkin King again with Sally by his side. The music scores for this movie is great and keeps the audience entertained. You have the notes becoming higher when it's an important scene or they are singing, but it mellows out into the background the rest of the time. This gives the movie a well-rounded music score with the scenes because it tells the story with the dialogue. Tim Burton has a certain feel to his movies and this is no exception. It reminds me a little of the Corpse Bride on how the lighting is in some of the scenes but its also a stop motion animation too. There is some romance to it, but it doesn't show until the end where both parties come together. They must learn and comes to terms with certain issues before they get their happily ever after to their story.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
501,charliandwillforeva,"Tim Burton directing, need I say more?",9,27 December 2005,"Of all Tim Burton's movies (excepting Vincent) this would still have to be his crowning glory. What I love most is the in-depth characterization of the models. From their physical appearance, to the way they speak even including their movement each character is a true individual. Along with Danny Elfman's musical genius which has also produced the fabled Simpsons theme tune and many other ""uknown"" television and movie song, this truly is a movie for the ages. I highly recommend it for anyone who has twisted sense of humour or a good sense of fun. Everyone can enjoy the colourful characters of Halloween town and the soft heart that lies even in the chests of Monsters and Ghoul and, of course, Skeletons.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

506,AmazingShrekIsNotOnFire,Movie Review Originally Written for Film Class (with spoilers),9,20 December 2018,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a film written and produced by Tim Burton. It is a formalistic film that likely takes place during the gothic era. The Nightmare Before Christmas falls under the animation and musical genres. It is a fun film to watch around the Halloween season, maybe even around the Christmas season. The use of mise-en-scene really helps depict this world very well and makes it seem believable.The Nightmare Before Christmas tells the tale of a man named Jack (Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon) who is a skeleton and lives in this fantasy world where holidays are segregated. Jack basically runs Halloween. Jack's character is portrayed as a scary figure with aid of costume. It helps that Jack is really tall and thin like Slenderman. Jack also has this striped black and white suit that accentuates his length. To complete his outfit, he has a bat pin stamped just under his neck. Dark gaping holes fill his face where his eyes should be. Jack is just one of the many creepy creations from the mind of Tim Burton.
The mayor figure (Glenn Shadix) is a clueless event coordinator. He cannot plan anything on his own, and he always needs Jack's help to plan the next Halloween. The mayor is this bowling pin-shaped, two-faced man with an elongated hat. His face actually rotates between the pleasant face and then some type of angry, sad face. The mayor is a relatively harmless figure in the movie.Jack is dissatisfied with his life after the Halloween celebrations. He goes off on his own to think about what is missing from his life, and a girl stalks him from the shadows. Her name is Sally (Catherine O'Hara), and she was created by the Halloween town scientist (William Hickey). She is a puppet put together very sloppily with random seams all over. Her limbs often disassemble, but sometimes that is a good thing. As Jack is walking down a winding hilltop in the moonlight, she watches him and listens as he sings his song of how he feels that he just does not belong. He wishes he could renounce the Pumpkin King title, and he travels further into the forest.Jack discovers the Christmas town and loves everything he sees. He comes up with a plan to introduce Christmas to his friends in Halloween town. Jack has some kids bring Santa Claus back from Christmas town. When Santa enters Halloween town, he is wrapped up in a large black bag. As he emerges from the bag, the point of view shifts for the first time. The viewers can see from Santa's perspective the horrors that are presented before him. His vision is a bit blurry at first which when added to the chiaroscuro effect, makes it seem scarier. Everything from Santa's vision is pointier, darker, meaner. There are bricks out of place on buildings and bolts holding everything together. Spiked fences line the bricked roads. This is not a place Santa Claus would want to be. The kids take Santa to see Oogie Boogie (Ken Page).Oogie Boogie is a villain. He is a monster that looks like a ghost wearing a massive potato sack with form-fitting facial orifices. In the movie, he is really composed of maggots on the inside. Oogie Boogie lives in a creepy place in the ground. The decor consists of a hole in the middle with some type of acidic goo, rusty pipes, and ghostly gambling paraphernalia. In order to get to it, people have to climb down a small tunnel, which could make the viewer claustrophobic just looking at it. Confined spaces are scary, though, so that keeps up with the reputation of the town.While Santa Claus is being held captive, Jack goes back to Christmas town and pretends to be Santa Claus for the night, handing out the toys that they made in Halloween town. These toys have teeth and can chase kids. The point of view shifts again as a child runs timidly down the stairs to the scene of the skeletal Santa distributing demonic toys. Getting to see the screen shake with each step the child takes puts the audience in the perspective of the child. It is a useful technique to involve the audience like that, even briefly, because it keeps them engaged and, in this case, it builds suspense as we all discover what is around the corner.The movie concludes with Jack's return to Halloween town and rescue of Santa Claus. Jack discovers that he loves being the Pumpkin King, and that is what he is meant to be. Santa Claus goes back to Christmas town and restores the balance of Christmas again.The setting plays a very important role in establishing this story. The scenes need to be composed of dark tones, creepy creatures, unsettling music, and scary houses and streets. When Jack enters Christmas town warm, festive colors, soft snow, and pleasant sounds can be experienced. Observing the distinction between the two towns helps the viewer understand these worlds better.The storyline is linear, and the ending is a little predictable. The viewer knows that everything will go back to the way it was, especially since it is meant for a younger audience. It is hard to empathize with these characters. Besides Jack's existential crisis, the plot revolves around something very specific that is not something that humans can experience. Although, everyone can probably relate to feeling like they are out of place in life, and so they search for what they are truly meant to be doing.There was a metaphor I caught on to that I found slightly amusing. The mayor has two faces and is a political figure. I think that might represent how people view actual politicians, because they may be smiling in one situation, but they could be a totally different person in another.I liked this movie because it is a great Halloween movie that people of all ages can enjoy and still get something out of. I really like how the movie is composed with the animated characters. I am not quite sure if this is Claymation, but it seems like it has some elements of Claymation in it. The choice of using animation in the way they did was successful because the characters and the setting looked more realistic than if it was just plain cartoon animation. The more realistic the scenes, the more willing the audience is to suspend their disbelief. This will be a movie that I will watch every year because it is seasonally appropriate and brings back nostalgia from my childhood. I would recommend that everyone watches this movie at least once in their life. It is on all the time around Halloween, so it would be hard to miss it.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
507,eriks_angel900,"One of, if not the best, the greatest Tim Burton films",10,4 March 2006,"Nightmare Before Christmas, the first time I saw it, blew me out of my Love/Hate relationship with Disney (Then, I thought Disney had produced it, as most of the merchandise is manufactured at Disney). The ending wasn't a true Disney ending (La-de-da, we're so happy. Flower chains for all), but it was also a sweet, all most tears-of-joy-jerking moment between Jack and Sally. The speed and the way the movie plays out is nearly perfect (nothing's perfect), and the music's amazing. Every song was musical quality, and I could (if people could properly dress up as skeletons, zombies, and huge sacks of bugs) seriously see it becoming a Broadway production. Claymation is one of my favorite forms of animation. Since it takes up so much time and effort going frame-by-frame, I respect the animators for their patience. The cliché good versus evil that's plagued movies for years actually held a positive respect for me in NMBC. With Oogie Boogie (my personal favorite character) and his henchman Lock, Shock and Barrel (Henchwoman in Shock's case) causing havoc for Jack and Sandy Claws was cool, but it was only because Jack told Lock, Shock, and Barrel to go kidnap Sandy Claws. Like in the song 'Poor Jack', when he laments his failure as Sandy Claws and realizes it's his fault for all the suffering everyone has gone through, you realize it wasn't entirely the bad guy's fault. The ending, which includes peril, fright, and an entirely gross spewing of bugs is also a sweet realization as Jack and Sally realize their love for each other.",The Nightmare Before Christmas

509,theobservantmeerkat,A Monster Film Filled With Hair-raising Humour; Frightfully Original!,10,9 March 2006,"An animated musical marvel, ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" shows Tim Burton at his best. This mock horror promises mischief and monsters with just a hint of romance (but unlike the pumpkins, your laughter will not be hollow). Between the original musical pieces and the captivating storyline of kidnapping Christmas, this film is a real treat, trust me, this is not a trick. After Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, has filled the inhabitants of Halloweentown with as much fright as is inhumanly possible, he finds himself growing frustrated with the sameness of the fearful events that occur year after year. Whilst feeling dreadfully downtrodden with boredom, Jack takes his dog Zero for a walk in the woods surrounding Halloweentown and discovers the joys of Christmas. When he returns to Halloweentown he shares his discovery with the occupants and the literally two-faced mayor decides that having Christmas instead of Halloween would be fun. In his preparations for Christmas Jack seeks the help of a young woman called Sally, who was created by the local genius, Dr. Finkelstein, to make his costume. She tries to warn Jack that his Christmas will turn to disaster. But, as you have probably guessed, he takes no notice. Once Santa was out of the way, Jack took flight on an adventure to bring the world his Christmas. However, if you haven't already foreseen it, everything goes horrifically wrong! Jack finds that his Christmas is not all fun and games. Meanwhile, Santa is fighting for his life back in Halloweentown; can Jack get back in time to save Christmas?A lot of holiday films seem to annoy me, as they are either too sickly-sweet or full of obvious comedy, which gets boring after a while. So, if like me, you tire of watching the same Christmas films time and time again, then ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is definitely the film for you! The contrast of the fun of Christmas and the fright of Halloween are cleverly joined in this ghoulish original from Tim Burton. Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon's Jack is a hilariously terrifying character who seems to have good intentions but his dream of Christmas is ruined because he was made to be mean, he's just not cut out for all the fun and games of Christmas. The characters created by Burton are all horrifying in their own particular way, yet they are also somewhat quirky at the same time.",The Nightmare Before Christmas
