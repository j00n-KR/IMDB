0,classicsoncall,"""It will be quite an uphill battle.""",8,9 November 2021,"There's some serious upvoting for this film here on IMDb; if not for a weighted averaging of the film's rating by viewers, this would be the number one movie of all time having just come out this year, and that by a wide margin. I thought the movie was good for it's portrayal of corrupt authorities taken down by a dedicated attorney, it hit on many of the points that social justice advocates clamor for here in this country. Based on a true story, one can only marvel at the dedication of a man like Chandru (Suriya), who utilized every bit of means and cunning to humiliate the brutal police authorities and their corrupt political allies. Many times it's a difficult story to watch, as the beatings and punishment doled out by district police against members of lower castes approach grotesquely inhuman treatment. Chandru's efforts eventually pay off, and it was inspiring to see him honored by the citizens he represented at the finale, reminiscent of that final scene of Gregory Peck in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".One note of caution when coming to the IMDb title page - the names of characters listed in the credits don't match the corresponding identification of characters in the film. As an example, actress Lijo Mol Jose portrayed the agonized wife Sengoni in the credits, but in the film, captioning described her as 'Sannamma'. I'm not versed well enough in Indian nomenclature to know if that's a result of translation or some other factor. I would also question the narrative offered at the end of the story that stated the attorney portrayed in the picture was responsible for ninety six thousand cases in six years. To do that, he would have to have been involved with over forty cases per day, every day for six years, with no days off!",Jai Bhim
1,SAMTHEBESTEST,Jai Bhim's subject is too extraordinary to be handled by such ordinary execution but Suriya's power-packed performance makes it a worth watch.,6,2 November 2021,"Jai Bhim (2021) :
Movie Review -Tamil Cinema has brought some really good films this year. Not just good but meaningful ones. Films like 'Pebbles', 'Mandela' and 'Karnan' have brought major social issues into spotlight. Director T. J. Gnanavel's latest offering 'Jai Bhim' is another superb addition in the list. However, it's like a stone turned into Silver when it could have been Gold, if wanted. Jai Bhim attempts a very sensitive issue in a hard hitting narrative but while doing so, it misses a few things that could have made it a Sensational Film. Anyways, it's a great one time watch and surely does some much needed hammering on ""The System"".Based on a true incident in 1993, the film follows Sengani (Lijomol Jose) and Rajakannu (K. Manikandan), a couple from the Irular tribe. The latter is convicted by the police due, and later goes missing from the police station. Senggeni seeks the help of an advocate Chandru (Suriya) to seek justice for her husband. It's not a fight between low caste and high caste or corrupt police officers, but it's a fight against the entire system. When the first born of the lands are treated like slaves, your blood surely boils but what can these low grade people do against highly influential people? Law is same for all and that's the biggest weapon they have. Jai Bhim is too disturbing and devastating at moments. Some scenes in the film are unbearable (for weak hearted) but because its storyline demands the same uncompromised vision, you don't get a chance to point a finger at it.The performance of Suriya is the biggest reason why this film can be recommended to everyone. Supporting him, Prakash Raj, K. Manikandan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh, Rajisha Vijayan and M. S. Bhaskar put out their best in their individual roles. The entire acting unit in Jai Bhim is commendable. Talking about the flaws, the film fails to remain steady throughout the narrative. This entire thing takes 164 minutes to wrap up the same old Ambedkar-oriented stuff, why? That grip over the content is not tight enough to hold such a socially important topic.When it comes to the positives, one has to mention the writer first. Gnanavel's on-paper draft is astonishing and eye-opening stuff. Sadly, his direction is not upto the mark as required but it's fairly decent. In some scenes, you just can't stop loving his directorial skills. For instance, whenever there's Suriya on the screen thinking of something, you hear that intense background music which creates that atmosphere around you. Those speeches on morals, fundamental rights and equality will end up with your claps. Unfortunately, some scenes have been dragged for no reason and over-dramatized for the sake emotional quotient. Also, the predictable nature of the script is too typical. It works sometimes because you cannot bear seeing those brutal and painful scenes of obscene tyranny. Excluding couple of mistakes done by the director, nothing seems to bother too much. Jai Bhim has an extraordinary story to tell, which deserves your viewing but it gets an ordinary vision to showcase it on screen. Had it been taken care of, Jai Bhim would have been a nationwide sensation.RATING - 6.5/10*",Jai Bhim
2,santhosh-10290,Jai Bhim,10,2 November 2021,Excellent Movie. Everybody acted well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie were excellent. The movie was so interesting and thrilling. This is the Best Tamil Movie of 2021. Excellent Movie.,Jai Bhim
3,arungeorge13,Suriya & Co. deliver a hard-hitting social issue drama! [+73%],7,2 November 2021,"It's always nice to see a star like Suriya move away from a typical masala flick for Diwali and come up with a hard-hitting courtroom drama based on actual events. In the film, he is more of a tool that helps enact justice for the oppressed victims. There's no showy entry, songs that praise him to the skies, or stock heroines who exist only to admire him. Instead, the film focuses more on the tribal characters played by Manikandan and Lijomol (both excellent) and the series of unfortunate events that they go through.Police brutality has been a sensitive topic, touched upon by very few films and filmmakers, even when we keep hearing several such cases in the news. Films like Visaranai and Karnan paved the way for TJ Gnanavel's Jai Bhim to tell a harrowing social issue without the need to be preachy. Jai Bhim's first hour is a somewhat disturbing watch, with the cries of the oppressed both tugging at your heartstrings and coming across as slightly amplified. There's no subtlety at play. The punches are wholly felt, the screams are heard loud and clear. If you still don't, Sean Roldan's woeful score will drive the point home.But the film gets infinitely better in its final hour. While the finale isn't exactly unpredictable, the journey of getting there is riveting. Both Suriya and Prakash Raj deliver the goods gracefully - not for once, getting in our faces with loud monologues. At a length of 2h 45m, Jai Bhim works due to its performances and topical relevance. Glad that a mainstream audience gets to see it on OTT.",Jai Bhim
4,ketgup83,"Do Yourself A Favor, Leave Everything And Watch Suriya's Hard-Hitting Drama",8,7 November 2021,"Jai Bhim turned out to be a hard-hitting, raw and powerful court-room drama. The purpose of cinema is not just to entertain but also educate and empower the audience. The courtroom drama based movies are always engaging as the prosecutor and defendant both fight to solve the case with solid evidences and innumerable witnesses.Bollywood Films like ""Damini"", ""Jolly LLB"",""Talvar"" ""Rustom"", ""Pink"" or even ""Section 375"" have been immensely successful in keeping the audience engaged with impeccable dialogues and fantastic screenplay but what makes Jai Bhim different is the beautiful message on morality and equality of a tribal woman who fights for the justice of her husband.Jai Bhim is based on 1995 Habeas Corpus petition in which human right activist cum lawyer K. Chandru ( played by Suriya ), who takes up the case of Irular tribe couple (Rajakannu and Sengeni) where the husband is wrongly convicted by local police for stealing ornaments from village head's house.As Jai Bhim opens, we see that cops segregating the prisoners based on their caste. Among all the caste, the tribal people becomes the easy target for the cops to clear the pending cases under the influence of their political head. We also see how Rajakannu, the main accused in the jewelry case, is forcibly taken away from his family. The film goes back in the flashback mode where life of the tribal couple is beautiful in the serene village where they hone the skills of catching rat for their bosses. As their life progresses, in one of the event Rajakannu and his brothers are caught for the crime which they did not commit. They go through extreme level of police harassment and torture which will be very hard to digest and is completely raw. Enter Chandra a.k.a Suriya who takes up the case when Sengeni narrates the entire incident and request to help find her husband who as per police, has been absconding from the jail.Jai Bhim is one such hair-raising film which is definitely difficult to digest as it gives you goosebumps and eye-popping experience. Screenplay is the hero with nail-biting moments. Art direction is fine while Cinematography is excellent. Suriya is a knight in shining armor. Watch out for him in the second half when he questions the witnesses in the courtroom. It is unforgettable performance which should be lauded for its sheer brilliance. Among the actors - Manikandan and Lijomol Jose are mind-blowing with their natural performances. Prakash Raj does well as IG.Jai Bhim is an experience that needs to be lauded for its impeccable direction, electrifying performances and beautiful message. Excellent 4/5.",Jai Bhim
5,akshatmahajan,South Indian Industry is rocking,8,7 November 2021,"This movie is much needed movie which raises questions on police, custody murders and casteism. Nowadays, South India Cinema is giving us much better movies than bollywood.Story was good, pacing and execution was also good but could have been little bit better, acting was also good (nothing looked fake or forced). Not adding songs in the movie was best choice, that could have ruined the movie. This movie was different than bollywood's legal case stories which have masala, songs and overacting.Overall, will recommend this to everyone. You must give it a try.",Jai Bhim
6,sriramthestranger,Predictable but engaging!,8,7 November 2021,"The movie is predictable in many scenes but still the performance of Surya and the music keeps us engaged throughout. The characters portrayed are highly one-dimensional except Prakash Raj. That is the major flaw of the movie unlike Visaranai, where Vetrimaran's characters and story was much much better than this one. Good watch neverthless!",Jai Bhim

RECOMMENDEDTribal life and their rights are cleverly delivered...at some point i forgot that i am watching movie and seeing their pain in real. The cast and locations are so real...The court room drama and the flashbacks are well balanced and at end credits makes the awe...
Kudos to Jo and Surya for producing this movie... At any point this movie could become a documentary, but director brilliantly maintained the mainstream movie entertainment throughout the story telling.... Another big advantage is that you will never feel the preaching/advising tone and it is not biased.It delivers the same pain and feeling of the movie ""Visaranai""....

9,nidhunmoviebuff,A hard-hitting courtroom drama on custodial violence!,8,2 November 2021,"Despite being over 2 hours and 45 minutes long, 'Jai Bhim' is an engaging, thoroughly entertaining watch backed by an astonishing real life story of custodial violence, police cover-ups and systemic corruption.Suriya plays a crusading lawyer, hell bent on revealing the truth behind three Irular (Scheduled Tribe) men who go missing while being in police custody.The superstar turns in an impeccable performance as he fastidiously chips away at the truth, only to discover layer upon layer of lies, caste hatred and cruelty.Despite having a big name star at his disposal, director T. J. Gnanavel deserves praise for letting the story take the driver's seat, never reducing to unnecessary 'massy' sequences or masala elements to drive the narrative forward.Lijimol Jose as the wife of Rajakannu (played by Manikandan) is an absolute force of nature in her role, delivering some of the best sequences in the film, turning in a performance a veteran would be proud of.Prakash Raj as usual excels in a supporting role while and Rajisha Vijayan had precious little screen time to make any sizeable impact.The music from Seal Roldan played very significant role, helping the audience to feel the pain of the beleaguered protagonists in the beginning and that of vindication and righteousness towards the climax.Jai Bhim does not rise up to the emotional highs of previous classic dramas based on custodial violence like Visaranai (2015) or Naandhi (2021) but is an immensely engrossing watch. Recommended!",Jai Bhim
10,rahul000994,"Suriya's Jai Bhim Deserves To Get An Oscar Award For The Best Movie, And Suriya Deserves To Get The Best Actor Award !!!",10,3 November 2021,"In a scene in Jai Bhim, a group of tribals man meet a police office who is heading an inquiry commission about the disappearance of three missing tribals who were being interrogated by the police about a theft case. One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school. These people are clearly damned if they did, and damned if they didn't.This scene is an echo of the scene that opens the film. We see many prisoners being let out of prison. A few cops from the surrounding police stations are waiting. As each prisoner comes out, he is asked for his caste. If they mention a dominant caste's name, they are asked to leave. But those who belong to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, they are told to stand in a corner, only for the waiting cops to pick them up as suspects in the many cases that remain unsolved in their station. When some of them complain that there are too few for them to foist cases on, they are told that they could accuses a few of committing more than one crime.With scenes like these, Jai Bhim powerfully captures the abuse and humiliation that is heaped upon the underprivileged by those in power and the kind of defiance it will take to get them justice. Like Visaaranai and the recent Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, the film is also a fierce criticism of police brutality. The plot revolves around Rajakannu (Manikandan) and Sengani (Lijomol Jose), a couple who live at Konamalai near Viluppuram. They belong to the Irular tribe, and despite their poverty - they still cannot afford a brick house - they are contented and happy. Especially with their daughter Alli going to school and a second child on its way.But their happiness is dashed when cops come in search of Rajakannu over a robbery. The poor man has become the main suspect just because he happened to be the one who had visited the house where the robbery happened that day to catch a snake. Unable to find him, the police pick up the pregnant Sengani and a few other men from the tribe, including Rajakannu's brother Irutappan. Sengani is later let go - not before being beaten and kicked multiple times - but for Rajakannu and a couple of others, there is no respite from the harrowing violence unleashed upon by the men in khakhi. When Sengani hears that the three men have escaped and their whereabouts unknown, she reached out to Chandru (Suriya), a righteous lawyer who fights for the downtrodden. But can they uncover the truth with an entire system standing against them?Jai Bhim is an unexpected sophomore effort from TJ Gnanavel, who had previously directed the uneven drama Kootathil Oruvan. This is a film that is raw, real and brutal, with gritty filmmaking enhancing the solid writing. It effectively portrays the wrongs that are done to the underprivileged without seeming exploitative or overly melodramatic. Despite being one of the oldest communities in the country, these tribes do not even have any proof to show that they are its citizens and cannot even own a piece of the land. When Mythra (Rajisha Vijayan), a teacher who is part of an adult literacy programme, tries to get them a voter id, the local big shot, who belongs to a dominant caste, retorts, ""Isn't it enough we have to request the lower castes to vote for us? Should we also go to the homes of these fellows?""Gnanavel gives us some terrific moments of defiance. Lijomol Jose is quietly powerful as Sengani, who gets a couple of rousing scenes when she turns down efforts at a compromise from cops. Manikandan, too, is effective and stands out in the scene when he urges his men to not give in as that will result in their community being branded as criminals. The director also portrays the intimacy between Sengani and Rajakannu in a charming manner.The film is based on a real-life incident involving Justice K Chandru, from his days as a lawyer. Suriya plays this role with the right amount of intensity and earnestness, which helps the character seem grounded even while the film and Sean Roldan's score try to build him up as a can-do-no-wrong superhero. In fact, his introduction scene wouldn't be out of place in a masala movie. But after Soorarai Pottru, this is another notable film for the star as a performer.And his scenes with Prakash Raj, who plays the inquiry commission head, Perumalsamy, give us calm and composed dialogue that act as a counterpoint to the flinching violence and the moving melodrama. The latter lends the role with a great deal of dignity to a character who believes one has to take up a little bit of authoritarianism to protect democracy. So, we have a lawyer who considers the police as the worst and a cop who finds lawyers the worst working together to ensure justice is done. Through these scenes, Gnanavel - as one of the judges in the film mentions - shows how justice can be upheld when law and order work hand in hand.There are only a couple of missteps. After a point, the violence begins to feel like torture porn, even though the film presents these episodes as flashbacks of events that happened over a day or two. And in a narrative sense, Chandru's efforts to unravel the mystery and his battle in court feels somewhat easier because there are no strong antagonists. Both Rao Ramesh as the advocate general and Guru Somasundaram as the public prosecutor never come across as formidable foes for Chandru in court. That said, as Chandru unravels one cover-up after another, the film makes us realise the extent to which unchecked power can go to maintain status quo.But these doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the film, which, along with films like Visaaranai, Kirumi and Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, is a much-needed antidote to restore the balance in portrayals of the police in an industry overrun by the Singams and the Saamys.",Jai Bhim
11,magadalwarmayur,What a great film,10,2 November 2021,I'm not a native tamil speaker but I had seen the film trailer which had intrigued me.This film is what I call raw hitting. It hits where it hurts the cast did a great job the casting director did better job of finding such cast.The direction of this film is very grounded it never feels like cliche so does the acting of all cast member.The cinematography of the Film is very simple which gives it more of an indie film vibe .As an Indian you should definitely watch this film because I haven't seen more important film than this in a decade.,Jai Bhim
12,isaacsundaralingam,This movie is an hour too long,6,4 November 2021,"I just don't understand why this movie gets the love it does. This just feels like a diluted ""Visaranai"", with nothing new to say to the audience. The story progresses in snail's pace and it's oh so predictable and cliche. Yes, I get it, it's based on a true story, but what matters in cinema is not what the story is, but how it is presented.Jai Bhim isn't by any account a bad movie. I think it's a decent one. But like literally every legal drama movie ever made in Tamil cinema, it falls victim to overestimating its appeal. Do we really need the exaggerated slow-mo's, the over dramatic profiles and the intrusively annoying musical numbers to have effectively told this story?The worst part about this movie is its characters. They lack an enormous amount of depth. I still wonder why the character of M S Baskhar even existed in the movie, if not to annoy us with literally every word he says, effectively bogging the movie down with him. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy and think he's an amazing actor, but he was so poorly written overall in this movie. And that is true for Suriya as well. The character has nothing to set him apart from what you might expect from an exaggerated ""goody"" lawyer.The movie is 160-something minutes long. That is a painstakingly long time to have to sit through a movie with so little substance. If they had cut down on everything they thought would make it a commercial movie, and had stuck with only the meat of it, they could have made it into an amazing 90-100 minute experience of high spirits and emotions. But no, you just had to drag it for as long as you did.I don't hate the movie, if not for feeling like it wasted one extra hour of my attention it deserved to have. It's at least a decent one, but nothing close to the amount of praise it gets. But hey, I'm in the minority here, so who knows...",Jai Bhim
13,TreeFiddy53,"Brilliant, hard-hitting & a must watch.",8,2 November 2021,"Turns out, the movie is based on a real-life incident from 1993.In times when being a policeman is mostly glorified in Indian cinema, I wasn't expecting a movie about police brutality, something that's usually swept under the rugs, which makes this an important film in Tamil film industry and thanks to streaming services, in Indian Cinema.The storytelling does a great job of making you care enough for Rajakannu and Sengani (both brilliantly played, with Lijomol being the show stealer in this movie) that you empathize with them throughout the movie. Parts of the movie were brutal and hard to watch, don't be surprised if you find yourself shouting ""Okay that's enough! STOP!"" at the events that unfold. Suriya and Prakash Raj play their respective roles with just enough intensity, nothing over the top with this one. Acting by all of the support cast was very well done.As much as this film is about police brutality, this is also about casteism, which is still prevalent in our great country. Movies, both good and bad ones, in the past on this topic have been made, but you can tell if the script is trying too hard to highlight the caste system. This one, I thought, did it just right and didn't overdo it.If you HAVE to, you can find things wrong with the movie - some cinematic liberty, the ""comedic"" elements, some ""mass moments"", were all necessary IMO. That said, this isn't the kind of movie you find flaws in, but the kind that you watch, and learn and grown from as a person. So, I'd request that you simply appreciate the filmmaking, empathize with the characters and learn a thing or two takeaways for real life.",Jai Bhim

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐9/10
What a week, my love for movies got me.Two 9 star rated in a single week.God bless me .Jai Bhim is one of the most powerful movies I have watched , it's pungent , It's emotional it's a war between a state and a women who is determined for justice , and God send help , in form of a lawyer with a heart .Leave alone the whole movies, we can just pay for a couple of secnes and the meaning in them . I don't know what amazon paid but , this is rated at 9.7 in IMDB with over 30k ratings, what ever it is , they hit a jack pot.But why not in theatres , why not? , I don't mind OTT, bussiness but when I am unable to watch India's top rated movie in a theatre , it's injustice.@actorsuriya , it's criminal not releasing it on the Big screen.Finally .All men/Women are born and created equal no matter to whome and where they are born.Everyone is the same in the eyes of law, be it a king or the sweeper .#jaibhim

In the era of SQUID GAME and Suryavanshi fantasies, we need such real life stories. I feel so much guilty that we are still carrying the burden of this 2500 years old rotten caste system where our fellow human beings are still treated worse than animals. As if the actors have not acted, it feels like I am watching CCTV footage! There is minimal heroism, maximum expression. There is not much court room drama, still the pace of the story is intense. The police and system which were supposed to protect us, provide everybody equal rights for survival, in reality literally killing people based on their surnames!!! :-( This movie based on a real life story on tribal rights made me sad, this movie made me hopeful too! Hats Off to all the Actor-Director-Story Writers and entire crew members. 10/10.",Jai Bhim

43,manojmanpal,Very well directed movie,9,5 November 2021,Movie has a message based on true hero with fictional elements added. Surya as an actor acted above par and his acting is far better than soorarai pottru.At initial half I felt director has little exaggerated with respect to police dropping back sengini where pariyerum perumal showed in simplistic and non biased way.Overall a must watch movie with as - truth always triumphs.,Jai Bhim

65,airjordanyk,A riveting and raw legal drama with mind-blowing performances from Suriya and Lijumol,10,2 November 2021,"Director Gnanavel captures the raw nature of police brutality with a high degree of realism, and every scene was emotionally charged. Suriya brings another firebrand performance after SP, and delivers with his impeccable dialogue delivery and mannerism. I'm glad they didn't add any unnecessary mass/commercial scenes just because it is a Suriya film, and even the songs went along with the story instead destroying the pace. Another important mention is Lijomol Jose's performance as the Irular women who nailed it in every scene.If I had to nitpick some minor negatives in the movie. It would be the antagonists. While they did a satisfactory job, perhaps having a more intelligent lawyer to counter Suriya would have added to more intensity, however this barely impacts the film. The runtime could have also been shortened by 10-15 minutes.Jai Bhim is a fantastic movie and frankly I was more emotionally moved by it than Soorarai Pottru. The movie is an eye-opener to police brutality, but isn't over the top in its police bashing either. Instead it provides nuanced perspectives from well-meaning police officers (pay attention to Prakash Raj's role) in an attempt to support a more just legal system.Rating: 9.5/10.",Jai Bhim

Really can't imagine how tribal people were treated by the police and society . Most of the scenes were disturbing , especially Police brutality towards tribes . After Visaranai this movie majorly spoke about Police brutality . I think director done good background work on this case . Movie was not only disturbing , also interesting too , investigation sequence were very well handled . Dialogue writing was also great support to the movie hard-hitting and thought provoking dialogues . Sengani character was the highlight of the movie , Lijo Jose very well performed in that role . Suriya's performance and dialogue delivery were awesome , Prakash Raj very well supported . Manikandan had less screentime but gave a very good performance . Every cast done their job . Technical team work was good , especially makeup artists and art work . Cinematography was good . Sean Roldan music was mind blowing . Only negative I felt bit lag in few places .

69,sreejithkaimal,Excruciating tale of cruelty,4,8 November 2021,"The movie is excellent & appreciate the effort, however it's high time Indian movies stop encouraging the tell-tales of the past suffering. It sets a bad precedence on the international stage.The bad behavior of police was inherited from the British and it continues to exist, yet there are some good policemen who continue to uphold Justice. I would say Prakash-Raj was the hero of the movie and yet all attention was on Surya. There are some really unbearable scenes in the movie that could have been replaced with suggestions on how system could have handled it better. This was success only because it was on streaming, if it was released in theaters it would have had another story to tell.",Jai Bhim

91,samrendra1263,"Propaganda film to demean vanniaar community,",1,9 November 2021,"The movie is based on real-life incident that took place in Tamil Nadu in the 1990s, where a lawyer fought to get justice for a tribal woman. But viewers have alleged that the makers of the movie have deceitfully changed castes of certain characters to perpetuate their political propaganda.For instance, the movie shows villains from the Vanniyar community with their sacred motif 'Agni' being situated in the frame. The sub-inspector in the movie, who is one of the villains, is a man from the Vanniyar community and depicted as an enemy of the Irular community. However, in reality, the sub-inspector who framed the Irular men and thrashed them was one 'Anthony Sami' and was not from the Vanniyar community.This has predictably not gone down well with the Vanniyars, who have shamed actor Suriya and makers of the movie for the unwarranted vilification of their community.In another scene in the movie, actor Suriya could be seen spreading canards about the Brahmin community. The scene is from outside the court where actor MS Bhaskar, as a Brahmin lawyer (Sankaran) who often utters 'Sivaya Namaha', is seen speaking with Suriya. In the exchanges that take place between the two, it is insinuated that Brahmins are a vile community that cannot be trusted.",Jai Bhim

Unbelievable situation in free India; tribal minority have no human rights - it truth they don't exist (no legal documents, education or rights).Suriya is superb and supported by superlative support cast, in particular Lijo Mol Jose (as Sengoni).; she excels in details.Mr Gnanavel (writer and Director) sets us with real world examples of treatment of tribals by upper cast society members (verbal, physical,emotional) and equally allows time to share their simple dreams (home, family, education) of those forgotten.It will force you to rethink on priorities and cherish contributions of one Mr Chandru who went beyond the cause and impacted 96,000 cases and transformed life of hundreds and thousands of tribals.",Jai Bhim

I must say these real life inspired movies are really helping his cause providing fodder for his immense acting talent. Although communal oppression and custodial violence has been portrayed in several films before, it is the raw treatment which sets this film apart. The guy who acted as Samikannu literally must be awarded an Oscar for all the abuse he took onscreen. His spouse just lived the role with her great natural acting.

122,giridhargopinath,Decent Cinematic venture which is a good entertainer despite the shortcomings,8,7 November 2021,"I went into the film with a pre-existing judgement that it will be a very preachy unoriginal story relying on identity politics and though I can't say I was completely proved wrong,I have to admit that I did enjoy the film well.'Jai Bhim' has a very boring unoriginal first act and a short second act and has a very black-or-white approach with only three class of humans:The Oppressors,The Opressed and The Savior. The real world never works that way and there needs to be a lot more nuance in depicting an issue of such magnitude. When I said three classes,I meant that those belonging to any label has no other personality trait other than being Extremely Evil,Extremely helpless or Extremely Virtuous. This type of apporach would work well for a film like 'Karnan' which has a very dreamy,mythical and fairy-tale approach,a reason why the film is so great. But for a film like 'Jai Bhim' which is supposed to be grounded in reality and only having slight dramatization,this falls flat and feels very ""rubbing it on the face"".But after the first 1/3 rd,the film becomes a very entertaining court-room thriller despite its dramatisations and takes a more nuanced approach to the issue and its depiction even though 'The Saviour' character of Surya still remains an unrealistically holy and virtuous persona.The final act where justice is served was satisfying and brought this entertainer to a decent end. However the film could have made some effort to show that the actual trial which the film is based on actually took years to reach its final verdict instead in the film it feels like everything became well and fine within a couple of months which in the harsh and cruel reality of the Indian Judiciary,never happensSurya,who now has matured as an actor gives a very decent performance with just enough drama to make it entertaining while not over-doing it to the point of meladroma. Lijomol Jose gives her career-best performance though I found the use of black-face to be slightly offensive.The digital cinematography is just ok and does not have much signifance as this is heavily plot driven. I did see some fan theories of hidden symbolism. Editing was good. An odd thing about this script and screenplay is that it feels like it was written by two different people. It is clumsy,unrealistic and rushed in the first third while the rest two thirds is solid and straight. The score and songs of this film was really magnificent.It is the turn which the film takes after the second act which made me give 8 stars instead of 7 while it is the overall clumsiness which prevents me from giving this 9.In essence,a decent cinematic work with high ambitions and low execution but which offers good entertainment.",Jai Bhim
123,grafixplanner,A good movie with lots of plot holes,6,3 November 2021,A good movie with lots of plot holes.I can't describe in single review. For example HQ judges remain all 3 police officers on dudy after knowing thay lie in HQ twice.,Jai Bhim
124,tapanmozumdar,"For the people, of the people, by the elite",8,6 November 2021,"Where I lived in Patna, a community called Mushahar lived around us. Shriek cries of pigs being hunted and skinned, their catch of field rats and squirrels that they displayed, their habitat and drunken squabbles bothered our middle-class sensibilities a lot. Even in those urban surroundings, we were all told to take care of our belongings from these nomadic urchins. 'Jai Bhim' took me back to those personal memories and showed me a mirror of ignorance and insensitivity towards these marginal communities.The film's pitch is set to the populist tunes and though there is no fight sequence with the hero, the background music, gestures of the 'star', the camera angles - they all build up the hero worship Tamilnadu is so much known for. Personally, I feel an actor like Vijay Sethupati would have brought more layers to the protagonist's character. Suriya, even in this author backed role, seemed much of a star and less of a seasoned lawyer. Prakash Raj too was routine.The real 'hero' of the film is Lijomol Jose's Sengeni. Her physical acting and lack of expressions while helpless will haunt a sensitive viewer for long. Just that they had to blacken an otherwise fair actress for a role hurts me a bit. Same as Suriya, I think a naturally deglamorized actress would have been fitter for the film.Manikandan's Rajakannu, Rajendran's Mosakutty, Tamizh as SI Gurumurthy - and the rest of the cast bring to life the daily day toils, joys and sorrows of the incidents and characters.It is a difficult film to watch. The torture scenes should have come with a warning for the mentally not so strong people. If it gets so disturbing at times to watch, I can't begin to imagine how difficult the lives of such marginal communities actually are.The movie could have done with some editing. Even without the melodrama creating background music, the film would have remained as effective. I think the film could have opened with Sengeni waiting to meet Advocate Chandru and the rest could have unfolded gradually. Narration through flashback, as a trope, has not been well exploited in this film.This is a necessary film. The sage Ramakrishna Paramhansa had said, ""Theatre educates the masses"", and the same can be said about this film.Just to document the plight of the marginal tribes who struggle every day to prove their existence despite their skills and demanding work could have given the film much credence. That the director has attempted to do so within the parameters of popular cinema makes it even more creditable. Gnanavel seems deft in handling the scenes depicting the masses. Where he had to blend the same with the matinee icon's charisma, there are a few hiccups.I have given an extra star in the review just due to the boldness of the makes and Prime Videos to let this film happen. Though set at a pitch a tad higher than necessary, the film delivers the message home.To conclude, the medium of cinema, an OTT channel and a viewer like me who is privileged to use internet and a holiday to watch make me write the caption of this review. This cinema remains as a peep into the masses through an elitist binocular.",Jai Bhim

162,cntrvl,Irrelevant is the word,5,5 November 2021,"My 2, sorry 10 cents -
1. 3 men are caught by police for a crime they did not commit. Yes - the director believed Indian audience has never see this before
2. They r tortured to confess the crime and during 3rd degree one dies. Trust me - it's not from crime patrol or savdhan india . It's from the highest rated movie on IMDB.3. The police is torturing them coz they are in poverty and living a life too low to protest. But this fact does not suite agenda so let's introduce caste.4. Here comes a cool-dude-version of Ambedkar who believes Ambedkar must be kept at par with Gandhi and Nehru. Not sure how many nanoseconds Mr Ambedkar passed in jail. With all due respect he has a reserved place for him in history. What does this question mean in movie is beyond human know abilities.5. Judges are shown in such a poor light that almost all witnesses from defence lie million times but they just excuse them with a funny face. Reality is that lying in court is contempt of court + damaging the credibility of entire case from the perspective of the accused7. Courtroom drama is presented in a very non-dramatic environment. Director fails miserably to make it look real. Who on the earth will believe the logic presented in the court?8. The entire story gets a positive end because of few key people - the doctor, the booth guy and the officer(Prakash raj). They all have been shown to belong to community of the accused. Still the hatred narrative is set against the community of accused.9. Lastly, the title - Jai Bhim ? Seriously ? It's a political slogan of a political party. You guys seriously wanted us to believe that the movie wanted to be justifiable and appreciable despite being politically motivated so much so that it's titled on a political slogan. Are we really jokers?10. Scan your own friend list and see how many people from these categories are there . Ask yourself - did you personally misbehaved with them for their cast?? No! Then who r these people wanting to make you believe that you have been brutal towards certain cast and communities .",Jai Bhim

Just by birth in such a tribe you will be proclaimed as criminal... So even after 70 yrs of independence, people are still stigmatized. Law commison has made a detaildd report on this. You should go before that..somewhere something got stolen, they randomly pick any such memeber of a such a tribe and put into jail, case over....

194,architectddeepika,🎦Jai Bhim 2021 Review 🎦,9,2 November 2021,"One of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of ""Visaranai"", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or ""mass""components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim! Cheers!Original Content By Ar Deepika Dhilip.",Jai Bhim
195,brianmwewa,The BEST,10,6 November 2021,"It has been a long time since I saw a well calculated piece of work like this, Jai Bhim is full of emotions which is good and actor knew their rolls greatly, thank you India this piece, I salute you keep up the good work 🇮🇳.

198,taxfreeknight,A good movie with plenty of noise pollution .,8,8 November 2021,"As with most good South movie , it is spoiled by too many unwanted noises created by the casts . I found it unbearably irritating the way the women in the movie , especially the wife of the victim cries in every scene unnecessarily. Tears are effective on screen when they are shown only when necessary , making it occur every second scene , combined with lots of wailing and bawling , just diminishes its effectiveness in garnering sympathy . If fact every time she started wailing I hoped the cop would shut her up . Maybe, it's only in the Hindi dubbed version that all these unnecessary loud noises are shown and not in its original format. But all the same a good movie was ruined by some very unwanted overacting by its female casts and a few male cast as well , like the short guy in the lock up as well as in the end at the court .what any guy in court would have given his statement in a normal and controlled manner , this fellow was overflowing with mile long tears and wailing with more unwanted noises .When he was doing his teary acts , I so wanted the cop or anyone in the movie to just kill him too , just to shut his bawling .It was that unbearable. Why couldn't the director make it more realistic and less melodramatic like rest of the movie ? Would have been well deserving the fantastic IMBD ratings had it not been for these stupid melodramas and sound pollutions . Having said that , the movie was an out an out entertaining movie and thoroughly captivating .",Jai Bhim

How he also did his job & do protest at a same time. Maithra & #ParkashRaj also did better. Some critics & buffs will say spoiling a police image but at a same time director also shows I. G Perumal as a honest police officer.Remember the Mulk ( secularism controversy ) at a same time. This is the 2nd court hearing I love the most. (Atrocities on Tribal & below cast ) some scene are intolerable ( beaten scene of pregnant women & police kick on her husband's chest) like #Paatallok rape scene was. Pre production work for collection & study of evidences was superb. Finally that lady got Justice with truth but without her husband's life.The beauty was
1. When she tells a lie to convict's lawyer ( surya) & He denny to pursue the case because he already mentioned everything he wants with truth.2. when police jeep follow & drop her into her villageAs always Tamil & Malyalam cinema doing a great from a while.Sayings from #JaiBheemLaw is a an important weapon : what matters how we use it. ❤To save our public ,sometimes we need to take law in our hands. ❤My score 8.5/10#jaibBheem #amazonprimevideo #ActorSurya #PrakashRaj #filmreview #tamilcinema #filmbuffs #tollywood #loveforcinema #OTTIndia.",Jai Bhim

280,vishudhawle,REAL AND BRUTAL,9,3 November 2021,"First things first, ""Jai Bhim"" is not a commercial movie. It is a content-rich film that is anchored by a leading star. Suriya doesn't have a romantic thread, and nor does he perform an action stunt. Nearly after 30 minutes of the runtime, he makes an appearance quietly.Music, cinematography, and production design are appropriate to the theme.Coming to the HIndi dubbing part, the dialogue is poorly translated.All in all, ""Jai Bhim"" is a gripping legal drama, with good performances but has a raw approach. It might appeal to those who like documentary-like serious movies.It doesn't dare turn its back on hitting where it hurts the most.",Jai Bhim

How some people are people and how some people are property of the other people! The injustice against the tribal poor and SC and ST people is of the worst type in the history of humanity. For more than 3000 years now this has been going on and no one has risen up against this modern Indian slavery. America got divided to fight slavery. But Indians who are not impacted by this menace think that those who are suffering are joking. I belong to a higher caste but since childhood I have seen this.,Jai Bhim

Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of ""Visaranai"", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture.

318,aravindstalinroger,Engaging and emotional,10,3 November 2021,"Jai Bhim is a film of over two and half hours in duration but it doesn't feel so because of fresh and engaging screenplay. The film is more of crime suspense thriller than just courtroom drama. The visuals are stunning. The songs and background music are too good that they elevate a situation to a great extent though they act as speed breakers occasionally. There is nothing bad to say about the performances and in fact they deserve prestigious awards too. I did not find anything wrong in technical aspects of the film to my knowledge.The brutality involved in the film is too high but that is a reality which cannot be denied. I recommend elderly people having heart related issues not to watch this film as some scenes can affect them mentally. It can bring tears during raw intense scenes of beating innocent tribal people including women, severely. In short, it is a must-watch for all children and adults because the content can impact the behaviour of people by making them understand equality of all castes in this society and also digest the fact that there are still people in our country who are oppressed , weak and vulnerable with no identity.",Jai Bhim

353,girikanna,Vera level movie,10,4 November 2021,"In a scene in Jai Bhim, a group of tribals man meet a police office who is heading an inquiry commission about the disappearance of three missing tribals who were being interrogated by the police about a theft case. One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school. These people are clearly damned if they did, and damned if they didn't.This scene is an echo of the scene that opens the film. We see many prisoners being let out of prison. A few cops from the surrounding police stations are waiting. As each prisoner comes out, he is asked for his caste. If they mention a dominant caste's name, they are asked to leave. But those who belong to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, they are told to stand in a corner, only for the waiting cops to pick them up as suspects in the many cases that remain unsolved in their station. When some of them complain that there are too few for them to foist cases on, they are told that they could accuses a few of committing more than one crime.With scenes like these, Jai Bhim powerfully captures the abuse and humiliation that is heaped upon the underprivileged by those in power and the kind of defiance it will take to get them justice. Like Visaaranai and the recent Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, the film is also a fierce criticism of police brutality. The plot revolves around Rajakannu (Manikandan) and Sengani (Lijomol Jose), a couple who live at Konamalai near Viluppuram. They belong to the Irular tribe, and despite their poverty - they still cannot afford a brick house - they are contented and happy. Especially with their daughter Alli going to school and a second child on its way.But their happiness is dashed when cops come in search of Rajakannu over a robbery. The poor man has become the main suspect just because he happened to be the one who had visited the house where the robbery happened that day to catch a snake. Unable to find him, the police pick up the pregnant Sengani and a few other men from the tribe, including Rajakannu's brother Irutappan. Sengani is later let go - not before being beaten and kicked multiple times - but for Rajakannu and a couple of others, there is no respite from the harrowing violence unleashed upon by the men in khakhi. When Sengani hears that the three men have escaped and their whereabouts unknown, she reached out to Chandru (Suriya), a righteous lawyer who fights for the downtrodden. But can they uncover the truth with an entire system standing against them?Jai Bhim is an unexpected sophomore effort from TJ Gnanavel, who had previously directed the uneven drama Kootathil Oruvan. This is a film that is raw, real and brutal, with gritty filmmaking enhancing the solid writing. It effectively portrays the wrongs that are done to the underprivileged without seeming exploitative or overly melodramatic. Despite being one of the oldest communities in the country, these tribes do not even have any proof to show that they are its citizens and cannot even own a piece of the land. When Mythra (Rajisha Vijayan), a teacher who is part of an adult literacy programme, tries to get them a voter id, the local big shot, who belongs to a dominant caste, retorts, ""Isn't it enough we have to request the lower castes to vote for us? Should we also go to the homes of these fellows?""Gnanavel gives us some terrific moments of defiance. Lijomol Jose is quietly powerful as Sengani, who gets a couple of rousing scenes when she turns down efforts at a compromise from cops. Manikandan, too, is effective and stands out in the scene when he urges his men to not give in as that will result in their community being branded as criminals. The director also portrays the intimacy between Sengani and Rajakannu in a charming manner.The film is based on a real-life incident involving Justice K Chandru, from his days as a lawyer. Suriya plays this role with the right amount of intensity and earnestness, which helps the character seem grounded even while the film and Sean Roldan's score try to build him up as a can-do-no-wrong superhero. In fact, his introduction scene wouldn't be out of place in a masala movie. But after Soorarai Pottru, this is another notable film for the star as a performer.And his scenes with Prakash Raj, who plays the inquiry commission head, Perumalsamy, give us calm and composed dialogue that act as a counterpoint to the flinching violence and the moving melodrama. The latter lends the role with a great deal of dignity to a character who believes one has to take up a little bit of authoritarianism to protect democracy. So, we have a lawyer who considers the police as the worst and a cop who finds lawyers the worst working together to ensure justice is done. Through these scenes, Gnanavel - as one of the judges in the film mentions - shows how justice can be upheld when law and order work hand in hand.There are only a couple of missteps. After a point, the violence begins to feel like torture porn, even though the film presents these episodes as flashbacks of events that happened over a day or two. And in a narrative sense, Chandru's efforts to unravel the mystery and his battle in court feels somewhat easier because there are no strong antagonists. Both Rao Ramesh as the advocate general and Guru Somasundaram as the public prosecutor never come across as formidable foes for Chandru in court. That said, as Chandru unravels one cover-up after another, the film makes us realise the extent to which unchecked power can go to maintain status quo.But these doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the film, which, along with films like Visaaranai, Kirumi and Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, is a much-needed antidote to restore the balance in portrayals of the police in an industry overrun by the Singams and the Saamys.",Jai Bhim

358,kinderjeet,Best movie on casteism and police brutality,10,3 November 2021,I have no words to describe how great this movie is. Though this movie is in telugu but police brutality and casteism remains same no matter in which state that brutality took place. We live in so called 21st century but nothing has changed neither the police brutality nor the casteism. The upper caste still enjoys privileges of being part of that caste and lower caste / tribals bears the harassment from upper caste plus the society. The movie is an eye opener on the casteism that still exists in our fake modern society. This country still need honest lawyers who believes in standing up for those who are denied justice and standing against who misuses the power and law. About the slapping scene where police officer slapped the person to speak in tamil I couldn't find anything offensive. Everyone is proud of their mother language and one should remember hindi is not a national language so dont impose it on everyone. Don't ruin the rational behind the movie over just one scene. The movie shows us the horrible state of this society upper caste lower caste and of course the police brutality no doubt why I still hate police so much.,Jai Bhim

399,s_arief,This is a True story that happened 26 years before. Please watch the movie and know how old generation treated people who they think as low grade,10,2 November 2021,"The screenplay the script has scenes that are required and necessary. The way it was projected to showcase the true story that happened 26 years before is pretty awesome. Everybody's acting is treat to your eyes. Sengeni character in the movie brings tears every time she appears in search of the truth behind her husband missing. Chandru as a lawyer does anything and everything legally to bring justice to Sengeni. His expressions speak. Climax scene emotions and expressions by Chandru character is awesome and makes you feel the same way he feels. Characters represented as higher grade people treat Rasakannu and Sengeni and their people very bad as if they are untouchables and low grade people. Even when they know these people are good, they won't help them or save them from Police. Lawyers who support villains have done the given job and executed it well. We get angry on why such lawyers even exist helping wrong people and encouraging them to do more. Treat every man and woman from any caste equally. Have heart and treat everybody with humanity. If people we start respecting everybody and treating others with humanity and helping needy people by means of education and employment, each and every family will definitely raise their status from Poverty to at least middle class eventually someday. I request everybody who reads my review to help somebody in need by any means you can help.",Jai Bhim

And the government, along with the entire police department, has stepped in to cover up the killings. Because, if this petition goes against the government then their dignity will be questioned.This movie can give you some ideas of how our Executive and Judiciary are governed and how the abominable acts are done by the police. Where the lawmakers are lawbreakers, then what would be the consequence? The law is divided on the basis of caste. The law has become a slave to power and money.Jai Bhim is an important film in the history of Tamil cinema. It shows how caste discrimination and injustice kill people. Jai Bhim is a film that also talks about the lack of humanity. Jai Bhim is a must-watch for its hard-hitting content and its ideologies. It's what society needs right now.Rajakannu's wife make a writ petition through a lawyer named ""Chandru"". Where they get justice. In his 30 years of career as a lawyer, he has reclaimed the rights of thousands of workers. And he did not receive a penny for all the human rights cases he fought. Later he became a judge of the Chennai court and solved ninety-six thousand cases in six years and seven months. He gave many landmark judgments as well.Good and bad people are everywhere. Not all people are good and not all are bad. Those who just have a bad idea about lawyers can watch this movie.BLAST and others vs. Bangladesh and others ['Section 54 Guidelines Case', or 'Rubel Killing Case' or 'Guidelines on Arrest and Remand Case']",Jai Bhim

Thanks for the enlightening yet gripping drama.Second thing, I wanted to talk about the controversy on a particular scene where the actor Prakash Raj, portraying the IG character, slaps a man for speaking Hindi, and asks him to speak Tamil or Telugu.Imo, there's nothing wrong in asking that person to do so. Before getting angry, please let me explain.The man clearly knew Tamil or Telugu, and was trying to mislead the police team by speaking in Hindi, as the IG didn't know Hindi. So I think it was okay for him to ask him to speak in Tamil or Telugu.The thing is, the Hindi dubbing team should've done the scene like the guy was speaking some other language like Tamil or Telugu, and the IG asking him to speak Hindi.And the director should've made sure that it was done like that.The only thing I find disturbing in this scene is the physical abuse.

603,sauravtompes,Bestest South Indian Movie Ever,10,7 November 2021,"One of the outstanding, excellent movies of hot Chocolate, hot Shot, Actor Suriya (younger Killer seems). Courtroom drama this is so thoroughly remarkable & enticing right from the start of the film. Distinctively particular, even from the first actual 5-10 minutes. Virtually from the traces of ""Visaranai"", i am getting used to the current cinematic criminal works which includes Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, those kind of thought-provoking scripts is speedy catching up as a trending inspiration for all movie makers.In his brave & ambitious attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks approximately custodial violence, police cowl-up, systemic corruption at a big level, this is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole fact and sooner or later there could be no end to the complete picture. The blame recreation is in no way ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is truely actually-brutally honest, 665ffa919c35bfa66744e335c03b7855 truth full of heart-wrenching scenes, that is certain to depart you feeling that there may be greater terrible on this international than good.Possible praise Actor Suriya for his notable megastar overall performance this is so shockingly superb, handiest to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has finished a excellent task of appearing so well & so concealed, that I simply forgot him in the procedure, being so much involved within the brilliant narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the author TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Massive spherical of applause for simple degree lovely Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this film it s center existence & the detail of suspense. Song by using Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own manner, made me sense pain and all styles of emotions in the course of the film. Other actors specifically Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his realistic acting quantities for a helping function, whilst Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and mainly okay. Manikandan who earned the merit of a unique mention. One wonders how he simply did all those ugly scenes.The director honestly has to be offered for the stupendous fulfillment of this movie which solely entertains circle of relatives audiences without relying upon masala component or ""mass""components.I'd truly watch it once more because it become primarily based on specified portrayal of proper activities & humans!Hats off to the whole solid & group, group of Jai Bhim!

The story is set in 1993. But as I was watching this story, the tragic lockup deaths of Jayraj and Bennicks in 2020 came to my mind. Police brutality is a real thing.

652,adityanarayan-86187,Jai Bhim is the best in 2021,10,6 November 2021,"One of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of ""Visaranai"", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or ""mass""components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim! Cheers! ~ Aditya Narayan.",Jai Bhim

663,ashwinichandak,360 degree view of India's social fabric,10,6 November 2021,"Rarely, movies move you to think beyond yourself loved self.Jai Bhim is one of them. It is one of those movies which unabashedly shows the plight of the tribals and that you need someone of Chandru's spirit to get justice.I would have loved a bit more about the man Chandru - as from where he got his conviction. A tight editing could have helped here.Having worked bit with tribals, I can say that they too naïve (if that is the word) to comprehend the social structure, power equations and majority wish to lead their lives with dignity and non-interference. Sadly the contrary sets in when power mongers twist and twirl to secure petty benefits. That by favoring and taking sides with power mongers one can secure a raise, a promotion.... dispels the notion that merit prevails and that it would not become a casualty in the future too...With fine actors, the movie is brutally honest and OTT serves this content well. Fancy Censor Board clearing a movie without any cuts.Overall, a gripping ~ 2.42 minutes wherein one is transported to become either a tribal or a Chandru or a honest IG to uphold and celebrate what they have done. On the other hand it also transports one to visualize one as a power mongers and how to modify ones conduct for the betterment of the society.Thank you Producers, Directors, Actors, and an array of stakeholders for sharing the story.",Jai Bhim

It's always nice to see a star like Suriya move away from a typical masala flick for Diwali and come up with a hard-hitting courtroom drama based on actual events. In the film, he is more of a tool that helps enact justice for the oppressed victims. There's no showy entry, songs that praise him to the skies, or stock heroines who exist only to admire him. Instead, the film focuses more on the tribal characters played by Manikandan and Lijomol (both excellent) and the series of unfortunate events that they go through.",Jai Bhim

677,thamizhmagal,Must Watch movie!,10,2 November 2021,"A landmark movie! It was heartbreaking to see how the marginalised are brutally victimised by the mainstream, by inhuman system of caste inequality and the police brutality. Also it was so heartening to see the triumph of truth in the end thanks to a conscientious lawyer, a teacher, a social worker, judges, a police officer, communist comrades and the unwavering fighting spirit of the wife of the victim. Surya was mind-blowing as a lawyer believing in the ideologies of Dr. Ambedkar, Periyar and Marx. Hats off to the writer, director TJ Gnanavel and the producers Jyothika and Surya for making an amazing movie based on a real-life incident of the justice prevailing in support of the oppressed against the police and the state machinery championed by Justice Chandru.

Manikandan and Lijomol Jose needs a great applause for their best performance. In technical side, art director K Kathir have done a great job by taking us back to 1995. They showed us accurate detailing and kept the audience engaged throughout. It's an perfect attempt on important things that needs to be discussed on a mainstream cinema. Many film's intention will be good but it'll fail in terms of execution. Miraculous and staggering performance by Manikandan. In that police station scenes, he was marvellous. Extraordinary. Hard hitting one. Duration was lengthy one, but it's a needed one too. Most of the scenes will be so eye-trouble.

The cast and locations are so real...The court room drama and the flashbacks are well balanced and at end credits makes the awe... Kudos to Jo and Surya for producing this movie... At any point this movie could become a documentary, but director brilliantly maintained the mainstream movie entertainment throughout the story telling....

740,gopalcoolrahul,OUTSTANDING !!,10,2 November 2021,"When an issue for a rich family crop up, the police, politicians, and judicial systems stands up for them and the greatest lawyers in the country are hired to speak against them and ensure that even though guilty are released with ease. But, in the same scenario when a poor or a backward caste family are stuck around courts seeking justice everything just falls apart. Jai Bhim showcases a story about an honest lawyer who stands for such issues and about a tribal family who seeks justice for their innocence for a case that has been upheld against them.There have been many movies in the past showcasing the issues that the backward caste / tribal people go through by the injustice done by the society as if they don't exist in the normal population. They are treated as a different set of people and termed as UNTOUCHABLES.Since 2020 when OTT is on a rise, there have been multiple movies that have opted for OTT as their route and with no second thoughts Jai Bhim stands out in all the ways. Be it a thought-provoking subject, courtroom drama, people's attitude towards backward, troubles that tribal people face, and to prove that they exist in society. This reminds me of Ambedkar's fight to abolish untouchability in India which still exists in greater parts of India. This plot showcases the story based on true events revolving around a 1995 habeas corpus petition that human rights. (Fundamental right in the Constitution that protects against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment)Suriya once again proves that be it any subject, if done with conviction and honesty will reach people's hearts. His simplicity throughout shows his sincerity towards the character. The other characters in the story are apt as per the proceedings. The initial premise of 25 mins is slow as it sets the stage for the main plot and when the protagonist appears on the screen, that's when the real proceedings follow. There are no punch dialogues or any massy numbers which a regular movie-goer would expect. This is a serious subject which every section should watch and applaud for! The emotions of the tribal people are heart-wrenching (Police station episodes are raw and rustic). The logic in the proceedings never go for a toss, each and every dot connection shows the perfection while execution.To sum up, Jai Bhim proves it point of the empathy that the poor or the tribal people are looking for and this one when ends would stay in your heart for a long time! Very Well Written and executed! (Language is no barrier, Amazon Prime has released the movie in all major languages 😉)",Jai Bhim

886,anandsridhar,Hard hitting and Inspiring!,10,3 November 2021,"Please read if u have time:
it may contain plot spoilers.It has been an hour since I watched the film..
I just cant get over the film, the emotions that I am experiencing is overwhelming...I find rats disgusting.. but there is a entire community of people finding, killing and eating rats for survival..I have never set foot inside a police station ever in my life, but there is a entire community of people who are being harassed, tortured and killed to accept a crime that they have not committed.Being a young adult, the impact this film has, is nothing short of life changing..
in my opinion, students above the age of 15 should be made to watch a censored version of this movie so that they can understand the sad and true state of the society they live in and learn what equality really is.I say censored version because, students cannot handle the brutal use of police force and lockup violence in the film, I just cannot help but wonder, if we think that our children cannot handle a 2 hr long film,
imagine the plight of the children of the people getting dragged out of their homes in the middle of the night, getting stomped on their faces, their mothers getting harassed, their livelihoods getting thrown out the window in a fraction of a second.. such is the sad state of the society we live in.I don't think I can type everything that I am thinking right now in this space..I don't wish to be a critic of such a film and applaud the characters, point out the flaws if any, appreciate the technical aspects of the film.. nope.. not going to..just one word.. if u want your children to treat everyone equally and learn about humanity and mankind... watch it along with them...
after the film ends.. tell them this,every person is equal and each and every man/women deserves respect, be it the servant who work in our homes, a driver who opens the car door for you every morning, the house keeping staff that clean your school bathroom, the security anna who stands by the gate, the grandfathers and grandmothers that come to collect garbage daily from our house, the people who clean our septic tanks and drainage.. tell them that in no way they are neither beneath us nor we above them... I bet they will understand and change the society for better.Jai bhim!",Jai Bhim

Jai Bhim provides answers to the questions that have not raised for centuries in this nation full of inequality disguise under religious caste dogma. This 164 minutes movie lay bares the sanctimonious democracy that we proudly flaunt as world largest. This century old discrimination is worst of its kind while in other countries even in a lesser form had resulted in social revolutions. In the movie we hear the voice of Dr. Ambedkar, the alone crusader of social justice condemning the human discrimination had still hoped that his countrymen will one day realize if not in his life time but maybe later when the history will be reviewed unbiased and his role to established social reform would be studied as pinnacle of social revolution failed by his own countrymen. The movie title ""Jai Bhim"" which is proudly used to greet each other by lakhs of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar followers and Buddhists alike justifies the vision of the father of modern India Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar to educate, organize and agitate against any form of discrimination.",Jai Bhim

The director Gnanavel is good enough in presenting the story in an interesting manner. Suriya as Advocate Chandru,Lijomol Jose as Sengeni, manikandan as rajakannu were amazing.In my opinion a film is not just about 5 songs, 5 fights including an interval fight or twist, hero, heroine and a villain. Recent years tamil films going next level like khaki, khaidi, aakashame ne haddura, Narappa and now Jai bhim.Tnq surya sir for choosing such an wonderfull inspirational stories like Aakashame nee haddura, Jai bhim.

941,rameshtembhare,jai bhim is An eye-opening honest tale,10,4 November 2021,"Jai Bhim is honest and is focused about the brutality of the cops, caste discrimination, the pain of Irulas and how a woman stands against the system with the support of an honest advocate. The best part of Jai Bhim is the screenplay and the hard-hitting narration. The courtroom episodes are well packed. Each and every actor is too good with their performances which makes Jai Bhim a must-watch if you are fond of realistic tales. Jai Bhim sounds like an investigative thriller. Suriya's role has no elevations that a lead actor has in a South Indian film. He behaves like the other role in the film. He plays the role of an activist and an advocate who takes up issues that are ignored in the society. The drama looks narrated in detail and the custodial torture is quite brutal. The climax delivers the justice.",Jai Bhim

943,sangitaupare,Jai Bhim is realistic courtroom drama,10,5 November 2021,"Jai Bhim gets the best out of its ensemble of actors, who all turn in great performances. Suriya gives a formidable performance that is measured yet intense. Even though Chandru anchors the film, Jai Bhim truly belongs to the tribal couple Sengeni (Lijomol) and Rajakannu (Manikandan). Lijomol takes the cake with a phenomenal performance. She plays Sengeni with such a beautiful combination of dignity, innocence, and spirit that she becomes the soul of Jai Bhim. Lijomol is fantastically supported by Manikandan, who plays Rajakannu. The film also thankfully avoids forcing a romantic relationship between Chandru and Maithra (Rajisha Vijayan ). In the Tamil mainstream, the top reason to have a female character is still to play the love interest to the hero. Her importance to the story becomes less important. It is refreshing to see a star film sidestep this.",Jai Bhim

Honestly not even budget of this movie might have gone into their welfare from Government so far. Would be a miracle if 25% of allotted money is spent properly.

1041,alaminreigns,#best movie ever,10,5 November 2021,"N a scene in Jai Bhim, a group of tribals man meet a police office who is heading an inquiry commission about the disappearance of three missing tribals who were being interrogated by the police about a theft case. One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school. These people are clearly damned if they did, and damned if they didn't.This scene is an echo of the scene that opens the film. We see many prisoners being let out of prison. A few cops from the surrounding police stations are waiting. As each prisoner comes out, he is asked for his caste. If they mention a dominant caste's name, they are asked to leave. But those who belong to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, they are told to stand in a corner, only for the waiting cops to pick them up as suspects in the many cases that remain unsolved in their station. When some of them complain that there are too few for them to foist cases on, they are told that they could accuses a few of committing more than one crime.",Jai Bhim

#JaiBhimOne of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of ""Visaranai"", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.The director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or ""mass""components.I would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!Hats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim! Cheers!",Jai Bhim

Virtually from the traces of ""Visaranai"", i am getting used to the current cinematic criminal works which includes Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, those kind of thought-provoking scripts is speedy catching up as a trending inspiration for all movie makers.In his brave & ambitious attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks approximately custodial violence, police cowl-up, systemic corruption at a big level, this is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole fact and sooner or later there could be no end to the complete picture.

i think what we saw in this reel life still needs to be applied in real life
how much are we gonna let such atrocities slip by and let the helpless soul suffer
its high time for this century to see and examine person by his virtue not by his birth
unless that happens India is still very hateful country to live in and a major taint in face of human rights
annihilation of caste should be practiced but not the annihilation ofperson born in it

Great movie by sough indian industrySuriya plays a crusading lawyer, hell bent on revealing the truth behind three Irular (Scheduled Tribe) men who go missing while being in police custody.The superstar turns in an impeccable performance as he fastidiously chips away at the truth, only to discover layer upon layer of lies, caste hatred and cruelty.Despite having a big name star at his disposal, director T. J. Gnanavel deserves praise for letting the story take the driver's seat, never reducing to unnecessary 'massy' sequences or masala elements to drive the narrative forward.Lijimol Jose as the wife of Rajakannu (played by Manikandan) is an absolute force of nature in her role, delivering some of the best sequences in the film, turning in a performance a veteran would be proud of.Prakash Raj as usual excels in a supporting role while and Rajisha Vijayan had precious little screen time to make any sizeable impact.The music from Seal Roldan played very significant role, helping the audience to feel the pain of the beleaguered protagonists in the beginning and that of vindication and righteousness towards the climax.Jai Bhim does not rise up to the emotional highs of previous classic dramas based.",Jai Bhim

1230,arunvanavasi,..Everyone must watch,9,8 November 2021,"This film is based on true events that took place in Cuddalore district in 1993. In the original story, Rajakannu, a member of the Andai Kurumbar tribe whose main occupation was making bamboo baskets and agricultural labour, was accused of stealing jewels from a house that employed him. Based on the complaint, Rajkannu was taken into police custody.After suffering torture at the hands of the police, Rajakannu died in custody. To cover up their crimes, the local police moved his body late into the night, disposed of it in the neighbouring Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) district and later claimed that he had escaped from custody. Rajakannu's wife Parvathi, however, did not buy this story and sought help to locate her husband. Finally, she found a lawyer of the Madras High Court, K Chandru, who joined her quest for justice.K Chandru, who would later on become a well-respected and popular judge in the Madras High Court, filed a habeas corpus petition in the same court. After a 13-year legal battle, the court adjudicated that this was a case of custodial death and the accused police officials were sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment for the murder of Rajakannu. In an interview with The News Minute, he recalls how the police attempted to bribe Parvathi and him during the case. Chandru responded by throwing out the suitcase of money and the police from his office.Getting Parvathi justice for the custodial muder of her husband, however, is only one among the many incredible contributions of Justice K Chandru for the marginalised and downtrodden.In his six and a half years as a judge of the Madras High Court, he disposed of 96,000 cases, a remarkable feat which was only possible because of his immaculate planning and organisation.",Jai Bhim

1274,ksivakumaran,Best of tamil cenima,10,9 November 2021,"Best movie ever seen in tamilPolice brutality has been a sensitive topic, touched upon by very few films and filmmakers, even when we keep hearing several such cases in the news. Films like Visaranai and Karnan paved the way for TJ Gnanavel's Jai Bhim to tell a harrowing social issue without the need to be preachy. Jai Bhim's first hour is a somewhat disturbing watch, with the cries of the oppressed both tugging at your heartstrings and coming across as slightly amplified. There's no subtlety at play. The punches are wholly felt, the screams are heard loud and clear. If you still don't, Sean Roldan's woeful score will drive the point home.",Jai Bhim

The movie showed the brutal reality without any compromise. What's more haunting is to know that this incident happened in real.Manikandan & Lijomol Jose has done their roles brilliantly and definitely deserve awards for their performance. Many police characters were haunting. Even if I come across these actors in real life, It will create a sense of fear inside me.The success of the movie majorly lies in the fact there was no compromise just for the purpose of roping suriya into the movie.

QOur subconscious knows that will happen, but consciously we are trying to cover the truth by thinking director will show some thing to entertain us.I think, director took a bold decision to make us (audience) to embarrasse by watching our co-citizens life, how our ignorance affecting them, how our perceptions about dress, speech, education etc makes some one guilty?We are not our conscious. We are our subconscious and this movie is about to disturb it.",Jai Bhim

The movie is based on true events and is about oppression by police on tribal communities.The movie is all about how certain sections of the society do not have access to even the basic rights such as justice, education, equality and right to live with dignity. This movie shows the ground reality of how underprivileged are tortured and falsely set up in cases just for the sake of closing up cases by police and so called privileged classes.I have lived in a village and have witnessed all this, this is an eye opening glimpse for us to atleast briefly understand what happens with underprivileged classes and how they live aside in a different corner of a village.Kudos to the director who has picked up such a complex topic and portrayed it so well, acting is top notch, screenplay is good, dialogues are superb. The movie is very engaging and does not feel long at any point in time.This is a gem of movies, must watch, don't miss it, they are made rarely!!",Jai Bhim

Take a bow team!And for those blaming that the movie promotes divisiveness. The society has been divided for ages, based on state and caste. We live in unity but that doesn't mean that one should forget their identity. Any story that promotes this identity doesn't mean it is promoting divisiness.

1387,karungopi,Amazing Movie - Must watch,10,3 November 2021,"One of the best movies that I've seen in the recent past. Suriya performance is absolutely stunning. Sinathalli aced the role... Amazing actress. I'm sure this movie will win multiple awards. This is no doubt an Oscar qualifier. Screenplay & direction is just amazing.One of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of ""Visaranai"", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.In his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.I can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.One can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.Huge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.",Jai Bhim

1402,nareshstalwart08,Completely left speechless,10,5 November 2021,"While watching the movie the very particular thought that it is a real life move was completely disturbing. Tears rolled out understanding few fellow men just like us with families are left to be victimized by the system simply because the bureaucracy ""can do it"". It is a very powerful movie where the reality slaps you right in the face. How having a voter id or vote bank can protect some citizens from system abuse. Only concern was the viewers should have been informed that the police knew the real culprits and they have a share with the theft. That would have made us understand the severe torture meted out to the victims by the police. Revealing at the end might be good from a cinema point of view but it takes away the vital information from the viewers which they need to know to understand the entire brutality. This movie will bring in some required social changes in the society. The importance of adequate representation for every oppressed community was clearly evident. Tamil film industry will lead the infian movie industry in making movies based out of the social fabric of the society. Which while in remake will be missed out as was the case with asuran. Watch these type of movies in their native language to understand the actual pain and plight. My heartly congratulations in making a wonderful movieti enlighten the masses about oppression. Tamil cinemas kudos to you. Make fantabulous movies like these in the future as well.",Jai Bhim

1421,rbhalerao,Dawn of a new Era,10,6 November 2021,"Words are very less to express my Thanks to Suriya and whole team.Movie started with a poor but happy family, but one thinking made their life destroy. Sangini the character alone is strong character.Those who thinking this movie belongs to a perticulur community then they are missing India's Masterpiece movie. Writer directors specially taken care about the hearth about the movie which is social msg and real story, this movie has not a single dialogue with the word ""Jai Bhim"" but whole movie given a msg more than this word. In India lower caste people greetings with the word ""Jai Bhim"" just like western countries say ""Hello"" as a greeting word. ""Jai Bhim"" coming from Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar who is father of Indian constitution coming from lower cast community.This movie based on real story which is happened in 90s. Every scenes in the movie shows that the details study of whole team on each character.Director also not looks intrested in any hate communal dailouge, she sticked with the real story very well.Pregnant lady she is main character because story revolving around her her acting look more real.Sometimes movie gives feel like you are watching actual cctv footage of the real story.Thanks to Suriya because no Bollywood actor or director will dare to toch this topic as they are more interested in money making and undigestable comedy or same singam style movie.Bollywood need to take classes first from Tamil industry then we can expect from them atleast some better content.People Alredy proves that they want pure content without any masala, movie named ""Sairat"" (Marathi Movie) made a history in Marathi industry because people knows that marathi industry is full of Brahmin people. But Maharashtra liked the subject of ""Sairat"".Bollywood should know that people don't want glamour anymore they are hungry for an Art, they don't want all time white actress or Gym actors.People more intrest in pure art.Once again I would say ""Jai Bhim"" is a Masterpiece movie in Indian history.",Jai Bhim

1423,pratheep-94911,Jai Bhim,10,3 November 2021,"Jai bhim showcast caste discrimination of tribal people,and police brutality and injustice in modern India in the nutshell. Police exploit the tribal people to close out case by frame them and torture them to acknowledge the crime that they never commit. The movie presents two big issues to the state and union governments, that are equlity caused by caste practices and Police Brutality. Police reforms to end the torture and fake cases and body cams and CCTV cameras on every police station. Equality or social justice to give the tribal people a chance to live a peaceful life such as land to live, educational opportunities, care for necessities, change to thought process of caste based inequality.That being said, the movie is well directed, the tribal actors and hero did a good job. Jai Bhim is a good title to show the fight against inequality since Dr. Ambakar name lived his life to fight inequality. Music just made the movie more natural. The scrpts are more natural, scenes and stories are well crafted, good job director.

1426,narendervelu,An excellent movie revealing systematic atrocities against the marginalized,10,6 November 2021,"Firstly this is based off a true story. The victimized community, the lawyer who fought for them, the political leader who advocated for their justice are all there so do not believe the negative reviews that falsely proclaim it was a lie. This incident shown in the film has been proven in a court of law so to deny it would be unlawful in the first place.Now the movie...The marginalized community was depicted very accurately in the film. It is a sad fact that all over India these real, indigenous people, are still not allowed inside the main areas of the village/township, reduced to do menial jobs, mistreated, and even taken as perpetrators of crime without evidence. This is EXACTLY how they have been shown in the film.The filming crew has given extreme attention to detail when it comes to outlining their characters onscreen (this includes their accent, dressing, jobs, and lifestyle in general).Unlike many Indian films, there are no 'masala' scenes or songs showing heroism. The lawyer character fights for the truth and that's what is shown as well.One other thing to look for a movie is how well the central incident is taken by different characters in the film. The director has captured it perfectly and showcases how prejudice is interwoven in the society and while it is harmless to the unaffected, causes immense pain to the other.The long duration of the film does not cause even an iota of disinterest and puts you on the edge of your seat with its gripping reality.Movies like this should be welcome as eye-openers and proof that Indian flicks do not have to be all about dancing in the rain and catapulting villains.You can certainly find reviews that label this movie as fabricated, divisive etc. But remember, according the honorable (retired) judge of Madras High Court who actually handled the case when he was a lawyer, it was watered down a lot to reduce the gore and pain of the real incident.Kudos to Surya and team, and Amazon for taking up such a bold subject much needed for the society today.",Jai Bhim

I've seen Lijo Mol Jose in a previous movie and I was surprised when I saw her name in the cast as Sengoni. She has done a great job in this role, followed by Manikandan(Rajakannu) and finally Surya making us speechless with his performance. The other cast also did a great job.Music:
The songs in the movies may not be catchy or commercial but it helped the audience to feel the emotion which the movie wanted to convey. The BGM were so good and very apt for the film.Direction:
T. J Gnanavel has given quality movies in the past but this one is his masterpiece till date. It will be one of the best movies he has directed. The movie was simple, to the point and kept the audience nailed to the seat.This movie is based on true events and shows what injustice and hardship tribal community has gone through. It is a long film with 2hr and 40 min screen time but not even in one scene it felt slow. It has a nice pace and awesome dialogue and screenplay which will make almost 3 hrs feel so short.
