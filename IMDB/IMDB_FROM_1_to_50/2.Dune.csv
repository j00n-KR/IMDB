0,SnoopyStyle,Villeneuve epic,8,21 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timothée Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie. He puts his skills into the epic feel of this franchise. It feels right... coming from a non-book-reader.",Dune
1,Hitchcoc,The Beginning,8,22 October 2021,"Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.",Dune
2,Horst_In_Translation,"If this film was a planet, then it could be fine for temporary stay, permanent not really though",6,26 September 2021,"""Dune"" is a really new American movie from 2021 that just got released and I saw that people really liked it, so I got curious and decided to check it out myself. It is a pretty long movie at slightly under 2.5 hours and the director is Denis Villeneuve, perhaps one of the most influential filmmakers right now and maybe number one from Canada. He is also one of the writers and the writing staff also includes an Oscar winner. You can check out the names there yourself. I shall instead elaborate a little more on the cast. Villeneuve being in charge resulted in many big names becoming a part of this project. The lead actor here is Timothée Chalamet, definitely a rising star, but I must say I am not the biggest fan of him really. This is a bit of a problem as he is basically in this movie from beginning to end, but luckily, the supporting cast includes more than a handful actors that I like quite a bit. These would be Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. With Brolin and Bardem, it felt like a bit of a reunion from No Country for Old Men, especially during the one brief scene/moment in which they clash to some extent. And as we are already talking Coen Bros movies, Isaac's Inside Llewyn Davis deserves a mention as well for sure. So you will find a few actors in here who have worked with the maybe most famous filmmaking brothers duo in the past. Brolin is featured heavily in the first half of the film, but then vanishes completely. Isaac also has more screen time early on. Bardem has a brief scene when his character is introduced, but appears in the last 30 minutes again. I personally thought that he would not show up again with this film, but play a central role in the second movie. Yes, there is a sequel indeed. This already becomes clear when this film here starts as we see a ""part one"" or something and also the way this one ends makes it very obvious that this is not it.As for the rest of the cast, Rebecca Ferguson is almost lead as well, which was okay. Zendaya I am still not buying the hype and she is only really in it near the end. Momoa is on the good side, while Skarsgard and Bautista are on the enemy team. The latter is really making himself a career now if you take a look at everything he has been in, even if it is always supporting parts. His recognition value probably helps as well. Oh yeah, Charlotte Rampling also has a memorable scene in here. I will get to that/her later. Of course, people will immediately think of the David Lynch Dune movie from decades earlier. I will not talk about parallels or differences now with that one because I have not seen it. Let's just focus on this one here instead from a standalone perspective. There is enough to elaborate on anyway. I must still say that I struggle with seeing Chalamet as some kind of hero or chosen character. I don' think he has the props to really pull it off. Of course, this is the idea that he does not look like Hulk or Thor or something, but when I see him show his dedication like how he really wants to join Momoa's character or how he can defeat Brolin's character in a duel or how he leads his mother in the desert and knows exactly how his items and uniform work because he is such a natural or how he in the end says his path leads through the desert, it is difficult to believe. Also how he of course wins the battle against this fella near the end who challenges him. And he has to kill in the process, which also shows us how much of a kindred spirit he is that he has never killed somebody before.Death is a crucial component in here. Still I must say seeing how literally every single good guy, be it Isaac's character, be it Momoa's, be it the seer, goes out in a heroic manner that puts harm to the enemy side was a bit much and eventually also repetitive. There were other issues I struggled with here in terms of the plot. Take a look at the idea of Chalamet's character playing a real hero. Basically he is the future. And yet, his own folk (Rampling's character) were ready to kill him immediately with this poisonous needle if he pulls out his hand from this box that caused so much pain to him. Or his dreams and premonitions linked to Zendaya's character were also not exactly new or inspired the way they were put on display here. I could go on by saying that for example the introduction did feel too long and this movie could have been (or should have been) half an hour shorter perhaps. What I cannot say anything negative about is really the way in which the bad guys attack. When they come for Isaac's character and the others, it is really spectacular and this is when this film is at its very best and an incredibly tense thrill ride. In the middle of the film. Unfortunately, when this is over and the bad guys have won for the moment, it gets a bit weaker again and here and there it drags a bit and has some lengths. What also can be said is that this film is never really intended for comedic purpose. The way you could see it a lot on another Bautista fantasy/sci-fi movie. There was this one moment when Momoa's character talks about Chalamet's character's muscles that was a bit on the playful comedic site and maybe one or two other inclusions as the film went on, but yeah this is not a movie to pick for light relief or something. It takes itself very seriously. Does it have the right to? I am not sure.Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with sets, cinematography, costumes and all other visual/audible production fields, but this is pretty much a given now with a film of this dimension, even if we maybe should not see it as a given. With the likes of Zimmer, Roberts and West in charge, however, there is at least as much competence available in ""minor"" departments as there is in front of the camera. If not more. But back to the action itself: With the spectacular visuals, this is definitely a movie you'd rather want to check out at a theater than at home on a small screen. Unless you have a home theater of course. Oh yeah, another moment that will maybe make you smile is how Isaac's character tries to get Brolin's grumpy character to smile really early on. The latter reminds me a bit of the man Brolin played on Sicario. Anyway, I guess we will see more from Brolin's character in the sequel here as well. As for Villeneuve, I must say I liked his earlier stuff like Prisoners, but his recent take on Blade Runner did almost nothing for me unfortunately. Quality-wise, this movie here is somewhere in-between. It's not a revelation or anything and I think the reception is way too positive (I even saw people consider Chalamet for an Oscar nomination, like come on!), but it is worth seeing if you like the genre and some of the cast members I suppose. Not a must-see by any definition though. Seems as if Villeneuve really enjoys giving us his take on some films that are considered classics. It certainly could have turned out worse here, but I hope that with whatever he does in the future, also after this sequel here, he can manage to be a bit more essential again. The pathos felt a bit much at times and did not always ring true. This maybe also could have had to do with Chalamet for me though. If you like him more, you will maybe not see it.The attention to detail at times was still pretty good. I liked Brolin's words during the training sequence linked to Chalamet's character expressing he is not in the mood for fighting or so and how he has to fight when the time is right and how this felt connected to his battle with one character near the end. Completely aside from that, I initially struggled with the sand component, but in the second half they turned the background and location into something special and you could feel the endless desert element finally. Also the idea of these sandworms was depicted nicely. Or how a ring is used to print a seal or signature. Or these helicopters that look like insects. Or the little drone, so it is not just the big spectacular inclusions where you can see all the talent that was included in the making of this film. Unfortunately, there were also many struggles. I mentioned most of them, but while I already stated that the introduction felt too long, the real introduction at the very start felt incredibly rushed and it was impossible to remember all they mentioned there. Pretty much a no-go for a film with this running time. All in all, I still give it a thumbs-up and I think the good is more frequent than the weak, but there's no way I would say that this is among the very best films of the year 2021 so far. Maybe the better, but not the best and I hope that Villeneuve can step things up with the second film, but given the lead actor I kinda doubt it. Anyway, if you like this one, you can probably keep watching. Maybe said sequel is out already once you read this review of mine and then you can decide for yourself anyway. (tt1160419)",Dune
3,nogodnomasters,The Desert takes the weak,8,15 October 2021,"The Duke (Oscar Isaac) is sent by the empire to take control of the spice operations on Arrakis, which sounds like Iraqis. It is inhospitable and the locals have seen empires come and go who try to rule over them. (Reminded me of Afghanistan.) The Duke wants to have peace. The Duke's son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is the main character and has too much of his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) in him. She comes from a long line of witches and he has some of their powers such as ""The Voice"" and ""The Sight"" which is similar to ""The Force."" He dreams of a girl (who doesn't?) and of things to come. As it turns out, the empire was quite honest with them.I have never read the book. Three of us watched the first one on VHS and fell asleep during the film. The machines looked like they came out of ""Star Wars."" They needed some good music background.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Dune
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"My movie of 2021, so far.",10,23 October 2021,"It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.The story is somehow easier to follow than in the last adaptation, motives and actions are easier to see and follow. I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.",Dune
5,classicsoncall,"""He shall know your ways as though born to them.""",9,22 October 2021,"It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.",Dune
6,lee_eisenberg,destiny will come,8,27 October 2021,"I've never read Frank Herbert's novel or seen any other adaptation of ""Dune"", so I have to take Denis Villeneuve's adaptation as the guide. It's an impressive movie. Not just the visuals, but in the story's complexity. Timothée Chalamet continues to reaffirm himself as one of the greatest actors of his generation.I'm eager to see part 2, as well as David Lynch's adaptation.",Dune
7,jboothmillard,Dune,7,1 November 2021,"The 1984 David Lynch movie was a box office flop and has been garnered with mixed to negative reviews over the years, but the trailer for the new movie, based on the cult book by Frank Herbert, looked like it would be much better, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Basically, in the distant future, the year, 10,191, in the known universe, Duke Leto of House Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis. The planet Arrakis is a barren desert planet populated by gigantic sandworms, better known as Dune. It is the universe's only source of the spice called melange, a drug that extends life and expands consciousness. The Spice is also critical for safe instantaneous interstellar travel to any distance in space. Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor's Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, who threaten Shaddam's control. Leto is apprehensive but sees the political advantages of controlling the spice planet, and an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen. Leto's concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is part of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female order with advanced physical and mental abilities. Although Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter to descend and become the Kwisatz Haderach (""one who can be many places at once""), she instead gave birth to a son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Throughout his life, Paul has been trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and the Mentat Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), while Jessica trains Paul in disciplines of the Bene Gesserit. Paul talks to Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions he has had of the future. Due to these visions, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) visits Caladan and subjects Paul to a deadly test. He is subjected to experience excruciating pain to his hand, to assess his impulse control, which he passes. Later, Mohiam instructs House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) to not kill Paul and Jessica during his coup. He agrees not to harm them but intends to cause their deaths indirectly to end their bloodline. House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, capital city and fortress stronghold on Arrakis, where Duncan and an advance party have been learning about the world and the Fremen. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and meets planetologist and imperial judge Dr. Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster). Kynes explains the dangers of spice harvesting to Leto, Paul, and Halleck, including the giant sandworms. During a flight, they spot a sandworm approaching an active spice harvester with a stranded crew. Leto and his team rescue the workers moments before the sandworm swallows it. Paul's exposure to spice-laden air triggers intense premonitions. Following an attempt by a Harkonnen agent to kill Paul, Leto's soldiers are put on high alert. Suk doctor Wellington Yueh (Chang Chen) disables Arrakeen's critical protective shields, allowing Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops to overwhelm the Atreides forces. Yueh incapacitates Leto and tells him he made a deal with the Baron to deliver him in exchange for freeing his captive wife. Yueh poisons Leto with a gas capsule and is killed after delivering the Duke. Leto releases the poison gas, killing himself and members of the Baron's court, but the Baron survives. Duncan escapes and steals an ornithopter (an aircraft with rapidly flapping wings). Harkonnens capture Paul and Jessica and intend to drop them in the desert to perish. Paul and Jessica overpower and kill their captors using a Bene Gesserit power called ""The Voice"" to control others verbally. Finding a survival kit left for them by Yueh, Paul and Jessica spend the night in a tent. Paul experiences visions of a ""holy war"" spreading across the universe and him leading it. The Baron hands over command of Arrakis to his brutish nephew Rabban aka ""Beast"" (Dave Bautista) and orders him to sell spice reserves and restart production to recover the cost of the coup. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Kynes and head to an old research station but are soon tracked down by Sardaukar. Jessica, Paul and Kynes are allowed to escape the facility when Duncan and various Fremen sacrifice themselves. Kynes, ambushed by Sardaukar troops, lures a sandworm that devours them along with her. Paul and Jessica reach the deep desert and meet the Fremen, among them are Stilgar and young warrior Chani (Zendaya), who Paul has seen in his visions. Their admission into the tribe is protested by Fremen warrior Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), so they have a ritual duel to the death, and Paul is victorious. Against Jessica's wishes, Paul states they will remain on Arrakis with the Fremen to reclaim the planet. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Piter de Vries, Benjamin Clémentine as Herald of the Change, Golda Rosheuvel as Shadout Mapes, and Roger Yuan as Lieutenant Lanville. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, with all the stuff involving religion and politics, just the main plot that everyone wants the spice. Chalamet makes for a good young hero, Skarsgård is good at being the nasty and grotesque villain, and the all-star cast, including Isaac, Brolin, Rampling, Zendaya, and Bardem all get their moments as well. The visuals and special effects are fantastic, from the spaceships and alien creatures to the interior and exterior locations and large-scale battle scenes, so it doesn't matter if you don't understand it all, it is a great spectacle, and hopefully the second part will be as exciting, a worthwhile epic science-fiction adventure. Very good!",Dune
8,paul_haakonsen,"Visually impressive, but rather unnecessary remake...",6,18 October 2021,"Sure, I was looking forward to getting to watch director Denis Villeneuve's take on Frank Herbert's iconic story ""Dune"". And yeah, I did also enjoy the 1984 version of the tale, so of course this 2021 version was something that had to be watched.And yes, I did enjoy the 2021 rendering of ""Dune"", of course I did. I mean, how could I not? Despite of running for a bit more than two and a half hours, the movie was entertaining and enjoyable. And this was just the first part of the story, so we are in for more.Visually then ""Dune"" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then ""Dune"" doesn't disappoint.In terms of casted performers, then the majority of the cast were actually nicely cast for the various roles and characters. Now, I am not familiar with Timothée Chalamet (playing Paul Atreides), but he was no Kyle MacLachlan (playing the same character in the 1984 movie). This 2021 version of ""Dune"" also have the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgård on the cast list. I was really impressed with Stellan Skarsgård in the movie.And while ""Dune"" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of 'was this really a necessary remake?' once the movie ended. And then my thoughts went on to ""will it be remade again in 40 years, with whatever technology is available then?'. So there was that whole whether this remake was a necessary thing or not looming over it.And I also feel that the character gallery was a bit underdeveloped, as I felt most of the characters were only given superficial characteristics and personalities, never letting the audience really get to know the characters backgrounds, motivations and such. It just felt a bit too shallow in terms of character development and growth.If you have the chance to watch ""Dune"", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie.My rating of ""Dune"" lands on a six out of ten stars, like the 1984 movie. Sure, this 2021 movie was more pleasing to look at, but of course almost 40 years have done lots to the development of CGI in the movie business. But the 2021 version is held back by an inferior character gallery and that overwhelming sense of this being essentially just a massive waste of money and effort in terms of remaking something that didn't really need to be remade.",Dune
9,CinemaSerf,Classic and sophisticated sci-fi at it's best.,7,25 October 2021,"Fans of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) might recognise the bleak scenery around Wadi Rum, one of many stunningly beautiful and evocative locations used is this epic piece of cinema. It is that photography, and another hugely complimentary score from Hans Zimmer, that perfectly sets the template for this adaptation of Frank Herbert's story of family, avarice and power. I was sceptical about it being split into two parts (especially given the lengthy delay between this and the sequel) but it really works well. The unseen Emperor of the Known Universe commands that house ""Atreides"" take over the mining of the valuable ""spice"" from their arch enemy the ""Harkonnen"", and so the Duke (Oscar Isaac), his wife ""Jessica"" (Rebecca Ferguson) and son ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) must prepare to relocate to their new and distinctly hostile desert world. It is clear from the outset that young man is troubled. He sleeps fitfully with strange dreams all set upon a planet he has studied but never visited. Upon arrival, they are betrayed and the young man and his mother must find and befriend the local ""Fremen"" population and learn how to survive and to fight back. Now I won't fib, it does drag a bit at times, and if you already know the story from either the book, or the David Lynch version from 1984, then that can lead to you wanting to shout ""get on with it"" at the big screen, but being patient with this brings it's own rewards. The attention to the detail, and the grand scale of this feature is immersive, it draws you in and there is enough action, and food-for-thought to sustain that interest for the most part. Chalamet offers us a strong and engaging performance. He is growing as an actor, maturing - and though he still looks like a decent meal would kill him, he owns the picture in a way (for me, anyway) that he never has before. The remaining cast members gel well together, and the mysticism and political manoeuvring that underpins this story is subtle and nuanced but potent in it's presentation. The costumes and visual effects are splendid - I want one of the locust-copters (though heaven only knows what the vibrations must be like onboard!), and we do get a sense - but really only that - of the enormity of the giant worms that patrol the desert looking for their quarry. The second part of the novel was always the more interesting. We will see the characters develop more, and we will learn more of the troubled ""Paul"" and of whom he really is - as well as there being much more actually going on. If this is the standard of the opening gambit, then what is to come ought to be wonderful.",Dune
10,zardoz-13,Villeneuve's Greatest Sci-Fi Film,10,29 October 2021,"Watching director Denis Villeneuve's groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel ""Dune"" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. Unlike its ill-fated predecessor, David Lynch's critically reviled ""Dune"" (1984), which shoehorned Herbert's gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, Villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. Instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. Some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but Warner Brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before ""Dune"" generated some box office traction. Mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. Meantime, Villeneuve retreads several Lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. You cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and Byzantine political intrigue. Although classified as science fiction, ""Dune"" never degenerates into a juvenile ""Buck Rogers"" space opera. ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" lenser Greg Fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. Surrounding Timothée Chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgard. Overall, ""Dune"" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. Nevertheless, the filmmakers don't bewilder the audience with narrative overload. Clearly, Villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.Imagine a mash-up of ""Star Wars"" and ""Game of Thrones,"" and you'll have a clue about what ensues. Specifically, ""Dune"" takes place in the year 10,191. This tour de force saga of clashing empires unfolds on the bleak desert planet of Arrakis. This savage, sun-scorched world is the only source in the universe for a unique mineral called spice. Not only does interstellar space travel hinge on spice, but it also is a psychedelic drug that heightens awareness and lengthens life. The evil Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård of ""Good Will Hunting"") of the House of Harkonnen, who amounts to a smaller version of Jabba the Hutt, has reaped an obscene fortune in spice from Arrakis over the last 80 years. Now, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV removes the Baron and replaces him with a rival, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac of ""Ex-Machina"") of the mighty House of Atreides, who hails from the ocean planet of Caladan. Accompanied by his consort Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson of ""Doctor Sleep"") and their teenage son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet of ""Lady Bird""), the Duke arrives on Arrakis with his aide, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin of ""Sicario""), and a vast army. Leto suspects the corrupt Emperor may be setting him up for failure.Pandemonium erupts soon after Leto has taken over the spice mining operation. Earlier, the Duke had vowed to forge an alliance with the natives. Known as the Fremen, this disgruntled nomadic race resides in Arrakis's deep caverns and conducts campaigns like guerrilla warriors against the spice miners. Suffering dreadfully under the Baron, the Fremen expect similar treatment from Leto. The Duke dispatches a scout, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa of ""Aquaman""), to embed himself among them and win their hearts and minds. Swathed in hooded white cloaks, this mahogany-skinned tribe has dazzling cobalt blue eyes from using spice. A blue-eyed babe haunts Paul's dreams. Meantime, the mining equipment Leto inherited from the Baron is in rough shape. If the broiling temps on the surface weren't bad enough, prodigious sandworms--some as long as 13-hundred feet--cruise beneath the shifting sands like great white sharks. These leviathans can wrap their elastic mouths, bristling with zillions of wicked, razor-sharp fangs, around an entire spice harvesting machine. Eventually, treachery within Leto's palace topples his rule, and the Baron's soldiers annihilate Atreides' army. Miraculously managing to escape, young Paul takes refuge with the Fremen and ponders a rebellion against the Baron.Comparisons between ""Dune"" and ""Star Wars"" are inevitable. Indeed, both films share certain formulaic scenes which seem virtually interchangeable. An empire-building yarn with anti-colonial sentiments, ""Dune"" takes itself far more seriously than ""Star Wars."" When Paul watches his mentor perish, our hero suffers as tragically as Luke when he witnessed the demise of Obi-wan Kenobi. ""Dune"" differs, too, because it is a sword and sandal saga about supernatural critters. Arrakis makes Tatooine seem like a beach resort. Villeneuve and ""Prometheus"" writer Jon Spaihts and ""A Star Is Born"" scripter Eric Roth don't overwhelm the audience with volumes of exposition that cluttered up the Lynch film. Instead, they parcel out exposition and use it to foreshadow events. The warfare is conducted with ancient as well as futuristic weapons, with emphasis on ancient weapons. The dragonfly helicopters-known as ornithopters-look exciting. The crisp dialogue is both pointed and compelling. Villeneuve and company never cut our underdog heroes any slack in this initial bloodthirsty chapter, and the evil Baron maintains the upper hand despite minor setbacks like a near-death experience. As villains go, the grotesquely fat Baron makes an admirable but unscrupulous adversary. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa wield their weapons like old hands. Unlike Lynch, Villeneuve doesn't rub our noses in unsavory violence. Nonetheless, the battles are savage without being sadistic. Hans Zimmer's brawling orchestral score with native choral interludes enhances the atmosphere. Altogether, ""Dune"" qualifies as the first truly great science fiction classic of the 21st century with a coming-of-age hero driven by prophetic dreams he cannot fathom.",Dune
11,neil-476,At last,8,26 October 2021,"Spice, a substance mined only from the deserts of planet Arrakis, is the most valuable commodity in the galaxies since it enables interstellar transport. The violent and sadistic Harkonnen family have help the spice mining franchise for 40 years, becoming immensely wealthy in the process, alienating Arrakis natives the Fremen in the process. The Emperor abruptly appoints the Atreides family instead, infuriating the Harkonnens who sabotage equipment left behind, and plan a violent takeback. This results in heir apparent Paul Atreides and mother Jessica being abandoned in the desert, where they need to fall in with desert experts the Fremen in order to survive. Trouble is, after 40 years of the Harkonnens, the Fremen aren't very keen on offworlders.And.... end of part one. We are halfway through the story, with a part two which may never be greenlit if box office doesn't justify it which, in this post-covid world sounds somewhat unlikely. So what's part one like?My history of Dune and director Denis Villeneuve meant I was not hopeful. I read the novel in my teens in the 1960s and found it dense and impenetrable. David Lynch's movie had its moments, but got hacked about by the studio. The later TV series was more lucid, but suffered from some really poor casting and acting. And I had problems with Glade Runner 2049 and Arrival, both of which were a bit too cerebral for me, and less clear than I would have liked from a narrative stanndpoint.Dune (part one) 2021 is a fine film. It looks amazing, which one would expect these days. The casting - and acting - is excellent. And the script/adaptation is first rate. The power games which underlie the main plot are clear and obvious, the interplay of character dynamics is solid, subtle story points come through, all the little bits you need to understand are explained organically without huge obvious information dumps, and the story flows easily throughout the two and a half hours.I have two reservations. One, the film isn't as significant as it sometimes seems to think it is. And, two, Hans Zimmer's score is dissonant, intrusive and aggressive and I actively disliked it.But I liked the film very much, and I greatly hope there will be a part two.",Dune
12,evanston_dad,"Lifeless, Emotionless, and Dull",4,8 November 2021,"At the very end of ""Dune,"" Denis Villeneuve's attempt to make a screen version of the novel that isn't a disaster, a character says, ""This is only the beginning."" The line is meant to be an enticing promise of what's yet to come. To me it sounded like a threat. I knew this was only the first of a two-part movie, and yet this bit of news still managed to be one of the most demoralizing things I've heard in a long time.The creators of ""Dune"" clearly love the source material and have attempted to make something true to it with much care and love. But they've somehow still managed to make a lifeless, dramatically inert bungle of it. I didn't feel a single thing during this nearly three-hour movie, except the urge to pee, which I knew would happen given the size of the Modelo I bought at the concession. Seriously, you should have seen this Modelo. I paid $13 dollars for it, which was almost as much as the amount I paid for the movie ticket and parking combined. At first I was astounded, but then I saw the can they were handing to me. It was like I got my own personal keg of beer. This is the first time I've ever had a movie end and realize that I still had beer to drink, which I chugged during the closing credits.Wait...did I wander away from the subject of ""Dune?"" That's because the story of my beer is more interesting than this movie. Have you ever seen the musical ""Urinetown?"" If you have, you know that there's a song at the beginning about how the characters don't want to overload the audience with too much exposition right off the bat. The creators of ""Dune"" should have watched ""Urinetown."" This movie is nothing but exposition. We have to have someone explaining something to us in every scene. At one point, there's even a five minute scene where one character literally tells the other characters how their suits work. It's like a mechanic explaining to you how a car engine works when you're not that into cars. There's an audience for it, but I'm not it.One brown, ponderous scene follows another, while Hans Zimmer's screeching score drones on and on. At first it was just there, but by the end of the movie the music had me wanting to climb the walls. It becomes a parody of itself. By the time a bunch of female vocalists came on the soundtrack wailing in something resembling a Middle Eastern way, I had decided that this might be one of the worst scores Zimmer has ever composed.The movie never changes tone. I mean never. It never changes pace. I mean never. I suppose during some action scenes the editing literally gets faster, but the scenes still somehow manage to remain lifeless and unexciting. I never felt a sense of adventure, which is odd for a movie about a young man who gets the opportunity to leave his home planet and experience something new. I never cared about anything. None of the actors seem to be having any fun being in this movie. Timothee Chalamet is pretty as a postcard, but he has exactly one facial expression. Oscar Isaac is in this. So is Jason Mamoa. So is Josh Brolin. So is Javier Bardem. Lots of good talent. All of it swamped by colorless production design.This is the kind of movie with rabid fans who will tell you that there's something wrong with you for not liking it. I can just hear them saying things like ""Stick to 'The Fast and the Furious' you nincompoops who are too stupid to understand such profound things as 'Dune',"" as if they have any idea who I am or what my movie tastes are. Let those people get their knickers in a twist, and let those who also thought this movie was a boring slog join me for a keg-sized Modelo. Cheers!Grade: C-",Dune
13,ferguson-6,stunning visuals,7,21 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been nearly 40 years since David Lynch directed DUNE (1984). The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound, and has since been a cult favorite, though not one I'm particularly drawn to. All these years later, Frank Herbert's 1965 novel (there are 5 sequel novels) has been re-made by acclaimed writer-director Denis Villeneuve (ARRIVAL, 2016) and his co-writers Eric Roth (Oscar winner, FORREST GUMP, 1994) and Joe Spaihts (PROMETHEUS, 2012). The new version looks absolutely fantastic, even if the story is a bit convoluted and the characters don't always make the best, or even logical, decisions.The year is 10191, likely the most futuristic movie we've seen. Oscar Isaac is Duke Letto Atreides and Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica Atreides, though the story mostly focuses on the son, Paul, played by Timothy Chalamet. The story revolves around the protection of spice, the most valuable resource in the universe/galaxy. However the real focus is on politics and power plays ... so I guess not much really changes over the next 8170 years - except, of course, the colonization and travel between multiple planets (surprisingly, none of these planets is named Elon or Bezos). There is much talk of ""the plan"" with emphasis on whether young Paul is ""the one"" mentioned in their legends. Paul does have some special abilities, but Chalamet's understated (and mostly monotone) portrayal makes everyone, even Lady Jessica, a bit unsure of whether he's the leader they need.The supporting cast is impressive and all do their part to drive the action and story forward. Jason Mamoa is Duncan Idaho, the warrior who humorously belittles Paul's fragile physical frame. Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, the bodyguard to the noble family, and Charlotte Rampling plays the Reverend Mother (a creepy nun). Oscar winner Javier Bardem is under-utilized as Stilgar, while Zendaya shines as Chani, one who bonds with Paul. Of course the most outrageous role finds Stellan Skarsgard (with some heavy make-up and special effects) as the grand emperor of Harkonnen, with Dave Bautista as his brother, the Beast.For me, the movie's technical aspects are what stand out. It deserves awards consideration in multiple categories, especially Sound, Visual Effects, Cinematography, and Score. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer really delivers a score that compliments and enhances what we see on screen. Cinematographer Greig Fraser has been involved in numerous high profile projects, like ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) and the highly anticipated THE BATMAN (coming in 2022). The effects are special and include the sandworms, as well as dragonfly choppers that are quite impressive. It was a bit annoying to see the desert sand blowing constantly, yet goggles and masks are hardly ever used. I guess these faces are too expensive to cover up!Familiarity abounds as some bits recall MAD MAX, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, STAR WARS, and THE MATRIX. Director Villeneuve shot the film in Norway and Jordan, and to answer the question from fans of the original ... no, Sting does not make a cameo appearance. The film looks stunning and will likely satisfy the target audience. Whether it's enough to expand the audience is something we will know soon enough. The film ends with ""This is only the beginning"", and Mr. Villeneuve has Dune Part Two in the planning stages.The film will be released October 22, 2021 in theaters, on IMAX, and streaming on HBO Max.",Dune
14,deloudelouvain,"I can't wait for part two, and hope for more parts after that if they're of the same quality as this one.",8,6 November 2021,"I barely remembered anything from the 1984 Dune movie, only that I liked it at that time. But this remake is certainly something else. The progress we made now, technologically speaking, is just from another world. The visuals in Dune: Part One are just stunning with amazing spaceships and other tech. That alone is worth watching this movie. If you're a sci-fi fan you really can't go wrong with this one, it's all very mindblowing. The story itself is also entertaining. I can't wait to watch the second part to be honest. As for the acting, the whole cast did its best, they all gave convincing performances. At first I thought did we really need another remake of a 37 year old movie? Can't they come with something new? But I was wrong, this movie is totally worth watching, just for the visuals alone it's already worth it.",Dune
15,siderite,"More of a remake of Lynch's film, rather than an adaptation of the book",8,22 October 2021,"I am one of those few people who thought Lynch's 1984 Dune was great. It was terribly edited and had other flaws, but it captured what I feel is the essence of the book. Of course it wasn't exactly like the book, it couldn't have been. Enter Denis's Dune, 2021, everything can be done on a computer, actors have had decades to refine the craft, films are not forced to be one hour and a half anymore, the budgets are astronomical. So how is it? I liked it, but I feel that it was something closer to what someone does after thinking for a long about how they would fix 1984 Dune rather than a reinterpretation of the book or even a very dry rerendering of it like the 2000 miniseries.There are two things I really didn't like. One of them is the flat refusal to do anything that might be considered R-rated. The film is butchered to blandness, even when it features vicious knife fights, large scale warfare and sadistic Harkonnen. Second is Jessica's character, who is portrayed as a weakling, rather than the incredibly resourceful Bene Gesserit who has been trained for years that she is. I love Rebecca Ferguson, but she is not right in this film and nor is her character.The visuals, while impressive, were kind of subdued, too. The mutated Navigators don't even make an appearance, the Harkonnen look big and fearsome, but clean and not really vile, the worms are shown with restraint, the colors are muted, the clothes and overall attire are simple, functional and uninteresting.Bottom line: I am sorry to say that I think Lynch's film would have probably been better if the same resources and artistic freedom would have been awarded to him. This Dune doesn't really show as much an improvement as 37 years of thinking about it should have warranted. And it is tame and lame, refusing to take the artistic risks that should have been taken to portray with today's technology and knowledge a world 8000 years into the future and described with so much care and attention in Herbert's books.Well, back to reading all the books again and dreaming for the next 40 years of an adaptation of God Emperor of Dune...",Dune
16,thesar-2,"Long, Over-Dune",4,4 November 2021,"I'm so obsessed with going completely cold into a movie, I read nothing, watch no trailers/vids, observe anything to do with a movie prior to seeing the movie. In the case of DUNE PART ONE, that plan backfired.Had I known this was only Part ONE of what appears to be a 5+ hour SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW film, I wouldn't have bothered. Yes, in the opening couple of minutes, it actually does say: DUNE PART ONE. But, I read that as JUSTICE LEAGUE's Part 1 of 6, as in chapters, not actual movies.That all said, this movie deserves 4/10 stars for its incredible cinematography, visuals, special effects and score. Those should absolutely be nominated for Academy Awards. But, the rest, including another convoluted DUNE script, was pretty much crap.The technology they showed in this movie felt more like 8 years into the future vs. The 8,000 they want us to believe. But, on the flipside, the certainly not Tatooine planet had too much of...everything. How on that planet do they have any supplies or creatures or ""humans"" when there doesn't appear to be a drop of water on the planet's entire surface? If it's underground, how did they drill with no natural materials to build anything on the planet?I was also obsessed with that planet and how anyone could live there. But, that's besides the point. I hate this plot and barely made it through, even turning it off at about 48 minutes, but I was interested just enough to come back to it in about 10 minutes.Again, had I known this was just PART ONE, I definitely wouldn't have returned.***Final Thoughts: Just saw both DUNE films for the first time within the last 2 months and I have to say, if you loved the book or just curious about the film-format, I'd probably recommend this one over the David Lynch one. You can't go wrong with this score and these visuals. I understand the other movie was from the mid-80s, but frankly, I've even seen way better FX long before DUNE (1984) came out.",Dune
17,cherold,painfully tedious adaptation of an overrated novel,3,31 October 2021,"I wasn't a big fan of Dune when I read it. It was like a sci-fi/fantasy take on an old sword-and-sandal political intrigue thing, complete with dull characters and dumb story.On the other hand, it had this wonderfully anthropological creation of a desert world and its people. That was the only reason I got through it.Dune Part One is the first part without the second part. The characters are still dull, the plot still dumb, and the sci-fi world-building almost non-existent. The scenery and special effects are quite good, but nothing is interesting; even action scenes are listless.Will Dune Part Two offer the world-building that was the only good part of the book? Doubt it. Anyway, I certainly can't take any more of this.",Dune
18,FeastMode,visual and auditory explosion of beauty,7,22 October 2021,"I want to start by saying the most important thing. If you want to see this movie, WATCH IT IN IMAX. Or at the very least any premium screen (ultrascreen, emax, etc). Definitely don't watch it on HBO max unless you have a full theater system with surround sound. Whoever made the decision to simultaneously release this on VOD is a moron. It benefits from a theater viewing more than any movie since Tenet, maybe longer.The other most important thing to know is, this is half of a movie. It's basically incomplete. The first part of a 5 hour epic. I wish i knew that going in. I started becoming anxious because the story didn't seem to be progressing as fast as i would expect. I finally realized that the ""part one"" in the opening title was for the entire movie. It feels more like a setup movie than it's own story.The things i liked... there is so much. From a technical perspective, this is an absolute masterpiece. The directing, cinematography and music are all maximum top-notch quality. This isn't surprising, we've seen this from director denis villeneuve (omg arrival). And of course hans is the GOAT movie composer. They are why this movie is epic, to the fullest extent of the word. They are why half the scenes feel like the biggest moment of a normal movie.More on the music, i've been asking for something like this for a while. Where the music is the driving force of the scene, but not just for one or two scenes, but the whole movie. Forget about dialogue during these parts, just marvel at the visual and auditory explosion of beauty.So my dilemma is, how do i score this. I really hope they make a second one (now greenlit!!!), and if it's awesome, i can see myself always rewatching them back to back as a single long movie. But if they don't make one, or if it sucks, i can't see myself coming back to this more than once.I will give it 7 stars (awesome) for now. Depending on the outcomes mentioned above, i could see myself dropping it to a 6 (good) or upping it to an 8 (amazing). (2 viewings, opening night 10/21/2021, 11/3/2021)",Dune
19,inkblot11,"Certain to be a classic, just like the novel, SUPERB!",10,3 November 2021,"Based on the elaborate, spellbinding novel by Frank Herbert, Dune tells the tale of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) far into the future. Born into a royal family who has ruled the planet Caladan for 26 generations, Paul expects to follow the same path as his noble father, Leto (Oscar Isaac). Paul's Mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a well known member of the Bene Gesserit, powerful and magical sisters. However, the Universe is ruled by a capricious Emperor who has become jealous of the Atreides. Therefore he allows the Atreides arch enemy the Harkonnens to plot to bring them down. This is disguised as an offer to rule a different planet Arrakis aka Dune. The most valuable element in the galaxies, Melange is only found on Dune. The Natives of Arrakis called the Fremen have been suffering for years under Harkonnen rule. To be sure, the Duke and his trusted staff and fighters guess there will be a trap somewhere. What they don't anticipate is betrayal by one of their own. Pretty soon, Paul and all those he loves are in mortal danger. Yet, Dune has legends about a ""chosen one"" to lead the Fremen to defeat all their enemies. Is Paul this person? It's very hard to give a decent summary of the story's many layered tale. But Villeneuve the director does a grand job in staying faithful to the book while covering all the major plot elements. The cast is terrific, with Isaac, Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgård and so many others. But, Chalamet is especially fine and should get an Oscar nod. Then, the scope and magnitude of the visual effects and fabulous settings are worthy of the highest honors also. Dune is the type of towering spectacle that is rare to behold. Don't wait.",Dune

This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of ""Blade Runner 2049"" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!",Dune
21,tabuno,The Movie Falls Short of Lynch's Movie,7,22 October 2021,"Director Denis Villeneuve's attempt to improve on Director David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune fails in a number of respects. First. The pacing of this movie is slow and plodding. Second. The absence of the any Emperor scenes that Lynch so lavishly displayed on the scene offered up a spectacular science fiction motif missing in Villeneuve's version. Third. The absence of the powerful use of spice, a crucial element of the movie in space travel. Fourth. The casting and directing is rather mundane without the sharp and powerful characterization that Lynch cast. The Baron's character is a dull, a toned down shadow of Lynch's version while Duke Leto is a weakened version of Lynch's more dignified and royal persona. Lady Jessica seems too young and dismissive and also less than royal while his son Paul also does not seem to have the royal statue either. Fifth. The color, backdrop were wrong. Most of the scenes were shot in unnecessarily darkened shadows, Caladan, the water planet, had too much earth in comparison to the striking Arrakis, the desert planet, and anybody who has experienced the desert would realize how bright and powerfully sunny such scenes should be. It was hard to see what was going on in detail with many scenes. Lynch was able to incorporate this light and darkness, water and sand to a brilliant contrast. Sixth. Little important details went missing, especially the poor use of voice over that Lynch captured the thoughts of Frank Herbert's novel that helped to enhance many of the scenes such as the observation that people were more important than spice or how Paul was able to fit a skinsuit so well. Seventh. Unnecessary fillers that included a scene of Jessica and Paul in a after a crash that was not included in Lynch's version while Lynch included an extended fight training scenes and the use of the voice that enhanced the development of the plot even even though the special effect was crude using the box. Dream sequences were not photographed well as dreams like Lynch nor the blue eyes as effectively presented. Villenueve also used too many dream shots unlike the more selective and carefully edited nuanced use of dream scenes. Eighth. Villenueve offered up too many reveals too soon instead of the more tantalizing surprise discoveries of the audience to experience. It is really hard to describe in detail all the problems with this movie with one screening, but it seems that what Villenueve created was a mainstream popularized version of a science fiction classic with plenty of special effects but without the compelling edginess nor the strong characters that Dune requires.",Dune

Anyway Denis Villenvue directed such a wild ride that enthralls you from start to finish and I would say there's no complaints Dune has everything you'd want in it!

23,paulclaassen,"Started off sensational, but eventually overlong with too much going on for too little happening.",6,26 October 2021,"Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.",Dune

""Dune"" is more like a drama, science fiction movie than action due to the very few action scenes. I enjoyed it because I knew the story, the music was simply amazing and the direction which was made by Denis Villeneuve was simply outstanding. The interpretation of Timothée Chalamet who played as Paul Atreides was breathtaking and he made the difference. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Oscar Isaac's who played as Duke Leto Atreides, Rebecca Ferguson's who played as Lady Jessica Atreides, Jason Momoa's who played as Duncan Idaho and Stellan Skarsgård's who played as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

25,cruise01,Spectacular and visual feast in a epic scope.,8,22 October 2021,"4 out of 5 starsDune is a beautifully done epic science fiction film that is the start of a new sci fi franchise. Or an attempt to revive one. Even with the opening title saying Dune Part one. I never read the novels. Only knowing the film is the first half of the first Dune novel. Leaving the film with half a story and no climax. Which is frustrating and exciting to see more films. One can hope this film is a success for more. Which it does deserve more films.The plot is good and does open up for an epic story. Paul (Timothee Chalamet) is from the House of Atreides. Which he accompanies his parents to Arrakis which is a homeworld that has spice produced in the desert. Spice can be used for intergalactic travel. House of Atreides is looking for a reasonable peaceful trade. While House of Harkonnen lead by Baron (Stellan Skarsgard) is sending his army to Arrakis for an all out war.The cast ensemble is huge and every one did great playing there characters. Timothee Chalamet taking the main role was phenomenal. Rebecca Ferguson was also good. Along with Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Jason Momoa was good. Zendaya is fantastic even if her role was short. But saved for a sequel.Script did a great job with the world building and details on setting up the story. Great with the character building. Even for being a complex book. Director Denis Villeneuve did a great job in making this film a cinematic masterpiece. You can expect great cinematography set up in capturing beautiful landscapes. Visual effects. And having Hans Zimmers music score blasted at a high volume. Every sequence is designed for a cinematic scope to be seen on the big screen at the theatre with a great sound quality. Also, a down side on what you can expect from Denis Villeneuve is the slow pacing.The film does have some action sequences with great visual effects. The giant sandworm sequence is cool. Do not expect any big battle sequences. There is a brief battle scene in a dream sequence that is hinting towards the next film.Positives: the film is a good start for a franchise. The scope with action, visual effects, cast ensemble, production sets, music score, and direction all aims high for a cinematic experience that is epic and loud. It is one spectacular experience. The action sequences were good. Also ending abruptly for more films, do not expect a big climatic battle.Negatives: director Denis Villeneuve is fantastic in making a cinematic visual feast. He does take his time with his storytelling even with a slow pacing. Which he suffers in all his films.Overall, Dune is a good science fiction film which is spectacular and epic. I am excited and hoping to see more films. It delivered with a great world building for the story, visual effects, and action. It deserves to be seen on the big screen theatres.",Dune
26,zkonedog,Director Villeneuve Ascends To Film Stratosphere,9,28 October 2021,"Despite being a fan of sci-fi and fantasy fare, I had never read Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" novel. To be honest, the plot summaries of trade wars and odd names didn't exactly appeal to me. So, I came into this film armed only with the expectations that director Dennis Villeneuve (one of my favorite film helmsmen) would probably do a good job with the material. That sentiment turned out to be an enormous understatement.For a very basic overview, ""Dune"" tells the story--set thousands of years into the future--of the planet Arrakis, notable in the galaxy for its rich deposits of a spice that powers interstellar travel. Once ruled by House Harkonnen, Arrakis is being transferred to a new bloodline, that of House Atreides--with much political intrigue afoot. Central to all this is Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), a young man who not only is being recruited into a behind-the-scenes string-pulling society inhabited by his mother (Rebecca Ferguson), but also begins having visions of fulfilling a savior prophecy amongst the Fremen (Arrakis' desert inhabitants). Truth be told, trying to sum up ""Dune"" in a few sentences is nearly impossible and comes off sounding boring or trite. Rest assured, however, that the film is anything but.Perhaps the biggest draw here is the work of director Villeneuve, who may now be nipping at the heels of Christopher Nolan in terms of directors with the prominence to create a project with this type of scale. His ability to take a plot that, yes, essentially stems from a trade war and make it utterly compelling cinema is remarkable. It's Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings with the best themes of each franchise being showcased.Having a stellar cast certainly doesn't hurt, either. Besides Chalamet & Ferguson (both excellent), veterans of the craft like Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellen Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, & Zendaya play key roles. In a film that requires characters to look and feel epic in nature, that is easily accomplished with such a distinguished group.The visuals and music soundtrack also heavily contribute to the sense of scale in ""Dune"". While not flashy in any way, this is a film that begs to be seen on the big screen, where the planetary geography, interesting technology, and swelling score from Hans Zimmer can all best penetrate the senses.Yes, this film is technically ""half a movie"" in that a sequel will be released at a later date to cover the rest of the source novel. But never for a moment did I feel in any way cheated or frustrated by this fact. In this case, I actually appreciated the way the filmmakers set the groundwork without rushing to try and cram everything into a single runtime.Overall, my theater experience while watching ""Dune"" was one of the best I've had in some time. Truth be told, the only reason I deduct even one star is because I have to wait to pass final judgement until the sequel is finished. But I'll have absolutely no trouble going back to re-watch this effort again in anticipation of that conclusion. In a film era of endless sequels and IP-related projects, ""Dune"" felt original and fresh in a way that is (sadly) growing more and more rare.",Dune
27,digitalbeachbum,"Visually stimulating, but tedious and verbose, with audio difficulties",6,23 October 2021,"I have never read the books that Frank Herbert wrote. I have friends who were big on these books and told me about them and how the original movie adaptation was lacking much content. Apparently the books are laboriously detailed and complex.Immediately I noticed there is a lot more filler in this production. Is it needed? I guess it depends on the viewer. The first production by David Lynch was abridged and rejected by many, but I enjoyed it for the efforts and the constraints put on him by the executives. He had a limited budget and had to keep the run time down. This was pre-LotR trilogies and 3 hour movies were not acceptable.The second production I have watched is the SciFi mini series which was good but forgettable. It was too complex and detailed. That casting was more than acceptable and the effort in to special effects was visually entertaining.This production is amazingly wonderful visually. I wish I would have read the books so I have something to compare the scenes to, because it might give me a better perspective to what I'm watching.Several of the scenes in the first 35 minutes are very similar to the 1984 version of Dune. The hand in the box/fear is the mind killer scene I think was very well done. The fight scene with Gurney is good, I liked the special effects but the scene felt cut short.When I saw the trailer I was put off by the casting choices, specifically Paul. However, here I am in 36 minutes and I've been pleased with the most of the cast's performances. Again, I wish I had read the books so I would have a better understanding of the descriptions of the characters.Some of them are very similar to each production, but others are complete opposites! I do not care for Jason Momoa being cast. He seems out of place. I noticed the dramatic changes in male/female of some of the characters as well, the age and the height of them. I'm not sure of the book and the description given. I did like that they used an Asian for Dr. Yueh.I've never understood the plot where Dr. Yueh turns off the shields. This seems more like deus ex machina to me because the writer needed a betrayal. I don't care for how simple the process was for this character to commit the betrayal. It should have had more of a complexity to it. Then in the reverse, the whole ""buy freedom for my wife"" by putting a hollow tooth with poison in the Duke's mouth so he can blow the poison on to the Barron? That's about as complex and convoluted of a plot device as you can make, but they do one then the other back to back. It is a low point in the story.The one thing that immediately disappointed me is the audio. I normally listen to my movies on a 12/100 level while using headphones. Sometimes I have to raise the volume to 18 or 20, but this production I had to raise it to 58/100 just to hear some of the voices. The voices were not brought to the forefront. When a character whispers, you don't keep their voice at a whisper. You bright it forward in the audio track so it is raised above the music or the ambient sounds. I also do not like how the volume rises and drops when transitional music is played. The audio is definitely a problem, and this is a production issue. I blame the director and the audio technicians for this.There are several scenes which I feel aren't needed. When Paul is talking to the servant who is watering the palms. I didn't feel this was necessary. It is more filler than it is to story development.As I stated, there are many scenes which are not in either of the previous productions. I think many of them added to the story which I did not understand previously. Some of them are worthwhile, others are filler which the production could have left on the cutting room floor.Overall, I think it is a good script, produced in an attempt to be true to the book. There are highs and lows. Some scenes great, other scenes meh. I question some of the casting. I think they did as good as they could do given the two different productions before it, but failed to find a middle ground.",Dune

29,SAMTHEBESTEST,The most beautiful visual spectacle ever created by Denis Villeneuve. A splendid narrative is little hurt by slow pace but is still worth watching.,7,23 September 2021,"Dune (2021) :
Brief Review -The most beautiful visual spectacle ever created by Denis Villeneuve. A splendid narrative is little hurt by slow pace but is still worth watching. Dune is feature adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. It covers only half of it and takes 150 minutes for it which makes it often boring and it's little complicated too for mass lovers. But the same loss is recovered by the spectacular visuals which shows us an unimaginable future world. Set mostly in desert, the film has almost every single property looking new in sci-fi genre, and that fictional imagination of the visuals deserves credit for thinking out of the box. Not just that but the cinematic experience is excellent too. Look at the background music and how turns a simple scene look thrilling almost every single time. Dune has a big cast so it's unfair to name just few names here but yes everyone does their best with the characters they are portraying. If that's not enough then watch out for the costume designing of every character followed by brilliant VFX work and innovative action sequences. The action is less and not hard-core in that sense because as we know the film isn't a superhero flick. Yet, it fetches your attention with that ideation about the results of the action scenes. One has to think what would happen rather than thinking what's happening. That's some fun you know. However, i won't deny the fact that Dune is terribly slow in the first half with no proper conclusions about setting the plot. Thankfully, the second half comes as an improvement and even though we don't get to see a full stop at the end, it leaves us excited for the part two. Overall, another Worth Watching Villeneuve flick but please don't overhype it as if it is too great and Nothing like we haven't seen yet.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",Dune
30,matthewssilverhammer,Villeneuve is undefeated.,9,30 October 2021,"Dune is such an impressive feat of technical filmmaking; I partly believe they filmed this on-location in space. I wish it had a bit more levity, and I wish I was more personally invested in the individual characters, who have very few distinguishing characteristics (other than being portrayed by whatever famous person plays them). Nit-picking aside, this is giant, bold, gorgeous, epic, compelling, exciting, capital-C Cinema at its finest.",Dune
31,southdavid,Come to the Party.,9,27 October 2021,"My prior relationship with Dune was thus. I've never read any of the books, I've seen David Lynch's film a couple of times, but couldn't tell you much about it beyond Sting in a mankini. This is to try and demonstrate that I come to this film on its own merits and not with any built-in feelings for the franchise. Whilst I can understand anyone that argues that not much happens, personally I absolutely loved it.The planet of Arrakis is a desolate desert inhabited by a native people who have learned to live in its harsh environment. The planet though is covered in ""Spice"" a substance that is a vital component to interstellar space travel. The Emperor takes the planet from the cruel Harkonnen family and into the hands of the noble Atreides clan. This, however, is not an act of benevolence, but a calculated move to stretch the Atreides' resources thin, before the vengeful Harkonnens will take their revenge.Again, right up on Main Street, I absolutely loved this. I went to see an IMAX presentation, which was a great decision as the scale of the film is one of its star attractions. Giant space armadas, the size of the sandworm all benefit from the extra scale. The all-star cast is another pull, with all the main characters played by a recognisable face and some, such as Javier Bardem and even Zendaya who must have signed on knowing that they were likely to feature much more in a sequel, than in this film. The central relationship is probably between Paul, played by Timothee Chalamet, and his mother, played by Rebecca Ferguson. I thought that was believable, despite the age differences not really stacking up. This is perhaps only the second film of Chalamet's I've seen and I thought he carried the film well.I can't argue against anyone who found the film slow or lacking in action. Those opinions would be understandable, though I disagree, and liked that the film spent time building the relationships and telling us about characters before they are separated. To me, it made the losses feel greater. As I left the cinema, my immediate concern was that, as much as I enjoyed it, if the sequel and the rest of the story was never forthcoming, then the film becomes set up for a journey we'll never experience. Hopefully, based on the latest news that is not the case, but if you're reading this at some point in the future, and for whatever reason this is not followed up on, then knock a couple of marks of the score.",Dune
32,paul-allaer,Denis Villeneuve just proved once and for all that Dune is unfilmable,6,24 October 2021,"As ""Dune Part One"" (2021 release; 156 min.) opens, we are in the ""Year 10191, Caladan"", and we are introduced to Paul and his mother Lady Jessica. Paul's dad is Duke Leto, who is assigned by the Emperor to go to Arrakis, a desert planet that produces a certain spice which is indispensable for interstellar travel. At this point we are 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: director David Lynch gave it his best shot to turn the 1965 Frank Herbert sci-fi novel ""Dune"" into a worthy film in 1984, and more or less struck out swinging. Now almost 40 years later comes another respected and bold Hollywood director's attempt to do the same. Let me state upfront that I am a big, big fan of Denis Villeneuve, in my humble opinion one of Hollywood's very best directors these days (""Sicario"", ""Blade Runner 2049"", just to name those). My hopes and expectations hence were quite high, and I am sorry to report that they weren't met. It certainly isn't for a lack of trying or a lack of resources or casting. The production budget is a reported $165 million. The movie sports a veritable all-star cast (Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem). There is a noteworthy original score by Hans Zimmer (who else?). The production itself is out of this world. So what sinks the film? It is the byzantine plot, period. Almost from the get-go I found myself utterly lost, and I never caught up (I read the book decades ago). While this worked in the book because there we get all of the nuances as it plays out page after page, in the movie there is simply no time to explain all of it. That was true with the 1984 Dune film, and now also with the 2021 Dune film. In my mind, this proves once and for all that Dune the novel is unfilmable, period. Two of Hollywood's best directors gave it a shot, and they both misfired. So in the end the Denis Villeneuve interpretation of Dune turns out to be a beautiful mess. But still a mess. Please note that in the movie, the title shows as ""Dune Part One"", and it is clear that a sequel has been intended all along.""Dune Part One"" opened in theaters this weekend, while also streaming on HBO Max. Even though I have HBO Max, Dune is the type of film that needs to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. The Sunday matinee screening where we saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but by no means anywhere close to a sellout (I'm guessing 40% attendance in a large theater). The movie's opening gross in North America was a better than expected $41 million, all but assuring that the sequel will receive the green light soon. If you have read the book and/or seen the 1984 film adaptation, or you're simply curious what the hoopla is all about, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on HBO Max, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Dune
33,DarkVulcan29,Amazing sci-fi epic,9,29 October 2021,"I won't lie, I've never been a fan of Dune, even the 1984 film, although I found it amusing in spots. A friend of mine wanted to see this, so I thought i'd give this the benefit of the doubt.Now the film started out slow, to the point ya'll be dozing off and on, but once it started to pick up, it gets real interesting, and becomes more watchable. The scenery is very well designed, and all the actors really give it there all. Action scenes are okay, but the effects are oscar worthy. I liked the movie but it still didn't make a fan of Dune, I might check out part 2 when it comes out.",Dune
34,stevendbeard,For the Fans,7,22 October 2021,"I saw ""Dune"", starring Timothee Chalamet-Lady Bird, Love the Coopers; Rebecca Ferguson-Doctor Sleep, The Greatest Showman; Oscar Isaac-the Star Wars movies, Inside Llewyn Davis and Zendaya-the Spider_Man movies, The Greatest Showman.This movie has great special effects and a stellar cast but it is for the die hard fans-of which, I am not one of-and it is also part one of a two part movie. I vaguely remember the 1984 movie and the giant sand worms-yes, they are here too-but not much more. Oscar is the noble ruler of a planet that is trying to bring peace to all the other planets. Timothee is his son and heir and he has been having dreams of a planet with Zendaya on it. Rebecca is Oscar's....well, not really his wife but she is the mother of Timothee and lives with both of them. Oscar and family go to another planet to mine a rare spice and spread peace but some people don't want them to succeed. The rare spice is a valuable commodity-not as just a food additive-which if controlled by someone, would make them very powerful and the planet it is from is overrun with giant sand worms, as well. As I said, the effects are great and they have lots of cameos-I remember seeing Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem & Dave Bautista-who may or may not have bigger parts in the next installment.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours & 35 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be a good rental if you are a fan.",Dune
35,JoeB131,Dune- as Endless as a Desert.,4,23 October 2021,"There is probably no point in warning about spoilers for this film. You've probably read the book or seen either the 1984 Dino DeLaurentis version or the 2000 Sci-Fi mini-series.... If you've seen either one of those, you've seen this movie. This movie only covers half the story, the sequel we'll probably never get to see will cover the other half.So how does it stack up? Not well, in my opinion. It's a loud, dull action movie, with an ear-splitting soundtrack. It has all the scenes you might have seen if you watched either of those two versions, but didn't do them nearly as well.At two and a half hours, it drags on. The Lynch version of the film was 137 minutes, and got the whole story in. This film leaves key aspects out, and only tells half the story, and it just goes on and on and on.To start, let's talk about characters. DeLaurentis got a cast of largely unknowns back then, many of whom went on to distinguish themselves. Kyle MacLachlin, Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, Sean Young. Heck, even the little girl actress, Alicia Witt, went on to have a career as an adult. This movie uses a cast of people you've heard of, and their screen time is often based on ""I know who that is."" Other characters, more critical ones, were kind of shuffled to the side.I'll give two examples. A key point in the book is that the betrayal by Dr. Yeuh, (played here with no charisma by Cheng Chen) because as a Suk Physician, taking a human life is against his conditioning. No build up, no nothing, he just does it.On the other hand, because Duncan Idaho is played by Jason Momoa, he gets a lot more screen time than his presence in the book. (Duncan's clones become a much more important part of later books, but that's neither here nor there.) His final fight scene goes on interminably here, while they were quickly brushed over in the previous versions.Similarly, while Peter DeVries is a key player in the book, here they don't even mention him by name, and he's just ""Henchman who gets poisoned"". Other characters are omitted altogether, including Emperor Shaddam, Princess Irulan and Feyd Ruatha. Concepts such as the Mentats, Guild, Bene Geserit, are kind of glossed over to get to those sweet, sweet action sequences.The movie rises and falls on the actor who plays Paul Atreides... and again, he's actually closer to the age that the character is supposed to be at the beginning of the book, but he comes off as a little Emo.Again, trippy as it was, the 1984 version did this better. The Sci-Fi Channel did it better...
Now, this film really LOOKS good. The visuals are immersive. But without strong characters and story to back them up, what's the point? It's almost like watching a Transformers movie. The thing is, they HAD strong characters and a story... they just didn't use them.",Dune
36,kevin_robbins,This is an all-time great science fiction movie,10,22 October 2021,"Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timothée Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see. This is an all-time great science fiction movie that is an easy 10/10.",Dune
37,Jackbv123,Part 1,8,7 November 2021,"The only major complaint I have with this movie is what the opening title credit revealed. This is only Part 1. In general, I hate waiting around years to see a conclusion and usually avoid seeing the opener until the conclusion is available. Yet, after watching it, I wouldn't have wanted to try to squeeze the entire story into anything less than 4 hours which begs for having multiple parts. The ending to this movie marks an appropriate place to pause the story while providing a climatic scene.Timothée Chalamet plays Paul quite well. His dramatic timing is excellent. His physical features are not intimidating, but his bearing makes up for that to some extent. All of the acting is good.The script is amazingly faithful to the book as I remember it. Yet it didn't lack for suspense. Intimate familiarity with the book has rewards that compensate for the obvious foreknowledge. There are several symbolic images that might elude the newcomer. My mind automatically supplied ""Muad'Dib"" when Paul comes out of the sand tent and sees the desert mouse. Yet I don't think the newcomer will have too much trouble following the story since the movie provides explanations where they are necessary.",Dune
38,drqshadow-reviews,"Herbert's Dense, Moody Sci-Fi Classic Springs to Life",9,2 November 2021,"Tough to miss the marketing buzz for this high-profile, big-budget lunge for the blockbuster mantle. And, what a surprise, this time it's actually worth all the promotion!In Dune, the latest effort to convert Frank Herbert's intimidating and production-challenged novel to the big screen, creative heavyweight Denis Villeneuve has finally realized its potential. This is the rare case of a smart, lofty SF adaptation that remains fiercely loyal to the source material while also growing in more accessible, stimulating directions to appease a broader audience. Dare I say it... I think I might actually prefer this to the book? It's certainly more coherent than David Lynch's screwball 1984 adaptation.Clearly, plenty of thought and care went into interpreting and adapting the first volume's dense, tangled themes for the cinema - Villeneuve has confessed to being a lifelong fan - and, as such, it requires a comparable amount of scrutiny and undivided attention for newer fans to parse. But where the novel elaborates upon its wealth of interests (a deep dive of far-flung politics, culture, economy and revolution) through long, dry monologues and descriptions, the film is more fluid and efficient. We don't have to be told when we can be shown, and that's a particular area of strength for a work with this much world-class production design to spread around. God, it's rife with visual wonders.Even the expository bits, necessarily wordy by nature, are effectively managed to keep the viewer's head in the game. Everything doesn't have to be about talking heads, we learn, as Dune 2021 makes abundant use of subtitles to convey unspoken cues or nonverbal communication. That allows us to go far into the conceptual weeds without feeling verbose or static, a real godsend to a story that's so inherently brainy and long-winded. The ending is a mild letdown, a full hundred-fifty minutes of escalating stakes that culminates in a few meaningful glances and a ""see you in a few years,"" but the ride to get to that point is so well-balanced and riveting that I'm willing to let it slide. How long until part two hits the screen?",Dune
39,alindsay-al,A Good Film that Is a positive start for a new franchise,7,29 October 2021,"It has felt like forever but Dune is finally out and I have now watched the film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man attempting to find his place and learn how to be a leader while staving off enemy forces.Main Character
Timothy Chalamet plays the lead character Paul and he is good in this film. He just portrays the role well and you can see him struggling with his identity and the pressure that is put onto him, as the film progresses he grows in confidence and capability and he really does a great job of that. He isn't a character you will get that invested in emotionally but he has an interesting character progression and is an effective lead.Supporting Characters
Rebecca Ferguson plays his mother and she is really good. For me she was the real emotion of the film and you see this woman really get broken down due to her allegiances and loyalty to two different ways of life. She is a really strong actress and manages to stand out despite the top quality talent on show in this film. My other two favourite performances were from Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin, they don't get tonnes of screen time but I really like the heroic awesome warriors and they both do a great job at it and add some life into the film. Oscar Issac plays Paul's father and he is good in the role, I don't think it's his best performance ever but he is solid and you believe in his relationship with Paul and the dynamic that they have. Stellan Skarsgard, Javier Bardem and Zendaya also all do good jobs but they have pretty small roles here.Story
The story is a real coming of age story for Paul and in that I think it is effective and does its job really well. It introduces us to this new world and as an introduction I think it was also good at making me interested in the world and how things were done and run. But this film does have some issues, as a novice of the source material, I felt like so much was being thrown at me that it was hard to take it all in and really get to grips with exactly what character motivations are. Also the story feels a bit all over the place, it wants to fit lots in and it gets lost within each other.Script
The script is very dramatic and dark and it mostly works, I wanted to see these characters succeed in what they were doing but I did feel like that was mostly due to the quality of the acting. The humour is barely here, I am not asking for a laugh fest but it feels awkward when all the people are always monotone and incredibly serious.Style
This film looks gorgeous, the real star of the film is the cinematography and sound design as I was in awe watching it and listening to this incredible soundtrack. I liked all the technology and fight scenes too with some really interesting ideas put on the screen. But I had a real issue with the pacing of this film, it has a slow pace and it turned this 2 and a half hour film feel like a 4 hour film. I think this film could have ended at a certain point and I would have enjoyed it so much more, but it ended up dragging and overstaying its welcome.Overall
Overall Dune is a good film but for me felt short of my expectations. It feels like it is setting up the now confirmed sequel so much that it doesn't focus on the film at hand, it is still a good film and if that sequel really delivers then maybe it will all be worth it.",Dune
40,Fluke_Skywalker,Lacks Spice,6,25 October 2021,"More so than even 'Lord of the Rings', Frank Herbert's 'Dune' is an extremely difficult story to translate to film. All of the novel's many, many moving parts require the kind of explanation that just isn't possible in the format. Therefore you have to find a kind of cinematic shorthand the way David Lynch did with his polarizing 1984 adaptation. Or else you go w/a mini-series, which allows for a greater runtime ala the SyFy network's 2000 attempt. Here the solution was to cut the novel essentially in half. Unfortunately that creates an entirely different problem. Half a story simply isn't satisfying.The film itself is handsomely shot and the f/x are strong, though I dare say the design work is rather bland. The score by Hans Zimmer is an oppressive yet forgettable kit-bash of the ""exotic"" white noise that litters so many fantasy and sci-fi films in the 21st century. The characters are under-cooked, but the actors themselves are by and large solid.As someone who has read the novel three times I have a difficult time deciding if the uninitiated will have even an inkling of what's going on. But even if they do, I can't imagine that what we get here will ultimately be satisfying in a substantive way.",Dune

He travels there with his son Paul (Timothy Chalamet) wife Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and his council and army to begin. It is clear though that this shift in control is not favoured by the warlike Harkonnen or the mysterious desert people, the Fremen. Paul keeps having strange visions and at the same time there seems to be a belief by the Fremen that Paul may in fact be the 'one'.Villeneuve has clearly been attracted to the almost biblical epic nature of this vast and complex tale with its myriad characters and settings but has bought it to the screen particularly well. If ever a film has to be seen on the big screen with a stonking sound system, this is it, as hardly a scene goes by without breathtaking visions and sounds of a totally compelling and frightening world - this is truly a grand vision. It is pretty slow and often quite low key, but never boring and completely absorbs you from scene 1 punctuated by vast panoramas, amazing effects and spectacular battle scenes. The cast are fine with Chalamet holding his own as the hero with Ferguson even better as his wise but frightened mother. Watch out also for Stellan Skargard as the vile Baron Harkonnen - fabulously revolting creation.It should be remembered as per the opening titles that this is Dune Part 1 and as such you get the beginning and a large chunk of the middle of the story, there is clearly more to come (fingers crossed) for this to complete the full tale so don't be surprised when it ends.

44,Pairic,A Darker Dune,9,19 October 2021,"Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve.

I've never read the book(s?) and I don't really remember the '84 movie all that well. So I'm going into this fairly fresh and with no real explanations. That said...With all due respect to the brilliant Mr. Villeneuve, this felt like a massive superficial film that is a technical marvel but feels so hollow. Seriously, this thing is GORGEOUS with a capital everything, the sound is spectacular, it's shot beautifully but there just doesn't feel like enough meat beneath all the flash. It is a masterpiece on paper, with performances to match the visuals but after two and a half hours I felt like I was struggling to stay awake through an overlong prologue to an actual story.Yeah, this is going to be multiple movies (assuming they get the green light for another) and it feels like it. Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story. Still think it's worth checking out, just for the technical mastery and stunning presentation but... That's about all that's here.",Dune
47,aidanratesmovies,Star Wars- eat your heart out,9,23 October 2021,"A breathtakingly beautiful and fully realized concept, Dune may still have a handful of sillier moments- but it still manages to be pure sci-fi gold. First off, director Denis Villeneuve is an absolute genius, making some of my favorite films of all time, and some of the best sci-fi films in this millenia. His take on Dune is not only inspiring to watch, but also mesmerizing. You won't watch Dune feeling it to be a sci-fi film, nor really at all. This film is an experience, as if we have been placed in the future itself and are watching it unfold and I am absolutely awestruck at how Villeneuve is able to accomplish this. The acting is all rather solid, everyone does their best, but it's the characters that seem to be more the focus this time around, and i'm glad we have stepped out of that hole of just casting famous people in sci-fi films for attention. Rebecca Ferguson was easily my favorite throughout, although Jason Momoa, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsgard. Oddly enough I didn't feel the film was particularly great in its performance of Timothee Chalamet- not that he was at all bad- nor was his character- but his performance seemed to lack the charisma of so many others on screen- as well as Spider-Man actress Zendaya who hardly appeared in the film at all. As for the other aspects of this film, it's absolute gorgeous to look at. The visuals are astounding, the special effects are brilliant, and I absolutely adore the worldbuilding of the film and how grounded it all seems to be. There was a few ridiculous things I feel obliged to nitpick at, a moment of dumb toxic masculinity and a robot mosquito- but besides that- Dune was an unforgettable sci-fi masterpiece that I truly did enjoy and can't wait to see more of.My Rating: 9.5/10.",Dune
48,masonsaul,Phenomenal epic,10,24 October 2021,"Dune is a phenomenal epic that's thrilling, extremely engaging and emotional whilst also feeling extremely unique and different despite multiple adaptations already existing. Despite a slightly abrupt ending, the conclusion was still satisfying overall.Timothée Chalamet gives an incredible lead performance supported by Rebecca Ferguson and Jason Momoa, who are also incredible. Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster and Stellan Skarsgård are all great.Dennis Villeneuve's direction is superb, it's extremely well filmed with cinematography by Greig Fraser that is truly breathtaking and awe inspiring. It's extremely well paced, satisfyingly slow and immersive. The CG is consistently really impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer is perfect and so unique.",Dune
49,davidmvining,A solid beginning,7,25 October 2021,"Reminding me of the ending of The Fellowship of the Ring without the assured satisfaction that the next part is definitely coming, Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part One is a beautiful looking film that sets out to accomplish the impossible: telling the first half of a story. David Lynch managed an adaptation in the 80s that stuffed the whole plot of the book into a single two-hour and seventeen minute film, but Villeneuve has about two and a half hours to tell just the first half. The story has time to breathe now, and even though the film is largely setup without much of anything regarding payoff, it actually feels like a story being told rather than a series of events.I still hold the belief that one could adapt Dune into a single two-hour film. It would just require the cutting of a lot of stuff while finding the core of the story and nurturing that first and foremost. Villeneuve and his writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth went the much more traditional route of an adaptation of trying to include as much as possible. Well, that's not entirely true. They cut certain supporting characters like Feyd-Rautha and the Princess Irulan completely, characters who do have some limited presence in the first half of the book itself. That is not to say that there is no core to this telling, and I think the core is right.I've always maintained that the core of Frank Herbert's Dune was Paul's journey from boy to man to king to godhead, and that is the center of everything in Villeneuve's adaptation, mostly revolving around the relationship between Paul and his mother the Lady Jessica. Sent into what everyone in House Atreides knows is a trap, Jessica has to build off of what the Bene Gesserit sisterhood had established on the planet, the idea that the Fremen savior was coming. Jessica knows that for her survival as well as that of her son, they are going to need to play into these superstitions. This is established early, and the evolution of the idea is how the film ends, providing something like an arc for Paul, though it remains truncated.Around this is as much detail as can be stuffed into this movie, but Villeneuve's steady hand along with the healthy runtime never makes the film feel overstuffed. There's a lot going on, but it never feels like we're getting too much information. In terms of the extra detail brought in, I think my favorite is the focus on Leto's father and his death at the hands of a bull. Excised from every adaptation up to this point, it provides a sense of familial history about the dangers of taking unnecessary risks that helps color the family's move to Arrakis. There's also more attention paid to Duncan Idaho, the Atreides man sent to Arrakis first to make contact with the Fremen (which makes sense if the plan is to extend the films into a franchise where Jason Mamoa will pretty much become one of the most important stars in later installments).One of the things I love most about the film is its design and sense of scale. I think I would prefer Jodorowsky's more colorful variations on designs in the end, but the embrace of curves and impractical shapes for flying machines is a refreshing take on science fiction technology. The idea that a civilization tens of thousands of years in the future is no longer bound by how we move objects through space is nice, and the ovals, squares, and flapping wings of the ornithopters (finally realized in film properly) is all fun to look at. The different planets all have distinct looks that easily place the audience. Caladan is green and blue. Geidi Prime is black and gray. Arrakis is orange and white.In terms of the actual story, I'm not going to run through it. I will note some things, though. The relationships between the core three characters of Paul, Jessica, and Leto is strongly handled. Jessica obviously loves her son, and Rebecca Ferguson is a standout in the film for her performance, bringing both feminine strength and emotional openness to a well-written character. Oscar Isaac is strong, reserved, and fatherly as Leto, pushing his son to be as good a man as he can be, but also worrying for his safety in the face of danger. As the lead, Timothee Chalamet is fine. He's at a bit of a disadvantage because the central arc of the story is his, but it doesn't follow through. He starts the film as an eager, confused young man, and by the end he has to step into his own, moving beyond the objectives of his mother. He spends most of the movie quietly taking in the world and changes around him, but he does get some moments to shine. The supporting cast is mostly very good, my favorite probably being Javier Bardem as Stilgar. Sharon Duncan-Brewster is largely a non-entity as Liet, though. I imagine someone with gravitas holding the role again (like Max Von Sydow in Lynch's film), especially with Liet's expanded role in this film, and those scenes could just end up working better.In terms of some of the more fantastical aspects of the film, I think the film really captured some sense of otherworldliness that helps sell the universe. The Voice used by the Bene Gesserit is guttural and primal, and the way we see it through Paul's eyes gives it a dangerous factor as Paul loses even basic consciousness of what's happening. The visions, though, are something I really like. Visions and prophesies in stories are usually pretty mundane, straightforward, and entirely accurate predictions of what is to come. The visions here have some kind of tangential relationship to reality, most exemplified by Paul's vision of Jamis. In the vision, Jamis is a kindly and helpful Fremen, offering assistance to teach Paul the ways of the desert. Well, in reality, Jamis isn't helpful at all, but he does teach Paul the ways of the desert. It's a very interesting use of the concept.I was loving the movie at about the halfway point, but by the end my reaction was more muted. I think there are two main reasons for it. The first is Yueh. He's a linchpin on which the whole movie operates, and he's barely present, relegated to a plot point and not much else. In a large film like this, downgrading Yueh may be necessary, but it makes the key actions feel kind of out of nowhere which is not great for such a large change in direction for the movie's story. The other is the film's structure. As just the first half, we're left with the movie pretty much just stopping after the movie quiets down for a bit and we get one small spate of violence to end the film. It resolves nothing. Everything that's been planted in the first two hours go unexplored. The Fellowship of the Ring had a similar issue, but it felt like the end of a beginning. Dune just feels like it stops in the middle of a scene, more like the end of The Desolation of Smaug.Overall, I had a good time with the film. It's got great design, a wonderful sense of scale, good performances, and interesting looks at the world all while circling the central idea of Paul's journey. It's hampered by some stuff here and there, but not enough to completely demean the film.EDIT: Just an added thought that I had leaving the theater but forgot to originally include: Hans Zimmer's score is borderline embarrassing. It's 90% just noise. Zimmer can be very good. He obviously knows music, but whenever he's given carte blanche he goes extremely experimental and produces stuff that could be generously called interesting noise. This is that.",Dune
50,rgkarim,"A Desert Of Drama, Style, and Story: Game Of Thrones Meets Star Trek In This Modern Telling",8,23 October 2021,"LIKES:
The Pacing is Not Bad (most of the time)
A big surprise to me, this political thriller surprisingly moves at a decent pace despite everything it is introducing in the dense piece of literature it's based on. The establishment of the factions, the shots of the world, and getting to the planet are done in a very balanced manner, that allows enough time for you to get to know the characters, without being stuck on something for too long. Villeneuve and his writers managed to adapt the dense material of Science Fiction into a version for a lot of audiences and keep that balanced speed pretty much up to the last fifteen to twenty-five minutes of the film. A challenge that many fail in this day and age.The World Building:
I have not read the books, yet, but I've understood from others how much world building and development this series thrives on for being entertaining to the masses. Villeneuve and his cohorts achieve this mark for me, bringing out an amazing world developing experience in the visuals, the storytelling, and costumes that fill your screen for the nearly three hour run time. It's not just fleeting shots of ships, planets, and frontiers as some choose to do for time and budget. No, this particular installment takes the strengths of the modern era, and gives you plenty of time with the galaxy built by the author years ago. You'll get plenty of legend to the things dwelling on the planets, the evil nature of the mankind in the empires, to the legends and theology everyone follows. Where many books lose the translation of this for favor of keeping to a time, Dune makes sure to explore the facets and try to bait you into falling more into the lore of the movie. It's one of the strongest features of the film, and in true political thriller fashion, has those devilish details that pulled fans into nearly 8 seasons of debauchery.The Visuals/Cinematography
Dune is a movie that does not have the cheeriest of demeanors and it does not try to portray that in any light. Fortunately, a strong visual element will assist with this theme, utilizing fantastic visual style to convey so much the film is trying to tell you that may have been lost in the previous saga. The grey and ashen filters add an immersive element to the mix, helping you to feel the grit and grime of the desert planet Arrakis, and how harsh the landscape is. Wide angle shots and use of good CGI, show proportions of ships and landmarks to the small humans who crawl around them like ants. And the dynamic use of the camera, finding every shot to really give you the moment of the scene and have you feel the emotional kick. Those who say that this movie is indeed a cinematic masterpiece, aren't wrong when it comes to the visuals, and like HBO, has found the way to wrap you into the world and get you integrated into the movie even further. Even seeing the scale of the sandworms and what they can damage is brought to life, that visuals in the past could not copy given they did not exist.The Story:
I have to give them props, because all these elements due make an immersive story that HBO and Walking Dead held long ago. Dune's story has many elements done in a well-balanced manner, helping to give story guys like me elements to latch onto to help mitigate the other elements I do not find as entertaining. You want drama involving factions trying to stab others in the back and formation of shaky alliances? Dune is engorged with these elements. Need some type of mystical mystery and legendary prophecy made famous in Anime and Hollywood? Dune's got that to a degree to help layer a character. Want the venture into the unknown and attempts to travel a harsh landscape of life in more ways than one? Again, you've got that in spades, alongside hints of other elements that make gigantic worlds that book series like this thrive in. It's layered, it's got character development, and it's all laced with intrigue and a pace to keep you immersed into finding the end of this very bizarre rabbit hole.DISLIKES:
The Pacing At Times:
The movie does a great job with much of the pacing as I mentioned earlier, but there are times where like a video game racing, you get hit by the shell and spin out. For Dune, those moments for me involved Chalamet character's ""unique"" moments, something I can't go into too much detail to avoid spoilers. In these moments, the artistic side comes out, providing some dives into the events that are sometimes a bit off place and too frequent for a movie and better at home in a book. These moments sometimes are time beautifully, but other times are just extra details I did not need to see in such detail to bloat the already high run time. The only other area I had issues with, was the ending, where the cut off moment for the next part, starts to really wind down and drag in an effort to squeeze out that last bit of info to tease you. They are not the worst moments I've ever faced, but they were noticeable.Unexplained Storytelling Elements:
While much of the movie is explained and laid out, I agree with others that there is still some elements brought out and barely explained. Villeneuve is known to take liberties sometimes to tell a story, and those who appreciate subtle hints and letting a shot tell the bulk rather than an exhibition with concrete explanations, is bad at times. Primarily with some of Chalamet's qualities, alongside some of the technology and history, these elements ironically could have used some more time and attention to really draw a more complete circle. Not the worst, but certainly room for improvement, and would try to not be so subtle with key information for the character.Zendaya:
More so the lack of Zendaya. For someone billed in the top cast, I can't say that she deserved the merit of the top billed. When she's on screen, she's amazing as she continues to prove, but in this movie, the hype is much more than she actually is. I'm sure more will come if this Part 2 is made, however don't get your hopes up for incredible amounts of time on screen in this one. It's disappointing given how great she has done her roles for me, so here is hoping for the next part really utilizing her talents next go around.The Action:
Don't let the trailers fool you, or the genre tags on IMDB. Dune is not an action series and the hints of things you see are much like what you will get in this movie. A few passing moments and tech heavy scenes are cool, and there is one or two moments that build some momentum, however they fizzle out quickly, with most not lasting more than three minutes. The ending gets some things revved up, but the ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord Of The Rings"" statements in the trailers are hyperboles, unless you look at the new trilogy Star Wars then we hit closer to home. While I'm told Dune was never much about action, the modern marketing hints it is and I was not really that impressed outside of the cinematography and scale that Villeneuve does super well to execute. However, the ""climactic"" moments are minor for me, and only around hour mark 2 did I get any ""suspense"". It's very Game Of Thrones for this reviewer, more of the subtle and deceptive motions and key hits, than the dances of choreography that I particularly light in my epic blockbusters. If that's the kind of action you want, you are right at home, and it does fit with the themes, but don't think this is the John Wick, or LOTR battles that we fell in love with years ago.The VERDICT:
Is Dune the best movie of the year? Hmmm, not for me, but it's a fantastic modernization of the legendary picture that will appeal a lot of fans thanks to Game of Thrones. More like Star Trek and Game Of Thrones fusing together, this spectacle is beautiful across the board for visual storytelling. It's beautifully shot, the worlds are crafted, and the experience is there in so many levels, you will feel you are on Arrakis ready to tear into the Dunes. The characters have much to them, the cultures open up to an immense universe to get lost into, and the acting is magnificent on cylinders to really pull you into the political mess this tale is. And unlike the previous version, Villeneuve's tale does allow more exploration and immersion that fans like me love in films. However, in that regards, the Part 1 approach does cut the tale short, and the pacing and details can be thrown off by the restriction he still puts on this movie. Certain characters and their more intense details are limited at times, primarily Zendaya, and so you are warned that your favorite actors/actresses are not on screen for much of the time. Some of the visuals and sound elements fluctuate at times, but the theater will fix this, while the action will be much more limited than the hype the trailers are painting. Overall, the movie is definitely a great Drama/Space Opera, worthy of the theater to offset the limitations and to get Part 2 earlier will require you heading to the box office. However, the most epic movie still eludes this reviewer and I would say I've seen other movies I've found better than this piece. My scores for the film are:Action/Drama/Adventure: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",Dune
51,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Dune,7,26 October 2021,"First Denis Villeneuve decided to piggy back on Blade Runner. Now he's doing an update of 1984's Dune. Hey bro, how about coming up with some original material. Ha-ha just kidding.Anyhow, 2021's Dune is pretty uncompromising. I mean why wouldn't it be. This 155-minute flick is very epic in scope. It's sometimes Kubrick-an and almost every wide-angle frame is like a portrait. Villeneuve's lens is as big as Texas and you expect the Sand People from Star Wars to eventually show up (I mean the movie is called Dune). You'll sometimes be wowed by what's on display but you'll also be a little head-scratched.In truth, I've never seen David Lynch's '84 version and I've never read the book on which the film is based (I don't read). So yeah, I'll just lay out Dune's plot and get it over with. Paul Atreides (a smothering screen presence in Timothee Chalamet) is the ducal heir of House Atreides. Paul must travel to an evil planet to ensure that the safety of his family and people is secure. Dune takes place in the way-out future (10,191 ad to be exact). It's a stoned, fever dream that feels like total science fiction manifest.Denis Villeneuve's vision is completely assured even if Dune's story-line has thighs and ankles instead of legs. Villeneuve's vision will also creep you out as he gives us sandy white tropes, dragonfly spaceships, wonted opening credits, a glacial pace, and Hans Zimmer's almost demonized film score. Heck, you know this is a Denis Villeneuve pic from the first darn shot. As with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, Denis the menace is a creature of sculpted habit.All in all, Dune is not thinking man's sci-fi because well, it doesn't give you enough gumption to think. It starts somewhere in the middle and yup, its coda is somewhere in the middle too (I suppose that's why it's listed as Part 1). Whatever. Dune looks and feels like a million bucks (or $165 million if you're talking budget). There's a lot to admire here even if its disjointed narrative doesn't allow you to admire all of it.",Dune
52,rannynm,"A Modern Masterpiece - Brilliant Direction, Exceptional Visuals, Incredible Score, Great Cast",10,22 October 2021,"I love Dune. This film is almost like an introduction to a great story. When at the end Zendaya's character says, ""This is only the beginning,"" the foreshadowing tells me that there will hopefully be a sequel.Dune is an exceptional film directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted from the original sci-fi novel, written by Frank Herbert and published in 1965. Fans of the 1984 version directed by David Lynch - and newcomers to Dune -- will be fascinated to see Villeneuve's incarnation. I absolutely love the cast, cinematography, CGI, makeup and many other aspects of this film.The film takes place on an unfamiliar desert planet, Arrakis - the world of Arrakis is breathtaking. I love the culture of the planet, such as the languages they speak, the homes the characters live in, and, of course, the makeup and costumes have a huge effect on the aesthetic of this planet. The story centers on a young man named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) who has an important role: His family is responsible for mining a very valuable and powerful spice, which is the most precious element on Arrakis. As the story unfolds, it's easy to be captivated and mesmerized into the illusion that you as the audience are with the characters on Arrakis. At times, though, I felt I was almost missing parts of the story. Since this is an adaptation from a book, a lot of information has to be left out, and I left the theater wanting to know more about Arrakis. I also felt that the beginning is a bit slow and most of the action in this film takes place near the end, although that isn't a huge issue for me.Now let's talk about the acting and this great ensemble cast with Timothée Chalamet in the lead role and his peers: Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Oscar Issac and many others. I've been a huge fan of Timothée Chalamet for a long time and this is one of his best performances to date. I love his character - you can really see how at the beginning of the movie he is a vulnerable yet strong boy who eventually stands his ground and knows his place. I also love Zendaya's performance; throughout the entire movie I was waiting to see her appearance. I also love Jason Momoa's character, another one of my favorites. Finally, Oscar Issac and Rebecca Ferguson work really well together and deliver very engaging performances.The costumes are very detailed and intricate which bring out fascinating elements of the planet. And the cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual storytelling is so beautifully done and goes in perfect sync with the production design. It's important to acknowledge Hans Zimmer who composed all the music since his score brings the sci-fi storytelling to life.The message of the film is we all have a purpose, we should find our own voice and destinies and true empathy is as powerful as blood lineage in our world.I give Dune 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX if you can. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!",Dune
53,pc95,Villeneuve Cementing a Fan,8,31 October 2021,"After scoring with Blade Runner 2049, I was looking forward the Denis Villeneuve's re-creation of Dune, and I wasn't disappointed. The beauty of the sound and imagery is stunning, and the story giving a feel of both past and future. The look is undeniable. This movie's production design is a triumph. Acting meanwhile is earnest and straight-and-narrow. This was the best sci-fi movie I've seen since ""Moon"" with much larger budget and cast. It buries the funky 80s attempt which has aged fairly badly. Pity now we have to wait 2 year's for it's finale. Hoping Villeneuve tackles more Sci-Fi in the near future.",Dune
54,mhorg2018,"Not the travesty Lynch's version was, but far from a classic or decent adaptation",5,20 October 2021,"Dennis Villaneuve should be kept away from science fiction. This is his third loser in a row. He took a classic, talked up how it was going to be so faithful and... fell on his face. While this is closer to the book than Lynch's travesty, he picked and chose what he would use and what he would change. Changing the gender of Liet-Kynes made no sense. Dune is filled with powerful woman characters-so this was just a crass PC/woke move. The guy playing Paul, the pivotal character in the first two novels, looks too soft for the role-although his acting was all right. Where is Feyd-Rautha? Not here at all. How about a two second explanation of what a Mentat is. Nope. Not here. No mention of humans not using computers, either. At least they mentioned the navigators, although they didn't show them. The pacing of this film is, in parts glacial and design, with spaceships that look like blimps-unimpressive. Rebecca Ferguson looks too young to be Lady Jessica. The rest of the cast is ok. Some parts look like they're mimicking the Lynch version. The director should have watched the then Sci-Fi channels adaptation which remains the best. Unless this really rocks the box office world-I doubt there will be a concluding film.",Dune

56,denis888,"To Tell The Truth, I Am Not Impressed",4,31 October 2021,"Well, where to begin here? Long, very long movie of a very slow pace, with very dark and gloomy lights, very dour mood and very depressing feeling overall. It produces a rather sour taste and this sand sees to ooze everywhere. Timothée Chalamet is OK, but he is not yet the star to save the whole production. Other more mature stars, like Rebecca Ferguson or Oscar Isaac seem to be slightly better off here but the whole plot does not allow the to be beyond very tight frames which stifle them a lot. Zendaya or Josh Brolin are so limited in their screen time that it is almost null and void. Maybe, Jason Momoa is the real winner here with his bright and powerful prsence.Generally, the aftertaste is dour and sour and leaves no desire to wait for the second part, as the unbearably slow tempo of the first part and dark brooding atmosphere produce very limited wish to persevere.I'd say I am not impressed. Surely, this one is better then the awful 1984 version but still leaves much too much to be desired. To tell the truth, this is not my Captain speaking.",Dune
57,nancyldraper,Grand,8,22 October 2021,"If you have been patiently waiting for this film to be released because you are a fan of the epic book trilogy, I don't think you will be disappointed. Denis Villeneuve spent a great deal of his budget on sound, special effects, music and the pace of performances to make you feel you were watching something truly big and epic (perhaps I should tell you I saw it in an UltraAVX theatre). I should probably also tell you that CALL ME BY YOUR NAME makes it hard for me to like Timothée Chalamet in any movie just as EX MACHINA put me off Oscar Isaac (perhaps I have to get better at distancing an actor from a role. Surely, if their performance is that good that you have an enduring hate for their character/person, they must be accomplished in their craft? - Sorry, I digress). All that to say, this film cleared the field for both Chalamet and Isaac (they will be relieved, I'm sure), I totally bought in to their new characters. The acting is outstanding in this and the stand out performers are myriad and stellar. Indeed, that was crucial, as more of this movie depends on character than it does on furthering the action. I only have two issues with this film: often I found the sound effects, accents or volume of the dialogue obscured the words (I'm looking forward to seeing it again with closed caption) and, as previously hinted at, I found the pace of the actual story telling to be compromised by the grandeur. I give this film an 8 (grand) out of 10. {SciFi Classic}",Dune

60,martimusross,Totally Brilliant!,9,18 October 2021,"DuneJust got back from the unlimited screening at Cineworld of Dune, a truly gargantuan movie at 2 hours and 35 mins.After a disappointing Bond and a tepid continuation that was Venom, this movie totally nailed it. I thought it was totally brilliant and we are at the start of a new fabulous franchise, a story we have waited for over 30 years for someone to make a decent fist of!It was merciless if you had been living under a rock and had no clue what Dune was, difficult to believe but it happens. It was dark, moody, complex, with a multiplicity of characters and layers of meaning and intrigue. Of course we had the three set pieces for the fans, the gom-jabar, the assassination and Duncan Idaho, and these did not disappoint.This movie was so brilliantly paced, dwelling on the characters during internal conflict and then rushing forward with the action.The two things that make this movie a classic of our time, the micro gestures and styling that stamp this movie as something brand new, the second is the masterful editing, we moved from inside Paul's head to Jessica's and back again.The casting was inspirational in putting Rebecca Ferguson (not a fan) and Timothy Chalamet together, they totally clicked and Mr Villeneuve really got them to act their socks off! Of course much was missing, but there is no rush as this can be included in the next part and it seems sensible to have some measure, as it was it was an exhausting watch.Special mention must go to the scoring, it set the scene and was inspirational, this is an obvious Oscar in 2022.Whilst controversial Timothée Chalamet is perhaps the most charismatic actor alive today (Tom Hardy is my number 2) there is nothing this man cannot do and here he delivers in spades. I have read some remarks that Timothee's acting is merely proficient or perhaps nothing special and can't understand the ""fuss"", in response I would refer to the layered nuance of the Bene Geserit test, we went from irritation, to burning, to pain, a physical manifestation, alongside shock, defiance than resignation, an emotional manifestation, all at the same time in a three minute section of the movie. If you think this is pedestrian you try it in front of a mirror.I find one fault with this movie so it's a 9 outta 10 from me, to gender swap and racially rinse Liet Keynes, a much loved and established literary character, for no other reason than a political statement will always be unacceptable.",Dune

The film, however, has two main problems, the first is its monstrous slowness which makes it really difficult to watch because some scenes could easily be cut without impacting the perception of the film, the second problem is the ending because the latter is missing as this film is only an introduction and for this reason when you leave the theater you feel like you have wasted only time in a film that was absolutely nothing.",Dune
63,lambiepie-2,Visually Wonderful Part One,7,24 October 2021,"There is no doubt that this DUNE is visually wonderful. Grands sets, wonderful costumes, Oh my goodness - spectacular! Great music from Hans Zimmer! That's what kept me interested to start.And that there are actors in this that are beyond prolific in their roles -- the adult main actors, Oscar Issac, Rebecca Ferguson, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Stephen McKinley, Charolette Rampling(!), Stellen Sarguard and so many more, when they came on screen were interesting and forceful and convicted in their roles. They had my attention from time to time too.But the main male character young actor, Timothée Chalamet, just couldn't bring me into this more than what Kyle MacLachlan's portrayal did - as Kyle had that twinge of a 'mean-boy thing' going on that comes across in the roles he plays; and Timothée just doesn't have that coming across the screen with this. Timothée was lost and a bit milquetoast in the role. (To be honest, I wondered if the film was done 8 years ago if Kit Harrington would have been the better Paul... eh..) But this is NOT to dump on Timothée as I saw other material he acted in and did well. He just doesn't work for me in this Part One.It is about 'story'. And just like the 1984 one, this too is, is eh -- for me but again...a visionary triumph no one can deny! It's not enough tho' to wrap myself around ""the story"" and be interested in ""it's hero"". Maybe because this is is 2 and a half hours of Part One.Will I see Part Two? Will Timothée have more to chew on and prove me wrong about him in this role? Eh. Like I wrote, I love the visuals, the costumes, the music, the other actors. Dropping into a Part Two though... to see who becomes King of the Spices...eh.",Dune
64,thekarmicnomad,A bit of an info dump with flouncy fight scenes - but I enjoyed it. roll on part two.,7,25 October 2021,"The characters and actors are amazing in this. I really liked all of them and I got a good feel for everyone and got invested.But this is Dune and there is so much to unpack.Most films have about four or five moving parts - to have any chance of understanding Dune you need to know about the factions, the planets, the politics, the bloodlines, the spice, the supernatural, the worms, the space ships, the weapons, even the clothes are important.There is so much that needs to be explained and so many vision sequences it leaves little room for anything else. This film warms up at about the ninety minute mark, where a lot of other films are rolling credits.The fight scenes broke up all the explanation but, despite having some great effects, the fights were a bit dull. At times I felt like I was watching Westside Story as the armies ran at each other, their little swords drawn and danced around one another.I am not sure the logic of the shields worked either - a lot of those blows didn't seem very slow.I did enjoy this though.The story was interesting and engaging (even though I already know it) and I was left wanting more.At times it is a big, dry slice of pie you have to gobble down, but it is a tasty one.There is a lot of space opera here - but I mean that in the best possible way.Of course this is in two parts and although it means paying twice I think that was the right decision.",Dune

My assumption about TV was I would screen it on TV and if I loved it as much as the original, I would go to the movies and spend the $. About 10 minutes in I was really bored. Acting is terrible. Not just poor, but terrible. Everyone was terrible. The ""special effects"" are certainly unimpressive. Especially considering it's 2021 not 1984. Then there's the music, which is so poor you probably never thought about it. And worse than anything else, the direction and the photography are film school level.

Amazing interior and exterior designs; perfect cinematography and use of every type of shot to showcase the incredible sets (virtual or not); and riveting action sequences with a level of tension hard to find in the typical blockbusters.The acting from the protagonists Chalamet and Ferguson is as pristine as every shot (the rest of the cast either has simple characters with not that much depth, or not enough to do in this first part).To say something not quite as perfect: the dreamlike tone of the film doesn't mesh as well with the more exposition heavy parts of the second act.

Paul Atreides(Timothee Chalamet), the son of a royal family, is given the responsibility to protect the most precious resource in the entire galaxy.Dune is a mind-blowing film. Director Denis Villeneuve can absolutely do no wrong, after back-to-back masterpieces like Enemy(2013), Prisoners(2013), Sicario(2015), Arrival(2016), Blade Runner 2049(2017) & now this movie. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. The action set pieces are fantastic. What's really impressive is that they shot most of the movie practically, rather than opt for the oft-used CGI. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is otherworldly. Timothee Chalamet is spectacular as Paul Atreides. Rebecca Ferguson is outstanding as Lady Jessica Atreides. Oscar Isaac is brilliant as Duke Leto Atreides. Jason Momoa is excellent as Duncan Idaho. Stellan Skarsgard is unforgettable as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Josh Brolin is awesome as Gurney Halleck. Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Chen Chang, Dave Bautista, David Dastmalchian & Zendaya are amazing as Stilgar, Dr. Liet Kynes, Dr. Wellington Yueh, Beast Rabban Harkonnen, Piter de Vries & Chani, respectively.

70,bankofmarquis,The Definitive Film Version for the Fans,8,24 October 2021,"Fans of the 1965 Frank Herbert Sci-Fi Fantasy Masterpiece DUNE can finally rejoice - the definitive film version of this novel (at least the first 1/2 of the novel) has made it's way onto the screen.Lush, dense, rich, well cast and acted with eye-popping visuals that should be seen on the big screen, Directer Denis Villaneuve's DUNE is everything that a fan of the book (that would include me) has been waiting for in a film version. It IS the ""Peter Jackson LORD OF THE RINGS"" version of this book - finally!The question is, how does this film work for casual fans of the book - or for the myriad moviegoers that have never read the novel it is based on.And, I'm afraid, the answer there is ""not as well"". For Dune is a dense novel, filled with mythology that does go somewhat deep in the movie. This makes the pacing of this film problematic - especially at the beginning, for the novice - but is ""deep enough"" for those that have read the books.Let's start with what works - and that is the visuals that Director Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and his crew put on the screen. They are incredible. Unfortunately, most casual on-lookers to this film will decide to check out this 2 hour and 35 minute epic at home for free on HBO MAX, and that would be too bad. This film needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible to totally immerse you in this world.Villeneuve perfectly cast this film from top to bottom starting with Timothy Chalamet as the hero of this book (and series) Paul Atreides. He brings the right balance of cockiness and unease to Paul who grows into something more than the ""perfect prince"" as the story progresses.He is joined by some of the finest performers working today. Rebecca Ferguson and Josh Brolin bring their star power to the roles of Paul's Mother (who is something more than Paul's mother) and the head of the military (who is something more than the head of the military). Both of these roles needed to be played by a strong force - and both fill this need admirably.The always good Oscar Isaac is the right choice for the role of Paul's father, Duke Leto Atreides, who - by story necessity - is underwritten and, therefore, this film/role does not showcase his talents.However, Jason Mamoa SHINES as Warrior Duncan Idaho. This is one of my favorite characters from the book and Mamoa brings his ""A"" game to this charismatic warrior/mentor to Paul. It was the largest pleasant surprise of the performances for me.Alas, the villains of this piece - Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his nephew, Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) are relegated to background ""mustache twirling"" villains, they were not able to showcase their talents in this film. But, at least, we did not get the ""golden speedo"" that Sting wore in the 1984 David Lynch film version.Also, not being able to showcase their talents is Javier Bardem and Zendaya as members of the Freman (the subjugated native people of the ""Dune"" planet). They are both in this film, briefly, as their characters rise and shine in the 2nd half of the book - so, hopefully, we'll get to see more of them, then.Which is the other part of this film that will turn off the casual viewer - it only covers (by necessity) the first half of the book, so only tells half a story with no real emotional payoff. For me, a fan of the books, I was fine with this as I am eagerly anticipating the 2nd film - but as a viewer who is just gonna ""check this one out"", I'm not so sure that the visuals of this film will be enough to satisfy them.Come for the visuals, stay for the performances and the dense story and prepare for Dune: Part 2.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Dune

72,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Lives up to the hype,8,22 October 2021,"I didn't think Hollywood still had it in them to make such a beautiful and epic sci-fi drama with an intelligent story. And here they go, they actually delivered on the hype. This might be the 21st century answer to Star Wars.No need to cringe at that previous statement as I know Dune dates before Star Wars and that Star Wars borrows many ideas from Dune's Novel. It's clearly evident in some of the similarities. My point is that we need a good sci-fi drama to replace what The Mouse destroyed. Warner Bros might be the company that brings us a new sci-fi trilogy we need. At least I hope their is a sequel. I would be disappointed if this film is just a one film.BTW, I loved the dragonfly helicopters :) and the acting performances from Chalamet, Isaac, Momoa, Ferguson, Bautista, Chalamet, Rampling, and Skarsgård were absolutely stellar.People, watch it in DolbyVision HDR on a oled tv. The eye candy is unbelievable!",Dune
73,abisio,"Too slow, very unfocused and missing important parts",4,26 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is not a bad director; but has a really pacing issue. Most of his movies like The Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 over welcome their stay. Both of them could have been far better with some minutes less and more focus on the main story.DUNE makes exactly the same mistake; most of the movie is in David Lean mode (Lawrence of Arabia) with too long takes on the desert, on the rocks or deep dramatic and profound looks of the main characters. Adding to the agony; the very confusing dreams or visions; and about a 1000 takes of Zedaya digitally enhanced blue eyes; there is very little time left in the two and half hours to complete properly the story. Solution; trust people to see the older movies, the tv series or read the book and take out essential parts. The Baron other nephew (Feyd), the Emperor and his daughter or transport union creatures are nowhere to be seen.The conflict of interest is barely explained in a few lines of dialog; the Duke achievements with the Fremen are not given any importance.A friend of mine, not familiar with the above, ask me what was happening and who were some of the characters; so do not expect to understand most of it if you are not familiar.In the acting department; Chamalet is fine but he does not look as a rebel fighter; more as a scared young boy some mother issues. Fergusson however is very good she even survives her many many face close-ups.For those who complained about Lynch's 1984; in this one story is the basically same but with slower pace. Lynch made a more compelling first part in 60 minutes with far easy to understand and with more character development than the 150 minutes in the new version. The only noticeable difference; the insinuation of some complot from the Bene Gesserit with Jessica involvement.Last but not least; while the visuals are too spectacular; action scenes are not and with little or not emotion.In brief; better visuals but not much more than the old movie and the series.",Dune
74,bob-the-movie-man,"""He's Not The Messiah - He's a Very Naughty Boy!""",10,19 October 2021,"Certain works of fiction have been labelled with the tag of ""unfilmable"", and Frank Herbert's 1965 novel ""Dune"" is one of those. It's full of exposition done as internal monologues - which screams ""movie voiceover"". And regular readers will know my hatred of those!Amazingly, Denis Villeneuve manages to pull off the impossible with his version of Dune (part 1), which I saw last night as part of a Cineworld Unlimited preview event. It's close to being a movie masterpiece.Positives:
My 10*'s for this one goes for the overall vision, which is grandiose with scenes that stick in the brain. As he demonstrated in ""Arrival"", Villeneuve likes to go for huge spacecraft that hang ""in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't""*. And the ships in this vision are just HUGE.The ensemble cast does a great job, with Chalamet, Isaac and Ferguson being particularly impressive. Stellan Skarsgård (looking like he is about to tell ""a very amusing story about a goat"", if you get that movie reference!) looks to have the most gruelling acting job, having to emerge from, and descend into, a bath of black goo!Much like Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2049"", this movie has cinematography that is worthy of framing and sticking on your wall. (Greig Fraser is the man behind the camera here).Hans Zimmer's music is phenomenal. I'm not sure it's a good 'sit down and listen to' sort of soundtrack, but it fits the movie beautifully.Negatives:
It wasn't a problem for me, but I expect some will consider the movie to be too much mood and not enough action. I've seen some comment that the film was ""emotionally empty"": but I really didn't feel that, and am well-invested in the story ready for ""Part 2"".This is probably faithful to the books, but given all of the advanced spacecraft technology on show, and laser/blaster technology, it seems bonkers that when we get to hand-to-hand combat between the armies that we get into ""swords and sandals"" territory.Deja vu?: There's nothing new under the Tatooine suns. And so much of this film has you linking the concepts back to ""Star Wars"":""The Force"" is now ""The Way""The Jedi are the 'Ben and Jerry Set'. (Well, that's what it sounded like to me... and I don't even like Ice Cream! 🙂 )Both films centre on a Messiah-like ""chosen one"", foretold by legend""Spice"" also features in ""Star Wars"" with ""spice runners"" (as in the Millenium Falcon doing the 'Kessel Run')
There's even a 'pit of sarlaac' moment in ""Dune"".Of course, since Frank Herbert wrote ""Dune"" in 1965, there's a significant question as to who is plagiarising who here!Summary Thoughts on ""Dune"": At 2 hours 35 minutes, it's YET ANOTHER long movie: cementing October 2021 as the month of long movies. But this is a movie that MUST be seen on the big screen. It's a memorable movie experience and highly recommended. I can't wait for Villeneuve's ""Part 2"", currently in pre-production.(For the full graphical review and video version, please search for #onemannsmovies online. Thanks.)",Dune
75,HabibieHakim123,Incredibly Well Made Remake Yet Not Finish But Worth To Watch And Worth To Wait,9,13 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's Dune is not a perfection because it's still a preparation, a very very well made preparation, a perfect build for what i hope is gonna be a massive and incredible war, more incredible than the original 1984 Dune, Denis Villeneuve's Dune also fills with an amazing performance by all the cast, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is for me something special because the movie can keep me personally awake for 2 hours and 35 minutes and for a preparation movie with a very little big action scene it's very impressive, compare to Avengers Infinity War (which is another preparation movie to Avengers Endgame), Denis Villeneuve's Dune is mostly talking and it's work, is it better than the original Dune? Well, that's a joke for me because even the first 10 minutes of the film is already better than the original and the whole movie completely is not finish, overall, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is an incredibly well made remake yet not finish but it's worth to watch and worth to wait.",Dune
76,Snootz,A MIXED ADVENTURE,5,19 October 2021,"I'm not going to take the position of a ""Dune Fanboy"" who believes a Dune movie can do no wrong. This version suffers from a poor choice of actors. Leto does not have the screen presence of a Duke, Paul does indeed look like a boy and I'm sorry... that's just not Lady Jessica. Duncan Idaho was better portrayed than any other character and really, seemed the only heart and soul in the entire film.Deviation from the original book is okay; I expect such in a movie. But this deviated needlessly, in ways that had me yawning. Presentation was poor. In a major battle scene the suits worn by the Fremen and Sardukar were so similar it was difficult to tell one from the other. The sandworms are not nearly as impressive as prior movies. Many vital dramatic points of the book (and prior movies) were left out, which cost a great deal of essential character.I was disappointed to find out it was Part 1 of (what 2, 3, 4?). There was nothing in the trailers that indicated this would be a multi-year series. Gah. This wasn't a ""slow burner""; it was a fizzle. In this day of superb CGI in even the most basic films I wasn't impressed by the ""special effects"". There was far too much time spent on trivial drama without nearly enough focus on key plot elements.What was most missing in this version is the heart that made Dune such a masterpiece. The plot moves more slowly than the Baron, and in the end it was simply disappointing. I expected far more from a movie made in this decade than those made 21 and 37 years ago. Another reviewer mentioned this was very much like the TV miniseries created in 2000. I have to agree.I don't demand constant action/adventure in films, especially in a cerebral classic such as Dune. But I did expect some directing skill in both screen adaptation and directing. We're disappointed to find neither in this rendition. It's a shame to wait so long for a film, only to find the anticipated blockbuster is yet another mediocre attempt at bringing the impressive world of Dune to the main screen... and not all that different from what has gone before. I think that's what surprises me most is that it isn't significantly better than it is. They should have titled this ""Dune Retro"".",Dune
77,Sir_AmirSyarif,An immersive cinematic experience,9,19 October 2021,"Modern master Denis Villeneuve delivers a masterful, spectacular adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic. 'Dune' takes its time to build and present its universe, but Villeneuve makes the most out of his canvas, using score, sound, and design to tell stories, and building the atmosphere with Greig Fraser's cinematography. The performances are uniformly excellent with Timothée Chalamet holds his own in his first blockbuster leading role. An immersive cinematic experience.",Dune
78,kjproulx,The Fresh Piece of Cinema I Needed,10,8 November 2021,"When it comes to Dune, I'll admit right off the top that I haven't seen or read any other iterations. I went into this film almost completely cold, only knowing the basics of the overall story and having watched the trailers a couple of times. The idea of grand storytelling put in the hands of a filmmaker like Denis Villeneuve is noteworthy, to begin with, but when you have his capabilities as a director, the vast world-building of a story like Dune will be one for the ages. Now, this is very clearly only the first half of a story, and keeping that in mind, some of my complaints may be resolved in a couple of years if this story ever gets finished, but that's my little asterisk to start. Here's why I believe every film lover in the world should flock out to see this one if they can so that more films like this can be made.In a galaxy where something known as Spice is the most precious element, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) begins as the son and heir to the throne of House Atreides. There are multiple houses in Atreides, Harkonen, and Corrino, which the film explores equally (for the most part). This was daunting to me at first, but I thought the thought-provoking nature of the film and how it took its time over the course of two and half hours, I was able to immerse myself in this world. Having visions of a woman on a planet called Arrakis, Paul instantly becomes the central character of this overarching story. Not a lot happens story-wise throughout this film, but it's very clear that this is building towards something big. Everything that does happen throughout this film though is simply breathtaking from a filmmaking point of view.At this point, it's safe to call director Denis Villeneuve one of the greatest working directors at the moment and some even consider him the greatest of all time, period. I have loved nearly every single one of his films to date (having seen most of them) and I think Dune may actually be his crown jewel. The way his storytelling techniques lend themselves to this story just felt so seamless. Along with the incredible collaboration with cinematographer Greig Fraser, the look of this film was elegant in every sense of the world. The scope was made massive due to the camera techniques here. I've loved all of his work since really noticing him in 2016 with the film Lion.I could go on forever about how immersive this film feels from beginning to end, so I'll just cap that off by stating that the score by Hans Zimmer basically becomes a character of its own through the film. His work is usually always stellar and he has only proven himself even more so once again here. Dune, although slow, is absolutely riveting, and that's in no small part to Zimmer's work. This is the type of film that cares about every single intricate detail and I wouldn't be surprised if it's the next Blockbuster to garner numerous awards at the Oscars next year.In the end, from this incredibly massive cast of A-Listers to a story that plays out very nicely and leaves you eagerly wanting more, with direction that's some of the best in years, Dune is simply one of the best films you'll see in 2021. If you're hoping for a complete story, please adjust your expectations going in. The intention was to make a series of films that slowly tell the story of the Dune novel and I think Part One told this portion of the story beautifully. Again, I have not read the novel, so this is solely based on my experience with the film. Simply put, this movie blew me away for many different reasons. I can see how some viewers may find the film too odd or too slow, but I'm very aware that's what Villeneuve was going for and it's soectacular. I can't wait for Part Two.",Dune
79,Movi3DO,Blessed my eyes Blessed my ears,10,25 October 2021,"Dreams are messages from the deep.Just let the small negatives out of the way first. Some parts were a bit slow, and characters murmured a lot so I couldn't hear some lines. Also it's quite a bit of info into the universe.Now that's done, I first want to say that Dune: Part I was a cinematic masterpiece. Almost every single scene was handled masterfully with cinematography that blessed my eyes. Never have I seen the desert this beautiful and dreamy. It was so breathtaking that I might suffocate.Not only that, the unbelievable scores from Hans Zimmer created an immersive atmosphere. I have been listening to Paul's Dream and Ripples in the Sand for about 3 months now, and I just could not get tired of them. They sounded just as good, and even better in the theater.The characters looked amazing as well. The suits that Oscar Isaac and Timothee Chamalet wore were so classy, as well as the other designs. There were an absurd amount of close ups of characters' face, and each one of them was beautiful, especially the Fremen with their blue eyes.Since this was only part I, the plot wasn't complete, but it showed great potential for an action-packed ""cinematic party"" - as said by Denis Villeneuve.Overall, probably the best looking film I have seen in a long long time.

In the end, I decided to go with 10 stars, as it is a magnificent adaptation of the book and it is a vastly better adaptation than the highly flawed Lynch movie from the 1980s. The reason I'm having a small debate is, that it's only a half of the novel, waiting to be concluded in a next movie, which is something I truly hope will happen, as Villeneuve's Dune deserves to be completed.Dune is a tremendous achievement and a first movie in ages, that has managed to leave me speechless. It is a massive epic in every sense of the word, leaving you craving more. It's definitely a movie you need to watch, as Dune really rises the bar to a whole new level.",Dune

What a huge disappointment after so much hype around it. Waste of time. The over dramatic seriousness of the characters made it even worst. The movie was boring, dragging and had too many unnecessary scenes that didn't contribute to overall plot of the story, they should've just made it a TV Series instead. Nowhere near as gritty or screwed up as 1984 original cat milk. Fun fact there are 3 versions of Momoa in movie. Long beard, short beard and no-beard.

84,djurrepower,Even better when watching a second time,8,31 October 2021,"A friend of mine wanted to watch this movie with me, but I already went to see it. But I decided to just go a second time. And I didn't regret it.I think most people can agree that this movie is visually stunning. But that opinions are divided on the story.I have to admit. After my first watch, I was kind of dissapointed on how there wasn't a clear story. And I felt that the movie didn't have much meaning. But now I can see that I was wrong.Knowing all the story elements beforehand allowed me to follow details I missed earlier. I was able to understand a lot of the symbolism, and the visions made a lot more sense.Also, small scenes that didn't really make sense, suddely had purpose. And with my second viewing I had a lot of 'aha' moments.So now I was able to understand that this movie has a lot of stories and worldbuilding, each woven into eachother. Seeing now how everything is linked together made me appreciate the writing even more.The only somewhat negative thing that I have to say, is that this is clearly part one. And that for a standalone movie, this movie doesn't leave you with much catharsis. This entire movie is basicly the 'call to action' in the standard 'hero's journey'.But all in all, I think this movie certainly deserves it's praise.8/10: great movie.",Dune

87,SoumikBanerjee25,Villeneuve's Dream Project!,9,28 October 2021,"""A Great Man Doesn't Seek to Lead. He's Called to It. And He Answers""Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a cinematic chef-d'oeuvre. From its staggering sets to its awe-inspiring visuals; on the account of the sheer scale of the presentation, it is no less than an extraordinary accomplishment.Led by Villeneuve's gifted conception with a substantial back-up from his apprentice (Cinematographer) Greig Fraser. Hans Zimmer comes alongside with his yet another piece of perfection; this guy can't do any wrong, can he?What impressed me the most is despite being centred mostly around a desert, and subsisting low on exuberance and colours; it never failed to astound me with its articulated framing and multifaceted shot composition. Undisputed credit must go to the entire technical crew for embracing such a difficult challenge and making the impossible possible.Based upon Frank Herbert's original novella with the same name; Dune inherently captures the essence of Power Politics. An intricate take upon diversified lineages, their distinctive sentiments, their varied beliefs; in short, establishing a notable image amassing all the different sects of the civilization.Loyalty, Allegiance, Betrayal; while on one hand, Dune tries to symbolise a lot of modern-day society through its innate storytelling mannerisms, on the other hand, the narration carves deeper into real-world issues concerning nefarious discrimination, cultural genocides or simply the authoritarian politics that come into play every freaking time.Coming down to Performances, Timothée Chalamet is a convincing lead, the same goes for Rebecca Ferguson. Both of them worked great as this Mother-Son duo. Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa; the cast, in a nutshell, is a powerhouse of abilities. And guess what? They all been their usual selves. Thus, no complaints.That being said, sadly the characterization in my opinion has left a large enough void that is yet to be fulfilled. Given the perceivable circumstances and their pre-made plans for a continuation, for the moment I would like to reserve my final verdict. Even though by the looks of it, I'm pretty confident that I can be comfortably optimistic.In the end, all I wanna say is that this is without a question Villeneuve's dream project. The passion and the appetite can be easily noticed in every frame. Dune undeniably is entitled to all the appreciations that may and will come along its way.And there's no doubt that he has set a new standard with his near-flawless execution, my only concern is that it would be harder to contest the next time he introduces us to the sequel. It remains to be seen, whether this Dune Duology could hold the legendary status of a lifetime or will it gradually fade away into oblivion!",Dune
88,mahmus,I didn't want it to end.,9,24 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's Dune is exactly what I wanted it to be. A big, epic sci-fi story with deep lore and world-building, full of gorgeous visuals and spectacular set pieces.I didn't want it to end. I was completely willing to sit through another hour or two. I was so invested in the story that I wish it had kept going. A second one must happen. It's for the good of mankind.",Dune
89,ThurstonHunger,Accelerated course for Dune,7,2 November 2021,"Having read several of the books decades ago, and seen the two previous movie attempts, this feels a little bit like the re-telling of a family/story myth. So familiar, but you look for variations.I suspect others are in this boat. I did watch at home, and am sure on a bigger screen it would be more impressively enveloping. Not much is made of the Guild Navigators, although the Bene Gesserit are well-detailed. Some pronunciations were changed if I recall from the past, ""Muad Dib"" for one, and ""Arrakis"" at times worded interestingly like ""Iraqis.""Felt the film used subtitles well for other truly foreign languages (if you hate subtitles as some do, then better brush up on your Sardaukar ;>)I tried to know little about this version going in, including the fact that there is a second part to come. The romance here is almost entirely flash-forwarded in visions by Paul, I had hoped to lure my wife in via that, but there is previous little of it. For her, the scene with Charlotte Rampling, while a powerful one for Dune fans was a bit of a deal breaker for her.Anyways, my kids are off at college, one has started reading the book, the other has not, and I'm hoping they might watch it and provide a sort of test for those who are less familiar with Herbert's lore.I suspect people who are not necessarily steeped in the story could enjoy this quite well, it does cover a lot of ground. Villenueve for all the bombast action and sleek style on screen, relies strongly on tight shots of actors for helping initiates empathically absorb the spice of the saga.The book(s) are definitely a commitment, but of course well worth it imho. However, in a world where time is fleeting, and 500+ pages is a mind killer, this is an excellent accelerated course you can complete in an evening. I could see some folks waiting for the sequel and then just burying themselves in the experience like Fremen in the sands.",Dune
90,RussHog,It's ok - not bad don't love it,7,31 October 2021,"Dune has remarkable visuals and does a solid job of telling the book page by page (with some exceptions.). That, in and of itself, is a huge accomplishment. However, my big gripe with this film was the worms. They were very underwhelming. My second grips is that the acting kinda sucks (except Baron Harkonnen - who needed more screen time.). This film needed some more Shakespearean actors - less flat Hollywood performances. So...I don't love Dune but I don't hate it - and I'd watch a sequel.",Dune
91,Alexander_Blanchett,True Eye Candy,8,8 October 2021,It was a good film. Not the second coming of Christ as many procalime it to be but it was intersting and simply perfect eye candy. Denis Villeneuve truely knows how to make a film visually attractive and he is quite in line with Christopher Nolan in that regard. Also his directing style more and more becomes similiar to that of Nolan although he is a little darker.I never saw the origianl and never had the ambition to do so I cant really compare them but I also dont think they were supposed to be compareable as this is a new interpretation of the source novel.Acting wise it was good. I liked Timothee Chalament who made more out of his character than the screenplay offered him to do. Nice character development. Rebecca Ferguson is always good to see in a majro role. She had some really good moments. Zendaya was a bit one note but very pretty on the eyes. Josh Brolin was kind of wasted although he had a very interesting approach for his character. Oscar Isaac and Jason Marmoa were both good. The best of the supporting cast was undoubtly Javier Bardem.I loved the cinematography and the visual effeets are some of the best of the recent years. Technically it was clearly a masterpiece and I dont think anything will beat it in this regard in 2021.,Dune

93,TheTruthofItIs,The Dune Snorefest,3,25 October 2021,"Dune 2021's cinematography is largely composed of muted browns and grays, desolate landscapes and buildings, almost all night-time scenes, a really depressing environment and VERY hard to watch, making it VERY difficult to stay awake. A good argument could've been made to do this in black-and-white. The pacing is glacial, you can feel your arteries harden, your hair start to gray. It's all dialogue of political and military strategy - can you conceive of topics more boring?! Huge monolithic sandworms that swallow mining machinery - that's gotta be good for their digestion! Action? Zippo, zilch until 75 freakin' minutes in! All the character surnames are distinctly non-English, more middle-eastern/asian, but then you have Jason Momoa's character named ""Duncan Idaho"" like some misplaced cowboy. There is modern, even post-modern high-tech weaponry on display, yet ground battles are done with Iron Age swords, what?! Properly edited, this could've run for 60 mins instead of the interminable 150 mins. We've had to wait almost 40 years (!) for a Dune re-make and this is a VERY VERY disappointing result, and it's only part one of two or three?! And no others have even been greenlit yet, so if it even happens, part two will be like 3 yrs out!",Dune
94,cardsrock,Spice up your life,10,28 October 2021,"Wow. What an experience. It has been some time since I have felt so engrossed and in awe of what I was watching on screen. This is what cinema can be when executed with ambition, precision, and passion.Villeneuve was absolutely the right director for this film. He films scenes with such a mastery of scale that you really feel like you comprehend the size of everything you see. The story is streamlined to make it clear and concise, but retaining important characterization. I fully bought into this incredible new world I was dropped into. The visuals are stunning, Zimmer's soundtrack is iconic, and the performances are top notch. This is altogether one of the most impressive productions ever put to film.A common complaint is the lack of a big battle at the end, but people seemed to have no problem with The Fellowship of the Ring doing this. It's all about the journey and this is just the beginning. Dune ends with the stage set perfectly for a grand climax and I for one cannot be more excited.There was a point during the movie when I started asking myself if this was the best film I've ever seen. The fact that I thought that means you should go see this film immediately and on the biggest screen possible.",Dune
95,CANpatbuck3664,Premium World Building and Great Acting Buoy the Slightly Bloated Dune,8,30 October 2021,"As much as we all love the trappings of modern science fiction, its still interesting and fun when something different comes along. Despite Dune being a pseudo remake/reboot, its a pretty big departure from Star Wars, Star Trek and other universes of that ilk. I enjoyed that change, the design of the spacecraft, the worlds we visit and the equipment being used felt more functional and less flashy. It helped create the world that Villenueve and his team were crafting and the more grimy and gritty cinematography helped distinguish and solidify the world and the plight of House Atriedes. I also thought the movie was shot beautifully, the cinematographer really knew how to make the desert environment arresting and from the set decoration to the use of CGI, there's a dangerous and foreboding vibe that's pulsating under all the political intrigue that helps establish the stakes.Getting to the characters next, we learn so much about Paul and how important he will be for the future of both worlds but I really liked how they built up our side players as well. I empathized with Leto and Jessica, Leto tried to take a measured approach and be flexible with both the Fremen and the other houses and while Jessica clearly has her own agenda, she cares deeply for Paul and is trying to execute her order's master plan. We also get some insight into Duncan and Paul's friendship which I thought the movie setup nicely. Hopefully we'll get more of Chani in the sequel but we get our needed character development to help us bond with Paul and relate to his struggle.With all the expository dialogue and the complicated political system to go through to get the audience on board, they wisely brought in a cast that could help get the story across. I hadn't seen Timothee Chalamet in anything else but colour me impressed. He was great in this, his character is very angsty yet he never came across as whiny or a brat. Its not news that Oscar Isaac was good in a movie but his character could have come across as cliche or boring but I empathized with the Duke. Ditto for Rebecca Ferguson, I see a change in her character ahead but there's a lot of effort in her performance and her character's bond with Paul is effectively communicated. Jason Momoa is doing Jason Momoa but we all love Jason Momoa because he has a lot of charisma and screen presence. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Sharon Duncan-Brewster are all really good in their supporting parts. I thought Zendaya was also good but the marketing misrepresents how much she's actually in the movie.Dune has so much going for it but I have to add in one or two gripes. The long running time did grate on me after awhile and the pacing while tight for large sections goes pretty slack by the end. By about the 2 hour mark, I was getting impatient and by 2:15 I was starting to nod off. So while the movie is largely excellent, much like the Irishman, be prepared for what your walking into.I'm glad to hear that the sequel for Dune has already been greenlit. I want to see what else they will do with this story and in what direction they'll go next. Despite Dune running a little too long for my taste, I'd still wholeheartedly recommend seeing it in the theatre, the movie is very operatic and deserves the big screen treatment. Check it out and hopefully you'll be just as excited at the prospect of another adventure in the sand.",Dune
96,cliftonofun,"More, please.",8,23 October 2021,"I fully intended to read Dune before this movie came out...but then I checked it out from the library and saw it was like 800 pages. As a result, I walked into this movie only knowing Dune via a VHS of the 80s version that my family taped from TV when I was a kid. That did not matter at all. Villeneuve builds this world so patiently - fantastic scene setting and a commitment to slowly unwinding the story. I was sucked in from the jump, and the 2.5 hours flew by (thanks in part to stellar performances). If Part 2 was available, I would watch right now.",Dune

99,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,23 October 2021,"The stage curtains open ...Our latest epic sci-fi extravaganza, ""Dune"", astounds with its visuals and atmosphere, pulling you into a world that resonates as both immediate and real. By the time I got a foothold on what was going on around me, I was completely immersed into the surroundings, the people, their culture, and the importance of one very specific plot point - ""spice"".The Emperor has decreed and mandated that the House of Atreides rule over the harsh desert planet of Arrakis - the chief source of ""spice"" which is vital for human survival and space travel. The previous ruler, House Hark.onnen, has been asked to vacate the planet, leaving Atreides to their own devices. The strikes a major blow to them financially, and they devise a coup to re-take control of the planet and their source of income. In the mix is Paul Atreides, the heir to the House - a young man troubled by unexplained dreams trying to find his place, not only in the world, but in his own House. With battle looming over them for control of the planet, Paul and his mother are cast into the deadly sands of the desert where they face dangers against giant, deadly sandworms as well as members of the Fremen, the planet's nomadic people.I was more than impressed with the visuals in this movie, that along with the excellent musical score by Hans Zimmer. Some parts were simply jaw dropping as I was pulled in right from the start. The acting was a bit dry (not just because they were in the desert) - as I was following our main protagonist, Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet) I couldn't help but think of Hayden Christensen playing Anakin Skywalker for his share of the Star Wars movies. Chalamet has been around the block and has been in numerous films now, but I was not compelled by his acting. It seemed, to me, to be only surface strong with no real depth to it. He hit his marks, but he didn't deliver the goods. You could say as much for the supporting acting as well. Nobody in this film delivers a home run performance.Even so, I still really enjoyed this re-telling of Frank Herbert's classic novel, ""Dune"" - even though this film only covers about the first half of the book. It really is a cinematic experience to be enjoyed on the silver screen. It will get your adrenalin going and it is a special effects and action extravaganza. If only the acting were on par with everything else - then this could have been an instant classic. But, that it is not.",Dune
100,saru2020,"Visual extravaganza, nothing else",6,31 October 2021,"I went to watch it for its visual extravaganza and the IMAX 3D experience was amazing.But, I should say that I didn't understand most parts of the film but never mind, the experience itself was good enough which made me feel like I'd watched something unique and extraordinary. I was just blown away by the artwork & making, nothing else.The plot looks old, the writer trying to make a point on human psychology that it won't change even after 10K+ years from now.But, I don't understand one thing, when the director focuses so much on the visual experience, why not give at least a 1/3rd of that into writing. It is just as awful to ignore the fact that these kinda big Hollywood flicks simply waste their money on such crappy content. I think there's a lot to be learned by these Hollywood directors from Indian films like Baahubali which is made at the fractional of their costs and the content is just top-notch and no single crap to notice. Indian cinema does precede Hollywood in our beautiful times.",Dune
101,garethcrook,Balletic epic.,7,27 October 2021,"I wasn't all that excited to see Dune. Until I listened to the score. Zimmer really has done a beautiful job, so I was very intrigued to see the images to accompany it. There's a lot of expectation with Dune. Everything from the book, which I confess I've not read and the misstep that is the 1984 film in the otherwise flawless Lynchian catalogue. I did wonder about watching Lynch's version again, but decided I really didn't need to see Sting in his fancy underpants again. That version is famously a butchered mess, in all its various cuts from what I can gather. How will Villeneuve's version handle this epic? Well I'll get to it, rather well. Perhaps because most sensibly he's opted to tell half the story. This being Part One, made with no guarantee of the concluding Part Two. Villeneuve said he made his peace with this potentially being his only Dune film, getting all his favourite elements on screen from the outset. It shows and he's been rewarded with the concluding film being confirmed only a matter of days after this opening salvo was released. I'm going to look at this as an outsider, seeing as that's how I feel. I know people obsess about this story and sci-fi nuts lap it up. I really don't fall into these camps. Dune I think feels like it can be a bit impenetrable. A serious sci-fi epic. So here's the skinny. The year is 10191. The planet is Arrakis. Timothée Chalamet is Paul Atreides our young hero. He's a posh kid, who because of his noble heritage is to be charged with looking after the planet and it's 'Spice', a valuable asset in the galaxy that's both a trippy drug and the secret to interstellar travel. This stuff is found on the sandy planet (hence the name Dune), populated by blue eyed desert soldiers protecting it from the evil bastards. I'm not gonna lie, on paper it sounds crap. This though right from the off is a visual treat. The shots are wide open and beautiful. Filled with fantastic spacecraft, creatures, costumes and militaristic pageantry. It's this that draws you in. The whole aesthetic feels earthy, dusty, real despite the obvious fantasy. Now I'm not a fan of Chalamet, but here he feels he fits, as Keanu Nenoo fits in The Matrix, he also looks great in a long black coat. He's in good company too. His dad is Oscar Issac. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa bring the yahoo macho muscle to fight the bad dudes lead by Stellan Skarsgård in a ton of prosthetic make up. For all it's relative simplicity though, there's a lot of spiritual set up and exposition. Be prepared to dig in and stick with it. The rewards will come, but it requires some patience. There's enough touch points to lead even the most sceptic through its dense first act. Charlotte Rampling as a reverend mother decked out in the most badass headdress testing Paul's powers to bridge space and time in his mind in the infamous hand in the box scene. It's a slow burning twisting tale of mystics and politics told with some of the most beautiful cinematography I've laid my eyes on. But fear not, there's action too. The Worms. They're treated as they would be in a monster movie. Teased and hidden, building the tension. Massive creatures lurking in the sand, ready to swallow machine and man whole. There's also mahoosive big smashy explosions as wars are waged and that Zimmer score goes full bombast. It's all very balletic. I'm not going to dress it up. It's good, but more so for it's style than it's substance. Even an effortlessly cool and underused Javier Bardem as a righteous protector of Arrakis can't convince me otherwise. That's not to say the substance isn't there, but it's hidden in the narrative and it asks a lot of the viewer to find it. I rather like this to be fair, but I wonder what the casual viewer will make of it. If you're here just for intergalactic conflict with spaceships and monsters, you'll be sorely disappointed. For the patient though, the final act delivers but retains its soulfulness right to the credits. I'm a little surprised that Villeneuve would be satisfied to leave it here, there's much more to play out. It'll certainly be interesting to see what he does with Part Two.",Dune

103,johannes2000-1,"Spectacular, but without a soul.",7,17 September 2021,"I read the book a lifetime ago, so I don't remember the exact details, only that I was pretty overwhelmed by its epic scope. I guess the makers of this movie aimed to evoke the same feeling. And although I was totally ready to go for this, it unfortunately turned into a slightly disappointing experience.Sure, it's cinematographic awesome, the CGI and special effects are top-notch, the settings and costumes are impressive, and the acting by all major characters is great. But there should be more to a movie than ""just"" all that. What I dearly missed was some kind of soul in the story, an urgency for all the goings-on that should have been transferred to me as viewer.What didn't help was the extremely complicated background of the story, that only in (rather incomprehensible) bits and pieces was revealed during the run. Neither did help the fact that none of the characters was even remotely sympathetic, not even Paul, who as the meant-to-be pivotal hero of the story all the time stayed composed, solemn and rather bland.What you get is a mixture of GOT, Star Wars or LOTR, with the same well known ingredients: there are some evil powers that mercilessly suppress; a downtrodden community that rebells but lacks a leader; and a messianic hero that stands up to save the day; all of this covered by the usual sauce of exotic fantasy-languages, semi-religious rituals, some sorcery, and lots of massive battle-forces fighting each other to death. It's all familiar and done before, maybe not as grandiose as here, but in my opinion with a little bit more insight and depth.After two and a half hours I was left with the impression that I had only watched a long, complicated and slightly incomprehensible introduction to The Real Thing. Maybe that Real Thing is already in the making, they certainly alluded to it with the subtitle ""part one"". I do hope so for Timothée Chalamet, I admit that I could watch his face for hours, but I so much had wished for him a more rewarding role to put his teeth in. He really earns a second chance.",Dune

105,Aylmer,"Heavy on Knife Fights, Low on Emotion",7,23 October 2021,"Stunning visuals and unique soundscape, along with a cast that's just about as good as the 1984 film, can't quite move this film over the finish line in my opinion. Although it's much more glossy, the film doesn't quite have the resonance of Lynch's sloppier, but more visionary take on the novel. The biggest letdown for me was finding out that this film covers only half the original story (hinted at with a PART ONE subtitle right at the start, which was not in any of the advertising I saw before-hand). Now I know how 1978 audiences felt watching Bakshi's LORD OF THE RINGS. Much like Peter Jackson's HOBBIT movies, this film feels awfully drawn out, with a lot of good material strangely hacked out and a few characters (namely Dunan Idaho) beefed up and given more to do with mixed results (a plus if you are hungry for more knife fights).I haven't read the book in over 30 years (and even then, found it extremely dense and confusing as a child - perhaps I'd enjoy it more now if I found the time), but I'm pretty well-versed in the universe from watching all the movies (including the garish and cheap TV movies) and playing all the computer games (including the exceptional EMPEROR BATTLE FOR DUNE), and so it's hard to view this film objectively. It'll be a completely different experience for those who have had no familiarity with the source material or other films, for better or worse.Much like with the Lynch movie, this movie will feel extremely obtuse and confusing to those who won't know off-hand what a ""House"" is, or what the relationship is between The Spice, The Worms, Folding Space, etc. It will probably take a few watches to get it as it doesn't try to explain things in the heavy-handed fashion Lynch did. For those of us more familiar with the subject, it'll feel painfully slow, sometimes frustrating, and generally lacking in suspense as we know exactly where things are going. The main enjoyment comes from seeing how differently this will tackle each scene and whether or not it ends up being worse or better than previous adaptations. Even though I think it's ""better"" than the Lynch movie, I'll probably end up rewatching the Lynch movie far more times in my life as it's just infinitely more interesting.All in all I wasn't either particularly pleased or disappointed, just generally unmoved and uninvolved. Despite its technical gloss, I think DUNE: PART 1 will be remembered as a decidedly average space adventure that opened the door to yet another franchise.",Dune
106,saadanathan,The biggest marketing scam of the year 6/10,6,1 November 2021,"""Dune"" with all its glory, fame and popularity is unfortunately at the same time a huge scam. At least this newest adaptation of the Novel.I will always have a huge respect to Denis Villeneuve, and I appreciate the hard work on bringing this installment back to the big screen since it's last appearance back in the 80s.Unfortunately, I can only write about the disappointment from this movie, the story is cut in half by the end of the film. Thus meaning that all this buildup and advertisement was just to tell us that a sequel is being made. Which I'm completely against. Too late it's already happening.I'm not in favor of making new movie franchises and Cinematic universes, I thought this would have a better closure and ending, but it seems Hollywood is more interested in making money than storytelling. Not to add the fact that it has been announced that a sequel was being made even before this film came out to theaters!I'm always in favor of making movies in general, as long as there is a story to tell and not drag, and as long as there is a beginning - middle - end. Not beginning- middle - end - sequel.If you've read up to this point than you're probably asking ""what about other movie franchises such as Star Wars and the MCU?"". I'm glad you've asked, those movie franchises are well known and loved. Unlike ""Dune"" that may have a smaller Fandom, not to mention that it has been a complete mess to create a movie centering around ""Dune"" for the past few decades (just ask David Lynch).What I'm trying to say overall is that maybe the request for a reboot of this film was never felt, thus was never necessary to be made in the first place.I will point out that the visuals and filming were shot perfectly and gave the movie a beautiful experience of viewing. Nevertheless the acting and portrayal of the cast was great.Rest assure I will not be around when a sequel comes up, this has been a huge marketing scam.",Dune
107,davidgee,Love those worms!,7,4 November 2021,"This is a somewhat less chaotic adaptation of the epic novel by Frank Herbert, which I read in the 1960s but don't remember well enough to help me through the labyrinthine plot. There are wonderful sets and production values, as (let's be fair) there were in the David Lynch version. The CGI is, as it has to be, out of this world. It seems odd that even in this far future with amazing flying machines (I particularly liked the dragonfly helicopters), feudal hand-to-hand combat is still key to warfare. I came away with a feeling of STAR WARS meets KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. I'm an admirer of Chalamet, but he rather lacks the charisma that Paul Atreides calls for.The giant scenery-chewing worms are, once again, the real stars, though I still have a soft spot for those in TREMORS!",Dune
108,kaefab,needs a longer running time. The original 1984 was a lot better,8,20 September 2021,If you liked this movie make sure to watch the extended version of the original 1984 movie.This one is lacking in a few elements.....,Dune
109,sbweightman,A visionary presentation of an epic story,9,23 October 2021,"A glorious start to an epic saga where every scene is a visual spectacle filled with atmospheric and dramatic music. Every part of this film is on an epic scale, from the explosive and exciting action scenes to the spectacular CGI landscapes and special effects. The film is mostly about setting the scene, explaining the story and who the main players are, which is informative and well-told, but it does make it a bit slow and possibly too long overall. The strong characterization and great acting makes up for this, and I for one can't wait to see the next chapter.",Dune
110,destroyerwod,Lot of quality but a few flaws too. Yet i can't give a 7...,8,24 October 2021,"I never watched the original movie, the mini series or read the book. I got into Dune totally fresh. Overall i would say i really enjoyed the movie but without spoiling anything, the ending left me extremely disapointed. Yes it is ""Part 1"" but if you take any endings of movies like Star Wars, even the worst ones, they all had some form of grand finale despite being part of trilogies. Dune end on a wet fart...Another issue i had was that the story was hard to follow. I just realized the main bad guy is actually just a leader in another faction and not the Emperor. We hear about an emperor yet we never see him. Bautista's character look interesting and menacing but is barely used, so probably kept for Part 2 but i wished he did something in this one.But despite those flaws and the tone of my review feeling negative, i had a lot of fun with most of the movie, really felt engage in the characters and the visuals were just pure bliss, even on a regular 1080p TV at home (yeah sorry but can't go to theatre sadly due to Covid pass otherwise i would had gone see it there). This is really the best part of the movie, the visuals, the atmosphere, the sense of grand spectacle. It does capture a feel of ""epic"".Now i really wish Part 2 will be made, it seem like its not official yet? This movie will extremely improve i feel when you are able to watch the whole thing as one big epic extravaganza (or at least part 1 on day 1 and part 2 on day 2, because its a kinda long movie lol). Lets hope it does well so it happen.",Dune
111,lareval,An Arresting Cinematic Experience,9,18 September 2021,"'Dune' is a stunning, gourgeous looking Sci-fi Epic that faithfully adapts source material into the Big screen with class and craft. Villeneuve shows why he is a masterful filmmaker. This movie deserves to be witness in the biggest screen with the loudest sound system possible, not on TV. Because of its impressive photography and scenography. Because of the scoop of its ambition captured in widescreen shots. Because of a gargantum score by Hans Zimmer that will stay with you long after listening it. It has minor flaws: some characters are more glorified cameos without a proper storyline. But with all the things that could have gone wrong with this movie, that's a flaw easily forgettable. And this is world so Big, so ambitious that as Zendaya says closing the movie: ""This is only the beginning"".Warner, don't be stupid and make Part II as soon as possible. I want to see how this story goes further.",Dune
112,sweidman-28016,A Triumph!,10,2 November 2021,"""Dreams are messages from the deep.""The booming voice and words that open the film. Dune, an adaption of Frank Herbert's sci-if epic, tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanity's greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive. Most anybody who has been alive within the past 3-4 years has known Dune would be adapted theatrically within the coming years, and properly unlike David Lynch's 1984 version. Denis Villeneuve was given the opportunity to direct and work with the writing team for this. As many of you know, he is in my top three favorite directors. For me, he's made three perfect films (Arrival, Prisoners, and Blade Runner 2049). And now a fourth. He really did the impossible here by making a film that is too large for any screen, even IMAX. World building is a strength of his, and Dune is the perfect example of how he creates them. Unlike Star Wars or various planets in the MCU, these different settings and cultures do feel realistic. They may have been shot here on Earth, but simply watching it you never get that feeling. We're set way in the future in a totally different galaxy.The production design team did wonders with this. In typical Villeneuve fashion, he makes things as large as possible. The sets (though some are done with visual effects) are ginormous. The visual effects are extremely good looking. For the budget they had, which wasn't massive, they made some of the most realistic looking effects I've seen. There's maybe a moment or two where it's noticeable, but you can't really tell. In every scene with something to that size, we always have a person or something smaller just to get the scale of it. Looking at it is entrancing. Aiding to that large scale look is the practically flawless cinematography. It's eye-candy for us all. The way each planet has a different look helps set the mood perfectly. On Arrakis, and most of the film is set there, we have a desert planet that looks so terrifying and mystifying. During the day, the warm colors are brought out that even make you feel hot while watching. And at night, it becomes slightly muddy to give the feeling that we don't know what's out there. You're on edge constantly. One of my favorite parts is actually this shot of Paul and Jessica running in this tunnel system and the only light is beams from above. As they're running, those beams of light hit their shoulders and it's framed and looks incredible. The fast paced editing that also takes it time works very well. This isn't setup like a typical action film where you have one action scene concluding the first act, maybe one or two in the second, and a big battle with space portals in the third. They couldn't even do it if they tried since this is only half of the novel. I mean, the novel is three books combined technically and we have two more to cover, so we've only seen a brief bit of it. That might make some people feeling empty towards the end, but the opening titles do say Dune: Part One. Even though it's half, the runtime is 155 minutes and there's plenty of everything where I don't think you could leave feeling like you haven't seen enough.I could lost the entire acting ensemble and how they all did, but that would take too long. All you need to know are the main leads. And before I do that, WE KNOW YOU'RE UPSET ZENDAYA IS IN IT FOR 7 MINUTES. Why is this such a problem? Yes they marketed her quite a bit, but she still has a lasting impact. Chani plays a huge role in the story and is a big motivation in this first half. Obviously, they were going to market Zendaya a lot because she's had a great past few years, and also to get younger audiences to come see it since older audiences are going to be the ones who know this story more. I digress. Timothée Chalamet is perfectly cast as Paul. Some have said he shows hardly any emotion and never smiles in this which makes it hard to connect. Let me ask you this: What is there for Paul to be happy about? This is a hero's journey epic so there's more development to come (some of which couldn't be talked about in just this first half to avoid creating another 15-30 minutes of explanation). I think his performance and how Paul is written is perfectly fine. Who I'm really excited to talk about is Rebecca Ferguson. Oh my god did she give it her all! Little did I know she would be the MVP of the film. This is easily her best performance to date and I don't think I'm she could get any better. Jessica is a very complex character, but the way they built her relationship with Paul tells us every little detail about her. We know this most likely won't happen, but with all the praise she's getting for her performance, a supporting actress nomination would not be undeserved.As for Hans Zimmer's score, well, there's so much to talk about. Firstly, he turned down working with Christopher Nolan on Tenet for this. He always works with Nolan and that's where his most iconic scores have come from. My favorite score of all time is Interstellar, and his work on Dune is so close to beating it out. I don't think people realize how incredible it is. He literally created new instruments! It's incredibly loud and large matching the scale of the film. We have the amazing vocalist Loire Cotler with the most intense and gritty voice belting out there. And what I love is how Zimmer paces the notes. Not to get too heavily in music theory, but they aren't moving fast and aren't constantly growing to get the huge sound. There's also those juddering drums that never feel loud enough though they're rattling your skull. The entire score feels epic, intense, and should move you to tears. He literally made three separate scores (The Dune Sketchbook, The Art and Soul of Dune, and the Motion Picture Score) for this. The total runtime to listen to all three is roughly 4:38hrs. I doubt you'll have trouble finding something you don't like. I've been listening to each album on repeat ever since seeing it last weekend (even the two tracks we were given back in August ""Paul's Dream"" and ""Ripples in the Sand""). Part of the sound design is just Zimmer's score. Everything sound immaculate and part of the reason you should be seeing this in a theater and not just in the comfort of your living room.This film perplexed me to some level. I was hesitant to give it a perfect score, since that's always a challenge for me. I let it sink in while it remained at the close stage. Once it saw it a third time (yes I saw it three times in one week), I think I knew my answer. There weren't really any problems I had with it. The minor thing I could say is some of it can be confusing, then again, once you do your research or simply watch it a second time, you can find your answers. As someone who's reading the novel, it is a hard read. It doesn't really stop to answer your questions. If you don't know a term, you look in the index in the back and learn it for yourself. The film explains everything well in my opinion. I was left with most of my questions answered that could be. Denis Villeneuve, who stated himself that this is his favorite film he's made, was the only person to do this project. Each time it ended, and that long runtime flies by in an instant, I wanted to rewatch it again. Since I saw it three times (twice in a Dolby cinema and once in IMAX), I can confirm that I will have a hard time watching this on a normal sized tv. I'm looking for a big screen, but it's also the sound that makes it a visceral experience (and why I preferred seeing it in a Dolby theater over IMAX). While it's still in theaters, please please PLEASE see it! HBOMax is great for having film in theaters stream for free, but you cannot simply watch this and not wish you could've watched it in a theater. The box office for its first weekend didn't make nearly enough as it should've or would have if it were only in theaters. Dune is a modern epic and now that part two has been greenlit, I could not be more excited. By far, the best thing I've seen all year.And now for its Oscar chances...Picture - yes

S. Actress - no (but in consideration)

113,Draysan-Jennings,Overrated,6,22 October 2021,"I can see why some people like this film. But how does it have a rating above 8 stars. Ya, it had great cinematography and special effects but man this was boring. It probably took me 4 hours to finish. The story just couldn't keep my attention. Every 10 minutes I'd have to rewind and re-watch the scene just so I could follow the storyline. I honestly couldn't wait for it to end. Not a film I'd watch again.",Dune
114,ethanbresnett,A hard one to review,8,24 October 2021,"I've taken a day since seeing the film to write this review as there is a lot to process and digest. I've heard numerous times that the novel is almost unadaptable into film, and I can see where that opinion comes from. There's a lot of orientation and scene setting, a lot of high fantasy elements to grapple with, and a meaty character list to introduce.For the most part I think Denis managed this very well. The broad strokes of the film were well explained and it was a joy discovering the intricacies of the characters and plot. Every scene offered some new knowledge and exploration of the world of Dune.However there were some elements (mostly involving Timothee Chalomet and Rebecca Ferguson's characters) that were shrouded in too much mystery. Overall though the plot was thoroughly engaging if a little overwhelming for someone who hasn't read the book! At times it seemed to move too fast and skip over parts that could have done with more explanation, and at others it dwelled a little too long. I think I'll enjoy my second viewing even more though now that I am up to speed with the concepts.Considering where the film left off and how things planned out I think it might be hard to view this film in isolation. I get the sense that viewed alongside part two when everything starts to fall in place this film will really shine.The performances were expectedly brilliant. With such a great cast list and a talented director at the helm to get the most out of them, it was a treat from that perspective.What is most stunning about this film though is it's look. It is visually arresting and an absolute joy to watch. I implore anyone and everyone who can to see this on an IMAX screen. This is what big event cinema is all about. Watching this film on a giant screen with the absorbing surround sound was an experience I won't forget. The score was perfect and technically this film is a triumph.Ultimately I got everything I wanted this film. It has a sensational cast, terrific action, gorgeous cinematography, epic score, impressive fantasy story. Part two can't come quickly enough as I cannot wait to see how the various elements in part one come to fruition.",Dune
115,PedroPires90,Just wow,9,25 October 2021,"My favourite from Villeneuve. Visually a piece of art, magnificent sound, so I recommend the biggest room and best sound system for this.Full of political intrigue, every single performance, dialogue or scene is a piece of art and should be fully appreciated. The director was not in a rush to tell us his vision and that is something refreshing to see. It's very difficult to have a ""first film"" of a story better than this.",Dune
116,blackmamba99971,Wonderfully adapted,10,19 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is now one of my favorite directors since Blade Runner 2049. His earlier works were more experiments rather than telling a story, but has such incredible insight towards a goal of achieving the perfect shot. Dune was one of those films. Since 1984, there has been talk about revamping Frank Herbert's opera classic but not one Hollywood director wanted to take on such a precocious project because of the source material.Frank Herbert was always a lot like J. R. R. Tolkien in many respects for giving the reader very complex scenarios that unfold one piece at a time. It made it nearly impossible for David Lynch to follow but tried his best to keep his version true to the letter except the producers who got involved often made changes to the film so that the audience could make heads or tails of it. Because of that fact, David's attempt fell short and confused the viewer rather than awe inspire them which made him hate the end result.After much debate with the writer's guild, Denis was given his chance to come up with a solution and did just that by keeping to the source material with every producer out of the loop. The cast was magnificent. All who were involved delivered wonderful performances to keep the emotional aspect intact, which is what Lynch wanted in the first place rather than eye candy. Yet the cinematography was brilliantly executed with beautiful sequence shots of home-world ships landing or taking off. Or the high-liners parked in orbit which resemble the worms on arakis in frozen form.The music was top notch as was the locations in Jordan, US, and Canada. Each scene was breathtaking to the last as well as the hand to hand combat between the atreites house warriors and the Sardukar terror troops. Denis kept the story authentic from the first frame to the last and I am so eager to see the second installment once it has wrapped up. Dune in itself was meant to be a two to three part tale in the first place, which is what David Lynch asked for but never got the green light because of budget talks.Like Lord of the rings, Peter Jackson was at the end of his rope before New Line Cinema agreed to pick up the tab for the three movie segment that paid off nearly five times over its foretold goal and won an astonishing seventeen academy awards for his troubles making it the only fantasy film ever to do it. But Denis Villeneuve will someday create and bring home such wins once he has achieved his ultimate goal and place his name beside William Wyler, James Cameron and Peter Jackson. Dune will still live on as the best space opera since Star Wars.Hopefully, Denis will think about 2001. Perhaps a bolder approach to the Arthur C. Clarke's vision needs a new perspective.",Dune
117,alcantaraj-16594,NEEDS A HOOK,7,6 November 2021,"For audiences familiar with the source material, ""Dune"" will probably be a fantastic adaptation.

I am in both sides of the audience.",Dune

120,gsygsy,Not enough popcorn,2,18 October 2021,"Visually spectacular but woefully tedious, portentous, pretentious, pompous movie. A reminder to be wary every time a director says that it's been a lifelong dream to bring a particular project to the screen. The result is likely to be over-reverence, as we have here. The real villain is the source material, which was already old-hat in the 1960s and now feels painfully over-familiar. Its sticky religiosity separates it from its predecessors such as Asimov's 'Foundation' trilogy. However much George Lucas may have taken from Frank Herbert, by creating the character of Hans Solo he saved the Star Wars franchise from being humor-free. There isn't a smile to be had from DUNE. Not even an unintentional one.As in all such epics, the actors who don't have to pretend to be real come off best. Fine talents such as Mr Chalamet and Mr Isaac, whose characters have 'journeys', do their best but inevitably flounder because of the drivel they have to speak. Simpler, two-dimensional figures, however, can give a well-cast performer something to chew on, and this proves to be the case with Stellan Skarsgård, barely recognisable as the villain, and Jason Momoa, who is touching as a valiant and loyal soldier.Female characters rarely prosper in this latter-day Cecil B. De Mille style, so well done Rebecca Ferguson and Sharon Duncan-Brewster, who find ways to give the impression there might be life in the corpse of the genre.I was going to say that there's too much noise and too much music. But on reflection I understand that they drown out a good deal of portentous, pointless dialogue.Kudos to DOP Greig Fraser, production designer Patrice Vermette and their respective teams, who obviously worked tirelessly on creating all the worlds on display. But I'll never get back the two and a half hours I wasted on this nonsense. I resent it.And, heaven help me, it's only Part One!",Dune
121,Finfrosk86,Star Wars meets GoT and Mad Max in an artsy filter,7,14 September 2021,"Beautiful looking with very good effects. Its visually great. The music is organic and sets the mood, although the music doesn't ""set up"" the scene as you might expect it to, making some of the more exciting scenes a little underwhelming perhaps.Acting is great, characters are mostly likable. Chalamet walks a fine like between acting and over-acting a couple times, but all in all he's good.The story is alright, I did get the names and the different ""races"" a little mixed up, even though it's not very complicated. Guess I'm dumb. Bummer that this is just the first part. When a movie is 2,5 hours long, I'd like to get a satisfactory ending, not just ""to be continued"".The action scenes sort of sneak up on ya, but they are well executed. The choreography is alright, and the action looks good.I liked the lore and the technology-stuff. The look of everything and the world building is great. Visually it's pretty sweet. Lots of sand, though. Lots of sand.Anyway, I'm pretty sure Dune will flop. Not because it's bad, but because I just can't see enough people being really into this, or even giving it a chance.And it seems pretty obvious that the studio has got big plans. A lot of work went into this I think, and I hope for the crew/casts sake that it does well.",Dune
122,cgvsluis,Great sets and amazing costumes in this version of Dune that is doing a better job of telling the story.,7,4 November 2021,"Amazing production of Frank Herbert's cult sci-fi classic novel, Dune. I was very critical of the original Lynch production of Dune...I thought it didn't do a very good job telling the story to someone who had never read the book, this film series seems to be correcting that.So far in part one there is phenomenal costuming and sets, the acting is well done, and they seem to be taking the time to truly tell the story of the novel.I loved the first fight scene we observe of the freman, where they come up from the sand to fight (lot of questions about the logistics, but it made for a great fight scene). I also enjoyed their air conveyance that looked like a dragonfly.I hope the quality of the production and the storytelling continues to be this high in the next film...part two. This film was much more accessible for non-scifi fans and for those who did not read the book.Summary of part one:
A powerful family, Atreides, is sent to a planet to take over a very profitable spice trade, while another powerful family, Harkonnen, is relieved of the duty...twist it was really a set up to eradicate the Atreides family because the emperor was afraid that they were becoming to strong in the abilities of their army.

The film is more of an experience than a classic blockbuster. The music and the sound underline this experience all the more.But still: Despite the incredible cast, the characters unfortunately seem superficial and simple. The story is very slow and sometimes very tiring. You get the impression that the director just wants to enjoy the look of the desert. Too bad.

That was always the best part of His other movies.So why This A-List?? An A-List with mostly boring actors. That hasn't really made anything relevant In years. Vikander on the other hand would fit the role/love interest like a glove. Even A-List Natalie Portman would have been eyecandy.The bad:
Looking at you (Goonies) His only great movie.Or swedish rebecca Or Stellan, Even If I like her She just doesn't fit the part. And Stellan just overracts every scene.Nobody likes Javier bardem movies ever. Except the philosophical moviegooers that tries hard to find anything subtle to like about him.And Timothy looks like a 10 year old dude still going First year high school.As so many others I had High hopes for Dune.I had my own vision what It would look Like.I never been this hyped or been going to the cinema Since Bladerunner. So Yeah, Dune Is definitely a letdown In many ways. It feels like Denis Is allready going the Ridley Scott route, more cgi, less interesting ensemble, and.. worst part.. not even the Score Is that memorable In a sea of Ambient Masters that could easily made It more interesting, more otherwordly and melancolic epic.Dont get me wrong, I loved bladerunner, I was In Awe! I was telling people every chance I got to go watch Bladerunner! While modern practical effects movies Fade away to full cgi Marvel movies and terrible sequels that looks like videogames.. I freakn loved Bladerunner. When others did Not. When others didn't get It. Now.. most of DUNE has become what I feared.

Let me guess - Paul's gonna become the most despicable evil bad white man and the diverse female who barely did anything in this movie will kill him and become the ""real"" leader?

128,OttoVonB,"Mesmerizing, but Incomplete",8,14 October 2021,"It's no surprise to anyone walking into Dennis Villeneuve's Dune that it is only part 1 of the story. The title implies a very different kind of missing ingredient. But let's rewind.First, kudos to all involved for, at long last, the definitive screen depiction of Frank Herbert's gargantuan sci-fi classic. Finally, a creative team is able not only to merely hint at, but do justice to a dense plot and long list of players, all while keeping the audience's jaws sagging to the floor throughout most of the runtime. As most other viewers have already mentioned, this is spectacle on a very rare scale, and you would be well advised to view this on the biggest screen possible, in 2D.Dune is the story of a galactic power struggle for Arrakis, the desert planet home to the spice melange essential to interstellar travel. They who control the spice, control the universe. As the film opens, House Harkonen fall out of favor (or do they?) and stewardship of Arrakis is handed to the noble House Atreides (but to what end?). There, young Paul, the heir to the latter house, discovers his role in the galactic chess-game, and his unexpected calling as a futuristic messiah.Upon watching Dune, all the usual hallmarks of a Dennis Villeneuve production are again present and accounted for: top-notch casting, world-building and performances. Whereas the expansive nature of the story initially had me wondering why the decision was made to go with a theatrical project (rather than, say, a generously endowed HBO or Netflix miniseries), watching the Canadian auteur at work, it is clear that if Dune belongs anywhere else than on the page, it is on the big screen. The faults, so far, lie largely with the source itself.The greatest hurdle in connecting emotionally with this film is that Paul, despite total commitment by Chalamet, is hard to relate to once his destiny becomes more clearly traced out. This makes the once controversial decision to beef up the characters of Lady Jessica (Ferguson) and Chani (Zendaya) all the more essential and understandable. Though their actions thus far in no way betray the Herbert tome, they, especially Rebecca Ferguson, become our emotional anchors, and perhaps the film could have weighed this consideration even more heavily.Dune is awe-inspiring, its designs are fantastic, but it is rarely touching, or emotionally engaging. And somehow, Hans Zimmer managed to drop the ball, churning out generic percussion and throaty wails yet depriving us of a single, memorable cue.Still, by rights this ought to be the real post-pandemic rallying cry back to the silver screen, and it is very possible indeed that Part II will even surpass and transcend it.",Dune

Also this became wb same day same date release date for 2021 so, i was looking forward to see it at home. But when it released this week in my country, I thought to give it a shot in theatres. Hence, dune is my first film in theatre post pandemic.Talking about the film, I was thoroughly engaged and thrilled thanks to hans zimmer's score obviously. Its clearly evident how passionate he was for this film by hearing his score. Sound effects were terrific, which i wouldn't have got of i saw it at home. The cast were great but I was not in awe of anyone except jason mamoa. I felt disappointed of them wasting bautista.Film ends on an incomplete note for a sequel, but I wonder whether we would get to see it in future or not, if it does not perform financially well. We know how wb ruin director's work recently. Also the director should have simultaneously start shooting for the second part too for continuity.On the whole, watch dune is a must watch in theatres. Find a best theatre near you and witness this masterpiece.",Dune
130,fciocca,"Villeneuve did his best to adapt Herbert's novel, but a lot of important elements are missing.",7,3 November 2021,"Before watching this movie I wanted to read the original material. Adapting Frank Herbert's Dune is a demanding task, because there is so much content and lore. Villeneuve did the best he could, in two hours and a half, and he managed to portray the vast world of Arrakis in epic proportions. The whole film has an ethereal look which matches perfectly with Paul's visions and the general thinking flows of different characters. For me it is really entertaining and I honestly did not see the time pass by. When it ended, I wanted more. Action sequences are amazing and special effects are stunning. This is definitely a film that needs to be watched in cinemas, with a good sound system. Only in this way you can truly enjoy this experience. Photography is also extremely inspiring and there are a lot of shots worth mentioning.A lot has been cut out from the original novel and I feel that this first part needs to have a director's cut released. For those who read the novel, this film might feel incomplete. There are tons of important sequences missing completely that would help the audience to better understand this narrative universe. Some things are definitely rushed. There are a lot of references to the book that I could catch, but that many people won't be able to understand, and this might be confusing. There are definitely translation issues from the novel content, to the film media format, due to commercial reasons. The project was ambitious and I think that the director and screenwriters did really their best to bring to life this amazing universe. Is this the definitive version of Herbert's work? Frankly not, but I think that it is very faithful: they did not take too many liberties and I saw many parallels between the two works.The cast was amazing. Thimotée Chalamet perfectly fits the role of Paul Atreides and he is really convincing. Rebecca Ferguson, as always delivered a good performance, she carried many emotions. Truly a talented and skillful actress. Stellan Skarsgard, as the Baron Harkonnen, is truly scary and menacing and for sure way better than the 1984 movie. He does not have much screen time, and I feel they could have used him more. I really hope that he will have a more prominent role in the second part. I was expecting to see Zendaya and Javier Bardem more, but they are barely introduced as part of the Fremen group, therefore they will have more significant roles later on. I highly recommend the latest Villeneuve film. As a cinema lover, I found this a rewarding experience that I have truly enjoyed.",Dune
131,Med-Jasta,Exposition: part one,3,24 October 2021,"This movie spends too much time setting up and not being a movie. Right off the bat, and just like the Lynch movie, we're hit with a lot of information. And then there's more, then more, then more, then more and the movie is over. It never gets a chance to breath and just go somewhere. They were slaves to the book and didn't just make this a movie. This should be a 3 and a half hour movie instead of a 5 and a half hour movie. We don't need scene after scene showing why he's probably the chosen one. We only need one. We get it. We don't need the entire backstory of everything. So much could have be trimmed for the momentum of the movie instead of the integrity of the book. Then even when an exciting event happens it's also really boring.A good example is when Paul gets taken away with his mom. They kill the bad guys, crash in the desert, walk around, do the tent thing, come out, do the sand walk, see a worm that goes away, then find the desert people. 15-20 minutes for that to happen? We didn't need all of that! After a while I felt like some scenes were kept in just to make this movie long enough to be it's own movie so it wasn't out of balance with the next one. The next one, the next one. I'm sick of seeing movies where it's purpose is to see the next one.Too bad because everything looked so good. The ships, the costumes, the creatures and the perfect cgi. But the problem is that in choosing this path of excess they ruined all those good things. They put so much talent to waste. When they could have done what a movie is supposed to do and extracted the meat of all these things and condensed them into an enjoyable movie.It really felt like the Matrix Reloaded in many ways. Almost nothing but laying the ground work for the next one. But at least half way through Reloaded does pick up and actually goes somewhere. And you know has some of the coolest action scenes ever made. Then you go back and realize that you were just watching the first half of one movie. With Dune you know that and it doesn't help. Actually if this doesn't do well we might not even get to see it finished. And it's going to be years from now, not 6 months. By the way I love Reloaded.Another little thing that got me was the casting. All great actors doing a great job but they were all really obvious choices. I guess lazy casting. Again they all did great and I like them but I was kinda rolling my eyes at how obvious it wasI was really surprised at how much it was like the Lynch movie. I've seen that once and never read the book. I don't think that one is a very good movie either but I admire the ambition. They should have divorced themselves from being fanboys and focused on making a good movie.",Dune
132,DeBBss,A movie that will keep you captivated,8,22 October 2021,"With Denis Villeneuve being my favorite director, I had high expectations for this film, and unsurprisingly, it more than delivered. It had Villeneuve's trademark cinematography, lighting, music, and pacing. This film may not be to everybody's taste; it doesn't have crazy amounts of action, and the movie is rather slow. But even though it's slow and not action packed, the film always kept me hooked with every scene.The world, atmosphere, characters, and creativity is what kept my eyes glued to the screen during its 2.5 hour long runtime. And when things started to get rolling, it was pretty much impossible not to be captivated. And there are some issues with the film, like Josh Brolin's character being completely forgot half-way through, and how the last 20 minutes of the movie took a little too long; but those issue barely ruin the experience.Dune is an overall amazing experience. It'll keep your eyes glued with its beautiful cinematography and lighting. The story is also great and it'll only get better with part two. And with every Denis Villeneuve film, you're gonna wanna experience Dune with the big screen.",Dune
133,DuskShadow,As Barren of Joy as a film set on a Desert PLanet Can Get,4,25 October 2021,"I have never been a fan of the Dune franchise, and only having seen the original, it took me years to finally see the orginal all the way through. Just as boring as I always felt it was. But even though its so slow paced and nutty, its at least a point better than this new rendition.Talk about try hard, yet not try hard enough. So many scenes in almost absolute darkness to the point I would zone out since there was not much detail to take in. Or times when transitions from one scene to the next, or the flow of the film in the exact same scene was just too messy and not well put together...I can safely say, this movie sucked. I dislike it more than the original, and I hate, and I blame the original for now giving us this piece of trash. It just goes on and on, and IM so glad I never have to see any film called Dune ever again. I hope. 4/10 RUN FAST!! And theres more installments to come! Lol T<T.",Dune
134,saraccan,Would be a better tv show,7,24 October 2021,"Part of me tells me that we shouldn't be too critical of this movie as it's barely trying to scratch the surface of this enormous universe in two hours, but on the flip side we still need to talk about how it holds up as a standalone movie. Not only because how this project is gonna evolve is still an unknown but also we can't just ignore its shortcomings hiding behind the excuse that this is a tough adaptation attempt for a movie.And that is the where the main issue lies for me. It is trying to cover a lot of ground and doing a ton of world setting but failing to go deep in any character or specific topic. I have almost no attachment to any good or bad characters. Just because he hugged a guy twice in the first half of the movie, i can't feel sad when he dies later on.The positives; well.. technically almost everything. Amazing sets, incredible costume design and make up, breathtaking visuals, strong soundtrack and unique sound design. All of these were so good that it almost lost its power. Those grand entrances and epic establishing shots; sure they are great but did we really need that many.Paul, the son of a duke is having visions from the future and he will start a new chapter in his life.",Dune
135,Trevor-Kerensky,"I hope you ""Dune"" (No spoilers!)",10,26 October 2021,"To be honest, I didn't get into Dune until my teens. I'd heard of some of the games and only read some of the novels. It wasn't until later I watched the 2000 SyFy miniseries that everything started to make more sense. We get an entire galaxy that predates Star Wars and so much more.Though the original Dune novel came a decade before 1977's Star Wars, this Dune movie does away with most of the elements of science-fiction, especially those of Star Wars. No lightsabers, no aliens, no ultimate super-technology, no robots or whatever. Dune is more than just good and evil. It's politics, ecology, religion and history all rolled into one.Anyway, back to the movie. Yes, 2.5 hours is a long running time but to be honest, when I watched the film I wasn't bored in the slightest. Everything was so well-done and every actor and actress did a phenomenal job. The sets were beautiful, the props were beautiful, even the special effects were beautiful. And some of the names from the cast I recognized; some of whom were from the MCU and one was from the DCEU series. I didn't know if I'd like Jason Momoa until this movie came out but he did such a wonderful job. As Minsc of Baldur's Gate would say, ""Butt-kicking for goodness!""Though I felt the director's previous movie, Blade Runner 2049, was a bit underwhelming, this absolutely makes up for it. Not that Blade Runner wasn't terrible, it's just that Dune had been ignored for so long and it was time to let this Star Wars precursor shine. And it did.Yes, the movie leaves the door open but that was a smart move on the director's part. A followup is definitely in the cards. And with the success of this first part, it is very much a possibility.If you were bored by the Star Wars sequel trilogy, give this a go. You won't be sorry.",Dune
136,aarongnr,I did not read the book and I did not know what to expect exactly. I LOVED it.,10,15 September 2021,"I have seen many reviewers write that this movies has no ending. That's true. BUT: The ending Denis chose seems perfect to me. There is no cliffhanger, no big question that I needed immediate answers to. This movie is about house Atreides being betrayed and the path this sets Paul on. This path leads him to his new home: Arrakis.In that sense, this movie had enough of an ending for me to not feel dissatisfied.That said, I will probably go and read the book instead of waiting 3 years (or forever) for the conclusion of this story arc.This is a movie of gigantic scale that feels so familiar, yet so fresh and and unique in it's own way. It's a 2.5 hour, polished piece of art and spectacle.I cannot recommend it more, and if you're hesitant because it's just part 1, don't be.I would give this an easy 9.5/10.",Dune

As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence. A commodity capable of unlocking humanity's greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive. Dune was incredible and for me one of the strongest films of the year.My first few positives would be the fantastic set up and worldbuilding. As well as the incredible cinematography and sound design. Also, the chemistry between the cast and performances. The film set up the storyworld excellently. Establishing the villains well, as well as introducing the world of Arrakis and the people that lived there. This film had some of the strongest worldbuilding I have seen. The storyworld was so rich and incredible it was beautiful to see. There were so many different elements to the world that were so well explained and explored throughout that I was invested and in awe from start to finish. The film was visually stunning, the sheer scope the film managed to execute was astounding. The colour palette and the creativity with the shots really helped with displaying not only the beauty of the world but just how well-crafted the film was. Another very strong element was the sound design. It added such a cinematic appeal to the film, with one of the best scores I have heard. The sheer volume and cinematic appeal of the score just transported me into the film and I didn't want it to end. I also thought the performances from the whole cast were so strong. The cast was incredibly impressive for this film, and everyone delivered. Key highlights for me were Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, and Rebecca Ferguson. Jason Mamoa was another highlight with a charming and likeable performance. And Timothée Chalamet did a fantastic job in his first big action role and delivered an impressive performance. The whole cast had great chemistry, and the different relationships shown were great as we got to really dive into the characters and their relationship with each other.My next few positives would be the great action and script. As well as the interesting elements to the story-world and strong plot development. The action within the film was excellent, it was intense and well-choreographed. Incorporating fascinating technology from the storyworld making the characters glow blue, which led to visually unique and entertaining action sequences that left an impact. I also thought the script and dialogue was very strong. There was so much attention to detail with the script and there wasn't one plot point that was left unexplained with the rich world. And the dialogue was very insightful and raised a lot of important questions with its political themes. I also loved the interesting elements to the storyworld. All the different technology and elements to the world was fascinating. With some of the characters powers being able to control what people do being interesting. I also thought the plot development was strong. I think Paul realising the weight of his responsibilities with being the chosen one really was the focus as the story developed and the true intensions of the villains were revealed.My only slight criticism would be the pacing issues in places. This wasn't an issue most of the time. But the film had so much exposition and explaining to do in places that the pacing was slightly inconsistent.My final few positives would be the strong themes and villain. As well as the great plot twists and fantastic final act. I think the political themes conveyed with the house of Atreides taking control of Arrakis but trying to find a balance and peace sent a strong message, also with its themes on power and family throughout were strong as the characters relationships developed. I also thought the Baron was a very strong villain. The character design and the intimidating force of his character was fantastic. His ruthless aggression and lack of emotion when it came to killing entire bloodlines really made him a strong villain that will no doubt be explored even more in the sequel. The final act was also excellent. The plot twists were unexpected as the characters didn't know who to trust and it kept the tension high. And the score, action and the arc for Paul was very strong. Leading a lot open for part 2 as he strives for peace with the people of Arrakis.Overall, Dune is one of the most visually captivating and impressive films I have seen. With an incredible cast, amazing and rich worldbuilding. And one of the strongest scores I have heard. I was in awe from start to finish. This is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the strongest adaptations I have seen.Overall rating 96/100.",Dune

139,renegadeviking-271-528568,Dune review,9,15 October 2021,"When asked by a friend to summarize with just one word my reactions to the newest Dune screen incarnation, I replied ""Finally!"", because that's how I felt once the movie was over: finally, Frank Herbert's work has been translated on the big screen with as much accuracy in respect of the original material as the change in mediums allows.It's not perfect, granted, mostly because we were prevented from appreciating the whole story due to a deplorable lack of faith from the industry which led to the filming of just one half of the story before committing to the project in its entirety, but I appreciated and enjoyed Denis Villeneuve's vision in a way I was unable to with the previous attempts.And before launching into the review proper, I feel the need to address the proverbial elephant in the room, i.e. The comparison with the 1984 movie directed by David Lynch (I prefer to forget the existence of the 2000 TV mini-series for a number of reasons I will not list here). I rewatched Lynch's Dune a couple of weeks before the new movie's theatrical release, and while I still maintain that it is visually amazing, I could see more clearly its shortcomings, which have less to do with the changes in viewers' tastes and styles of cinematography than with the director's ""imprint"".The 1984 movie feels excessively burdened by the huge amount of inner musings employed to convey Herbert's complex world-building, and it suffers from unequal pacing since it follows more or less faithfully the original material in its first half, only to rush far too quickly in the second. Moreover, some of the acting - particularly where the Harkonnens are concerned - is way over the top, as if screenwriter and director feared that the audience would be unable to understand they were the ""bad guys"": the choice to have them constantly laugh maniacally and to add a good portion of blood and gore to their scenes had the effect - at least from my point of view - of turning them into caricatures rather than figures to be feared. I'm not completely onboard with the way the character of Paul Atreides was written and performed, as well, but I don't want to indulge in a prolonged nitpicking session...As far as visuals go, Denis Villeneuve's Dune looks more... pared down to essentials, for lack of a better definition: buildings and ships lean toward stark geometric forms, costumes tend more to the utilitarian than the flashy and the overall photography shows a preference for darker, primal shades - the greys, blues and blacks of Caladan and the earth and sand tones of Arrakis. This choice had the effect, for me, to enhance my concentration on the characters and my immersion in the images and the story which, no matter how familiar I am with it, remains a compelling one: after all, that's what we look for in works of the imagination - for an absorbing tale, one that can take us away from everyday reality for a while.Equally pared-down, but still able to convey the necessary information, is the world-building: I tried to put myself in the shoes of a viewer not familiar with Herbert's work and found that the story is quite understandable even without the huge voiceover info-dumps of its predecessor: I know for a fact that SFF audiences possess the kind of mental agility that allows them to connect the dots without need for external help, and it looks as if Villeneuve relies on this very assumption as he presents this future background without offering footnotes, or just hinting at them in a few brief snippets of dialogue.And last but not least, I appreciated how the character of Paul Atreides was portrayed: not the carefree young man who finds himself invested with the promise of godhood and in the end totally embraces it, but rather a teenager quite unsure of his role in life who discovers he's been maneuvered toward a path not of his own choosing, which in the end will cause first a profound breach with the mother who shaped him so and then will leave him somewhat distrustful of the future role he's called to play. This is the way I always envisioned Paul in the book, and I hope that Part 2 of the movie - if it will be filmed - will focus more on this aspect of his personality rather than on the ""hero's journey"" side of his narrative arc, which to me is far less relevant than the existential turmoil that's part of his psychological makeup.It's difficult to review what is essentially half a story, and I have to admit that at the end of the 2 and a half hours of screen time I felt the incompleteness of it all - even though the movie ends in such a way as to organically support the infamous ""to be continued"" - but rather than be disappointed for the lack of closure, I prefer to remain optimistic that the public will acknowledge the validity of this first installment and reward it with the success necessary to allow its completion.",Dune
140,MogwaiMovieReviews,"Richly-Detailed Beauty, If A Little Dull",6,20 October 2021,"This turned out to be exactly what I expected going in: beautiful, immaculate visuals accompanying a rather stodgy and not-very-exciting story.The digital worldbuilding on display is second-to-none, with alien technology and vast desert landscapes rendered impossible to tell from reality. The actors are all excellent but the characters themselves are pretty dull, with the only truly likeable face the audience can invest in and care for being Jason Momoa being Jason Momoa for too short a time. Everyone else remains shallow and sterile and too underplayed.It has a diverse cast from around the world but thankfully very seldom feels like it is conforming to a woke political agenda. The only thing that stood out was the crowbarring a black girl (Zendaya) into being a much larger character than she was in the books or previous films: hers is the first voice we hear in the film and she pops up in visions the lead character has throughout, leading us on towards promises of beauty and love which never arrive, in much the same way that the first few seasons of Game of Thrones kept leading us on with promises of dragons.And really, most of all Dune feels like a very, very long first episode of a multi-season TV show like Game of Thrones: it's not exciting or satisfying enough on its own terms to fully succeed as a standalone film, and doesn't have an ending. For all that, it's still miles better than all the Disney Star Wars abominations, and does enough to justify a sequel or two.

Because it's 2.5 hours, if this doesn't pick up by the 90 minute mark I'm not finishing this so far overhyped nonsense it's a total snore fest.I made it through the first lame battle and to the 1hour and 20 minute mark, and I'd rather be in that Desert running from giant sand worms than finish this mind numbing garbage.Hollywood some books are not meant to be films period.Why anyone would consider this any better than a no name low budget Netflix film is beyond my mental grasp.",Dune
142,movieman6-413-929510,"Beautiful and believable effects, but a difficult story to follow.",6,18 September 2021,"Dune is a new film adaptation of Frank Herbert's book. This film adaptation is directed in part written and produced by Denis Villeneuve, the director of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049.Set in the distant future, the film is about Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the future heir to the house of Atreides. His family trades in the valuable commodity called spice, which they get from the dangerous desert planet Arrakis. Other houses try to take control of spice themselves with a hostile takeover so that they get a monopoly over here. Paul must try to stop these houses, but isn't sure if he can use the help of the local full of Arrakis.Frank Herbert's science fiction book has already been filmed in 1984 and later in 2000 there was also a short TV series of the same book. These film adaptations were not a success. As a fan of the book, director Denis Villeneuve is now trying to film the story in a dignified way. Despite the fact that Denis Villeneuve and the other screenwriters try to convey the story in a clear way, it can still seem a bit unclear to people who are not familiar with Frank Herbert's Dune story. For these people, it can seem like they are watching season four of Game of Thrones, for example, without having seen the previous seasons. Hopefully with the planned sequel they can give more clarity to the story of Frank Herbert's book without you having to read it first to understand the film better. If successful, the Dune film series could come across as the new Star Wars film of our time.What Denis Villeneuve has more luck with are the film effects that can be used in movies these days. Together with the visual effects team, he manages to portray the film beautifully and believably. With a good eye for detail, they know how to bring out the different houses with their rituals. Except for the battle over who has control over the spice raw material, you don't know clearly why the different houses attack each other.As the lead character, Timothée Chalamet still seems a bit ignorant, which may be because his character is now allowed to meddle in the affairs of his family's house for the first time. The better acting comes more from the adult film cast like Oscar Issac, Rebecca Ferguson and Josh Brolin. Other cast members also play more smaller roles, some of which don't really have a clear build-up. Cast members like Jason Momoa or Zendaya still play a minor role in this movie, but maybe some of them will get more opportunity and time to develop their characters in the sequel.",Dune

144,srdjan_veljkovic,It's remarkable... in how it makes Dune bland and uninteresting,3,19 October 2021,"Dune is a very interesting and vivid novel and story. David Lynch understood this and created a movie accordingly. Said movie was flawed in many ways, but, it got the main point correct.This variant of ""Dune"" is much less flawed. It's CGI is top-notch. There are no silly things. It smartly avoid showing the Navigators, which is so hard to do, and both Davind Lynch and the Dune mini-series do a pretty bad and kind of silly work on that.But, that's about it, for the good parts.Casting is _very_ wrong. Timothy Chalamet is too old to play Paul. He's also too tall, too skinny. Oscar Isaacs is no Leto, I don't care how big a beard he grows. Jason Momoa as Duncan is simply not sophisticated enough. Josh Brolin is probably the smallest miss, but, he, too, is simply not the high-ranking military type.By far the biggest miss is Lady Jessica. This is a woman of extra-ordinary beauty and grace. Rebeca Ferguson is not hard on the eye, but, that's simply not it. She's good at portraying skilled fighting women, which Lady Jessica is, but, it's subdued for her, and a lot of her success stems from it being such a surprise to everyone. Also, Rebeca Ferguson plays Lady Jessica as an emotional woman, which she is underneath, but she's very poised and almost stoic on the outside.Lynch did a _far_ better casting in 1984.The acting is also not very good. Lady Jessica we already touched, by Chalamet is simply too weird as Paul. At 25, he has no business being so childish, even though Paul should be 15 at this time. Even so, Paul is very much his mother's son, poised, but also takes a lot after his father, being ceremonial and a little stiff. Chalamet's Paul is a lost boy in a young man's body, disconnected from his parents and just about everyone else. Others don't do much, but what they do do is not very good or interesting. Aquaman has no place in this, especially not of Duncan Idaho.Story is not that much different than Lynch's first half of the movie, so we can't honestly say that it's closer to the source material. There's much, much more going on in the original novel and the choice of what to show is very similar in these two movies. Presumably that would be changed in the second part, where Lynch was forced to provide a more ""impactful"" ending.The pace is very slow, most of the time, but for no particular reason. Again, Lynch did a much better job. Conisder this: this is about 2.5 times longer than the first half of Lynch's movie, yet it gives only about 10% more content.The idea was probably to immerse the viewer in this world. But, it doesn't work. Not just for stuff already mentioned above, but because this world is too bland and uninteresting.Really, everything is grey, brown and dark green, with a few blue spots. There is no red, yellow, orange... Probably this was intentional, but it does not make sense, except maybe on the Harkonen homeworld.Also, everything is just so damn big. It makes no sense to create such large structures, it's simply way too wasteful.And what's with Navigators ""finding way through stars"" rather than ""folding space""? Aren't the people who created this movie aware that there's a ridiculous amount of _empty_ space between stars, way to much to be hard to navigate? I know that ""folding space"" is not where mainstream SciFi went with regards to inter-stellar travel (it's warp engines, hyperspace drives and such instead), but, ""folding space"" is actually an important piece of the Dune universe.I'm doubtful that a sequel could fix all this and it is the only reason I could think of to see this first part. Just watch Lynch's variant instead, ignore the silly special effects and some cringe-worthy dialog and go with it. It's much more fun than this and it's also more interesting and a better adaption of the original novel.",Dune

The characters are really well portrayed and cast.It's brilliantly acted and the pace is perfect. I love the way it was shot as well, it reminded me at times of the first star Wars film.I really hope this is the start of a great series of films but it has set a high bar.",Dune
147,Darkjak007,The Spice,8,22 October 2021,"Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, the Son of duke Leto of the house of atreides. One the noble house apart of the imperium empire. The house of Atreides is task with stewardship, mining and harvesting of the planet Arrakis, Where the most sought after substance in the universe the spice melange is located. The spice is so valuable because it allows the possibility of space travel among other things. So who so hold arrakis hold he key to the universal essentially. What Adores is a political struggle for control of the planet. The movie I myself found very entertaining and intriguing for the most part the story. It's pace well with the Exception of a few areas and it does give time for the characters to flesh out and describe how this world works. Especially in the first half is where most of the film shines although in some ways the second half it feels like the film kind of lingers off. Where you begin to question like where is the stopping point of it going to happen. Overall the film manages to keep you invested and leaves you wanting more. Given this is really the first half of the story one thing worth noting is that some characters you were probably expecting aren't going to be as prevalent in the film. Example don't expect to see the Emperor here. Though when it comes to performances everyone gives a top-notch performance from Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson Jason Momoa. The lead himself Timothee Chalamet does well as Paul in the first half you really buy that he's is this old prevalent noble son, who has knowledge that he really wants to know how everything works. The production he know about the Fremen natives. The second half's where it beginning to push more towards him becoming more of a warrior and a leader. It doesn't really show us much of that side so you can't really buy it. However you can see that his journey is just beginning and he if he is growing so there are possibilities that is a character will improve later. Stellan Skarsgård as the baron's great pompous vile you wish that there was way more of him in the movie then what was given. However while his personality is disgusting his physical appearance doesn't compete with the 80s film he doesn't have protruding boils and pus ridden skin. Hans Zimmer music is amazing helping build the atmosphere around the scenery, but it does feel like it's a bit too bombastic in certain scenes. It just feels as though The wild drums and the chorus vocals don't really feel necessary in someplaces like when the bene gesserit leave. Visually in comparison to the other productions of Dune it doesn't really feel like much of a comparison there's way more cg and money put here. So you're able to show off a lot more the huge scope of the planets,the sand worms,the ships it's not even it's not fair to compare to the 80s Film or the miniseries. Going back to The scenery builds up to the reveal of certain moments like you're not immediately just off to the Arrakis when we finally do get there and you see the scope of this place even though it's really just desert it still looks magnificent. The sandworms you see them for quite a while,but when they make their entrance it's big. Though with all these good things there are some bad things in the movie one being the overuse of slow Mo is one use too much. The second is all the visions Paul keeps having so many times that it feels as if it begins to get tiresome and just keeps hinting towards what's going not here but in the next film. That and Paul is why the key features of why second-half doesn't feel as strong just vision on top of vision on top of vision. But overall I enjoy the film. If you're not really into dune or never seen any of the other media or read the book, you might find it a bit boring that it doesn't really live up to the general action mentality. It's more about politics and religion from a sci-fi perspective more philosophical in the sense but it does have action it's just not a space laser shoot them Up from start to beginning. While the film here does leave off on huge cliffhanger it's just a taste the final journey.",Dune
148,dk77dk,Dune : Just another lukewarm PG-13 movie,4,28 October 2021,"A long-awaited film that is unfortunately another in a series of watered-down PG-13 films and simply does not have the intensity it would have had if the producers had given the director freedom and an R rating.Visually the film is satisfying and the special effects along with the CGI are excellent, but the film is overall lukewarm.The fight scenes are bloodless and like we're watching a cartoon, and that makes the film look like another generic superhero story. The dialogue has been carefully modified to suit modern sensibilities, and thus the story has lost on an atmosphere that is already lukewarm precisely because of the PG-13 rating. Because it's not just about violence, nudity or harsh vocabulary, PG-13 movies can't have a dark and sinister atmosphere, and that's exactly what Dune was supposed to be.The cast is mostly good, Josh Brolin is great as Gurney Halleck, and Rebecca Ferguson is a great choice for the role of Lady Jessica Atreides. Lady Jessica Atreides is probably the best part of the film, perhaps the most convincing character.The rest of the cast consists mostly of solid actors, but some are miscast for their characters. Timothée Chalamet is a great actor, but he just doesn't fit the role of Paul Atreides. Oscar Isaac is not bad in the role of Duke Leto Atreides and it is perhaps a pity that he did not actually have a bigger role.Dune is an adult story, and this film looks like a cartoon, without blood, without intensity and the necessary atmosphere that would make this film a worthy screen adaptation of this interesting story.The cinematography is great, as is the photography, but that's it. Denis Villeneuve is a great director, maybe even brilliant, but the PG-13 rating holds back every director and all he can do here is make the film visually great, and he did.Everything is nicely polished, but there's nothing beneath it, just another watered-down PG-13 story.",Dune

150,Claptrap_Reigns,Nothing,1,24 October 2021,"Quoting a review of Rolf Kasparek's Giant X I album from the Encyclopedia Metallum, nothing is on the wall here. Not the big name actors who seem to make their impression of their previous interpretations (Jason Momoa is just aquaman with a cosmic suit on, Dave Bautista is back to his WWE days with shouting that would make Vince McNeil proud) or making their worst interpretations ever (the guy from the Oldboy Remake in particular), not the non-existant plot, and surely not belieavable situations/dialogues/whatever. The only thing on the wall here is the money WB possesses in the CGI/design department but nothing else. A complete waste in every way possible.And, BTW, congratulations to the reuse of some shots from the WW84 movie, the one with the wide camera of the Amazon's isle at the beginning of the movie.

151,darkreignn,Snail-like pace drags the film down,6,24 October 2021,"I have a love-hate relationship with Denis Villeneuve - on one hand, I know that his movies are going to look visually stunning, with scores so loud that they will shake the very foundation of the theatres the film is playing in. On the other hand, I've noticed that most of his films have an apparent lack of characterization, as well as a very deliberate, snail-like pace; because of this, every Villeneuve movie feels exactly the same to me, and not in a good way. From ""Sicario,"" to ""Blade Runner 2049,"" to ""Arrival,"" and of course, to ""Dune: Part One,"" Denis doesn't seem to fluctuate from his preferred style of filmmaking. Whether or not you enjoy this, and whether or not you will specifically enjoy this in ""Dune,"" is completely up to you.I don't mind slow-burn films; and in fact, depending on the genre (horror, specifically) I prefer them. However, I think there is a time and a place for slow-burn to work effectively - perhaps ""Dune"" wasn't the time nor the place. Denis has a tendency to make his movies move slower than a turtle without limbs; and even when there is something exciting occurring on screen, Denis likes to portray the same, steady, slow-moving pace. And that is most apparent in ""Dune.""I've seen people call this movie an epic, or a tour de force of science-fiction cinema. That may or may not be true, but I have a sneaking suspicion that people are utilizing those words to hide the word that they really want to use: boring. And for a large majority of it's running time, ""Dune"" is just that. I am not trying to downplay the astounding visuals and euphoric soundtrack - because if you watch this movie strictly for those aspects, I'm sure you'd love it - however, that doesn't excuse the fact that this film isn't all that interesting. The visuals are as marvelous as you'd expect, but the plot development and character progression - both things that are essential in epics such as this - are noticeably lacking.Character development is minimal, as is believable dialogue. As such, I can almost guarantee you that you won't feel emotionally connected to any characters or their stories. Sure, you may feel a slight attachment due to how attractive and/or likable these actors and actresses are - both Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, and Timothée Chalamet are extremely attractive and, as a straight white male, I wouldn't mind taking them both out to a romantic night on the town; Jason Momoa is also charismatic as always. So, yes, if you're judging these characters based on how likable and pretty they are, then you'll feel some surface-level attachment. But other than that, there is very little meaningful dialogue or characterization that manages to naturally and organically engage viewers.Thankfully, Denis throws in more action than his movies typically have. That said, the action feels incredibly sanitized and watered down, no doubt to keep the PG-13 rating. The final action sequence in the film is exciting, well-filmed, and has some serious stakes to back it up - every other action sequence works well to show a sense of scale, but does little to draw viewers in, especially when it all looks so perfectly choreographed. Blade fights are devoid of blood; knives will have a small smearing of blood on them, but when people are sliced, diced, and stabbed, zero blood leaves their body. And unfortunately, most combat in this film is done through blades, which means that most of the combat lacks impact.I know I've just spent the majority of my review complaining about this film, but it's not all bad. As I mentioned, it looks and sounds phenomenal - also, the last 30 minutes are incredible, and I almost want to see the movie again to relive the final part of the film. All the acting is serviceable; no one gives too memorable of a performance, but no one is bad here. The action can be fun in scope and scale - and luckily, it is framed around a story that is somewhat engaging. But, I really believe that the slow pace drags this movie down. This is an almost 3-hour long film, and for a large majority of it, it's practically sleep-inducing. That said, the last 30 minutes almost make up for it, and have me looking forward to the inevitable sequel.",Dune

158,jamesjustice-92,Part one of what?,4,18 September 2021,"I've watched the original David Lynch version of 'Dune' a couple of years ago, well it's a bit far-fetched to say that I've watched it - more like the first 40 minutes after which I got bored and quit the movie. And I have to admit, if I weren't in the theater tonight I would walk out of this one too.The bell rang early on when I saw PART ONE on the movie screen and I thought, great, this is going to be one of those movies that drag along for eternity only to be continued some other time later but was there really anything to continue? What have I learned in this 2,5 hour pilot of the miniseries called Dune? Not much.The characters are paper thin as usual and leave no desire to follow any of them. Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Jason Momoa and even Oscar Isaac are there only because they're tough looking fellas who (surprise surprise!) play some tough looking characters. Rebecca Ferguson's character is plain annoying and doesn't do absolutely anything to move the plot while being a main character. Timothee Chalamet is the only one to provoke any kind of empathy toward a viewer but he wears only one face for the duration of the movie and barely scratches the surface of his own character who is supposed to be deeper than he looks but his performance, along with many others, leaves it all to guessing there could've been more (but wasn't).The whole movie builds a concept to the bigger story but in the end turns out to be just 2,5 hours of running around, changing one desert after another, buried in semi-darkness most of the time and therefore killing most of the great visuals it has, filled with repetitive lines and Hans Zimmer's trademark thundering soundtrack that you easily get tired of by the middle of the movie.After all I don't get why did the people involved think this would be a good idea to remake a mediocre movie from 40 years ago and not do it justice by making it at least better?",Dune
159,TheCorniestLemur,Someone's got bad tapeworms,9,22 October 2021,"Dennis Villa Na Wavey (can't find the sodding video now but I know I've heard someone butcher his name that badly somewhere) has done it again, folks.I can only really say he's done it once before though, because the only other film of his I've seen is Blade Runner 2049, but if you'll look in my favourite movies on my profile page, you'll know that that is one hell of a film to be introduced to a director with. And since that proved to me how good he is at taking an already iconic and brilliant sci-fi world and putting his own spin on it, well...I've been looking forward to this ever since I looked him up immediately after seeing that film and found this in his upcoming projects.I didn't know anything about Dune other than it's set on a desert planet with giant worms though, so I did what all the book nerds are always telling people to do and read the book over the last few months, and...woo boy did that only get me more excited, imagining what the guy who made Blade Runner 2049 could do with this universe.And...I wasn't disappointed. While I do think the book is great, it hasn't really aged too well, considering almost every sci-fi story written since 1965 has stolen something from it, and it does have a bit of a tendency to prattle on with unnecessary detail quite a bit.This film suffers from none of that. There's a few things it does suffer from, but my biggest issues with the book aren't really here. It's a bit exposition-heavy towards the beginning, sometimes the acting came off as slightly wooden, and the biggest problem of all, and something that I don't think could have been avoided, is that this does feel like a ""Part 1"" film. It does do its best to not feel that way by moving a pretty significant event from the second half of the book up to the end of this film, but I don't think all the shuffling in the world could have saved this film from feeling a bit unsatisfying on its own. And in addition, there's no way this would ever work as just one film, so you can't really do that either.I'm willing to go easy on it for this though, because like I said, I really don't think there was a perfect solution to this, but they still did their best to create a solution, and I do appreciate that. Other than perhaps tentatively suggesting that it may be a bit off-putting to people that haven't read the book (I don't know if it is or not), I can't think of much else to gripe about.One of the best things about Blade Runner 2049 is how achingly stunning it is from top to bottom, start to finish, and I'm pleased to say that is the case here as well. There's so many ridiculously cool designs for machines, costumes, creatures, you name it, the effects are never not convincing, and the cinematography is just...goddamn, it's bloody breathtaking. It's without question the best looking film I've seen so far this year.The casting and performances are all nearly flawless - seriously, name a character from the book and I couldn't possibly think of anyone better to play them, it adapts the first half of the book just about as perfectly as possible, with just the right amount of stuff cut out, the soundtrack and sound design in general is killer, and Denis Villeneuve just...Villeneuve'd it. Just like how he did with Blade Runner, he's made a respectful, worthy adaptation of a beloved sci-fi property, and managed to be the only person I could ever see doing it after it was over.So all I have left to say is please go see it, please go see it in the cinema, because it really does deserve the theatrical experience, and because the box office predictions for this have been a bit up in the air, and it would be the suckiest thing to ever suck if Part 2 doesn't happen because this doesn't do well enough. It would suck for everyone who loved this film, like me, it would suck for the source material, which has been long overdue for a good adaptation for decades now, and if you go look at interviews with Denis where he talks about how much he loves the book, and how it's been a lifelong dream for him to adapt it on this scale, it would suck most of all if he never got to finish his vision for this.Let's say I could quite easily imagine him getting depressed and smoking a fat load of spice if that were to happen.",Dune
160,Gubby-Allen,Generally Dull,4,9 November 2021,"A film nearly three hours long to tell a plot which never reached anything beyond mildly interesting.

161,digdog-785-717538,im too old to explain and you are too young to understand,5,23 October 2021,"Keep in mind that i hold no contempt towards Villeneuve for wanting to break up Dune into two films, as i know some people have been disappointed that they did not get to see the entire story - because, you know, it's not like Lord Of The Rings is one of the most successful films in the history of commercial filmmaking. Or Harry Potter.Anyway;There are two separate considerations i have about this film, 1. The film as its own entity, and 2. The film as a remake of the 1984 David Lynch original.Brace yourself because it's not gonna be pretty.Dune 2021 is a Netflix-level production that, like pretty much every large american studio film of the last 20-or-so years, gets everything wrong about filmmaking.Not CATASTROPHICALLY wrong, which is not even a rare occurrence these days, but still wrong enough to not be a good product, despite all the money spent to make it look pwetty.Every scene involving the Atreides military has been filmed and made to look like it's a war film about Afghanistan. The Ornithopters (which, to be fair, i hated in the book AND in the 1984 film) look like stupid helicopters, while the film has clearly established that anti-grav exists. Aquaman guy can play only one part and the dialogue is out of any mediocre war film.The miniatures for Arrakheen were genuinely some of the worst i have EVER seen in my entire life spanning back 50 years.Costumes are nothing more than football gear and Amazon-bought combat gloves.The characters try to overact one another, where when a character is briefly on screen, that scene is entirely devoted to that character, completely forgetting that a film needs to be told from the perspective of THE PROTAGONIST.Paul is an insufferable kid that constantly tries to antagonize everyone without a reason to do so; and frankly, i don't buy Chalamet being able to fight with a highschool bully, much less a Freeman. Villeneuve's idea of Paul as a literal child is absolutely in disagreement with the book (so much for sticking to the source material), and he *certainly* didn't see Duncan Idaho as a big brother, but rather as a subordinate.Lady Jessica changed from being a strong woman confident in her supernatural powers, to an abuse victim.Rabban is obviously too difficult to portray as a cruel man so they just made him big.Leto is frankly an improvement over 1984's Prochnow, which is hardly a success given how horrible he was in that film.And then, well, Skarsgard is excellent and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is such an awesome character that it cannot possibly be ruined.All these faults, the horrible, horrible costumes, the bland, empty sets, the bad acting, the bad direction, can up to a point be forgiven, but what really makes this film not recommendable in any way, is the photography.There are far too many scenes in Dune 2021 where everything is the same color. Everything is gray, or everything is olive, or everything is blue. Why?I'm sorry but from a filmmaking point of view, if you do not know how to dress a scene, you are not a filmmaker.Let's say that, if someone had read the book Dune, and had NOT seen Dune 1984, then maybe this film could hold some interest. As its own thing, it's not really a compelling story, due to the poor pacing, Villeneuve's inability to tell a story, and a truly mediocre production.And that's what i have to say for Dune 2021.Now .. for Dune 1984.2. as a comparison to Dune 1984, this film is trash. Not only does 2021 reuse word per word some not-in-the-book dialogue, but also fails to see the point of the original scene when doing so - for example (pick one), the shield training scene.1984 was criticized for the voiceover because, you know, what a horrible crime it is to portray THOUGHTS as THOUGHTS. 2021 instead just has everyone bite their teeth and mumble the same lines.1984 was accudes for being cryptic, but at least when were told what a Hunter Killer is, instead of watching the protagonist hide from a fishing lure.But sadly it's not just that, it's literally everything. If somehow Villeneuve thinks HIS version of the Rev. Gaius Mohiam' Gom Jabbar scene is superior to Lynch's, he need to be locked up. Sets, costumes, LIGHTING, pacing dialogue and acting, even SPECIAL EFFECTS (nearly 40 years later), everything is worse, and to top it off they have CUTS !!! In the scene, because **** tension.What i mean is, that, the public, you, have been so deprived of good filmmaking, that you don't even know what you are missing. What real film can be. Things like, constructing a narrative, pacing, dialogue, delivery, acting, photography, camerawork, lighting, sets, costumes, scene dressing, a proper, non-intrusive soundtrack that highlights the film rather than oppressing it, they have so disappeared from the last 30 years of film - because they require talent - that people today don't even miss them when they aren't there, but instead are happy with Jason Momoa chewing the scenery, Dave Bautista flexing, and Stilgart being reduced to a kabab shop guy.My vote: 5.5/10 - still much better than the Star Wars prequels.",Dune

163,TheVictoriousV,"It certainly feels like ""Just the beginning"", but by God am I ready for more",9,3 October 2021,"I am confident Denis Villeneuve's Dune will go down as the definitive screen version of Frank Herbert's revolutionary novel (as with Greta Gerwig's take on Little Women; technically the latest one of many, but undoubtedly the finest).We all know the 1984 David Lynch version and how fate was unkind to it. Some will also be aware of the previous attempt by Alejandro Jodorowsky, as documented in the film Jodorowsky's Dune, where the concept art by H. R. Giger at least eventually gave us 1979's Alien - this particular Dune adaptation was ultimately lost.Now, we have what's possibly the ultimate Dune film, and its director has been exquisitely selected, having previously expanded on Ridley Scott's Blade Runner in a way that made the world feel larger, without forgetting the themes and internal rules of what it set out to adapt. (I know a certain other science-fiction/Fantasy franchise that's been having some trouble with that; it was about stars going to war or some nonsense.) Granted, had Villeneuve truly been free from Sony's influence when he made Blade Runner 2049, we wouldn't have had Rick Deckard's involvement spoiled by the advertising.As for Dune, the world of its source material indeed feels more awesome in size - and intricate in detail - than in the 1984 film, and Villeneuve's knack for imposing visuals and atmosphere, resulting in that sense of interstellar awe that good science-fiction ought to bring, remains untarnished. He understands the sheer otherworldly potential of cinema, better than many other blockbuster-makers.Hollywood can render new CG worlds, ""cool"" creatures, and idiotic action scenes starring Black Widow to their heart's content; they will always seem cartoony and predictable without the right shading, weight simulation, framing, and sound design. It looks and feels as if we've entered a distant moment in mankind's future, where the sights are truly new and humbling, yet our proclivity for conquest, fanaticism, and imperialism remains the same - they're not just dangling Cybertron or Lamentis in front of the adult babies' faces.That being said, I admit there are some things that seem studio-imposed for the sake of juicy PR, including race- and gender-bending of various characters. The reason given by Warner Bros. Is that making the characters into ostensibly oppressed groups served to complement their roles in this universe; to better mirror our own peoples, or perhaps predict their fate. I understand the book was partially inspired by Middle Eastern culture and Islam, and that white-washing the ""Fremen"" in particular might've weakened its impact - and, for lack of a better term, its relevance. My only issue is with the cringey reactions from the Usual Journalists.This is to say nothing of Vanity Fair's Generation Z-friendly reporting that Timothée Chalamet's character will be akin to Greta Thunberg if she was, and this is an actual quote, ""a Jedi with a diploma from Hogwarts"" (which several droning stans probably think she is already). I don't know that Dune ever panders to the little activists quite so embarrassingly, but the article surely turned some heads. This is what matters.Speaking of actors, the film features a myriad of Hollywood stars, all of them seminally cast in terms of both appearance and skill. Chalamet now plays Paul Atreides, Oscar Isaac portrays his father Leto (the Duke of House Atreides and the new head of the ""spice-mining"" colonies of Planet Arrakis), Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica, Zendaya is Chani, Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, Jason Momoa is Duncan Idaho, Javier Bardem is Stilgar, Charlotte Rampling is Gaius Helen Mohiam, and Stellan Skarsgård (gloriously) plays the beastly Baron Harkonnen.There's also Dave Bautista as Harkonnen's most trusted nephew and David Dastmalchian as Piter, the ""Mentat"" of his house/planet. Many of these characters barely get an introduction - which is one of many ways that Dune feels exactly like what it is; the first half of the first book.Of course, not everything in the film feels ""new"". We've naturally been to the world of Dune before, albeit a cornier version of it. Some images and themes bring Star Wars, Mad Max, The Chronicles of Riddick, and Oblivion to mind (note that the Dune books predate these works by a minimum of ten years), as well as previous Villeneuve pictures like Arrival and the aforementioned Blade Runner (there are even some visual call-backs to his first masterpiece Incendies).But it's the sense of scope he brings to these visuals that make them feel truly alien and intimidating, albeit maintaining a human element (i.e. The many great characters and their roles in the system) that makes this future seem believable; a world where computers are banished but we've discovered the ""spice"" that may make our meaty brains surpass the computational power of machines. There is a sense that we've come a long way, possibly much too far.",Dune
164,jackgdemoss,Movie of the Year,10,24 October 2021,"From a world-building perspective, Dune is the best movie I have ever seen. The source material is Frank Herbert's science fiction novel of the same name, which apparently is as lore dense as mainstream science fiction reading can get. This makes the screen writing even more impressive considering how clearly and concisely the audience is fed information without ever resorting to tiresome exposition. After 45 minutes, I couldn't have been more immersed into the world. I had such a potent feeling that I had been transported to another place; a feeling I haven't had in a long time at the movies.Director Denis Villenueve did a masterful job at world building and communicating key plot elements as well. His choice to make everything seem to take place on such a grand scale was perfect. Every time there was a massive sandworm, city, or collector, he always placed the shot in the context of something easier to understand the size of, like a human. The combination of understanding the scope and stakes of what our characters were dealing with while also seeing them surrounded by goliath structures and beings was mesmerizing.Of course a review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the goose-bump inspiring work done by Hans Zimmer. The sound design and score were rock solid throughout the entire runtime, but I distinctly remember two 30-50 second scenes were Hans composed a truly unique orchestra that quite literally sent a shiver down my spine. At this point if he is signed on to a film, then I am signed on.The only possible critiques of this film are it's lack of advertisement that it is part one of a story, and that it can be mildly difficult to follow for some. I was thrilled to see that it was only part one during the opening scene, and it curbed my expectations to see a fully complete and boxed story. Dune is the best sci-fi epic I have seen since Interstellar, and I hope anyone reading this sees it in theatres.",Dune
165,gareth-75442,$165 million dollar snorefest,2,19 October 2021,"Mind numbingly boring & drab,Dune is the perfect antidote for insomnia.While the cgi, cinematography & sets all look excellent none of it can save a movie with such a dismally uninteresting story.Dune is the cinematic equivalent of the proverb "" you can't polish a turd"".With more pointless ""slow mo"" than the entire fast & furious franchise & every actor delivering performances as if they'd been deprived of sleep for days, this reimagined /rebooted version of Dune looks to be more of an Apple TV + show than a big budget theatrical movie release.The highlights of the movie was the introduction of a ""sand mouse"", a very cute, excellently animated creature of the desert with the depiction of the gigantic ""sand worm"" being slightly less interesting.Dune's comic moments, albeit unintentional was the interesting looking but ultimately silly ""dragonfly helicopters"" which looked more at home in a children's animated cartoon show & the phrase ""desert power"" in reference to an individual riding on the back of a giant sand worm ""surfing"" the desert,
both silly when uttered & witnessed.Denis Villeneuve's 2021 version of Dune is no better or worse than David Lynch's 1984 offering but lynch's Dune is delivered with fervour & gusto & it's actors portray the characters they play with the depth & drama befitting a blockbuster sci-fi drama whereas Villeneuve's version is delivered with all the excitement of a ""damp squid"" & it's actors delivering their performances as if they wished they could be anywhere but on the set of Dune.Villeneuve looks to have decided to attempt to mimick the epic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" for his version of Dune, which the memoirs of T. E. Lawrence was in part the inspiration for Herbert's original story, but Villeneuve's version has nothing of the spectacle or grandeur of that movie.There is no doubt that Frank Herbert's Dune novels (1 thru to 6) were epic in their world building & the other 15 or so books expanded even more to the before, during & after of those six novels but all in all its a matter of preference when it comes to any genre & the story therein, Dune is inherently boring & Villeneuve's version is no different, suited more to a dreary TV drama similar to ""Raised by Wolves"" or the slightly more interesting but no less dreary ""Foundation"" than a ""blockbuster"" movie.",Dune
166,daniewhite-1,Drains,5,30 October 2021,"'Dune' is a drain to watch, a drain to listen to and a drain to review: so many boring characters in one film; so many boring minutes in one film and so much boring dialogue in one film; boring music and boring set designs, boring costumes, boring cinematography and boring actors; but heavy like a devotional tract with earnest angst and hunger for meaning and sense.Hardly a science fiction film, hardly developing any human character beyond a simple familial status, hardly giving it's cast anything to do: that's 'Dune' for you.The action pieces are well done, operating with verve and suspense and some sense of risk and jeapardy which I found highly complementary.There is some modulation of pacing in the narrative which just about saves this film from becoming utterly trapped in quicksand and sinking deep to its own centre of gravity on a few occasions.Sometimes the non-linear narrative structure works well and sometimes it serves to further diminish my enthusiasm towards this act of storyfication.Compared to the ill-fated and infamous Lynch version there is almost no hard sci-fi with all its attendant visual and thematic imagination, no depth to political machinations, and no scenes driven by character interaction and definition.This version of the Dune novel is mystical, mythical and magical and it's loud and it's dark and it's flat but the sound mix doesn't handle the sound effects and the score well together: the two often countermanding the other; the cinematography is dark and bereft of sufficient colour at all times; it is slackly acted, directed and edited with a lazy dwelling on scenes which could have been composited into a fewer number of more functional sequences.In this sense the writing must be held accountable also: simply put the requirement to break the novel in two has honestly wrecked this feature and left it a narrative mess. If this was my introduction to cinema storytelling I would not reindulge myself.It has also left the ensemble cast with utterly inadequate characters to work with and consequently they universally hand in shoddy work and often they look bored and awkward whilst doing so.I do rate a 5/10 average score, which matches my rating of the Lunch version, because I was genuinely impressed with much of the action scenes, and a small part of the production design and the modulated and nonlinear narrative is just about able to hold it together for two and a half hours.I recommend to fans of 60's counterculture and in that sense this might be quite a successful adaptation of the source material. It just isn't an entirely successful film treatment of it for me. If you like mystical art which has a calling towards the human religious and spiritual inclinations you may find nourishment here also.",Dune
167,fung0,A Towering Mediocrity,5,27 October 2021,"I can't say I'm disappointed with Dune, given the track record of director Denis Villeneuve. In the past, he has stooped to artsy garbage (Enemy), weak adaptations (Arrival, which avoids exactly those elements that made its source an unsettling classic), and hollow spectacle (Blade Runner 2049, an endless, empty, at times ludicrous mess).That said, I didn't hate Dune. I simply found it lackluster.The good: the visuals are splendid. The music is nice, though not exactly memorable. The narrative sticks wisely close to the book.The not so good: first of all, the casting. Not one of the actors in this film really blows me away. Paul Atreides, in particular, is far too weak to hold our attention. Not terrible, but at the same time not capable of suggesting the hidden strength that will soon make him a leader of men, a 'mahdi.' Jessica does a nice job with what she's got, but the script leaves her little to do but whimper, without suggesting the deep well of authority the character should have. The Duke Leto probably fares best, though again I think he's portrayed as a rather weak character, not the iron duke of the book.The worst: the pacing. I didn't find the slow, deliberate pace to be annoying. However, Dune the book is actually both dense and fast-paced. By taking the slow road, Villeneuve leaves no room for the background and character depth that's really needed for a proper epic. Grand vistas are not what make films like Lawrence of Arabia great - it's the deep, powerful storytelling. Even if Villeneuve was allowed to stretch this franchise to three films, it would be too late to fill in the missing detail in this first installment.I hate to think what anyone unfamiliar with Dune, the book, will make of this eye-candy adaptation. Probably, they'll wonder why anyone would bother adapting such a lethargic and superficial book. Dune the movie comes across as a Cliff's Notes version of the book: faithful, yet without any of the juice that make the book so compelling. See it if you have a spare evening, but don't feel there's any urgency about it.",Dune
168,ajkbiotech,Terrific but not perfect,9,24 October 2021,"This film was terrific.It had great action, great CGI, terrific acting, and it was reasonably faithful to the Book by Frank Herbert.It's hard to pinpoint the reason why I rated this a 9 rather than a 10, but I'll list some;1) the pace was rather slow;2) Rebecca Ferguson as the Bene Gesserit mother was surprisingly flat. She just doesn't carry the role the way it should be carried.3) they do not really explain the reasons for removing the House of Harkonnen, inserting the House of Atreudes, and then attacking the House Atreides, all on Arakis, as if we've all read the book and know it. I think this is a fatal error.4) the film fails to explicate the Bene Gesserit to any extent, instead assuming the viewer has already read the book, etc.I could go on, etc., but in general, this is a great film, but it's just not for the first time general viewer unfamiliar with the Dune Saga.",Dune
169,namob-43673,"Its okay for a pretentious, artsy slow moving nonsense movie",5,27 September 2021,"This is stunning to look at and if cinematography is all you care about then yes this is a great movie. But if you like actual content, great script, amazing directing, and fabulous acting, then this is not for you. While watching this movie I constantly had the feeling that some art director got a good book in his hand and waved his hand to create his most pretentious artsy ever - but in doing so forgot to build things up, to let the characters breath and to develop the story in a way so we all can grasp and understand and feel with the protagonists.Not that this is a bad movie. It isn't. But this is neither a very good movie. There are a lot of great parts, and you can feel the intention, but its simply not there. They failed at putting it together, they failed at making it whole with a coherent story. Yes, perhaps the coming movie/s will further the story and we will get it all, but that is not great storytelling and it is not a good way of getting the audience to love what you are telling them.I saw a couple of other reviewers arguing they should have made a TV series out of this instead to really be able to tell the story, and I wholeheartedly agree. A few other reviewers called it boring and that they almost fell asleep, and I get that too...Without going into details and spoilers I cannot review this movie much more. I do recommend this movie, it is beautiful. However if you are an action junky or do not like a 2,5hrs movie moving very slowly while trying to setup the world and not doing a good job at it, then perhaps you should not watch this?I ended up giving this a 5/10 and I think that is reasonable, but perhaps actually generous...",Dune

This one give a really big hanging feeling, didn't know it was good or not. You can feel that this first movie was all about 'introduction'. Feels weird tho, because they rush and over doing it.I pretty surprise about how the story was quite easy to understand despite all the new name, language, troops, planet name. And i really see a lot of reference from my believe in this movie tho, don't get me wrong, im cool with it but some people might not.Visually great, some cgi need upgrade for this movie with this scale.

They should be ashamed of themselves.,Dune
172,dakjets,Would have loved a proper ending,7,25 September 2021,"I had high expectations for Denis Villeneuve's Dune. I'm also one of those who appreciated David Lynch's version from 1984. The only thing I knew in advance about this film was a lot of great reviews.And in many ways it does not disappoint, but I was not aware that this is set to be a series, on Dune 2, 3 ...? I quickly understood that as the plot is much more elaborate and in-depth than in Lynch's version. I like to watch movies with an end, so it was a downturn that I have to wait 2-3 years to see a sequel.But beyond that, there are fantastic effects, good actors, incredible film music (see it at the cinema !!). Stellan Skarsgaard makes a powerful debut in the film as the Baron. But everyone is good here.Despite being two and a half hours long, I would have preferred it even longer to get an ending. I'm not a fan of francise.",Dune
173,Michael Fargo,A Beautiful Mess,6,22 October 2021,"I hope this is the final attempt to bring Herbert's science fiction classic to the screen. It would be easy to dismiss this if the talent behind it weren't so impressive. And there is a lot to be impressed by in the film. But it is so static, it could be a submission to a Folio Society special edition of the book for illustrations. Oh, there's people in motion, but often we don't really understand who they are, why they are where they are; or, if they do something, why it matters. The screenplay's dialog is jarring. And Hans Zimmer's thunderous imaginative score fills in for the justifying classy visuals. I wound up looking forward to how Timothée Chalamet's hair was going to appear from scene to scene since the dialog was absolutely no help in explaining whatever else was going on. The characters speak in long expository speeches that even if it wasn't indecipherable, it wouldn't help us care about any of the characters.The art direction (and the score) run off with the movie leaving us abandoned in a murky, clearly epic, story that a ""White Savior"" was going to rescue the Universe from greed and substance abuse. And we know how well that's worked out. The whole idea that Western culture is going ""save"" exotic Islam (or vice versa) is dated and more than a little offensive.Villeneuve's previous films reveal an understanding of the beat and rhythms of story telling. Since that is missing from ""Dune,"" you have to wonder if the project overwhelmed him. (It certainly is overwhelming to watch.) After the midway point (over an hour into the film) there seems to be an awareness of how stagnant--even trite--the film is: ""Waaaa, I don't want to be a duke,"" ""Waaaa, I don't to have special powers,"" and a pointless excursion into the dunes, things pick up, but they're leaden and very tired. ""It's a trap!"" Yea, it is. And from where Part I ends, we're going to have to a whole other hour of exposition to get us through Part II. Very discouraging.",Dune
174,PetarNeo,Be prepared (not) to be blown away,8,19 October 2021,"Considering it's been 25+ years from first try to bring us sandstorm to the big screens there had to be hope for this one and for most parts it did not disappoint. Denis Villeneuve took all he got and put it into trying to tell compelling story that will have sense but if you haven't read the book, you will be like a dog chasing a speeding car that can never catch it.Story keeps on delivering but considering what is known and what is not if you are someone who is looking forward to enjoying this movie, it's biggest strength is visuals that are spectacular and astonishingly beautiful and casting that has brought some great performances that are not be laughed at like in Lynches Dune.Saying all that and knowing backstory of everything if you are unknown with world of Dune you might suffer from information's that may seem irrelevant or having no meaning.Now coming to bad part of all this. Movie feels like 5 hours long but being 2.5h and in a bad way it feels like trailer for Epic Space Opera that could be 10+ movies. Part two needs to happen otherwise movie loses all meaning and senses. As standalone this movie will probably be forgotten in nearby future because you have seen it all in ""Old Dune"" but now you have visuals that are great.Back to good things, score in this movie is amazing, it continues to provide with it's setting and atmosphere and it never stops on giving. Casting for some roles is miraculous, such as Harkonnen's, as they really feel like thy should and finally Sandworm looks amazing, feels amazing and makes you wanna run.All in all movie feels like it should have been 4 hours long at least, to deliver punch that it should have and filmmakers should not be under pressure to cut their movies and dream a little bigger.It deserves a praise for all efforts that went into making it because it definitely feels like Space Opera that have been robbed of some things but they'll be forgiven if they deliver satisfying Part Two.",Dune

Why were the guild navigators Not in this installment?...as I was watching, I kept wondering if I had missed something..Certainly as it played true to the 84 movie in so many parts, they would Also be having that awesome scene where a guild navigator was introduced but no go.In the next movie they say it will be so but I missed it and this one felt lacking for its absense..I felt the lead actor doing paul atreides did a fantastic job..Ive see timothy in another period piece and he was a King therein and blew me away..Young or not, this fellow commands the screen
even with his slight physical presence..the other choices for cast were outstanding,especially brolin and mamosa.The actresses that could have brought More weight of Presence to their roles were the actress playing jessica and lastly zendya, who as soon as she opens her mouth feels out of place and out classed.. there are far better choices and while she has looks, that alone will not carry anyone in a movie of this caliber when surrounded by some seriously capable actors...The woman playing Jessica, she did ok but not at all the standout that the actress in that 84 version made of her role...This woman lacked the force and carriage and articulation of a woman of her status and power.. not bad but there are many others who could have done it better..I watched on a home theater with great sound on a 50"" screen, I can only imagine what a full theater experience would be like with this Although, I often find watching at home sounds as good and is far more enjoyable..You'd have to twist my arm to get me into a theater..",Dune

They reminded me of video games, to be honest.There was no real sense of the politics of it all. Oh, OK, we got the bits about the spice and the fear the Emperor had of the Duke, who was popular, but then when the Landsraad was mentioned, who would have known what it was? Why did the Guild need the spice? How come the Sardaukar were so ferocious?Yes, we knew if we'd read the book, but one couldn't tell just from seeing the film.I'll watch the second instalment, if it's ever made, but it won't be with bated breath that I'll be waiting.",Dune
178,Lewis_Heather787,Modern day epic!!!,8,19 October 2021,"Thank you Warner Bros. For trusting an extremely talented director, tell a story with the required budget and not interfere with the process! However on the same note, they better not dare abandon the plans for ""Part Two"" when this film doesn't make anywhere near the money they want it too.This film is the definition of a modern day epic!! Large scale production, one of the most talented directors around at the helm and an insane array of actors on display. Plus add on top of that, trying to start a new film franchise and adapting one of the most beloved and respected Sci-fi books. Films like this don't come around very often, whether you love this film or hate it we should appreciate the fact we've got it!!Denis Villeneuve, thank you thank you thank you for bringing your vision for Dune to the big screen!! To me he was the perfect choice to take on such an enormous task and for the most part he pulled it off. Immaculate directing from start to finish, this film is a real fest for the eyes !! Coupled with the production design, CGI and cinematography this film is simply magnificent!!! The best part of the job that Villeneuve has managed to pull off, is the fantastic world/universe building he has done in one film. Whether that be the languages, fight techniques, technologies or the politics used in this universe, all are explained enough for you to understand straight away. It informs the audience extremely well on the foundations of Dune and the characters inside it.....which will go a long way for people that are completely foreign to source material.The cast......I mean where do I start ? All of them across the board are just sublime. Timothee Chalamet is awesome as Paul, cant wait to see him grow into the role even more. Oscar Issac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem are all terrific !! For me though Stellan Skarsgard is just simply haunting and is one of the standout performances!!I do have a couple issues with the film though, they are minor. Firstly I feel as if the runtime is a little too long, I don't think its necessary for it to be 2hr 30mins, it could have been cut down just a little bit. For me the last 45 mins of the film did start to drag just a little bit but only slightly. The other issue I have is the fact this film will heavily rely on a sequel being made and very much feels like a first film. Not a complete film in itself, if you get what I mean? Now I can understand if that drives people crazy and makes you dislike it.......puts more pressure on it performing well enough that the studio does green light the sequel. (I know originally Villeneuve wanted to shoot both films back to back). Warner Bros. Shouldn't shy away from making the sequel if this one doesn't meet their box office expectations, they have plenty of other franchises that'll make them $1Billion+ !! It would be a damn shame if ""Part Two"" for this film is not made!! I think its 100% needed, otherwise this film will forever look out of place slightly.Overall 85% out of 100 I thought it was really good and I had high expectations going into it, thankfully they were met....although I do have my issues with parts of the film! This film wont be for everyone however if you are into Sci-Fi then its a must see......films made like this with the talent in front and behind the camera don't happen all the time!! Enjoy the experience!!!",Dune
179,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Let the Spice Flow,8,24 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve did a great job of adapting this story. The book can kind of be a hard read since you have to get used to all the new terms used in it. And I think he did a good job helping the audience understand what's going on. I didnt feel lost at all. And definitely better than the 80s version which I couldnt even finish. Not just in terms of special effects or acting - but for instance thois Baron Harkonnen remains creepy but without the ""WTF"" factor the 80s version had.If I had to give a drawback, it does get a bit annoying getting introduced to new characters like halfway or sometimes right towards the end of the movie. But, thats just how the story is so I cant really fault Denis for that. And it does feel long. Though I partly think it feels so long because knowing its Part 1, I would come to a point in the movie where I would think ""Ok, its probably gonna end here, this seems like a story beat to end on""...and then it would keep going. And then I would hit another point where I would think ""Ok, this seems like a good spot to end on"" and it would keep going. If it wasnt for that and this had been entire story of Dune in one go, I dont think I would have noticed the time too much.Anyway go see the film. In the very least if the story or sci-fi isnt your thing, its visually a treat and will probably be up for numerous technical awards at the Acasemy Awards.",Dune
180,eldreddsouza,Not the masterpiece everyone is hailing it to be. Story is just okay and ends abruptly.,6,26 October 2021,"I really liked some parts of this film but after a point I just didn't care about it anymore. The casting while some of it was great, some were plain bad. I liked the first hour quite a bit I must say. The world building and all was nicely done. But after that first hour the film just doesn't make sense. It was just randomness mixed in a desert. Nothing else. In fact the whole movie literally seems like a set up. There's just not much interesting stuff happening. The scale on which this film was made feels great and imo that's the only thing that'll make you stay till the end. Because as far as the screenplay is concerned, it's quite mediocre, long and filled with unimportant scenes. There's hardly any action in this film. Even the ones that are there though look great, you don't feel fully invested as there's no proper build up. This makes for a great theatre watch as the visuals are quite nice but if you're not familiar with the original work, I'd say don't expect much from the story. Go in only for the cinematic experience. You won't be disappointed. The story seemed a bit nonsensical for me. Don't get me wrong. I love sci-fi and Star Wars (original trilogy) is something I dearly hold to my heart, but the story of Dune seemed just about okay to me. Loved the visuals though. Although nothing crazily extraordinary, but really really good.",Dune

183,nidhunmoviebuff,A visual spectacle of epic proportions!,8,18 October 2021,"The world's foremost visual storyteller Dennis Villeneauve has really let loose and outdone himself with the latest retelling of the fantasy classic 1965 Frank Herbert novel 'Dune'.Powered by a star studded cast headlined by the terrific Timothee Chalamet and the elegant Rebecca Ferguson, part one of the duology constructs an elaborate yet politically laden universe with plenty of intrigue, politics and emotional undertones.Set far in the distant future, Oscar nominee Chalamet stars as a young Duke of House Artiedes, tasked by the Imperial emperor to harvest the 'spice' fuel of the mysterious planet Arrakis. Plagued by troubling visions and hounded by a rival dynasty, how the young Duke comes to terms with one harrowing predicament after another forms the rest of the gripping tale.Every frame by cinematographer Grieg Fraser should be a separate exhibit at the Louvre, with Villeaneauve having outdone himself even by his lofty standards. Jason Momoa, Zendaya, Javier Bardem and Oscar Issac shine in their supporting roles while Stellan Skarsgard makes a spine-chilling antagonist.Josh Brolin's and Dave Bautista's characters had very limited screen time to make any impact and one can only hope that their character arcs are explored further in the upcoming sequel.The suspenseful and aesthetically pleasing narrative has a strong screenplay as its backbone with the music by Hans Zimmer generating the goosebumps as well as a sense of awe and inspiration at the opportune moments.Dune is Villeneauve's pièce de résistance.

Visually it's fine although not amazing, and Hans Zimmer's score is technically not bad, although it gets a bit bombastic and repetitive for my tastes personally.The characters are very bland and nothing special. Unless you have to read the book to get it, I simply have no idea what I was supposed to be rooting for or care about. Shooting scenes in a desert for a good amount of the runtime just didn't impress me much here. The film has no satisfying ending and yeah there's just nothing memorable. The acting is fine I guess, but overall super disappointed.4/10.",Dune
185,kenzibit,Prepare for a bit slow and amazing long movie.,7,18 October 2021,"This movie has some great sequences and ideas.... concept is rich when it comes to planetary plots. I really admired it. The story was deep and in building it to make audiences appreciate what's going on, it kinda introduces some boring and slow developments. Not too many action sequences but had some amazing CGI rendering with nice city developments and desert ideas. I recommend you take your time with the movie and enjoy it without comparison to any previous one. Not perfect but great.",Dune
186,sirwillisiv,A noble start; a fine example of visual storytelling...,8,10 November 2021,"As someone who has read the book twice, Dune does everything in its power to be a noble adaptation of a thematically complex and borderline unfilmable story. Plus it's one captivating piece of art to behold. This film only covers the first half of the book, which initially left me concerned but after seeing it I think that was the most practical course of action in order to fit as much detail as possible. Albeit, that does come at a price. Similar to the first installment of the Hobbit films and the seventh entry in the Harry Potter saga, Dune is somewhat light on the action and the pacing can be a tad sluggish, making the ""first part"" feeling stick out like a sore thumb. However, I give Dune some leeway because it's such an intricate and vulnerable narrative. Every character, action and dialogue carries so much importance. One arrant change is like deleting a bracket in computer code, the whole picture will just fall apart. Thankfully, Denis Villeneuve ensured this new cinematic take on Dune stays very consistent with the original story while maintaining a dignified tone through spot-on performances and boasting a breathtaking, artful scope. It begs to be seen on the largest screen possible. A mighty fine example of visual storytelling, Dune leaves you hanging at a sensible spot and sets a promising standard for its second half, which I predict will up the ante.",Dune

Too much emphasis on the visuals at the expense of the story. Maybe if I had read the book this would have been more enjoyable.

When Javier Bardem showed up on screen along with Josh Brolin I couldn't help but smile (especially since I also love No Country for Old Men).

The movie takes its time to show the landscape to create certain atmosphere and it does it well, with beautiful shots, even though I can see some might think it's too slow, too long and boring, I enjoyed the entire runtime of the movie.What let me down quite a lot, therefore not the 9-10 I was thinking about the first hour, was the action.It seems that this director really enjoys the slow setting shots, but is not the best at shooting action, the fighting scenes were quite mediocre on its choreography and rarely used any interesting angle or lighting, definitely not at the level of the rest of the cinematography, and in a movie like this, where the story is pretty much an excuse for hand to hand fights and action, this failing was quite a disappointing and ruined a bit the whole thing.Still the good acting, beautiful shots (of the slow parts!) and good production made the movie a good watch.We'll have to wait a bit for the ending though, as it's only the first half of the story, but I'll be there to watch it!",Dune

An exceptional masterpiece, with impeccable direction and cinematography, unique shots and scenery combined with imposing music and serious acting. An excellent transfer of the Dune story, with absolutely realistic effects on the big screen. But as with another epic, The Lord of the Rings, so with Dune, this movie will split into 2 or 3 parts rather than one standalone film. A unique fantasy story that was realized for the first time in such a way on the big screen! It is a new MUST but also a reference film for this genre.

199,grygotis,A marvel of filmmaking,9,27 October 2021,"As someone who thought the book a sludge to get through many years ago, I really wasn't sure this was something I even wanted to see and for about a half hour or so, I thought I was right, but then it comes alive. This is a magnificent production and a feast for the eyes and ears. I actually got involved with the complex storyline after a while and it just got more exciting and at times, much to my surprise, tension ridden as it went along with stunning scenes and sequences. It is beautiful filmmaking with a number of technical Oscars headed it's way. I can't imagine CGI ever getting better than this. The cast is excellent, though I think it would have been better to avoid an actor from Star Wars, and particularly one from Guardians of the Galaxy who distract from this vision. Chalamet is a puzzle to me. When I see him in pictures, interviewing, awards shows, he is just some not terribly interesting skinny little guy, but on film he is something else entirely. I've never seen him give anything close to a poor performance. He was outstanding in Call Me by Your Name, and so sad the sequel will now never happen, and deserved another Oscar nomination for Beautiful Boy. He won't get one for this as this is not an actor's film, but nevertheless he plays this role perfectly and this guy has presence! I've seen him strong, weak, childish, romantic, soft, tender, rebellious, funny, intellectual, you name it. This skinny little unimposing dude is a terrific and versatile actor who somehow blossoms on the screen and is becoming a major film star. I also appreciated Rebecca Ferguson, but everyone does well. Villeneuve has become one of this era's great filmmakers. I'm not into Marvel movies and while the first two were great and some recent ones were pretty good, I am done with Star Wars, and I've seen so many spectacle type movies in my life I thought I was done with all of those as well, but this proved maybe not if you have a new vision and this much talent.

Sure some cool stuff does happen but it's still limited in the 150 min. It also seems to be a little too close to finch's adaption which is disappointing but what you gonna do?

203,hunter-friesen,A Desert-Sized Disappointment,6,22 October 2021,"Like humanity's search for the missing link or the cure for cancer, movie studios have unsuccessfully tried and failed to adapt Frank Herbert's daunting 1965 science fiction novel, ""Dune,"" which laid the framework for several subsequent entries in the genre such as ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner.""Cult film director Alejandro Jodorowsky tried in the early 1970s, but financial troubles stopped him from getting past pre-production, a story which has now become immortalized in the critically acclaimed 2013 documentary ""Jodorowsky's Dune."" Over a decade later, David Lynch, armed with the mega millions of super-producer Dino De Laurentis, was utterly crushed by the weight of the material, which was forcibly squeezed into a two-hour runtime. Years went on as names such as Ridley Scott and Peter Berg attached to the project, but nothing ever came to fruition. Now in 2021, it's time for Denis Villeneuve - director of ""Sicario,"" ""Arrival,"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" - to attempt what has been thought to be impossible.To prevent the mistake of Lynch's adaptation, the 412-page novel has been split into two parts. Despite not bearing that moniker in the official title, the phrase ""part one"" does flash underneath the main title in the opening sequence. This comes as a warning to those expecting a complete narrative. Like ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" and ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"" ""Dune"" is here to establish the major events that will come in the sequel, which has yet to be officially confirmed. But rather than faring like those two examples, ""Dune"" falls more in line with ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant,"" which shuddered the series before the conclusion could be filmed.Now, that's not to say that ""Dune"" shares all the same qualities as that cinematic failure. Villeneuve is one of the most financially efficient directors working today, as he gets maximum value out of every dollar within his budget. With $165 million at his disposal, Villeneuve has crafted a universe of mythological proportions. From desert landscapes crawling with sandworms to interstellar cruisers, the scale that Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser work with is something to behold. Seeing this in IMAX brings a reward worth far more than the ticket price.But for all its grandiosity on a technical level, what's at the heart and soul of ""Dune"" is shockingly small. Taking place in the year 10191, the story centers on Paul Atreides, prince of the great house who rules over Caladan. Soon, the family is ordered by the unseen Emperor to govern Arrakis, which overflows with the precious mineral known as ""spice."" The natives of the planet called the Fremen, resent their colonial oppressors, a feeling that Paul slowly begins to understand. After imperial betrayal, Paul's loyalty and place within the universe begin to be tested as he is led down an unfamiliar path.That plot description may be admittedly light, but a proper one would require much more precious margin space. Villeneuve (his first writing credit since coming to Hollywood) along with veteran Eric Rith and Jon Spaihts seem to have punted all the interesting material for the latter edition. What's left is a shallow plot with dangling thoughts on colonialism, the chosen one, and religious allegories. Ironically, the groundbreaking material within the novel has been mined so many times that the film adaptation of it feels like a carbon copy.That feeling of emptiness stretches into the cast as well, despite it being filled with a roster of immense international talent. Boiling down to being described as space Jesus, the character of Paul Atreides is one of awkwardness and enlightenment. Timothée Chalamet is fitting in the role, working his gawky frame and soft voice past the limitations of the script.Through no fault of their own, the rest of the cast aren't able to shine as much as they should, with interesting actors such as Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skargård, Jason Momoa, and Charlotte Rampling being brushed aside for umpteen amounts of landscape shots. At some point, those beautiful vistas begin to feel empty, as the human element has been restricted to a minimum.""Dune"" is an odd case of style over substance, in that the substance is there but was intentionally left out for another time. It's a gamble that may pay off once Part 2 is released, but until then it leaves this first part as a desert-sized disappointment.",Dune
204,MamadNobari97,Why Wasn't This 4 Hours?,8,25 October 2021,"Obviously I'm a sucker for a Denis Villeneuve's movie and love everything he does and I liked this one too, it unfortunately is not as good or epic as I thought it's gonna be and needed more time to actually get to the third act we didn't get.As thousands have already said, this movie is a really good start to this franchise and I hope it gets a sequel because if not, it's really a shame and there's no reason to watch it standalone.And obliviously the visuals are amazing as ever and accompanied with Hans Zimmer's music is just audio-visual orgasm.One of the things I always admired about Villeneuve's works is that no matter how big the movie is, he doesn't forget and sacrifices character and characterization and that's the most important thing in a movie and a story. The thing that Nolan has apparently forgotten as we saw in the Tenet movie that he didn't even care to give his ""protagonist"" a name, much less a characterization and character development. And unfortunately, this movie suffers from that problem too. It's almost as if it was made for the people who have already read the book and know the details. We didn't spend much time with characters like Duncan so we don't get emotionally attached to them. I hope that they fix this in the next movie and give us a better understanding of the characters.Another gripe I have is the world-building of this movie, I know show don't tell is really important but somethings just have to be said in order to understand the world better. The entire epic of DUNE revolves around the expensive spice called Melange, which the name isn't even mentioned once, why? And they don't really emphasize on the importance of this spice and the hows and whys of it's expensiveness and why everyone want it. We have a 2 and a half hour movie that covers half of the first book, why not use that time to really make the audience familiar with that world and the characters?Lord Of The Rings Fellowship Of Ring did that beautifully and you already knew what the plot was, what characters we have and what The One Ring was and did, in like the first 3 minutes. Sometimes exposition of text on the screen at the beginning of your movie is needed and I wouldn't have a single problem if they had a big text at the opening talking about the spice and main houses and things that are not going to be mentioned in the actual film.Other than these two, I don't really have a problem with this movie, it's a well-made, well-acted science fiction epic and it's eye-pleasing to watch and I really hope they fix these issues in the next (hopefully at least 3 hours) movie and wrap up the first movie beautifully.",Dune
205,jere_zabala,"Like a boring episode of a random TV show, Hans Zimmer music was erased by the sand storm.",1,25 October 2021,"Hans Zimmer music was conspicouos by its absense, probably his worst work, very weak soundtrack, it sounded like my compositions, when I was 8 years old... The movie was slow, with nothing new, nothing interesting, excellent performances, cliché moments, very poor explaining and character development, subtext has to be used wisely otherwise all ur movie is gonna be a big flop, and they didn't use it wisely here, I don't know, maybe the books are bad like the movie? I didn't read them, anyway, I was waiting more for the trailer. So much waiting for this, such a waste of my emotions :/ 1 point for the incredible acting, 0 point for the rest, I'm fan of Hans Zimmer since I'm child (not like the possers of these days who love them because he's turned popular), but I have to be objective (unlike all the ""critics"" in this site), and i have to admit the truth, the music for this movie was obsolete, sorry hanzi, love ya pal, but when u just went out of new ideas, I think is time to retire and leave the spot to new composers, 1/10!!!!",Dune
206,arabnikita,Beauty without soul or substance,8,26 September 2021,"Dune (2021)By now, it is undisputable that Denis Villeneuve is a master of creating mesmerizing visuals and Dune is probably his biggest achievement as every single frame looks surreal. Frankly, I expected nothing less but ironically, the gorgeous visuals are also the reason for the film's weaknesses. On one side, they create an immersive experience; on the other, it feels like the director is trying to show off instead of crafting a compelling story for the audience to connect to. Nevertheless, it is a movie and it is bound to deviate from the source material so I will try to judge accordingly.While Villeneuve is an artistic genius, this isn't one of his personal art house projects but an adaptation of the greatest Science Fiction novel, which naturally carries expectations. The world of Dune is as complex as that of Game of Thrones where everything is intricately connected and the multilayered characters are filled with ambition; not to mention the philosophy. Unfortunately, none of this is created here and half of the big name actors are reduced to saying a few lines in favor of showing 15 pointless visions of Zendaya in the desert.By struggling to establish the characters and the narrative, the film ends up lacking a soul and as result, it is impossible to care about anything. Yes, every shot looks phenomenal but it doesn't stir a single emotion and no matter how pivotal the scene is, it just feels hollow. The excessive long takes leave little time for development and hence, key narrative moments end up being rushed. Even some action scenes feel underwhelming as they lack any energy and almost feel forced.Despite the anticlimactic end, I am eagerly waiting for Part 2 which will hopefully explain the world and allow the remaining characters to flesh out. Chalamet did a decent job as Paul but he needs to put on some muscle as he is pitiful to look at during the action sequences. At the end of the day, Dune is one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen with the aesthetics and sound being worthy of IMAX. Sadly, the essence and complexity of Dune itself feels either rushed or lost in between the grains of sand and the panoramic takes.Movies.shmovies in Instagram for movies and tv shows.",Dune
207,WubsTheFadger,I don't usually write reviews,10,24 October 2021,I used to be a big reviewer back in the day but I stopped because movies lost that magic for me. Dune sparked that flame inside of me and I got super excited for an upcoming movie. After a long wait I finally saw it with my family and my uncle who is a huge Dune fan like myself. After it finished I had a feeling inside of me that told me that this movie will hopefully ignite a whole new generation of sci-fi films. Denis Villeneuve should be extremely proud. He has faithfully adapted and extremely hard book. He made the film detailed enough to make avid fans happy and explained things enough to keep the jew comers involved and immersed. Timothée Chalamet played a great Paul and he is a very good actor. The rest of the cast knocked it out of the park as well. The visuals are stunning and the story is next to none. Please go support this film. We need to see part 2.,Dune
208,Come-and-Review,Demystified Dune,9,18 September 2021,"Perhaps the greatest lesson that can be drawn from Denis Villeneuve's Dune is that ultimately an entirely satisfying adaptation of the novel is impossible. Nonetheless, Villeneuve's version is the closest at succeeding so far, and is one of the more enjoyable theatrical experiences of 2021.Villeneuve stays very adherent to the original work, even in the smaller elements. There are a few omissions however, and the first scenes are not present in the novel.His version has however not rendered from the sense of mistery that permeates the beginning of the novel. It immediately submerges its reader in the world of Dune, without any introduction, and the complex situation is slowly unraveled throughout the narrative. Villeneuve's previous films prove that this approach could have been undertaken by him, but the 2021 film chose instead to rely on several expository scenes that explain too much to the audience. Some of the revelations that are hinted at very early were not as clear until the second half of the novel (yet to be adapted). A choice dictated by the destination to a wider target audience, for sure, but that ultimately adds dryness to the film.Another slight disappointment might come from the score by Hans Zimmer. It does render the majestic epic scale of the film, but it perhaps remains overly somber and ambiental in scenes where it could have charged up the depicted tense situation.What works best in Dune is the flawless casting. Whoever has read the novel could hardly imagine different actors to portray the characters. Dune also succeeds in rendering the alien scape of the desertic planet Arrakis, as well as the other planets that are even only hinted in the novel, without reduntantly using the strong saturated colours of Lynch's version. Greig Fraser's cinematography is truly a feast for the eyes, aided by a desaturated yet captivating coloring. Rest assured: the sky is never blue, which is something that the latest promotional poster seemed to suggest. On the other hand, what the film does borrow from the never made Jodorowsky version is some of the production design elements, especially for the Harkonnens.Ultimately, even if Villeneuve did not make the perfect Dune film (and it is fairly possible to say at this point that such a film cannot exist), it is an entertaining film. It is entertaining and
keeps the viewer glued to the screen even despite its slow nature, leaves the viewer wanting for more, and that alone makes up for all the small imperfections it features.(Extracts from my longer review on my blog, comeandreview)",Dune
209,pontram,A Perfect Example of Missed Opportunities,6,28 October 2021,"Disappointing in many respects, also compared to the Lynch version from 1984.First of all the music, aside from all the praise - good mediocrity, one nice theme (Paul says goodbye to his homeworld), otherwise no memorable parts. The soundtrack of 1984 by Toto/Eno is much more powerful and catchy and can also stand for itself. Hans Zimmer has nowadays not much more to offer than routine backpainting on a highly professional level.Then the characters, also good and mediocre, but an amazing number of pale characters. I liked Duke Leto a bit better than Jürgen Prochnow back then (who was nevertheless also very good). Paul is sympathetic and appropriately serious, somewhat less obtrusive than Kyle MacLachlan at the time. He, in turn, had a bit more charisma. Otherwise, only Baron Harkonnen's servant struck me as an interesting character (and that says much, because he has very little screentime). The Baron himself is perhaps closer to the book (which I don't know), but despite overlength he has practically no opportunity to unfold, as it was brilliantly and partly ridiculous, but still eerie and hauntingly solved in the Lynch film. Zendaya, who is announced x times, is actually left to starve between the dunes with a few sentences and meaningful glimpses. Paul's mother is interesting, but almost too young, Rebecca Ferguson is only 12 years older than Timothee Chalamet, and you notice that despite her makeup (alright, Jessca 1984, Francesca Annis, is also only 14 years older than Kyle, we wondered a bit about this even then).In general, the movie lacks the courage to take risks here (except for the narrative pacing), and a vision, and I don't mean the visual one. There are wonderful breathtaking visuals, the likes of which were not or could not be achieved in 1984, there's no question about that, but that's all about it. I missed very much the glamour or grandeur, decadence and political mysticism of an 11th millennium, which were omnipresent in the Lynch version and came alive with a few brushstrokes. Just think of the Navigator's appearance to the Emperor or the Emperors' scheming, almost sliminess. But maybe that will come in the second part. But it would have been better for the viewer's understanding if it had been placed in the first half of the film. World-building is what it is called today, what was simply well elaborated storytelling back then.The possible monstrous technology of that time might have come across a bit better in the 2021 version, but still remains a farce. Also, with such overlength, wouldn't an insight into travel technology with Spice be interesting ? Only the screeching bombs had some innovation value for me, the sound is probably from the shadow-ships from Babylon 5. Yes, and the thin-beam-cutter, which would be a veritable weapon, but is apparently only used to open doors.Finally, I found the duel scene at the end too archaic and also not very necessary. If there is to be any development of the Fremen (but also Paul), it would have to happen at this point. A fight to the death - unequal from the beginning due to the superior training of an opponent - is downright medieval and unworthy of an upcoming civilization. This also occurred in the 1984 film at the end between Feyd-Rautha (Sting, not yet introduced in 2021) and Paul, but was unavoidable in context.Overall, from my point of view, despite all the pomp and epic breadth and huge budget, as well as artistic freedom, this is a rather feeble, less intelligent, almost superficial (but perhaps more mainstream compatible) 'reboot'.Think of Battlestar Galactica, which admittedly hadn't a legendary book to follow, but reinterpreted the whole scenario and characters of its predecessor in a new and sometimes groundbreaking way.",Dune

211,daniellawson-14-787057,Beautiful. Epic. Unfocused?,7,19 October 2021,"POSITIVES:1) The film is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. There are countless shots that I wish I could frame and put up on my wall. Absolutely flawless cinematography
2) Everything about the film is epic. It cost so much to make and you feel like they spent every penny. The cinematography and the score in particular were both larger than life presences in the film
3) The performances are all great, as you would expect from an all star cast like this. Jason Mamoa in particular stood out, I hadn't been impressed with him in his previous films but here I really felt like he stole the show
4) There are some really great concepts and lore here, which is mainly credit to the novel rather than the film, but still a positive. The concept of the competing Houses is definitely something we've seen in other films and TV shows but still works really well here
5) Because the film is so loud and the score is so constant throughout, there is a really effective fight scene towards the end because the score goes away completely and it makes it much more impactful when Paul kills someone for the first timeNEGATIVES:1) I really felt the length of the film. There are lots of slow motion shots or montages of landscapes that really dragged out the runtime for me. For context, the last film I saw before this one was No Time To Die, which is actually longer than Dune but feels so much shorter because it manages its time so much better
2) It definitely feels like to truly get the experience of the film you need to have read the book first. The film does spend a lot of time with some rather clunky exposition scenes to try and explain all the complexities of the world, but I still didn't feel like it fully managed to explain everything properly. The people I went to see the film with were all confused about multiple points

213,repojack,Epic. Chef d'oeuvre. Magnum opus. Masterpiece.,10,22 October 2021,"Dune is an absolute feast for the eyes and ears-- stunning cinematography all accompanied by an immersive soundtrack that fits every scene like a glove.For those that have been lucky enough to have read the novel, you will be rewarded. I've been waiting for more than 35 years for what I consider the best science fiction story of all time. Tomorrow when I watch this with my sons, I'll get a sense of how this plays with those that don't know the story as deeply as those that have read it.Each ship, device, costume and technology is fantastically realized. While special effects technology has advanced so this can be made possible, Denis Villeneuve and his team deserve kudos for the creative vision in the adaption from book to screen. For example, I could never visualize the ""ornithopters"" -- the smaller flying ships on the planet Arrakis. Here they're represented as dragonfly-like X-wings that are mesmerizing. And then there's the stillsuits, the hunter-seeker, theEvery actor brings their A-game, but Rebecca Fergusson as Jessica and Timothée Chalamet as Paul are just fabulous. There's an iconic scene from the book where Paul is subjected to the Gom Jabbar, a life-or-death test. The scene requires both Jessica and Timothée to express themselves only with their facial expressions and body movements and they are fantastic.Stellan Skarsgard is more menacing than Michael Meyers in Halloween Kills as Baron Harkonnen -- in fact his whole entourage are like human Cenobites.While this should be seen in a theater, I watched it on streaming, and to be honest, I'm glad I did. I could rewind scenes I wanted to see again and put subtitles on as needed (there is a lot of whispering and ""Dune"" language that is hard to discern).I felt like I waited 10,191 years for this to be finally released, and it was worth the wait.

214,diggnuts,Does not add anything of value for me.,5,18 October 2021,"I like the book and I like the 1984 movie and I guess this adaptation is fine, but I do not get the added value.Sure, the visuals are modern, grand and detailed, but so is every science fiction game these days. It does nothing interesting with the medium like the 1984 version does. It feels generic and artificial.Then there is the story and personally I do not really care about the minute details from the book being accurately represented. Different media, different interpretation. If you are a stickler for these types of details, the mini series are far more accurate. This just feels like a less stylish remake of 1984 Dune.I also don't get the fawning over the actor playing Paul. I do not think he's that great and most of the movie he looks completely baked.I have re-watched the 1984 version many times but I don't think I'll re-watch this again. Perhaps I'll watch the second installment, perhaps not. It just does not add anything for me at all.",Dune

Yes it is well written and entertaining, but still it's your usual artificial product and a cash grab. So happens it just hit ""boomer generation"" at right age and this is why they are so nostalgic and exited about it. On other fronts also not much to write about. Everything is average: camera, dialog, fights, Fx. And its kind of half of the movie. BTW with how much theaters struggle to make profit, its not a fact that there will be a second one. Even the world building was, perhaps, stronger in older movie. 5/10 is exactly fair.",Dune
217,howboutthisone_huh,bit disappointing,7,24 October 2021,"Beautiful, visually and auditorially, this is an impressive movie but given what hollywood can produce if you throw enough money at it, you wouldn't expect anything differently, right, even these days. And, the story line is not the olympic trials given how much detail is in the book and past media productions, especially the '84 version, so it shouldn't have been a difficult movie to produce. The greatest fault of this movie is the casting and the stale character development and lack of up close story telling. Sure, it's true to the book and entertaining to watch, though who knows if this was herbert's vision, but it's not a movie that will stick to the wall long, no matter how popular it is at the box office. The main reasons for deep memories of the '84 version was the casting and story, particularly sting as Feyd Rautha and kenneth mcmillan as the baron, but it didn't have the technology behind it to satisfactorily represent the imagination of the book. Maybe some day they'll do this again and cgi the '80s cast and really do the book well. But, unfortunately hollywood will probably milk this to death and a remake will never happen again in my lifetime, so that's a thumbs down for me. And no, I'm not prejudiced by nostalgia because I haven't watched the '84 Dune for at least 20 years. If you could merge the two productions somehow, that would be something.For the record too, this version is not true to the book. Herbert would probably be as impressed as anyone else with the special effects, designs and so on, who knows, but he definitely wouldn't be happy with the interpretation and presentation of the story on many, many levels. The 84 version was much more inline with the book. This version is like taking a helicopter over the grand canyon while the 84 version, the helicopter lands at the bottom of the canyon and everybody has to walk their way out.",Dune
218,gcsman,"If you were waiting for a definitive version of Dune on screen, I think this is it.",10,23 October 2021,"For director Denis Villeneuve, it turns out tha his big films Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and Arrival ( 2016) have just been warmup efforts for this epic version of Dune. I can't resist giving this 10/10, mostly because I can't think of much of anything that could have been done better or closer to the look-and-feel of Frank Herbert's classic sf novel. Probably the thing I most appreciate is the director's willingness to let the storyline play out in a full, unhurried pace that does justice to the very long and complex source material. It's all there, with little change. This is REAL science fiction, on screen.And epic it is. Huge spaces, huge settings -- the landscapes are vast and beautiful, the spaceships even bigger than they may have needed to be (doubly so for the orbiting 'stargates'), and the many long-distance shots of tiny humans placed within and outside huge buildings and landscapes don't fail to impress. The giant sandworms of Arrakis? They look just like the cover illustration of the book copy I read back in the 70's. All of this is underscored by the Hans Zimmer score that consistently goes for the monumental and foreboding. The production pays meticulous attention not just to the Dune source material, but also to scene placement, camera angles, and timing. If Villeneuve wasn't already a top-rank directorial presence, he certainly is now.The most memorable thing about Dune (the book) is, for sure, Arrakis itself -- the giant desert planet with its people, the Fremen, and their life in this harsh and striking environment. And Dune (the movie) does a terrific job of putting us there and giving us a sense of place. There is no 'conquering' of this planet, or its people. You either adapt, or die.All of this could fail if the script or acting were weak. But the dialog is as good as it needs to be (I recognized a lot of text lifted directly from the book), and the cast is uniformly excellent. Timothee Chalamet in the lead role of Paul Atreides has been handed a very big job here for a young actor to take on -- a whole lot depends on him alone -- and by and large he pulls it off. I've got some quibbles (below) but they don't take away from what is really a big achievement. If this film doesn't pull in some Oscars there is something really wrong with the Academy. So:Zimmer's music, impressive though it is, seems to have evolved to the point where there are no recognizable themes or melodies. It's simply mood-setting, and the use of heavy bass is maybe a bit too insistent.Frank Herbert struck gold with 'Dune' but he never wrote anything better even though he produced several sequels. But one of the features of his writing -- which got steadily worse in the later books -- is that it often feels elliptical or vague without ever going full-on mystical. The movie also captures this feeling, and I'm not sure whether that's good or bad. Sometimes it's just not entirely clear what happened or who did what. Unfortunately, as the book series went on Herbert started thinking he was a deep philosopher rather than an sf storyteller. He wasn't. Vagueness is just vague.For the non-desert locations the architectural style on display could be described as Monumentalist Brutal. None of the living spaces on display actually look terribly comfortable. Maybe a contrast is being set up for the next film where we'll see the the more personal, close-to-the-land living style of the Fremen.But in the end, it's hard to imagine Dune being done any better. I guess it will be a while till we get Dune Part II but I'm already really looking forward to it. Having got past all the setup stuff that Part I had to get through, we'll finally get Arrakis in all its glory.",Dune
219,PotassiumMan,"It won't be the fastest 155 minutes of your life, but still stunning",7,1 November 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the famous science fiction novel is a visual mosaic and a master class in cinematography. Performances are exceptional throughout. Timothee Chalamet is Paul Atreides, the son of the Duke of House Atreides (Oscar Isaac in commanding form). House Atreides and House Harkonnen are in an ongoing conflict on the planet of Arrakis, for control over a resource called ""the spice"", which is the planet's most vital resource. Chalamet gives a committed performance as the youthful heir apparent leader in this global conflict and one whose special abilities give him a surprising advantage over his elders and his rivals in asserting that authority. Rebecca Ferguson is solid as Paul's mother and part of the nobility. Javier Bardem is menacing as the leader of a Fremen tribe, a species who live and breathe the desert.Visually arresting and with a haunting soundtrack, it's hard to conceive of any film more atmospheric and rooted in sense experience than this one. Hans Zimmer's powerful music adds to a feeling of grand and terrifying wonder throughout. Villeneuve often keeps us in suspense with the total absence of background music as well. But the film is not without its flaws. In some of the battle scenes due to the very similar design of the battle armor it is very hard to distinguish who is who and on which army is which. Similar issues arise in parts of the dialogue where due to volume and mumbling, the dialogue is hard to understand and separate from other subtitled foreign languages spoken. The final criticism of this film is that it simply could have used more editing. Once you get past the stunning cinematography and potent visuals, you might discover how much of a slog it is. You will feel the running time at some point. But if you're a viewer who enjoys ambitious and methodical filmmaking, it will be worthwhile. Recommended to patient and open-minded viewers.",Dune

Jihads, messiahs, prophecies are at best passé, unimaginative concepts.The 1980's film was horrid, a convoluted mess where the main character, Paul, never aged. Very weird.Not content on allowing Dune to be absorbed by the sands of time, producers decide to give it another shot and and we have yet another botched remake.The story continues as uninteresting and dull and bloated and toothless as before, and this new movie version does nothing to make it a little more interesting.At almost 2 and half hours, the movie does make us suffer as if we were in the middle of hot, dry desert, such as we have in Arrakis. At least the writers and directors got this part right. The whole film is laden, humorless, dry, spiritless.

He is one of the few directors working in mainstream cinema that understands the medium and the 'show don't tell' style, although some that are used to Marvel based comic book sci-fi will find this a very slow and boring affair when comparing it.If I have one complaint it's that people who are not fully conversant with the source material may struggle at the start.

225,bastille-852-731547,Stunningly ambitious; multi-dimensional yet powerful,10,25 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's passion project has apparently always been to direct a film adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel ""Dune."" Coming off the acclaimed ""Blade Runner 2049,"" he has brought his unique skills to the directing table as a master of highbrow science fiction. The book of ""Dune"" is extremely challenging to adapt on film due to its complex, sophisticated plot and long length-but not only does Villeneuve successfully adapt the first half of the book in this film, he does so with flying colors. Even as someone who loves both the book and Villeneuve as a director, I was truly blown away by this adaptation. It manages to excel at providing both style and substance, simultaneously mixing all of Villeneuve's strengths as a director and wrapping them up into a superbly crafted package that you'll remember long after the credits start rolling.Because so many people have read the book, I won't say much about the plot. However, for those unaware, ""Dune"" is a chronicle of the bitter feud between House Atreides and the villainous House Harkonnen, who exploited and controlled production of a fictional substance called ""the spice"" on the desert planet of Arrakis. The top brass of House Atreides intends to assert sovereignty over Arrakis, and the story primarily centers around the young Paul Atreides (son of Duke Leto Atreides.) As you would expect from a film like this, the visuals are absolutely astonishing. From the oceanic landscapes of Caladan (the Atreides' home planet) to wide shots of the galaxy to flight scenes over Arrakis, the film is an extraordinary treat to look at. Villeneuve's shots often combine both real imagery (much of the film was shot in deserts in Jordan) and CGI, establishing a commanding sense of grandeur and ambition so unique they truly feel like they come directly from his vivid imagination while reading the novel. Hans Zimmer's score works wonders at establishing both a monumental sense of grandness while simultaneously intensifying clear emotional stakes and foreshadowing important scenes. The sound design is superb as well, often mixing a variety of unique sounds in one scene to establish a unique level of depth and detail to complement Villeneuve's ambitious direction. That direction is outstanding too on a variety of levels, but particularly through the film's pacing and tone. ""Dune"" runs for 155 minutes, but there's not a single scene I would have cut out, and the film is never even slightly boring at all. It's also particularly impressive how Villeneuve does not abide by the three-act structure of most modern blockbusters, which ends up making the film an even more effective viewing experience. The film's tone is strikingly effective on both a macro (a sense of epic urgency) and micro (imminent danger and the clear, personal harshness of the realities of being on Arrakis) level-often both at once.The screenplay is able to genuinely do justice to Herbert's writing, managing to be both taut yet tight and cohesive. One of the most impressive parts of the writing here is how many of the key scenes with both Paul and Lady Jessica are able to further both of their character arcs simultaneously, which ends up complementing both characters' development in the writing. Yet this impressive screenwriting hat trick is far from the most impressive way that ""Dune"" depicts its characters, which ends up being through the outstanding performances in its ensemble. I'm not a huge Timothée Chalamet fan (although he has been very good in some films,) but he is perfectly cast here. Other standouts in the cast include Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin. There's not a single weak link in the ensemble here, which is remarkably impressive for a film with such a large cast, and each major cast member effectively portrays a clear personal and emotional range in their roles.I go into such detail because ""Dune"" is an extraordinary work. It's a film that so truly perfect on every level in spite of its remarkable level of ambition, that it will truly remind viewers of why they love and appreciate great cinema. When the film ends, viewers manage to feel both a profound sense of satisfaction about the development of Paul's character arc yet also wanting to see more and remaining invested in the narrative. If that's not a massive complement to give a film, I don't know what is, and to say I'm excited for ""Dune Part 2"" is an understatement. Highly recommended. 10/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. Both the picture and sound quality were outstanding in this format. For example, during the ornithopter flight scene over Arrakis, one can hear the chopper noises around you while the bass begins to tremble at a gradual and steady pace. The Dolby Vision picture quality also manages to impressively enhance the film's lighting both in daylight and nighttime scenes.",Dune

What does not work for me is that it ends up being slow because of the way it tells the story and it does not feel so exciting but I think it is because I saw the adaptation made in 1984 and I feel that it affects the perception of the current one because I already know the story.The director does not disappoint with his work, he makes this film a visual spectacle that must be seen on the big screen, but due to the complexity of the story, the film is slow, I look forward to part two.",Dune

Yes, Dune 2021 has powerfully loud music and sound effects, gtand scale cinematography, panoramic battle scenes with sheer multitudes, futuristic machinery, and of course the spice-blue eyes; but the long, drawn out film seems presented just for sake of being epic. I guess you had to have read the book to be engaged emotionally with the characters. It is certainly a well done remake, but even less of a plot arc than the original. The power voice effect was underused, and the character playing ""the one"" was just a skinny kid having dreams who they featured as a weak pretty boy with some kind of promise that never pans out to any appreciable effect. The long takes of his mother's anguish and his blank contemplative stares were annoyingly boring. Oscar Isaac is perhaps the most overused actor besides Samuel L. Jackson, but Jackson at least is always compelling. Isaac leaves much to be desired as far as bringing gravitas and virtue to the house of Atreides. This movie could serve well as a prequel or pilot, but as a stand-alone not so much. Let's hope for a coming sequel where Paul Atreides grows up to visibly be ""the one"" who kicks butt and breaks rocks with his voice (get Keanu Reeves? ;-).",Dune

However, I have seen Denis Villeneuve's films, and have become increasingly amazed by vision as a film maker.I saw ""Dune"" (2021) on a pre-release screening in Denmark, and oh, is this made for the big screen. Once again, Villeneuve solidifies his masterful skills as a director. More so than ever in my opinion, including ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), Villeneuve builds on an increasingly sophisticated form of film-making. For film-buffs, who have seen these film mentions, this is quite a statement on its own.Story-wise, this clearly seems like a prologue: Villeneuve is taking his time on character development and world building, immersing the viewer with technical perfection, be it related to casting and acting (excellent performances by the entire cast, particularly by Chalamet and Ferguson), pacing, editing, and oh my, cinematography. It is simply an awe-inspiring film to experience. Furthermore, the score is nothing short of phenomenal in supporting the cinematography, and in my book on par with rare examples of perfect cinematography-score collaborations such as ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007, score: Johnny Greenwood) and ""American Beauty"" (1999, score: Thomas Newman).Obviously for fans, but I also recommend admirers of technical aspects of film making and film buffs to experience ""Dune"" on the big screen.",Dune

It also has the craziness that Dune requires.Gone is the colour and excitement of the 1984 original and we have a sci fi movie which is the equivalent of an iPad. Sleek, sterile and boring. But of course with an HD display.Give me grainy saturated and analogue 80's VHS any day over this. Simply because it's a more emotionally pleasing experience.Many of the reviews say it all, for those who saw the original, this doesn't match up.

I am seeing battles going on and I have no idea who is who. Loads of different parties just sort of thrown together and fight with knives for some bizarre reason, who are mostly in suits and look like each other. What exactly is the point of the buzzy thing they turn on; it doesn't seem to actually do anything.Did I mention a space faring set of nations, use knives and hand to hand combat? I will again.The reason historically soldiers wore different colours was to avoid friendly fire. It would have been nice to know which side was which.So, you little bomb that can destroy buildings and ships, you have a portable laser that can cut through anything. Why didn't you just use those in combat to wipe people out, no, much safer to fight hand to hand with knives (got it in a 3rd time).Beautiful and technically well-made film, just like Blade Runner 2, but empty, boring, silly, and dull.

I actually chose not to read the book beforehand because I wanted to be surprised and invested in the narrative and I felt that going in blind was the best way to do that. The reason I was so excited for this movie was mainly one thing: Denis Villeneuve. He has emerged as one of the greatest directors working today and I think he does his best work in a Sci-Fi setting with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 being among my favourite movies of all time and I can safely say that Dune lived up to all my expectations.Villeneuve absolutely nailed the direction of this film, more that any of his other work scale and size is so important and he continually amazed me with the enormity of what I was seeing on screen. He nailed all the action sequences and character moments while keeping that slower and methodical pace he's become known for. I could not have imagined a better choice to direct a film of this type. The script I also thought was very solid with it achieving everything it set out to do with an ultimately very simple story but a complex world to establish. I've seen a lot of people complain that the ending was too abrupt for them but I honestly found it to be executed very well. It cut off just as the main arc of the 3rd act was complete and left my heart racing, I'm writing this review after Part Two has been confirmed and I couldn't be more excited to see what happens in this world next.Beyond Villeneuve I thought this film succeeded on all other filmmaking fronts. I was so excited to see what Hans Zimmer would do with this film knowing his passion for the source material and I think it is some of his best work. It works in tandem with the incredible visuals so successfully and gave me chills at more than one point. I'll put money on him winning his second Oscar for this movie. The editing also really impressed me with managing to keep the film at a great and consistent pace, I never found it to be too quickly cut during action scenes and it managed to convey so many of the more intimate scenes amazingly well. This is also one of the best sounding movie I've ever heard in a theatre with it again selling the enormity of what was happening on screen and I also loved how sound was used in the voice scenes with it allowing me to better understand the emotions of the characters during those moments. The cinematography was for the most part great, as with all Villeneuve films, with my only minor compliant being that I just felt it could have been a bit more colourful in certain moments as opposed to keeping a more gritty texture. But even having said that I still see what Villeneuve and Frasier were going for. The performances I also found to be great without a weak link in the cast. I loved seeing all these characters on screen together with the chemistry between the cast really bringing it together. The stands outs for me would probably have to be Chalamet, Momoa and Ferguson.I thought this film showcased the planet of Arrakis and the whole universe of Dune extremely well and I was able to understand the world that was being set up as well as the dynamic and conflict between characters. As I said this was my first introduction to this universe so it was a concern of mine that it was going to be too much to take in on a first viewing but I rarely found myself confused while watching. I did start to worry during the 1st act that the film was spending too much time on exposition but by the end of the film I was ultimately glad they did as I may not have been able to follow things as well as I did had they not spend all that time setting things up.Dune was genuinely everything I hoped it would be. I can't remember the last time a film I was this excited to for met all my expectations. It is technically outstanding with a phenomenal cast and interesting characters to match. I think this film functions well as an introduction to this world and from what I've heard from my friends who've read the book they seem to have loved it just as much as I did. I really hope more people continue to see this film because I think it deserves all the success it can get and become the next great Hollywood franchise. I know exactly where I'll be on October 20th 2023.10/10 - A+ (Incredible)",Dune

Even scared me. The image stayed with me.Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a triumph. Everyone that has read Frank Herbert's Dune will have their own vision of it. That's the magic of the written word. And if Frank Herbert taught us anything, it was to have an open mind.Villeneuve has shown us, with Dune, that dreams can be given justice, if the heart is in the right place.A stunning achievement of cinema and of science fiction. Many will wish that Herbert was still around to have seen this. But of course he already has.Salut.",Dune
239,dopefishie,"it's a slog, but def better than Dune (1984)",6,4 November 2021,"It's a slog, but def better than Dune (1984).First, they missed a perfectly good opportunity for Sean Bean to play Duke Leto Atreides but, alas, it wasn't meant to be. (Oscar Isaac does a great job).I wanted to like this. It has a lot of things going for it. The cinematography is beautiful. The sound design was good (but could have been better). The protagonists are likeable. This is a major improvement. Chalamet has a better written and better performed Paul than MacLachlan had in Dune (1984). In fact, everyone from Atreides comes across better in this version with the exception of Lady Jessica who is uncharacteristically frightened for nearly the entire movie. Jason Momoa stole the show as Duncan. He was great!Now, for the bad guys: Much Worse this time around. I was very disappointed here. Where the villains in Dune (1984) are larger than life and boisterous and colorful, the villains here comparatively boring - very one-dimensional. This film overall has a more somber and plodding tone while Dune (1984) managed to capture a manic kind of energy that's sorely missing here.Thankfully, there is much less exposition here for which I am grateful. However, it's been replaced by a dozen dream sequences for which I am annoyed. 90% of Zendaya's appearance is in the form of dreams. It drags. It drags to the point that I was looking at my watch and wishing it would end. That's never a good feeling. Hopefully, part 2 can fix some of these issues.",Dune

242,dcobbimdb,Wow! Does not disappoint,9,25 October 2021,"All together great movie! I think the thing I loved the most was the uniquely gothic, noir look & feel. Similar to the Matrix or Jurassic Park, the cinematography and sets of this movie just seemed different and unique and really played into that off world vibe in a very real and visceral way to me vs. So many other Sci-Fi's movies including the Star Wars franchise which just remind you you're watching a Sci-Fi movie with good special effects. The other thing I liked a lot was the actor who played Paul. Sure there are some big name stars in this movie, but it's always nice to see a fresh face who does a great job. Although he was 25ish while filming this, he appeared much younger and innocent which I liked a lot as well and gives him room to growI went into this knowing very little, and I'm glad I did. I was intrigued to see it and watched it in a Dolby cinema which I highly recommend as you just get that more immersive feel to it. I've never read the books, but story wise it's similar in many ways to the original Lynch Dune movie. So if you've seen the original or the 2000 mini series (which I have not) then you won't be surprised by the story & plot, aside from some creative liberty differences. However if you have not seen any of the previous Dune movies or series, don't and just see this first. Granted if you're reading this review, chances of that are pretty slim.Admittedly I didn't know going into this that it was only the first half, but I wasn't totally surprised either. I knew the movie was 2.5 hours long, and it got near the 2 hour mark I realize they wouldn't be able to wrap up the story in 30 more minutes. As I understand it part 2 wasn't even green lit prior to this coming out, but I sure hope they follow through with it as I really like this directors vision and found myself immersed, entertained and intrigued the entire way through.So why only a 9 out of 10? Well for me I think I've given one or two 10's in my entire life. So while I thought this movie was awesome, very memorable, and am going to see it again in the theater (this time with my daughter instead of my friend), I felt the ending could have had a little more punch to it, and I do feel there were certain aspects that could be confusing if one isn't familiar with the story, but then some times a little mystery makes for a better movie rather than spoon feeding the audience everythingI'll be curious what my daughter thinks about it when we go to see it. I've told her not to view any spoilers and by all means DO NOT see the original or it will take any suspense away. Overall I highly recommend.",Dune
243,Sankari_Suomi,Wasted opportunities,8,5 November 2021,"With a brisk runtime of just 2.5 hours, Villeneuve's 2021 remake of David Lynch's critically acclaimed 1984 blockbuster classic is clearly intended as a starter rather than a main course.Its plot covers the first three chapters of the first book of the 28 canonical volumes of Francis H. Herbert's controversial Galactic Drug Trade saga. A sequel (currently planned for release in October 2023) will summarise the rest of the books.If I could summarise this movie in just two word, they would be 'wasted opportunities.' There is so much good about it, yet Villeneuve inexplicably omits several elements I had eagerly anticipated.What I liked... Villeneuve's vision of Lynch's interpretation of Herbert's work unfolds in a far distant where Western and Eastern cultures have coalesced and humanity now exists as a single race of interstellar Space Arabs.The ceaseless battle for resources and territory is dominated by countless aristocratic families and war clans. Of these, we meet just a few.House Corrino: Mongolian Space Arabs. House Harkonnen: Nazi Space Arabs. House Artreides: Scottish Space Arabs. Bene Gesserit: Muslim Space Arabs. Fremen: xenophobic libertarian Space Arabs.This was all very cool and imaginative. I loved the sound of the Sardaukar language, especially the throat singing.Villeneuve's visuals are flawless. There is a palpable sense of epic scale in his vast sets, titanic space ships, and massive battle formations. This imposing 'visual mass' (as Høenig calls it) combines with the sparse colour pallet to produce a masterclass in fictional worldbuilding. Everything on the screen feels heavy, solid, and real.The Bene Gesserit 'Voice' technique is depicted very differently to the book, but I liked how they did this.The music is exceptionally good, with a strong Hans Zimmer vibe that falls somewhere between Blue Planet II and Blade Runner 2049.What I didn't like... The anaemic 12A rating takes a heavy toll, particularly in the combat scenes. Fights are bloodless, poorly choregraphed playground scuffles without a hint of suspense or genuine threat. Boo!The Harkonnen are ludicrously sanitised. They look good, yet I just can't take them seriously. Boo!Baron Wladimir is still an imposing figure, but without the bestial menace and sexual depravity that was so well showcased by Lynch. In Villeneuve's depiction he comes across as a mildly aggressive uncle with gastric problems. He doesn't project any sense of evil or violence. Boo!Glossu Rabban (played by the goofy alien guy from Guardians of the Galaxy) has the personality of cardboard and all the thrilling masculine energy of a plastic spork. Very poor casting here. I have no idea what they were thinking. Boo!The Mentats' role is never explained, and they lack the defining characteristic of Sapho-stained lips. Boo!We are told that Melange is used by the Navigators for interstellar travel, but not how or why. We never see a Navigator in action, and we are robbed of the majestic Third Stage Navigator entrance scene for which Lynch's film has become famous. Boo!There's probably more, but that's all I can think of right now.I rate Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2021: Part 1 at 24.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as 7.5 Space Arabs out of 10 on IMDB.",Dune
244,marc5477,I really tried... twice....,4,2 November 2021,"I tried to watch it, not once, but twice, and I just cant get through it. Its just so boring. Mind you I love sci-fi and I enjoy a little bit of action and certainly this movie looks great. The acting is ok. Sound and music seem ok. But I just cant seem to get any enjoyment from it.I think what it boils down to is the lack of plot development. The movie really goes no where in the 1st hour or so and the pacing is just ridiculously slow. I kept getting frustrated with scenes hoping they would just move it along because they werent interesting. Further I really cant seem to feel anything for the characters despite all the attempt to develop some of them. I literally have no opinion on them which is not good. I sort of had a similar thing happen to me at an Iron Man movie a few years ago. Its seemed like an ok movie but for the life of me I just couldnt get into it and as soon as I walked out I couldnt remember what it was about. It was like elevator music. Its fine in the background but not memorable. Thats how I feel about Dune. I watched up to an hour, then walk out (twice), and I cant for the life me remember the name of any characters and as stated above, no plot really developed and from what I am reading on here it seems there is really no plot at all until the next film... /shrugBut like I said above it does look and sound good. The acting wasnt terrible. So im sure it will appeal to some folks but just not my cup of tea. I might try again when it goes to streaming.",Dune

As one travels across the desert night to the arrhythmic, plodding, and plump steps of a beanpole Chalamet and his ornithopter-mommy (Jessica the Hat), a Stilgar Chigurh might try to grab your crysknife or ride a sandworm thither, hither, and yawn, all in the epic effort to spice things up.Denis Villeneuve sure knows how to make the pretty. Moving pictures, and that's not just referring to Zendaya and Timothée, for even the sandworms draw up dusty appeal, inviting you into their gaping, undulating (not ululating) maws, making one wonder: what's it feel like to roll around in there? Are we universe-building? Was Adam Driver busy, or was Oscar Isaac simply given first Muad'dibs?As with Mad Max: Fury Road, we absorb roughly half of a sandy movie, leaving us stultified and wanton, searching our pockets for a decent toothpick (or two) to flick out the gritty remnants of 155 minutes of zoom-zoom-zoomaloo, boom-boom, wham-bam, did-they-greenlight-part-two-yet-or-not action.

249,Oktay_Tuna,Hard to Review Without Seeing The Rest,8,22 October 2021,"If I were to ask you to review or even rate the first 40 minutes of for example The Godfather then you would call me an idiot. Yes, the first 40 minutes of The Godfather(or insert your favorite film) is iconic but what makes it the scene it is, is what follows it behind. I can't review this film in terms of character development or on how it concludes. I can't even talk about the plot structure because without seeing the whole thing I can't say there is a complete structure. I haven't read the book and I don't think you have to, to enjoy or love this film because I did love this film. The characters were interesting and the direction the movie was headed was always unclear which I liked because in recent years the movies had become more predictable(or is it because I had seen more of them, no idea). I mean how can you guess the exposition and the rising action, those aren't supposed be guessed. This is like reviewing the first LOTR without seeing the other 2. It has great world-building, great acting, exceptional sound and visual design, exactly what I would say for first LOTR but what makes the Fellowship different is that it adds a lot to the other films of the trilogy. Villeneuve, as always, directed this film exceptionally. Some scenes were a bit long, some if not most characters feel soulless like they are machines and that's because their stories haven't reached their end yet and maybe the overlong scenes will feel right with the continuation films but as of today we don't even know if a second part is coming. So as of right now my thoughts on the movie are that visually and sound-wise this film is exceptional but story-wise it wasn't unforgettable or anything like that. I would love to see the rest of the story but I won't think about this film tomorrow, it won't get stuck in my mind. It has rewatchability especially in Imax and is definitely a great cinema experience but then again it isn't something you will discuss a lot with your family/friends after the film is over. I mean it is like stopping at the 100th page of a book to discuss what you think of the plot and the character arc. You can probably talk about it and make some fan theories but then again someone will spoil the end of the book. Maybe we are witnessing an amazing trilogy being developed, I hope we are. I think you should go see this film, Imax if possible and hopefully Denis Villeneuve will decide to continue with this story(I wouldn't want anyone else to direct the 2nd part).",Dune
250,theredsky,Dune Review,9,1 November 2021,"Denis Villeneuve creates another banger. This isn't my favorite of his films but it's still fantastic. My main issue with it though is that it is on the slower side and there is an emphasis on set up here but with the knowledge that it's set up similarly to the Lord of the Rings films then it wasn't something I took a major issue with. Even if it's a lot of set up, it's an engaging and investing set up. Besides a couple of scenes, I was fully engaged with the story and characters throughout. On a pure technical level, this film is masterful. The visual effects are off the charts. All of the ships, locations, and animals feel incredibly realistic and whimsical. The cinematography is fantastic. I prefer the cinematography in Blade Runner 2049 but it was still amazing here. Every shot looks incredible with how it's lit or the framing. The performances were pretty great. I wouldn't say this is the best performance from these actors with the exception of Jason Mamoa and Rebecca Ferguson. Both of them do a great job and I'm excited to see what else they can do. Hans Zimmer once again puts out another banger score. This is easily the better between this and No Time To Die but both are still great. The character work definitely helps the set up feel engaging. We don't get a lot of exposition dumps about our characters but we are shown how they act and it's great. I wouldn't put this at the top of a Villeneuve ranking but it's up there and I can't wait for the sequel. Definitely check this film out when you can. It's worth the price of admission.",Dune
251,samyoung-82648,Solid Film,8,22 October 2021,"IMDB don't like any review that challenges their identity politics. It's about time they grew up and stopped censoring people they disagree with.Dune is a gorgeous film and in many ways, the story remains true to the books. Having said that, Hollywood has add their woke filter to the film. This is disappointing.Interestingly, the original story had cultural parallels that made sense (ie. It wasn't box ticking). Most of that has been retained in the film. In a way, Dune is a diversity of cultures and ideas. This is the opposite of today where diversity of ideas and cultures is shunned.Positives. The film has mostly great acting. Even Rebecca Ferguson was mostly decent. Sharon-Duncan Brewster was a gender and race swap, however, she played the role surprisingly well (which is rare when the decision is political rather than talent based). Timothee Chalamet was solid in the lead role, as was Josh Brolin. Visual effects were superb, locations amazing, audio was outstanding.Negatives. You really need to know the material to fully appreciate the story. It's a fine line between spoon feeding the audience and confusing the audience. Also, I found the performance of Zendaya as underwhelming.I would be happy to let my teenage children watch this film. There is some violence and some depiction of pain. However, the most difficult aspect to appreciate involves the layers of story that can be difficult to follow and/or understand for younger viewers.I would definitely recommend audiences watch this film. It plays down the sci-fi and focuses more on human nature (relationships and politics). I don't think any director could have done much better.And IMDB, stop deleting my reviews just because you disagree with me.",Dune
252,ben-mckimm,More please...,8,23 October 2021,"This is Dune done right. It does away with the constant, overly long exposition dumps and frustratingly cringy internal monalogues and replaces them with well placed story telling and set pieces that dont treat you like a moron, just because you might not have read the books. It explains enough through dialogue and character progression that no one is left in the dark and is never overshadowed by the absolutely stunning visuals and incredible score. This is one of the most balanced adaptations of a novel I have ever seen and possibly one of the least pretentious, high quality science fiction films I've ever seen (which is baffling as Dune is extremely pretentious, even if not intentionally or to its detrement). How they achieved this is beyond me and if the second part follows suit, I will be very happy.",Dune

With both allegorical and tangible meanings; Dune is nothing more than the umpteenth masterpiece of the now master Denis Villeneuve. Masterful film, which gallops to the end without ever losing tension or rhythm, with an excellent choral cast, where everyone stands out, from the talented Timothée Chalamet to the more than mature Oscar Isaac, from the incredible Roberta Ferguson to the cryptic Dave Bautista; cast that takes seriously the reviving of the old futuristic tale of Dune. Masterful direction by Villeneuve, which captures the essence of faces, landscapes and history itself, thus managing to compile a single frame of pure emotions and pure concentration. Note of honor goes to the incredible compositions of Zimmer, the sound sector which is practically impeccable and the cinematography of Greig Fraiser. Villeneuve's Dune is the beginning of a great and very long story, potentially infinite and full of surprises, thus making this first act the beginning of a glorious and demanding journey. Dune is nothing more than another masterpiece of the master.",Dune
254,g-89622,The beginning of a science fiction epic,8,6 November 2021,"Villeneuve opened the most shocking science fiction series of the third decade of this century. On the basis of combining various creativity and visual wonders, the superb editing and music design give the work a terrible ""synaesthesia"" and weave a world of immersive epics. There are many problems with being a stand alone film, but as a prelude to a magnificent series, it is enough to look forward to. In this Part 1, Villenueva has done all the preparatory work for the follow-up: world view construction, character relationship laying, background and previous narrative, and most importantly, the atmosphere of the Dune world alone. Kudos to a very high level of artistic style and photographic editing. And as he shows in < Blade Runner 2049 >, Villeneuve's strong artistic film qualities determine that this is a work that is far more quiet than moving, emotions lead the narrative, and is different from the general sci-fi blockbuster. If you want to seek sensory stimulation in < Dune >, you will be quite disappointed. In fact, there is basically no real climax scene in 155 minutes, because this is really just the beginning.",Dune
255,jaredpahl,This Generation's First Great Epic,9,22 October 2021,"Every week, a few movies come along claiming to be ""The Biggest Thing in the World"". They show up, pop, and fizzle out in time for the next ""Movie Event of a Lifetime"" to take their place. So many of these imposters make it easy to spot the real McCoy when it arrives. Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a film that finally earns those lofty accolades. It towers over today's so-called ""blockbusters"". Some films are simply, clearly, more special than others, and Dune, with this incredible, exceedingly rare thing called vision, proves to be a stunning, triumphant achievement.Dune is made from stock science fiction parts. It involves, like all of them do, warring alien races, intergalactic politics, and adventure on strange planets. There have been hundreds of sci-fi novels with plots nearly identical to Dune's. An evil race of aliens conquer a desert planet and exploit it for a precious resource. Then, a new, gentler race of people visit the planet in hopes of bringing peace. Conflict erupts and caught in the center of it all is a young ""chosen one"" who must learn to lead a people. Strong if well-tread narrative territory, that's for sure. Timothée Chalamet plays the young Duke, Paul Atreides, son of Oscar Isaac's idealistic leader. Rebecca Ferguson plays his mother, and friends along the way are played by Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, and Zendaya. There are only a few directors in whose hands archetypal material like this can captivate. Apparently, Denis Villeneuve is one of those directors.He accomplishes this feat through cinema's greatest trait; immersion. Frank Herbert might have created the basic outline of Dune's particular vision of the future, but Villeneuve creates this physical place. Here, the universe of Dune is an disturbing nightmare world, full of eerie, gruesome, sometimes horrifying imagery and an alien soundtrack even more unsettling. We aren't just peeking into the lives of these far-future space travelers, we're plunged headlong into the world with them. The screen is packed with detail. Stone architecture, ceremonial costuming, weapons, vehicles, everyday objects even, are meticulously imagined, crafted, and slyly exhibited. I've said before, the mark of a great film is when you can feel transfixed to the screen simply because the place is so real. There is not one moment when Dune feels like a ""movie"". It's a striking vision of a time and place that we can barely comprehend. That's why the film strikes such a frightening note. Never mind the images, the scope, the weird rituals and Venusian desert landscapes, just listen to the sound design and score by Hans Zimmer. It simply sounds like nothing I've ever heard. Gut-turning. The sensation of being transported far into the future is a distressing one. We lose our moorings to the familiar. We feel lost, and yet utterly astonished. Watching Dune, I believed that what I was looking at was a real place, in a real time, and I drank it in with eyes wide open.There's the foundation of a fascinating setting. With that, I'm along for whatever the story has to offer. And fortunately, Dune's Hero's Journey is a great one. Or at least the first half of a great one. Villeneuve works on a scale that other directors are afraid of. Plenty can replicate the physical sense of ""bigness"" these days. I've seen massive CGI spaceships and thousands of extras in other movies. What you don't get in other ""movie events"" is the scale of import. This is something you can't explain or teach. Dune is a big deal. It feels important. I don't know why. Whether by music, the seriousness of the actors, the camera flourishes, or some intangible confluence of timing, look, and creative energy, you stop to take notice of Dune. You sit there in reverence. Chalamet puts his hand in a box, nothing more, nothing less, and the sheer level of electricity flowing through the theater could short circuit an entire town.The story is so absorbing for so long, starting with the building of the world and ramping up in intensity once the strangely terrifying assassination attempts begin. Eventually, it all explodes into one of the most breathtaking large-scale battles I've seen on screen. After that, the super-mega giant worms and force field swordfights keep coming, but the movie kind of throttles down. And it keeps throttling down until a stylish, but slightly trite climax. Or is it a cliffhanger? By that point, it didn't matter to me. I was ready for Part Two. The promise of another trip to this bold, stunning world of Villeneuve's Arrakis makes this director's follow-up one of my most anticipated new films. Get ready for must-see, appointment cinema.Dune is a special movie. It's the kind of film that nearly died with Stanley Kubrick. It's too far to call Dune another 2001, but Dune does things, feels like Kubrick's best works. It spoils you with cold wonder. Like a movie made by an alien genius. You look at it like something from another reality. This film opens a portal to somewhere you've never been. Once you're there, in the thick of this universe, every little thing is amazing to behold. I left Dune genuinely awestruck. What a wonderful thing to know that in the cinematic era of shrunken, factory-made TV, some films can still feel that huge!91/100.",Dune
256,terrylarosa,"Villenueve completes his trifecta of sci fi, incredibly lifeless",3,23 October 2021,"And full movies. Arrival was as dull a movie as has ever been made and Bladerunner 2 was an overrated, bloated dull mess like the original. This continues his dull sci fi filmmaking. Uninvolving with dull characters, little action, suspense or adventure. An incredibly dull color palette and a blaring, thoroughly annoying score make this a complete fail. But what elevates this tedious mess is it's main lead. You can't have a literal 99 pound lead as an action hero. Chalamet is so unmanly that he's painful to watch. Most of the rest of the cast is fine but as lead Chalamet is simply terrible. Same thing happened with the movie Valerian. Why directors chose these blaring mistakes is a baffling mystery. I don't think we will be seeing a 2nd part. Final note: Those that say that this is similar to the magnificence of the Star Wars or LOTR movies are obliviously delusional. My only caveat is I didn't see it in the theatre and suffer.",Dune

Every time I watch, read or even play it feels to me as the best jumpsturt to my imagination.It's been a long time simce I've read all the books (including prequels) and I remember back than I imagined something similar. I never really understood why would the author use blades and close combat and not use remote weapons, as all humanity used since the invention of bows and arrows. It never made any sence to me.Never the less, this series of books always inpired me to dream of distant worlds. Worlds with harsh climate and incredible deep stories.This adaptation takes some of the better parts of first book and implement it on the big screen. Everything looks impressive, but it never felt as the same shot of sci-fi ""amaziness"" into my mind.I think I've seen all adaptations of this book to date and none were as good as the books. Played every video game, as the ""Dune"" theme gave birth to the whole Real Time Strategy games genre.The books, simply put, are different beast all together and I don't believe that I will ever see a Dune movie that will give me the same feeling as the books.That being said, the movie is good for everyone who read it and understand what is coming next.

258,scottmannen1,An Instant Classic/Masterpiece for All Time,10,22 September 2021,"The original Dune film created and released by David Lynch is undoubtedly a cult classic film. This 80's version of Dune was epic with grand visual cinematography, breathtaking costumes and a story that absolutely is a masterpiece. Where the original falls short is on flow and pacing. It dragged out in some areas.The new Dune film created by Denis Villeneuve contains many similarities when compared side by side with the original. In fact, the new Dune more closely follows that novel, and instead of having one long movie like the original, the new Dune fits about half of the original Dune story into a 2.5 hour film whereas the original fit the entire novel into that same 2.5 hours.The good news is that by splitting the novel into a 2 part film such as Villeneuve has done, it captures more of the novel in total. The result is a more detailed dive into the Dune novel that effectively eliminates many of the pacing issues that plagued the original film.The cinematography is next level on visuals. The world of Dune is breathtaking to see visually. The costumes are unique and gorgeous to view. It is very clear that Dune is a film with a massive budget...something that is quite rare to see anymore. Studios are more careful than ever when it comes to doling out the budget for blockbuster films anymore. In recent hits the only films with such large budgets are usually just Marvel films, so it is refreshing, unique and simply a visual treasure to look at this blockbuster film type that is actually filmed in IMAX for that incredible experience.We know the budget is there, but how about the story? Since this films source material comes from Frank Herbert himself, one simply could not have asked for a better story. In fact Dune is quite often hailed as the single greatest sci-if novel EVER created, and that is an accolade that is no small feat! The key was for Villeneuve to accurately convert that story into film accurately. I am pleased to say that this was clearly handled with kit gloves and deftly converted in a very effective manner. In my opinion we have an INSTANT CLASSIC film! The story and even the pacing is as close to perfect as many could have hoped!The acting and actors for Dune is simply a roster of some of the most talented A-list thespians on the planet! I could name this list for you here, but it is long and ""star studded"" as they say. The acting is fantastic and well performed across the board. The surprise performance out of an already amazing list would surprisingly go to Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin who brought ""sizzle"" t9 their respective roles! Additionally, the role of Paul by Timothy Chalomet was good but particularly Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica is a stand out for sure.This film is absolutely worth the money to go ""experience"" at IMAX. Notice I said ""experience"" as opposed to saying watch? This film in IMAX is just that type of film. Most people watch films, but Dune is a movie to ""experience"" if you are able to attend in IMAX. This show ranks very high across the board in every single category, but the entertainment value is particularly high, something that can be difficult to achieve in such a long run type film.9.5/10. I haven't really ever issued a perfect score to any film, but since I am unable to review score an IMDB film at 9.5/10, I then give this film score a 9/10 official review. I have only ever given out such a high score once, and that was for Game of Thrones who I rated the same. Do yourself a favour and view this in IMAX, worth every penny!",Dune
259,ilikeimdb,"Atrocious Plot Changes; Dull, Pointless",1,23 October 2021,"I was hoping Dune 2021 would more rigorously stick to the Book's plot and bring alive Herbert's detailed story in a way the compressed / compromised Dune 1984 could not. Instead D2021 glosses over or completely leaves out major plot points, changes key aspects of its characters, makes up new plots when convenient, or simply repeats certain scenes from D1984 with nearly the same dialog but without the necessary context. D1984 also has significantly better acting. Zendaya's acting is so flat the EKG wouldn't register. Timothee Chalamet's acting is similarly flat and uninspiring: For his Paul Atriedes, Spice is salt and very mild pepper. D2021's truly beautiful CGI can't compensate for the fact that no one watching the film cares one iota for the fate of any of its characters. Sad.",Dune

261,Tactrix,Very poorly outlined,6,18 October 2021,"Let me start by saying that this was entirely a waste of 2½ hours. Were the visuals spectacular? Not really, I mean they probably would have been if this had been a lush planet, or anything that had reason for great visuals. Instead you have 2½ hours of sand. This movie could have done so much in that time, instead it had 2 or 3 fight scenes that weren't all too great, and 2 hours worth of build up with no reasonable climax.And bare in mind this is only part 1, which means there's another part that I'm going to assume is just as long. And that's not even the worst part, the worst part is that it took them that entire duration of that movie to explain the dynamics of what's happening in that universe and they could have just summed it up with a bit of intro words like Star Wars did.This movie fell dismally short of what should have been done, they missed so many chances to do great things here that I wouldn't be surprised if someone decided to shoot it on location in the middle of a desert and then add in the structures via CGI.The only redeeming quality in this movie is the actors, they were fantastic in every sense, all around the bad guys, the good guys, and everyone in between, spectacular acting. 6/10.",Dune

No one is the cast comes through with a particularly strong performance with the exception of Ferguson who shines. Chalamet is lack luster and never seems to muster the gravitas needed for the Kwisatz Hederach. Especially underwhelming is Skarsgard. He is far too low key and does not come across as the monomaniacal lunatic of the text or previous versions of the movie. Other characters come and go in an instant and the story and lore don't quite gel.I'm giving six stars mainly for the production value and cinematography which are spectacular. And for a handful of genuinely great moments of storytelling.There is no doubt that Dune is a challenge. One that sadly is not met here. And that's too bad.",Dune

It's all operatic (and borderline Shakespearean) stuff, and how well that plays with audiences will vary from person to person. I was totally wrapped up in it.The visuals are stunning, the music works in service of the drama, and the characters are mostly well-written. This feels like it's building toward something monumental; because of that, I'm wholly invested and want to see what happens next. What better compliment can I give a movie of this sort?",Dune
265,paulijcalderon,Memories from a time I thought I'd lost,8,16 September 2021,"I felt like I was Paul Atreides - since my memories of watching the original 1984 film flashed before me as a visual guiding force while journeying through the desert planet of Arrakis. As a child, I loved the 80's aesthetic, the practical effects, and the over-the-top science fiction aspects of ""Dune"" - But I failed to understand the core meaning of the story. I'm thankful for having had an experience with the mythology of this tale before since it helped navigate me through this new re-imagining. Which culminated in a surprisingly emotional and immersive cinema visit.All the exposition, all the time put into introducing the people and the worlds - It all continues building and building - Until all those elements find themselves holding hands - And your patience is rewarded with a feeling of relating to the potential of Paul's destiny. All of us are searching for what lies beyond that desert. Beyond that fear, a destiny awaits. And as they say in the story: ""Fear is the mind-killer"". Congratulations to Denis Villeneuve and his team! They nailed it! It made me reminisce on the past fondly, whilst also being in the present with eagerness to continuing striving towards the horizon. A very specific feeling, I know. But that's what the movie did. Plus, re-visiting that image of those iconic Frank Herbet sandworms echoed back souvenirs from a simpler time that I thought I'd lost.PS: It was a bold choice to only adapt half of the book. Fingers crossed that we aren't left hanging with this cliffhanger. Much grandness is left to be witnessed.",Dune

Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a movie I have been anticipating for a long long time, and it was worth every second. The movie in all its grandness of scale is meant for the big screen, and I'm so glad that's where I experienced it.Dune is nothing short of perfection. From its narrative flourishes to its technical prowess, the movie lands without a hitch. The way in which a futuristic sci-fi movie can have so many elements of tradition, religiousity and tribalism brilliantly done, astounds me. And while all that is more on Frank Herbert, I still feel that the way in which it was translated to the screen, and that too as masterfully as it was deserves all the praise in the world.Dune looks like a billion dollars honestly. From its epicly gorgeous set designs, to its unrivaled cinematography and visual language, to its more than capable cast, to its richly designed costumes and to whatever Hans Zimmer was possessed by when he made the soundtrack... It's all perfection in every level.I loved this movie even before it came out, and while I was in a position to be easily disappointed with how much I hyped it up for myself, I'm glad I loved it more as I watched it, and even more when I reflect on it now. Definitely hitting the theatres again to watch it.",Dune

I was enraptured the entire time and 2.5 hours went by all too fast. The story was clearly laid out despite its complexity, and the characters given time to develop through meaningful conversation that reflected the book faithfully, at least to my recollection since I read the book 20+ years ago.This is Sci-Fi at it's best and I can't wait for the next installment.

You need to immerse yourself in the sound and vision ... Its not a great film, but it works well for what it is ... I never read the books, even though I was around when they were fashionable, the narrative just didn't seem that interesting to me... And to be honest I'm beginning to wonder if they aren't that good after this and the farcical David Lynch mess, I think its more about internal battles and influences on the politics of the narrative ... Themes that are impossible to capture on film in any entertaining manner ... But in Hollywood, anything that sells well is up for sacrifice, and if this was to be made I dare say this is as good as it could get ... But of course its only half the story ... I've seen several shots that aren't even in this film, that are obviously further ahead in the story ... So I'm guessing its all shot, but the producers are not providing the VFX budget for the second half till they see an astronomical profit ... It is obvious that they'll get a decent profit after the figures already once this goes to blu ray so they should just get on with it, cos the masses aren't going to appreciate such an open ended film, without knowing there will be a finale to the story
Like I said ... See it on a big screen ... Its epic cinema and worth supporting as most of the muck that flops out of Hollywood now is best left to fester unwatched and unwatchable... 7 out of 10.",Dune

Great acting by the stellar cast especially by Timothy Chalamet and Stellan Skarsgad. Great world building. You can feel what the ""dune universe"" is like. Great storytelling especially because there is a lot to explain and so it is exposition heavy but never feels like that.And of course the visuals. This movie looks absulety amazing. The camera work, the costumes and the set design. Everyhting looks epic. And you never have that flat CGI look like in a marvel or Star Wars movie where you feel like you are watching a computer game or feel like actors talking to a fixed point on a green screen.

Folding Space
Shield Wall as Shields
No traps left by Harkonnen
The Original gave us evolution in how each planet & the guild were altered by the spice, This film just didn't seem to bother.The Original gave us the internal voices of the characters which improved the movie. Anyone, not aware of the first won't understand what is missing in this one.The Original film photography was Vivid, alive full beautiful Colors & imagery. This new one pales by comparison.The Original Cast was a wealth of famous actors perfectly suited to there parts. This Casting Director seems to have been very Sloppy.The Bene Gesserit Voice control was vastly superior in the original movie.Added
There was no Bag Pipes in the book or original film & no reference to earth so where did the bagpipes come from.The CGI (where they've bothered) is better but they haven't taken the original movie & book & improved on it. Instead they decided to make a poor copy.There was no reference in the book or film that Caladans were human.The StillSuits are worse.In open desert, sun up, the Fremen are not wearing masks, mouths open & talking.Apparently a fast blade can get through Duncan's shield.The sound could be better

However, once it gets going and the action picks up, the epic scope of this story is displayed beautifully.Denis is a master at crafting a breathtaking shot and uses the special effects to his advantage in creating awe-inspiring moments. The performances across the board are all fantastic as well, with no particular stand-outs, but that is only a testament to everyone's overall performance.This film's staying power will hinge on the success of Part 2, but no doubt serves as a great first installment to this sci-fi epic.If you are a fan of Denis.

The production design, cinematography and score are epic movie at its finest. Solid performances from the entire cast as well.

The cinematography, the battles, the character building, overall story, everything is perfect. The film ends with the expectations that there will be a sequel, which is why it isn't a 10/10. There wasn't the feeling of a resolution, and films don't necessarily need that in order to be a flawless film, but I wanted it to end with a more conclusive end.The epic scale of this film could be compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I would say that this is probably the closest to a modern equivalent of the LotR trilogy.At times the film gave me Avatar vibes, in terms of its slow build-up, which isn't a bad thing. But the ending gave me LotR vibes, where we know that we're getting a sequel, so the end can't be fulfilling. The only difference is that we have to wait two years, instead of one, before the sequel hits theaters.It's as close to perfect as a film could be, in my opinion.",Dune
284,talonjensen,"Beautiful vistas, but . . .",8,27 October 2021,"I enjoyed this movie, the scenery, vistas are quite well done, but then the director is known for that.Disappointed that it ends so soon into the book, not even half way.In spite of all the criticism of the 1984 movie, I really liked that version. Of course, it helped that I had read the book when I was nine years old. If you had read the book first, there was no problem following the 1984 movie.Many scenes in the 1984 movie were better. The guild navigators were much better portrayed in the 1984 movie. As was the human test Paul underwent with the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother.This version is a little more stoic, less emotional than the 1984 version. I didn't like that as much, but it does make some sense from the militaristic cultures of the Atreides and Fremen. As always occurs, movies just aren't able to do as much character development as books, but I would have liked to see more.Baron Harkonnen is not as gross as the Baron of the 1984 version but, is almost as loathsome.I won't go into the errors in this movie, every movie has at least a few errors. And, others have pointed out the errors I caught. Some errors seemed like production choices.Overall I liked it and am looking forward to the sequel which leads into the more exciting portion of the novel.

286,residentgrigo,A near masterpiece with major missing pieces,9,18 September 2021,"I, first of all, applaud Legendary for allowing the director to do his thing on a budget of 165 million. No fan of the book can be disappointed by the end result but I don´t know if the general audience will see eye to eye as Villeneuve stuck too close to details that matter to him while leaving his audience and even the overall book behind. Dune 2021 is the best adaptation yet but too much of the plot and players were skipped to focus on Paul & Jessica who are the real film. The end result is an accurate depiction of their journey in the world of Herbert but it's debatable if his world & story are fully on-screen. Only Atreides characters are allowed any significant screen time and even their hereditary enemies the Harkonnen are reduced to bit parts. The grandiose and lived-in world is a sight to behold but we see so little of it and are explained even less so viewers might be confused why the film´s technology is so functional and basic. A was especially perplexed by how bare-bones the explanation of the spice is. It is the whole reason for the plot! No guild navigators or space-folding are seen on screen for example. The effects, costumes, score and performances leave little to be desired. The dialogue is easy to follow even if the context is often missing but some iconic book quotes are left behind. It is possible to view this film as your basic hero's journey narrative if one wants to. The way Herbert inverts and criticizes such tales is also all on-screen even if the fruits of these details will only ripen in the second half and hopefully movie 3. Aka Dune Messiah. Our director stated it as his current end goal.I don´t want to sound too negative and I had a great time with the film and look forward to revisiting it. I simply fear that the lack of mass appeal or rewatchability for casual audiences will leave the story forever unfinished. The film adapts 60% of the story, minus missing political elements & characters that a sequel would need to cover immediately before moving forward with the story. Let's just say that the film goes out of its way to not follow the Chekhov's gun principle. Watch and champion this movie if you are a fan of heady sci-fi and of course the Herbert novel(s) but push the source material, its full-cast audiobook, or its new 3 part Graphic Novel adaptation on the people you recommend the film to as they will need a safety net to appreciate the film and to be hungry for more. Let's hope against hope that someone will dare to adapt Dune 4 one of these days. Maybe the next reboot? 8,5/10PS: The 3-hour long ""Dune (1984) Alternative Edition Redux"" (7.5/10) is a solid companion to this film and features backstory and characters that have so far been skipped.

287,BijeshNagesh,Extraordinary Reincarnation of a Classic,9,22 October 2021,"I was looking forward to watching this film via streaming, which I prefer, but a seat was temptingly available at a good theatre in my city so I couldn't resist going to see the movie as soon as possible before the meme train earnestly rolled onto social media with spoilers galore.""Dune"" 2021 genuinely lived up to the hype. It also stayed true to the spirit of the original 1984 title. This latest one is essentially a remake, and they both relied on the book that inspired them, namely Frank Herbert's Science Fiction novel after the same name.Denis Villeneuve was not only the perfect director for this film, his demand for excellence and subject-matter loyalty extended to his team of writers - Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth, and himself - as well as his cinematographer Greig Fraser (who also worked on ""The Batman"", directed by Matt Reeves, starring Robert Pattinson, and coming 2022). Add musical scoring by Hans Zimmer to the mix, and you have yourself 'dunes' of greatness that worked sheer movie-magic on this IP.Everyone in the crew brought their A-game for this one, especially Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan's costume design prowess. The VFX and special effects team did splendid work as well. Stunts and Art direction, along with production design, left no creative stone unturned.Playing the iconic Paul Atreides was Timothée Chalamet, who wonderfully took to the role and practically re-introduced the 80s hit character to a new generation of movie lovers. Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atreides was refreshing and different, but not too dissimilar to the original character. Jason Momoa's Duncan Idaho and Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica Atreides were both outstanding.Stellan Skarsgård's Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was excellence made manifest. Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck and Javier Bardem's Stilgar were amazing. Dave Bautista as Beast Rabban Harkonnen was pretty convincing. Zendaya as Chani was good, though I believe more of her scenes await us in the next instalment. Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Mohiam was superb. Stephen McKinley Henderson's Thufir Hawat, Sharon Duncan-Brewster's Dr. Liet Kynes, and Chen Chang's Dr. Wellington Yueh were captivating.The movie was a visual treat to beat all treats. It was stunning in every way, and I don't use the words lightly. It packed a world's worth of nostalgia and beauty, wonder and awe, timing and detail. ""Dune"" 2021 deserves praise for several reasons, the most important among them being that the team who came together to work on this project didn't botch it up.As highly anticipated sequels go, fan expectations and the anticipations of book lovers who'd read Herbert's novel were certainly poised on the edge of doling out harsh critique where 2021's ""Dune"" was concerned. As one such fan, I can honestly say that the film passes muster and the team did good by the story and its storied characters. And this was just Part I, leaving me parched for news of Part II - when does it start shooting and when's a tentative release date.Arakkis (Spice Planet), Caladan (Homeworld of House Atreides), Giedi Prime (Homeworld of House Harkonnen), and Salusa Secundus (Imperial Army Planet) breathed once more through 2021 ""Dune"", as well as their technologies, cultures, beliefs, sounds, languages, not to forget those dreaded Sandworms. I can't stress enough how unnervingly beautiful and hauntingly spectacular it all was, and how supremely nostalgic.I quietly wished Frank Herbert were still alive to see his literary brilliance be reincarnated on the silver screen yet again thirty-five years after his death. His book is still exemplary, and this feature-length adaptation did it adequate justice.""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."" - Frank Herbert, ""Dune"".",Dune
288,zombie84-1,BRILLIANT,10,29 October 2021,"What a film, truly a masterpiece in every area. So lets dive into why it is masterpiece.A little back story - so I always wanted to read DUNE but never got around to it, I watched the younger one as kid growing up and enjoyed it for its weirdness. Years passed into my adult life and I still missed out on reading DUNE till recently in which I am not 37. DUNE is a fantastic book (yes it could be boring) but its so much happening inside it and it draws you in even during the boring parts. So I was skeptic on how the movie would be. But sure enough I went to see it - and I ignored everyone who kept saying it was slow, boring and no action.Because DUNE isn't suppose to be a action sort of film. The book has none, only a few scenes. There is alot more violence towards the end - but other then that its a political world building book. ANd sure enough thats just how the movie was political and world building. I was so happy to see it translated to film perfectly, flawlessly, and brilliantly handled. It was scene by scene word for word basically.I was so drawn in that I forgot I was watching a movie.The acting from everyone was on point, and it felt like these worlds actually existed. The score was astouding and fit wonderfully, the visual effects were breathtaking, it was all amazing.Alot of people were complaining that Zendaya didn't get enough screen time, but she wasn't suppose to. This covered the first part of the book which is a 600 and something paged book its massive. The 2nd part will explore alot more of Zendaya's Character CHANI who has a huger role in the second half of the book. I can't wait to see PAUL become USUL and leading into him becoming Muad Dib.I hope they do a fantastic job with the 2nd part as much as they with the first I feel they will.I hope we get the rest of the dune books too turned into movies as well but honestly I would rather see them all become TV SHOWS. It be alot better to explore.",Dune
289,mitchell5954,PLEASE WATCH DUNE!,9,22 October 2021,"Dune is the long-awaited remake of the 1984 film by David Lynch and the third attempt at a feature film adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel. This is a film I've been wanting to see for a long time. It kept getting delayed by the pandemic, but now I finally saw it and it was pretty much everything I had hoped for. I'm a big fan of the director Denis Villeneuve. I've liked pretty much all of his movies. I like Prisoners and Sicario okay. I really enjoy Enemy and Arrival. Blade Runner 2049 I think is a masterful sequel and one of my favorite films of all time along with the original Blade Runner. I also am one of the few who enjoy the original 1984 film. It's pretty hockey and some of the effects are really dated. However, I think the cast and the material itself it was adapting saved the piece. Plus, some of the effects do hold-up decently even today, though not on the level of this film for sure.Theses days remakes get a bad rep, and it's not hard to see why. There have been many bad remakes over the past two decades, most of them horror remakes.The reason why most remakes fail is because they are soulless passionless cash-ins on a film or franchise that has proven successful before and requires no reboot outside of making money. However, there are some really good remakes out there. John Carpenter's The Thing, the Blob, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (yes, I like the remake), Red Dragon, and Oceans 11 are ones that come to mind. A remake is warranted when the original piece is either outdated or wasn't that good in the first place. Dune falls into both categories. While I do enjoy the 1984 film, it is a movie that is outdated. It was also panned by critics and fan of the novel. Plus, it has been nearly forty years since that movie came out and Dune as a franchise has been largely forgotten by pop culture. This is the ideal time to do a remake that finally does the original source material justice and rekindles interest in the franchise. I feel this film has done just that. I'd say this one of the best remakes ever done.The film looks immaculate. Dennis excels at making beautiful looking film as previously showcased in Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. This might be his best-looking film. Blade Runner 2049 was already a breathtaking film visually, but this film manages to look just as good if not better. Han Zimmer's score compliments the film perfectly, especially on the big screen. If you have the chance to see this film in the theater you need to do so.The cast is amazing. You have Javier Bardem, Bautista, Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Fergusson, Jason Momoa, and Zendaya. An all-star cast that all give amazing performances. However, most of the focus goes to Timothee Chalamet as Paul and he does an amazing job as both being a young and inexperienced person but can also be badass and command respect when needed.The one flaw with the film is that it only adapts half of the story. This is really half a movie. The legacy this film will have depends on how good the next film will be if we even get one. If this is all we get then this film suffer for it. The original, rushed as much of it was, still had a clear ending and could stand alone. This film really can't. Plus, as this is half a film, there are some scenes that do drag on a bit. Even so, I was never outright bored in the movie.Overall, please see Dune and, if possible, see it in the theater. I pray this does well so we get that part two. I also want them to adapt the other five novels in the series by Frank Herbert some day whether it be in movie for or through a TV series.",Dune
290,Badr90s,The adaption we need,8,11 October 2021,"Great movie with it's cast and cinematography, thrilled to read the novel and watch 1984 + the mini series, loved Oscar (Paul dad) performance and Rebecca (Paul mom), they carried the movie in my opinion unlike the goofey antagonist, I expect more of Timothee (Paul) & Zendaya in the sequel, til that time this movie is recommended to watch at Dolby theatre.",Dune

292,ferreiranazli,The beginning of something incredible,10,25 October 2021,"Since I haven't read the books or watched other versions, my review is based at this movie only.This movie is just an introduction for something bigger. An interesting story, engaging. The characters draw attention to the personality and strangeness of costumes and local customs of a fantastic world. For those who loves sci-fi, go for it. By blockbuster standards, it's a pretty slow movie, but that didn't hurt my experience at all. The photography and sets are amazing, doing the rest of the film justice.",Dune
293,alon-dar1,"Bad actors, boring, 10 good minutes.",2,21 October 2021,"Music was Ok, reminded the the music of blade runner 2, also some of the desert flight shots reminded the same film. Actors chosen were ridiculous, each one was the wrong person for the job, Javier slept while acting, the only 10 minutes that gave a feeling of an alien world and some creativity where when the battalions were preparing to attack the duke. Really bad, waste of money.",Dune
294,TreeFiddy53,"Neither GREAT, nor BAD. A good 'origins', that's about it.",7,24 October 2021,"I thought that Dune was neither as good as some people claim it to be, nor as horrible as others say it is. I don't know the first thing about the book or the old Dune, but this was a good 'Origins' story into the Dune world, IMO.The Dune world, from what I understand, is massive and they did a good job of trying to fit in A LOT of it in one movie. Hell, this one movie had SO MUCH going on that this could have been a 2-part movie for people who have no knowledge of Dune. That said, it was coherently done, so, no complaints.The music pretty much carries the entire movie, well supported by the visuals first and then the acting, plot etc., although, this isn't Hans Zimmer's best work IMO.People seem to be upset about how the film has always been marketed as ""Dune"" but it's actually ""Dune: Part 1"" when the movie starts. It was also called ""The Next Star Wars/LOTR"" in the marketing, did you go in expecting 3 movies' worth of plot in a single one?Apparently, Warner Bros hasn't approved a sequel yet and is waiting to see if Part 1 is successful. While it's likely that there will be sequels, there is a possibility that we may not even get a part 2, which would be a shame. If I were Warner, I'd have NOT released it on HBOMax, but I am a customer and I am glad they did. No chance I'd have left the theater satisfied after this movie as it is now.Will def. Be watching the next one, IF it ever comes out.",Dune
295,Harry_Gleeson,Denis Villeneuve. A Master,8,22 October 2021,"The best way to describe Dune is that it is a spectacle, and an enjoyable one at that. It's a film meant for the big screen, which is certainly a positive for the industry itself.The film is certainly entertaining, there's no doubt about that. The many action scenes are fun to watch, engaging too. What Denis Villeneuve does best in almost all his films, his keep the tension at a high level, which is one of Dune's strengths, he's a master at it. The cinematography again builds the world of Arrakis in a unique way, cinematographer Greig Fraser deserves praise for that. The CGI also isn't overused and doesn't affect the narrative in annoying ways.I didn't know anything about the novels going so it takes time to get used to the world, meaning that film can be too slow in parts and may pass you by, but eventually it clicks.The films a spectacle which impressed me, Timothee Chalamet was a good lead, but Jason Momoa and Oscar Isaac gave standout performances. An amazing ensemble.Look forward to part 2, definitely recommend seeing it in cinemas. A blockbuster in the truest sense.4/5.",Dune

I so cannot wait for part 2 and the future of House Atreides.",Dune
297,Dello_,A pleasure for the eyes,8,19 September 2021,"Dune is technically perfect: direction, cinematography, score, acting, visual effects. It is truly a great cinematic experience and if you are interested you HAVE to go watch it in a theatre because it's visually majestic and the big screen helps fully enjoying it. Even the audio is important with a inspired score and great sounds in general and the big speakers of a theatre can contribute to a even better immersion. Dune is technically great as I said and it should be viewed but its ""part one"" nature is what could let down some viewers or maybe, as it has happened to me, not to fully appreciate the movie. In particular the protagonist has his arc and some important things happen but the movie does not tell a complete story and the ending seems more like the finale of a episode of a tv show rather than one of a movie and I'm already anxiously waiting for the sequel. In conclusion Dune is certainly worth watching, especially in a theatre, even just for its aesthetics but be aware that it is not a conclusive movie and be prepared for that.",Dune
298,tocanepauli,2 for the visual effects but that's all!,2,19 October 2021,"Sorry, but what was that all about? I got lost right at the start and the story (if there was one) went downhill from there! Just who was fighting who? Who are the goodies and who are the baddies?

There were some thrilling set pieces and it was hard not to admire the impressive scale and cinematography. When comparing it to other big, multi-film epics, such as Lord of the Rings, however, it feels like Dune was missing heart and soul. Maybe when seen in the context of the complete series I will look back and feel differently but, for a film I have been looking forward too for many months, it left me disappointed.",Dune
300,saikatsamanta,A Stunning feat of Filmmaking But You Only Get Half of It !!!,8,25 October 2021,"I have always put Denis Villeneuve on the same pedestal as Christopher Nolan & I think the only thing that separates them is a Blockbuster. This film & hopefully the second part will finally give Denis his due recognition as one of the Best Directors of All Time. Its A Visual Masterpiece, the scope of the entities & grandeur is on another level. Hans Zimmer comes with yet another iconic score. Performances are solid all around. The film takes a lot of time in worldbuilding but keeps your interest with awe inducing visuals. It only adapts first half of the Iconic Novel by Frank Herbert so just when you start getting intrigued by the chain of events, the film abruptly ends. I hope enough people watch this one so that WB greenlights the sequel because leaving this story unfinished is a criminal act. Go watch this on the Big Screen.",Dune
301,gabethedinosaur,The sand is calling,10,2 November 2021,I absolutely loved it . It was almost like lord of the rings and the hobbit. The characters were so well done . The storylines and filming locations was brilliant. The effects and cgi was incredible. The beginning of the film had a great description of how the desert planet was facing war and killings . The other planets had great descriptions of making offerings and deeds . But the young boy who almost reminds me of frodo and bilbo baggins who wanted to go on an adventure and come face to face with the ultimate goal . Finish the war and bring peace to galaxy.,Dune

Just boring.First film I've ever walked out of, I'm not interested in if the last 30 mins was perfection which I doubt, a film is an experience and that 2 hours was beyond boring.I find this kinda film the hardest genre to get into unless your that way inclined, most others there's normally something that hooks you, this just doesn't.I do not get how people think, it's almost like they're bored and confused so think it's automatically good.

303,evilnigga,Immersive visual odyssey,7,24 October 2021,"Stunning visuals with amazing special effects but feels rather empty. I'm a little bit skeptical with the cast choices. I know they need big name actors to bring more audience and they did deliver a great performance but perhaps it would work even better if they chose some unknown.The action scene was good for the most part but it felt really held back, there's no blood nor sadism and you know exactly why. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself once again. While it is a vast and immersive audio and visual odyssey I still feel that it is lifeless. And the story keep setting up for something that didn't come. There's a lot that hasn't been revealed and I hope the second movie if Vileneuve did make it has a lot more to tell.",Dune
304,ha77y73ad97,Beautiful for such an immersive and harsh world,9,4 November 2021,"From the outset of this movie this was going to be another slow burning, beautifully shot epic from Villeneuve. From his other entries into the si-fi genre this certainly fits with how he wants to make movies!All of the performances from this star studded cast are prefect for this film. Nothing more can be said for Timothee Chalamet, truly this is the first film that i've seen him in but will have to see what else he has in store. From being on his home world to fighting in the harsh desert his still conveys that strong quiet persona for this role. As parents both Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson were great, behind closed doors Isaacs role was awesome, with encouragement for his heir to the Dukedom and strong infront of his subordinates. The small relief come from Jason Momos as Duncan with some great cutting one liners until his dermise and a true friend to Paul. Then there's the opposite of Josh Borlins harsh military commander that works so well with both Momoa and Chalamet whilst their on screen. Smaller roles for both Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautiata but hoping for greater roles in the part 2 of this film!If you know the story of the original movie or the books this is following this so there is no need to talk about this. The direction and cinematography is just epic, if there are ever pieces of art created from this movie this could fill an art gallery! From single shots to action explosions the pairing of Villeneuve and Greig Fraser is a match made in haven, I never thought the Deakins combination would ever be beat but this might have! His sizing of space craft has been tripled since his work on Rouge One and this is just epic. All the way down to a desert mouse and the grains of sand. Moving onto the sound editing the ""Voice"" is just terrifying when said, music and sound track just conveys the intensity that the writing and Villeneuve direction just cannot be reproduced from any other team!This is a small review on this long movie but i can totally say this this is a slow burner that doesnt fell like the runtime of this movie! If the return of the cast and crew is confirmed this could be the making of a trilogy, if reports are to be believed, that may go down in history.",Dune
305,suvechhabose,I opened my third eye just to find mistakes,8,18 October 2021,"I couldn't find any.Why? Because this cinema is very carefully made. M not a Villeneuve fan so my review is dead honest.I have seen dune (84) , it was good . Far away from being perfect,
But this one is just mesmerizing. Leaving aside vfx and music , the story is snugged. What Mr Villeneuve did here was a necessary move. He carefully divided the story , made few adjustments to the script & voila! Magic.Acting was okay , no complaints . Deciding not to show space is smart move. He instead of doing this , explained the characters , explained the environment , explained the blissful tension our protagonist is carrying.This is the first sci_fi which is based on different planets but there's no to zero planetary space shots & This one wasn't rushed like the last one! The sense of dark cinematography , high humming score of Mr Zimmer , enigma around antagonists and pledging zero allegiance to humour is what i am thankful for. After a lot of time ,Cinema is alive.Do add more surrealistic touches in part two
I mean , why not !",Dune
306,levybob,Dune is Fine. Which is not the same as Great.,8,8 November 2021,"Dune is Fine. Which is not the same as Great. One thing for sure it's a whole lot better than the David Lynch Version that preceded it by forty years or so. The reason to see this version is easy. It looks great. Everything is larger than life. More vast, more high, more fast, of greater multitudes. It is - I apologize - a feast for the eyes. And, get this, its story is a good one as well. We've got warring intergalactic families fighting over the rights to the universe's most important mineral. We've a good boy with an even better mother, we've got evil and horrific villains, and we've got a rebel army and their pet worms who stand guard over the minerals. And though this last group of characters plays a small role in this - Episode One - episode, you can bet we'll see a lot more of them in future installments.Finally, I suggest you adjust your expectations when seeing this film:
1. The film, as I stated, is but Part One of multiples; so don't get your hopes up for a neat and clean ending.2. The giant worms ain't all that much. Are they better than David Lynch's? Yes, of course. But they could and should be much better. And maybe they will be.3. The villains are easy to confuse with each other. They're ugly and bald. But maybe it's me; maybe I just failed to note their differences. The good news is David Bautista is an easily recognized villain. The not so good news; he's not real good in his role.Enjoy.I really think you will.",Dune
307,Benslie,This movie is two and half hours of wondering what's going on,8,24 October 2021,"Right off the bat, I have to mention the cinematography in this movie is gorgeous. No matter where you are in the movie everything looked amazing and never dull even when you're in a desert wasteland of just sand. Also, the special effects in this movie were spectacular. Special effects in movies are either a hit or a miss and thankfully for this movie they very much were a hit. You can tell that most of this movie was filmed on location and the special effects blended so well into the background that it seemed like these things were real. The hard work that also paid off for this movie was the costumes. Despite them seeming very simple you can still see the care taken to show the difference of status and houses with them. The last thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was obviously the Hans Zimmer score for this movie. It added so much tension for certain scenes but overall is an amazing listen to. Now, the acting in this movie was alright to me. Nobody really stood out to me bringing a lot to this movie but this also could be due to how confusing the story is which leads me to my biggest complaint which is the pacing. I could semi-follow the story well enough but the pacing and editing didn't help me fully understand this story. For me, the pacing felt alright for the first half of the movie and the started to really drag out during the second half. For the editing, it just felt like for certain scenes they spent the right amount of time on them but for others ended them too soon. Another problem with the editing is there are zero-time stamps so the passage of time was confusing. I will applaud Denis Villeneuve, the director and one of the writers, for still doing a really good job directing this movie despite how complicated the source material is. The book itself is 412 pages long so it's not an easy task to take on and he did his best and I enjoyed his directing of this movie. I especially enjoyed how he directed the action scenes in this movie. The action scenes might not be groundbreaking work but are still some of the best scenes in this movie. In the end, Dune 2021 isn't going to be for everybody but it still has some elements that everybody can enjoy.",Dune
308,the_real_smile,"Great movie, but lacks out on some points",8,31 October 2021,"I just love the cult classic Dune of 1984 and was afraid this remake would not live up to that standard. I was not disappointed, great cast, very good special effects and entertaining. If you know the story you know that the 'spice' is used for space travel, without it it is not possible. This movie lacks that it does not show the space travel with the spice, where the 1984 edition did, that was fairly disappointing. But the positive side on the 2021 version is that the story is explained much better. So overall, even if you love the 1984 version, or did not see any Dune movie/series ever, this movie is worth your while.",Dune
309,Master_Strange,The Setups Came Together Beautifully,7,31 October 2021,"Everything just made sense, the setups came together beautifully and the movie did show us more than it told. I have great respect and admiration for everyone who created this movie. This is truly a worthy adaptation for a very complicated and nuanced piece of literature. I was completely blank about what the story is about I did a bit of research but after watching the movie I feel like reading the books too the whole lore is so intriguing, it has so many layers to it. Timothee Chalomet is one of the most talented young actors out there right now and imo the best at the moment he compeletely embodies all the characters he plays as and I loved him in this movie although we got to see only a few intense scenes which seperates the great from the good and he did not let us down. Overall Villeneuve has built a strong base for a trilogy.",Dune

The movie does take itself very very seriously but there is some entertainment to be had, even for the casual viewer. There isn't much action and what there is isn't very exciting or well shot. Much is being made of the cinematography which is odd as much of it is filmed in the dark.The success of this franchise will depend on the time between installments. If each is released on annual basis it might work but for me as a casual viewer there isn't enough interest to make me watch the second installment in 2 or 3 years time. While not bad this movie is no masterpiece and as a franchise it will struggle to find a mass audience.",Dune

The casting and acting was also strong, however, several of these characters didn't appear to have much to do. I respect that it was a mature plot that had substance instead of explosions and an over abundance of fight scenes, but it needed some faster paced scenes to keep it from becoming monotonous. An hour and 15 minutes in, nothing significant still had not happened.",Dune
316,Criticalstaff,"Simply great, an instant classic!",9,18 September 2021,"The biggest question with this film was: was Villeneuve able to deliver? You got one of the most popular sci-fi novels, a cast of talented and very charismatic actors, and a generous budget. Was Villeneuve the right choice to direct this film; could he muster all these resources and use them effectively to tell a story? Could he make a film that is enjoyable to watch and at the same time adapt a convoluted cult-classic on which numbers of filmmakers have stumbled?Turns out, the answer is yes.The real cornerstone of the movie, if you put aside the special effects, the plot and the visual storytelling, is the pacing. The film takes its time and lays out confidently most of the techno-babble and sci-fi jargon upfront. Yet, it is not boring or annoying. In any situation or scene, you know what is going on, who is doing what, and generally speaking the action is clear. That is something that was absent from Lynch's Dune. It is challenging to deliver a lot of information in a digestible manner, especially with the sort of sci-fi such as Dune. But the movie does it patiently and clearly. Most of the time a concept is set-up in one scene and then shown or explained in the next. Not only was everything clear in terms of stakes; but it was also engrossing in terms of tension. Not only do you understand what Paul is up against, but you want him to succeed.The story of Dune is the story of Paul Atreides, the young heir of a noble family. One thing that is cool in Dune is: it's feudalism in space. So, you get something that is closer to Game of Thrones than Star Wars.The movie follows the adventure of young Paul. How he makes the transition to a new world, has to come to grips with becoming a leader and is destined to become a prophetic messianic figure. That stuff is good, but I always thought it was the weaker aspect of the novel Dune. The story of a young boy who discovers awesome powers that leads him to rule the universe is pure power fantasy. It is more appealing to young boys than anyone else. Thankfully, the plot weaves-in the space politics and keeps your attention. It presents a lot of that messianic text in ethereal settings: dreams, distant voice-overs and flash-forwards. Leaving the primary action to focus on the back-room intrigues and political upheavals.Generally speaking, it takes the established source material, but paints it with the Villeneuve brush. The movie has that visually sleek minimalist style, where heft is rather communicated with sound. Those are the same ingredients that made Blade Runner 2049 a good movie. In many ways, this movie is more of the same, there is not much innovation stylistically. On the other hand, why change a winning formula?My only caveat is: You have to love sci-fi to like this. Your typical Grandma will not enjoy this.",Dune
317,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,An immersive sci-fi cinema experience to behold,9,11 October 2021,"Dune is an epic science-fiction adventure experience to behold. Director Denis Villeneuve transports the audience inside the epic world of Frank Herbert's novel. It is an intoxicating film, at times overwhelming, that lingers in the mind like a reoccurring dream.Paul Atreides, son of Planet Calaban, accompanies his family, House Atreides, to the desert planet Arrakis to manage the mining for the ""spice"", the most precious resource in the universe capable of prolonging human life, enhancing intelligence and can fuel faster-than-light space travel.A betrayal pushes the House Atreides to join the Freeman, the local desert inhabitants of Arrakis, in a war against the Harkonnens, an industrialized race seizing control of the spice.Denis Villeneuve spends the first 30 minutes introducing the different planets, races and characters. It takes brainpower to keep up with it and remembering all the sci-fi names of who's who, but slowly and firmly all the little details pull you inside the world of Dune.It came like an awakening. I viscerally felt immersed around the 30-35 minute mark when Timothée Chalamet's Paul Atreides catches an object in his hand and I cheered. Just like that, I was in.Before that moment, the commercial film-goer inside me, all corn-fed on the Marvel formula, was throbbing going, ""Where's the action scene? What's taking so long?"" The film calmed that fever down with its slow pacing, ensuring every detail was crucial and every object in frame had a story behind it, which Denis Villeneuve gives the audience the time to ponder on what they might be. Eventually I tuned in and was immersed, feeling like I too was going on the adventure in the desert as well.Greig Fraser's cinematography combined with the production design and costumes, are breathtakingly gorgeous. If it's available, see it on IMAX. There's so much to soak up. It is addictive marveling at all the visual details, if you let it. Even the spice looks so visually delicious that it makes you want to put your face in it and snort it all.Hans Zimmer, a self-professed huge fan of the novel, delivers his most experimental score yet, including inventing new instruments, playing normal instruments differently and creating an alien language to create otherworldly music from another universe.Zimmer's score attacks the subconscious without words and he experiments with what's recognizable to our ears. There's an instance of bagpipes playing over a ceremonial setting that was masterfully jarring that had me discussing with friends the effect it had in our heads.The only one quibble I had was one instance where Mandarin Chinese was used as a coded language and it took me out because I speak it. It was so jarring that I missed the actual plot point. ""What? Mandarin exists in the Dune world?"" That is twice now Denis Villeneuve used Chinese awkwardly in a movie, his first being Arrival. He seems passionate about featuring the language, but unaware how it is playing to its native speakers.Above all the spectacle, what struck me was how Dune tapped into the metaphysical. Paul Atreides' visions call to him, driving him towards his destiny. It's an unexplainable yet compelling feeling and Denis Villeneuve presents it in such an ethereal untouchable way, my mind keeps thinking about it.This is the best time I've had in a cinema for 2021 and I'm rooting to see nominations come awards season. Dune is the anti-formula, the anti-Marvel attempt to deliver a new experience that cannot easily be explained. For me, Dune hits the standard of cinema that Martin Scorsese was talking about.I cannot wait for part two.",Dune
318,Joejoesan,"Dune is good, but perhaps not good enough",8,11 September 2021,"I just saw Dune this morning in 3D in a Dolby Cinema theatre in Amsterdam. I had some time to think about it and process what I saw and decided to share my thoughts with you. Be aware: I guess I have some good news and some bad news for you. Check out my review with minor spoilers.To keep my story in perspective let me first tell you where I stand.I love the first Dune trilogy by Frank Herbert. I thought book 4, God Emperor of Dune, was okay but pretty much disliked all the ones that came after that one. I love the David Lynch film. I know it's flawed and the longer (Alain Smithee) versions are a real mess, but there is a lot to enjoy. I even dare to say that his scenes with ""The Voice"" were better than in this film. I also think Denis Villeneuve is overrated (sorry!). Haven't seen Prisoners yet, but Arrival and Sicario were good but not great and Blade Runner 2049 is visually stunning, but storywise... Replicants getting pregnant by humans: I didn't buy it. Still, I thought Denis Villeneuve would be a good choice to direct Dune. He actually is... and isn't.Okay, let's start with the good things first.Dune has an incredible cast. And because Villeneuve only filmed ½ of book 1 the characters get a lot of screentime to show us who they are. Especially Duncan Idaho profits from this. In the Lynch movie he was not only miscast (actor Richard Jordan), but he didn't have much to do except xxxxx. In the new version Jason Momoa gets all the space and time to excel in this role. There are some nice scenes with Oscar Isaac (as Duke Leto) that establish his love for Paul Atreides. Although I missed a certain mystery in the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, I think she fit her role well. Timothy Chalamet is a more realistic Paul Atreides than Kyle Maclachlan. He is more vulnerable and presents himself more as a leader as the story evolves. He's a good choice to play Paul Atreides. To me the actors that really stood out were Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin (although his Gurney Halleck could have used more screentime) and Javier Bardem (as Stilgar). Haven't seen enough of Zendaya as Chani though. Apart from the opening there are no voice overs used in this film. I liked that too.Unfortunately the list of bad things is longer.Dune is a long movie (2 ½ hours) and it doesn't really end with a climax or a cliffhanger. Actually there aren't that many real climatic scenes that stand out. Maybe we are already used to films like Godzilla vs Kong, but the sandworms look nice but don't really make a big impression. I did think the ornithopters were kinda cool, though. Villeneuve's Dune is faithful to the book and doesn't have many surprises. He does explain the political situation much better than David Lynch, but because you can't do much with the (digital) scenery of sand and dunes his film isn't as visually stunning as for instance Blade Runner 2049. Even the 3D doesn't work. The film looks great of course, but stunning... no. The trailer promised us that there would be (some) humour in this film. The truth is: there isn't. The only funny scenes were already seen in the trailer. Dune is a very serious film. Some fans will love that and say there wasn't much humour in the books in the first place, but I think it's a good tool to bring the characters to life. It works very well ti establish the friendship between Duncan Idaho and Paul. I wish there were more scenes like that.Although I've listed my bad things about Dune here above, those have nothing to do with the real ""bad news"" about Dune. I'm going to walk on thin ice here, but this is truly what I think. Fact is, I don't believe Dune will be a commercial hit. I think it's a good movie that deserves a sequel, but I guess the timing of the release is all wrong. I really doubt if we ever get to see how this tale of Paul Atreides ends. Let me explain.Frank Herbert's world of Dune drew inspiration from the Arabic language (Shai-Hulud, Lisan al-Gaib, Gom Jabbar) and Islamic themes. In the book they call it a Jihad, in the movie they talk about Holy War. With the Taliban taking control in Afghanistan, I really don't know if a movie that glorifies Middle Eastern or Central Asian culture can be a great commercial success in the USA, where still almost 50 percent of the people voted for Trump. Maybe it can be in Europe or other parts of the world, but in America... I don't know. Some people can even claim that the native people from Dune, the Freeman, resemble the Taliban. I don't say that's the case, but people may think that way. There is also an offscreen beheading in the film and with I. S. having done the same thing that really is delicate. Again: maybe I don't have enough credit to Ameruca film audiences so I truly hope I'm wrong.The fans know what will happen to Paul and his fight against the Emperor and the House Harkonnen. But most of the audience doesn't. The moment the story ends may be a logical one, but probably doesn't make an audience curious about what happens next. With a running time of 2 ½ hours I really don't know if non-fans are really interested in the fate of Paul Atreides without a real cliffhanger.I truly hope they will be, because I'd love to see Paul's fight against Feyd Rautha on part 2 of Villeneuve's Dune saga.8/10.",Dune
319,alexscott-35299,Gorgeous visuals. Not so gorgeous story!,7,28 October 2021,"Look I get that this is basically a sci-do politics movie but I've honestly never been so bored in the cinema. This film is way too long and is basically just one big exposition dump for future films, which I'm kind of not mad at, I'm hoping that this film is basically just gonna be a big set up movie for a brilliant series of things. This the easily the best looking film that I've ever seen in my life, the cgi and effects are easily the best I've ever seen, it looks amazing. The score is beautiful and fits the movie so well, the acting is really good also, Oscar Isaac is brilliant and to be fair everyone is doing a great job in their role. I did enjoy this movie but for different reasons, I've changed my rating for this film 4 times since I saw it and it's only gone up, the more I think about the film the more I realise how much I enjoyed it. Honestly go see it for yourself because it is definitely a movie to be watched on the big screen. Not bad!",Dune
320,dannylee-78082,Felt like watching a strip show.,5,30 October 2021,5/10; felt like watching a strip show - love the visuals but couldnt care less about the peopleThings I likedVisuals. One of the most beautiful interpretations of deserts I've seen in film.The dragonfly ships were coolMost of the world building was interesting.Hans Zimmer score is always a solid pickThings I didn't likeWay too long. Timothee isn't mature enough of an actor to carry a nearly 3h movieWhat's the point of having high profile actors just to kill them off? Maybe spend that money on editors to shave 20 min off the movie.They failed to get the audience invested in Paul in the first 30 min which kinda made the rest of the movie pointless. It was honestly really hard to watch the coming of age story for a character I did not care about.Sometimes hard to understand dialogue hence the plot. Could be my hearing though.,Dune
321,jebyvyson,I need a part 2,9,23 October 2021,"I have never read the book Dune and I have only watched half of the 80s version and I did find it quite boring. When I watched the trailer for the new Dune film, I was mainly infested by it. Seeing that it was directed by Denis Villeneuve, I had hopes this movie would turned out well but concern that it won't do good in the box office due the global pandemic.This is the type of film to watch on the big screen for better experience. It's visually beautiful to look at, the special effects serves a purpose in the plot, and the plot does started to pick up later in the movie as it explains in more depth. I heard the story was complex to put on the big screen and the David Lynch film really didn't do its justice. This film, on the hand, really help the world building for me. This all feels like one big movie that's only the beginning with much more to explore. Hopefully, we get to see a Part 2 if this movie does well, which in my opinion was greatly masterfully directed.",Dune
322,benjamin-ensor,Great visual; appalling script,4,18 October 2021,"Everyone always said this is unfilmable and this version is no exception. The scene selection, scripting and sequences are way off. A casual user is not going to fully understand what's happening. Problem is this version allows thenselves 2 x 3 hour movies to get it right - but still fails. This is firmly on the director and not the complex story or production this time. I doubt this will actually get the part 2 promised - at least not in full cinema mode.Casting is a problem too - it's based on 'names' and they don't always fit the age/disposition etc of the characters.The production asthetics tries and blends sleek space travel with ceremonial elements of a feudal system... but ends up overdone and unrealistic - that's just... odd for 10,000 years in the future. Same problem as the 1984 version.It's a 5.",Dune
323,I_should_be_reading_a_book,The best Dune film so far but...,1,18 October 2021,"They should have titled id Dune 1/2, maybe 1/3. Will not comment on it although I must grant it's much better than the 1984 Lynch one which is appalling and even the 2000 miniseries which at least gives the Herbert book a good try. I hate --don't you?- when they drag you to a movie only to find they sold you only the first chapter?? Will rate when I get to watch the rest.",Dune
324,AlbertCinefilu,Epic. One of those movies that really make me regret I haven't finished the books.,10,24 October 2021,"As of right now I really regret not having finished the first book. Instead of buying it in my native language I bought it in English and since I'm not a native speaker, I couldn't comprehend all the subtleties of it and had to constantly look up words in the dictionary. At page 150 I gave up. And what a FOOL I was! Just by watching Villeneuve's movie I realize that the Dune universe has so many layers, it's a virtually one of the most profound epic, political and coming-of-age-story I have seen so far. I can't wait for the 2nd part, but right now I don't have the patience and enough words to describe this experience of a film... absolutely thrilling. I really need to share this ecstasy with someone else! :))",Dune
325,MovieWarfare,The director succeeds in bringing the grand scope and vision to the big screen,8,24 October 2021,"Honestly, I have not read the 1965 novel that this is based on nor the 1984 film by David Lynch. However, I am a huge fan of the director Denis Villeneuve and loved all the films he has made so far. The premise is ""Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence, only those who can conquer their own fear will survive"". So is this another hit by Denis or his first work I don't like?Let's get the obvious out the way first, Dune (2021) is a visual spectacle! The cinematography by Greig Fraser is wonderful. Every shot in Dune is gorgeous whilst also capturing the beautiful and grand nature of the otherworld planets. The costume and set department also do a wonderful job of really making it seem futuristic. Especial praise to the design of all the spaceships as they are remarkably designed. The CGI is very good as well, thankfully. Hans Zimmer of Interstellar fame does the music score for this film and it is magnificent. He uses to great effect a choir and electrical instruments that elevates every scene in the film. Dune (2021) also features a stellar cast who all do a great job in their respective role even those with little screen time. My biggest praise has got to be for Stellan Skarsgård as the Baron who is just creepy and unsettling every time he is on-screen.The story is also very intriguing and engaging. There is a political aspect throughout this series that gives a Game of Thrones vibe. There are alliances, secret agendas and backstabbing that keeps you glued to the screen. The movie also focuses a lot on world-building with the noble families, the ""voice"" power and the Fremen; a group of natives to the desert planet. All of this lore make the world of Dune feel more vibrant and unique similar to that of Lord of the Rings which managed to pull you in; Dune (2021) does the same. Denis does a great job in making all the politics and jargon stated, easy to understand for the audience. There are also a large variety of characters in the film and Denis does a phenomenal job in making it clear what their personality and agendas are. The main character, Paul Atreides played by Timothée Chalamet, has a clear character arc with the struggle of his power and him being next in line for House Atreides. Most of his story arc gets a clear resolution by the end of the film.However, Dune (2021) is a part 1 that just covers half of the book and it shows. Most movies build up to an epic 3rd act but Dune (2021) just ends midway through the 2nd act. This ends up feeling very jarring, to say the least as it doesn't end on a high note. It is also incredibly slow-paced. Since a majority of the film is dedicated to just exposition and explanation of the world; it results in a lot of moments that feel dull and sometimes boring. Additionally, the fight scenes and action scenes are serviceable but could be improved. Apart from the fight scenes with Duncan (Jason Momoa) the others are choreographed blandly and shot awkwardly as well.Overall, Dune (2021) has a lot of love and effort put towards bringing the grand vision and scope of the novel to the big screen. Every frame in this film is eye-catching thanks to the cinematography, costumes and set design that had a lot of thought put towards it. Nevertheless, it is a very slow paced movie that might deter some people from enjoying it. Despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed Dune (2021) and it was no doubt one of the most memorable Sci-fi movies to come out. It would be a crime for this to not get a sequel!",Dune
326,benprichardsdotcom,10/10 style over 06/10 substance,8,30 October 2021,"I like so many was initially wowed by what I had just watched and yet the more I pondered this reiteration of Frank Herberts novels the more I felt the initial euphoria wane. Don't be mistaken Dune is an exquisitely beautiful film and the sound is tremendous - that Hans Zimmer turned Tenet down to work on the sound of Dune is testimony to the scope and range he exercised here. I particularly loved the bagpipes.My only problem, well, my only two problems were that it felt long. I became weary of the film at about 90 minutes and despite not looking at my watch to see how long was left I noticed a few fidgeters in the packed cinema too. My other criticism is that for all its bombast and stellar cast not much happens in two hours - for all its flaws I think David Lynch has done a better adaptation. In fact watching Denis Villeneuve's Dune is like watching an adaptation of Lynch's Dune rather than the books.Also, I was semi-goading some woke friends of ours with whom we went to watch it by saying it was a yawn-fest because it's another story of the white saviour come to rescue the coloured folk. And despite my comments being fully in the realm of satire, they didn't like that kernel of truth about the narrative.",Dune
327,garethwooduk,Slow burner but a good film!,8,29 October 2021,"I don't know much about the books or previous movie but read about the story in a my movie magazine, it's a and the reviews were good, I have to agree.I liked the back story and great casting and the dystopian style like Blade Runner.Set pieces very good and use of music, being such a big story it was good it's not all crammed in one and defo worth another watch once out for release.",Dune
328,richkiel,Zero out of any number of stars.,1,13 October 2021,"First off, I have to stress that I have only seen about one half of the film. I stopped watching half-way into the film. I was going to stop watching already after about fifteen minutes, but I endured until roughly half, at which point I realised I would rather watch anything else.To say that this film is bad is to recognize it as an actual film, which it isn't. A film is a story being told through the film medium. However, I do not see a story here. Things do happen, but they seem random, incoherent, and as scenes follow one another, one does not get the impression we are being drawn into an actual story, into an actual fictional universe, with characters we care about. There is no intellectual or emotional investment on the part of the audience, because this 'film' makes it impossible. This is boring nonsense that one is incapable of relating to in any meaningful way.You know what the scenes in the film remind me of? A trailer. As if someone is showing you things and telling you that while it is all random and confusing, somewhere out there there is a movie that combines all this into a coherent whole worth watching. Action scenes and dialogue come across as footage filmed for the purpose of being used in a trailer. None of the dialogue seems to push the story forward or reveal something meaningful about the characters. Frankly, they could have all shut up and the film would have made just as little sense as it does with the dialogue.I am guessing that they are conducting a kind of social experiment, to see whether or not audiences will watch literally anything, however abysmal and lacking in meaning, let alone artistic value.Do not watch this even if someone pays for your ticket or buys you a DVD as a present. Every minute you waste watching this is a loss you don't want to suffer.",Dune
329,RetroRick,What real cinema used to feel like,9,7 November 2021,"This is mostly a really splendid movie. It makes me feel old writing this, but I don't think younger generations will quite know what it was like to go to the cinema and see an actual film. There's some great TV made these days, but movie-making has really suffered in recent years and it is a rare treat to encounter a movie that just sucks you into its world, and present a story on an (almost) epic scale.Actually it flags a bit at the end, there are some issues with the characterisation (The Duke just seems too nice for instance) but this for me is the most involving movie I've seen for a long time. It feels like something from the past, something much grander scale than what we are used to at the moment. It won't be to everybody's taste but if you allow it it will soak into you and take over a couple of hours of your life.At which point I will end this review in the konwledge I have said almost nothing about the actual narrative, about the plot or characterisation. I'll leave that to others. Suffice it to say I'm rather looking foward to the second part.",Dune
330,sujanfaster,Hopefully the beginning of something grand,8,5 November 2021,"Usually reboots and remakes of old movies are subject to a lot of criticism. But the same cannot be said about Dune considering how abysmal the first movie was which was released in 1984. Yes I did watch it although knowing about it just so that I can compare it with the new one. Denis Villeneuve comes with some reputation and he does live upto it and may have probably started another classic saga with the Dune (considering there will be more movies to follow).Dune is an adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel which I haven't read but I am guessing the readers of the novel would enjoy and relate to the movie better. One of the main reasons why Dune (1984) was hated was because of how it tried to cram the whole novel in a movie with some average visual effects. However, Villeneuve's Dune carefully goes about narrating the complexities and makes sure the audience don't feel like being bombarded with much information. I personally feel that a limited TV/Web series would do a more justification to introducing us to a whole new space universe. You can almost feel that the movie isn't gonna end anytime soon in the last 45 minutes of the movie and you are just curious as to where it would end.Dune boasts of a very powerful star cast which is a major highlight of the movie along with its superb visual effects. Having watched and loved Blade Runner 2049, I expected nothing less from Villeneuve. Timothée Chalamet fits into the role of Paul Atregdies with ease. Jason Momoa as Duncan manages to add a lot of energy to the movie. While Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Bautista and Stellan Skarsgard duly perform, it's Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem who stand out in the little screen time they have. The less I say about Zendaya's character, the better and I am not criticizing her performance, I am just avoiding spoilers.Dune (Part One - which you only see when the title rolls out) has probably set very high expectations and hopefully there is one or movie to follow setting up for a grand conclusion.",Dune
331,monberger,Grandeur!!!,10,24 October 2021,"Wow! I'm in disbelief for those few cinema critics who have given Dune bad reviews. I went to see this movie on Imax, and I have HBO Max and I decided to see it on the big screen first. After reading some of the bad reviews, they made up my mind that it was going to be a boring lousy film. Wow, again, what's wrong with these people? This movie is grandeur in all the extension of the word, it is just stupendous!!! It hasn't been a movie like this since the LOTR. DUNE is the next masterpiece. The acting, cinematography, the story, costuming, special effects, and the gorgeous musical score of Hans Zimmer is just beautiful. It is by far the best movie of 2021, and since 2003.This movie should win Oscar's best picture.",Dune
332,MajBlade2,Good start,8,24 October 2021,Havent read books since high school so dont remember more then broad outline. Seems pretty close adaptation. Went back watched the 1984 film which put way to much into one film so had to rely so much on narrative and exposition. This is another book like lord of the rings which is hard to put on film due to the nature of certain parts of the story. I thought they did a reasonable good film. Obviously they only got through the first half of the book I will definitely want to watch the next part. I think Chalamet did a better job then I expected and was more true to the book in age looks he was supposed to look young and inexperienced. Only thing I wanted to see was the weirding modules I thought they came in by this part. Also come to find out they had not even green lit the next part. Which I think is horrible they should have filmed both films at same time like the did LTR and Hobbit now it could be 2-3 years before they can get this out. They knew this was going to be a big movie they sunk tons of money into it they should have made both parts at once and frankly I could see three movies.,Dune

334,MK_Ultra_,A fresh take on a failed previous attempt,9,19 October 2021,"David Lynch could've should've...but in the end stumbled hard, in my humble opinion.Villeneuve's attempt at resurrecting the dormant Blade Runner franchise was an embarrassment, much like Lynch's shortcomings, also subjective.This film made up for it and more...in the same way that Mullholland Drive did for Lynch.Is it a perfect film? No...but for a film that was supposedly unfilmable, just the scale and scope of this film is beyond my own personal expectations. I also don't think it's a spoiler to say this is the preface of a much broader interpretation of the original Herbert Dune novel. A groundwork for a franchise perhaps, but as long as Villeneuve is onboard, sign me up.2 1/2 hours is or can be a slog for any film, but pacing and placement of scenes can improve the storytelling---so hats off to the script writers and editors to transitioning this type of multilayered yarn into a solid bit of escapism. Couple that with Zimmers excellent score and sound editing and you have a neo-scifi classic that should reel in fans of well made science fiction sagas.Bring on part deux9/10.",Dune
335,dogonlion,I dune see it!,3,27 October 2021,"I really don't see why this movie is so highly rated. It's slow, long and dark most of the time. The movie was so slow that couldn't justify watching it all at once. I found myself dozing off at times, playing word games on my phone at others. The soundtrack makes it a nice ambient background though (Thanks Hans Zimmer). The characters are not exciting, they just made the white of their eyes blue and that's it. I gave it 3 stars for the cinematography. For a movie to be so slow, why not just let it be a book? I think my imagination would have done a better job with what the characters and places look like. All the places in it look like earth and the extra terrestrials look human. There was no effort there. The acting is good but most of the actors they used to sell the movie and people were excited to see are in it for just a few minutes. Like Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin. Zendaya still has the same one facial expression she has in anything she's in. I guess the key to the success of this movie is a massive marketing campaign and it worked.

339,PerryAtTheMovies,A very engaging film.....,9,26 October 2021,"My Rating: 95/100 (9/10)I want to say to start off that I wish I had the finesse to describe how incredible this film was. It blended a lot of sci-fi culture with some not so sci-fi culture. The music and visuals were incredible alongside the great acting. Now....This was such an incredible film! I felt so many emotions. The pacing was great. I didn't realize how fast time had gone until the beginning was the end. While there was a lot going on the cinematography was incredible. The soundtrack truly tied the whole film together.As a whole, this film felt like ""Star Wars"" on steroids mixed in with a little ""Star Trek"", ""300"", and any war movie involving helicopters.The characters were likeable and hate-able. Acting was a key ingredient to the greatness of this movie. While no actor stuck out specifically, I found that they all did a great job to convey an emotional foundation to the success of the story. It was fun to see Jason Mamoa and super awkward to see him without a beard. The chemistry was good amongst characters that interacted with each other.Overall, more than one watch may be needed to fully appreciate what's happened over the two hour story timeframe because there is a lot to take in, but this is a must see for sure. This is one of the greatest films in 2021. I saw it in IMAX 3D, but I think this film would be as good in 2D IMAX.",Dune
340,pronitmallick,Aesthetic Feel,8,29 October 2021,"DUNE is a movie that begins its adventure like an aesthetic sunrise on the horizon. From the very first minutes the screenplay and the story itself makes us stick to the seat. Director Denis Villeneuve has successfully and beautifully adapted the pages onto the screen by making a really good presentation and the world building around it. All the actors in the movie have packed enough punch behind their development to quench our thirst to the fullest. The editing, transition, VFX and the main spice music has blended everything together like fine wine. The pacing may seem a little slow but it settles down perfectly later on and makes us thirsty for more story from the sands of dune. In the end it's a film that everyone should check out for not just once but as many times as one can.",Dune
341,marveller-66,Well.....,8,28 October 2021,"Maybe it's because i haven't read the book, this was not at all what i was expecting. Mostly, a supernatural fantasy movie with impeccable visuals and cinematography. This is no SCI-FI movie, i guarantee you that much. Having seen Villeneuve's 3 movies, PRISONERS, ARRIVAL & BLADE RUNNER, i find Dune to be the weakest. But i'm hopeful that part 2 would rearrange by opinions.Overall - 7.9/10.",Dune
342,WKYanks,So much better than the 1984 version...,10,6 November 2021,"Finally, a Dune movie that has time to breathe and settle in.I was gripped the entire run.All actors are outstanding and all characters are very well represented.It's an EPIC SCI-FI movie. Visually beautiful with a wonderful score.I'm confident that part II will give this epic story everything it deserves.Bravo!!",Dune
343,J-bot6,"The 1984 film is better. ""And how can this be?""",6,23 October 2021,"Let's start with what's good about the 2021 film: The vehicles and the sense of scale. Both are well done.And now for the weaker points....This film features no emperor, no Feyd, no Guild Navigator, almost no intrigue, and no sense of impending doom. Mentats and the Guild were played down to almost being non-existent.The big bad Sardaukar army in this new version of Dune are wimpy compared to their portrayal in the 1984 film. The taking of house Atreides is over in a flash and the battle scenes throughout the film are weak (unless you count the one big explosion during the siege).Despite the Baron's homage to Colonel Kurtz, the Harkonnens are like pussycats compared to the debased psychos from Lynch's 1984 film. As a result, they don't present nearly the level of threat or stress to the heroes. The sense of terror, disgust, despair, and intimidation that existed in the 1984 film is missing here. Adding to this are that most of the actors seemed to be sleep-walking through their roles in this 2021 film. It appears that only Jason Momoa and the warrior that Paul kills near the end of the film were really trying.The 'hand in the box' sequence failed to really convey the dire situation that Paul was in. Compare this to the horror and intensity of that same scene in the 1984 film. Other details like the personal (Holtzman) shield were more effectively conveyed in the 1984 film. Something halfway between what was shown in the two films might have been more appropriate.Casting: Well, there's just no comparison for the most part. The casting in the 1984 film eclipses that of the new movie (especially for characters like Gurney Halleck, Dr. Kynes, Chani, and IMHO, the Baron). I prefer Kyle MacLachlan's portrayal of Paul, but I understand that Chamalet is closer to the age of the character in the book, so I guess that evens out. As for the Duke, both actors did a good job, but if I had to choose, I'd say Jürgen Prochnow for the win.The musical score for the 2021 film is forgettable whereas the 1984 score is epic and features numerous strong hooks and a lot of variety. Sound design in the 1984 film is also stronger. It's a mystery as to why so many 80s films have stronger sound design than recent films, considering that we can now work with digital tracks, rather than cutting and splicing tape.Editing for this new film is slow and plodding (and also much less complex than the 1984 film). Edits in Lynch's theatrical cut are all there for a specific reason (to convey necessary information to the audience -- much of it visual). The 2021 film has a number of scenes that could have been cut since they're not essential to the plot and they don't convey enough atmosphere to really contribute to the sense of world-building.Pacing: Again, the 1984 theatrical cut of Lynch's Dune wins again. Pacing in the 2021 film is slow and plodding (and this is coming from someone who likes a good, slow, atmospheric film). The three-quarter mark is so uninteresting that I actually started to look at the clock.I would also give the 1984 film the advantage of having a proper resolution, but I understand that this new movie is just a segment of an arc. So I'll leave that be.Hopefully, the actors for these new films turn out to be a bit more endearing so that the audience can become more invested in them. That would certainly help the scenes that are to come.Again, there's no doubt that this new film is a great effort. It just feels a bit flat and suffers from some issues with conveying important information about characters and motives.So, ultimately, this 2021 film is worth a look, closer to the book, and features some nice ground and air vehicle designs. Just don't expect to get emotionally involved in it to any significant degree.",Dune

I seriously can't understand what you would rather have. I find your criticisms mind boggling... Did we see the same movie?Anyone with even a little bit of good taste will see this movie for what it truly is. It is an incredible cinematic achievement with a truly epic scale. Wow. I highly recommend seeing it in Atmos on the biggest screen you can find. I love this movie.",Dune
345,jcooloti,Incredibly good. The epic we all deserve.,10,26 October 2021,"I am a huge fan of the novel. I think Lynch's film is sort of a bad joke... (it's confusing to someone who hasn't read the book, silly looking, has a silly soundtrack, and just overall terrible)Looking on IMDB at these user reviews, I'm seeing some mind boggling negative reviews. Are these reviews an attempt at being edgy? Did we watch the same movie? Seriously, what do these negative reviews set out to accomplish?!? If you can't recognize this film as being absolutely AMAZING, stunningly BEAUTIFUL, and extremely well cast and brilliantly PERFORMED... then you must be under the influences of some really terrible drug or in a really bad mood or something. This film is truly PHENOMENAL, and it doesn't take a scholar to recognize this. I truly don't understand how anyone could ask for anything different... it DELIVERS. Plain and simple. It simply ROCKS.The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in film... it carries the movie so well, and is so incredibly EPIC. The bagpipes mixed with the vocal... the dark chord changes... it's BRUTAL and amazing. It has such an amazing darkness to it that most epic soundtracks are afraid to explore. This makes it unique and totally engaging. When paired with the STUNNING cinematography, one can't help let their jaw drop.Some things have been omitted from the movie because it is an ADAPTATION (not a remake!) of a book. You cannot make a movie that is shot for shot every part of Frank Herbert's novel. It just isn't going to work cinematically. I must say, it's a truly remarkable adaptation that is so faithful and respectful to the book. This film was obviously made by a huge fan, and it HONORS a brilliant sci-fi novel in the best way. Again. THIS IS NOT A REMAKE OF DAVID LYNCH'S TRAINWRECK OF A FILM. This is a fresh adaptation. One that had my wife (who is completely oblivious to the book and it's lore and mythos) in a complete understanding of Dune's story and world. That is NOT EASY, and the screenwriters should be recognized for their brilliant adaptation.I have to hand it to this entire cast. Everyone is cast so well. Timoth Chalamet as Paul knocks it out of the park. That kid is FANTASTIC in his portrayal of a deeply conflicted protagonist, and it's obvious he truly understands the complex character he is playing. What a great job. I still can't believe such a skinny kid was able to come across like such a powerful being at times. That boy has a great face that really says a lot, even when he's not speaking. I also loved Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Leto. He just oozes authority and nobility, while also conveying so well an underlying sadness knowing he is utterly doomed. Dave Bautista as Glassu... WOW. This guy is horrifying... I actually found him to be even more scary than the Baron. This guy was born to play the part and is totally amazing in the minimal screen time he had. I'm looking forward to seeing him in the sequel. Josh Brolin is perfectly cast as Halleck. I also can't wait to get more of him. Javier Braden as Stilgar... perfect casting here. Slam dunk. Amazing actor. Cool character. Bingo. Which brings me to Rebecca. Furguson as lady Jessica. She's fantastic. I will say that she brought a humanity to character I had never really imagined while reading the novel, and she does it very well. Very cool stuff. Everyone else was also great, but I wanted to specifically bring up these actors because they were my personal favorites.I serious find this movie to be an absolute masterpiece. I cannot wait to see more from Denis Villeneuve, who in my opinion, is one of the greatest living directors right now. This man truly knows how to direct an epic film. I hope to see more Dune movies from him as well as other great works. This man deserves all the praise and hopefully big Hollywood will continue to throw him huge budgets because he is really delivering here. This sets a whole new bar in my opinion. We need more film makers like Denis making beautiful high budget films. Great job! Amazing movie! I'm so happy to see it on the big screen. It's truly inspiring. Keep up the good work.",Dune
346,tmansreviews,Truly epic... First half of a movie,7,20 October 2021,"Villeneuve delivers a thrilling sci-fi epic, following House Atreides after the Emperor demands they take control of the dangerous and contested spice planet, Arrakis. Chalamet is a natural lead, but Stellan Skarsgard's portrayal of Baron Harkonnen is particularly menacing! The direction and score are equally great, but the lack of resolution is a glaring flaw. I understand wanting to leave your audience ""wanting more"" but this is taking it a bit far..",Dune
347,josenelias,Very disappointing,5,7 November 2021,"It's impossible not to compare this film with the book and the previous 1984 movie and in both cases it fails miserably. Apart from the special effects allowed by current technology, there are few redeeming qualities.Almost all actors severely lack charisma for the parts they act. The exceptions are Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho and Dave Bautista as Beast Rabban Harkonnen. These two are great in their parts although with little screen time and much better than the 1984 version.Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides and Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen are ok. But Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides is irrelevant.But when we go to characters like Thufir Hawat, Dr. Wellington Yueh, Reverend Mother Mohiam. Piter de Vries, Shadout Mapes and especially Dr. Liet Kynes they are a shadow of the 1984 actors. No charisma, presence or intensity.The worst is Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides. The acting is a snooze-fest. Paul Atreides looks like he never had a good night sleep and just drags around. Completely uninspired and uninspiring.The 1984 version is far from perfect, but it transmitted a epic feeling, with strong characters and actors. This version even leave out some major lines of the book used in 1984 version, the vision sequences are bad and lack transmitting the background story of the universe where the story occurs apart a few comments.It's just too much style and little content. Very disappointing.",Dune
348,kismit,Some incredible moments,9,25 October 2021,The CGI was fantastic and I loved the casting once I was able to adjust for the physical maturity of the new vs old Paul Atreides. I miss Feyd but he really wasn't a plot driver in the Lynch version either and part 2 isn't done yet so who knows?To me this seems like a big upgrade in almost every area to the Lynch film and I liked that film too. My real issue is they should have #2 shot already and ready to go next summer but I guess Covid had them gun shy of the commitment.Cant wait for part 2. A standout SF film when we really needed one.,Dune

350,hiraishinnojutsu,Two and a half hours felt like just an hour,8,24 October 2021,"And guess what, I watched it on my smartphone, not some IMAX theater where it'd be undoubtedly the best way to experience it, because this movie is not about the story or the plot, it's also about world-building, philosophy, score, cinematography, and the best colossal starships CGI you can get. So far the only problem I have that it should've been made as a miniseries/tv series with the same quality of production so it may gives time and space for audiences to be invested in each of the main characters and, not less importantly, the world they live in as it is told and described in the novel. Denis definitely didn't waste away the big names of the casts, they fit and play their roles pretty good, but sorry to say I still can't accept his absurd reasoning of gender/race-swapping one of the most important characters, well maybe it's not entirely his fault, it's hollywood's.

Big questions like the exact origins of Paul's powers and the extent of ""The voice"", and whether the future will play out as he see's it is still unanswered (as expected). Many characters died just as early as they were introduced causing their deaths to have little significance. Other than that it's an ok movie.",Dune

The action is exciting and raw and the relationships between the characters are realistic. I'll admit the movie did lose me at some parts but if you really pay attention, everything will make sense. This movie is slow-paced and I kinda like that about it, it probably should have been a show instead of a movie so the pacing would be better.I do recommend that you watch this movie if you like an action packed mystery.

He looked emo and that was about it. No charisma and no acting chops.Way too much CGI and wayyyyyy too much desire to be either a branch of the MCU series or the Star Wars mythologies. It felt rather desperate about these desires.Oh, the soundtrack was abysmal.",Dune
356,rchosen-193-5535,"Beautiful, majestic, epic masterpiece with one minor issue.",9,30 October 2021,"I can admit that I never liked the original Dune movie and never got into the novel. So when I seen the trailer for this new one I really had no interest in it. But none the less I went to see it. Especially with claims that ""This is better then Star Wars and Lord of the Rings!""Well, they were mostly right it seems. Despite how much I love those two series, this Dune was just an epic movie. The graphics, scenery, outfits...etc were downright beautiful. The music was amazing. The story was well done. The acting was great. It's rare that I find myself watching a movie so intently that I say nothing through the movie. I was sucked into this really quick and never wanted it to end. I can see this will be winning some Oscars easily.Now despite my 9 out of 10 rating, the one thing Dune does that seems to have many struggling with it is the lore. Unless you have read the novel or seen the first movie, you may be confused about everything. The movie doesn't really build up the lore or explain much. You are just thrown into the movie and not really given any time to take in what is going on.Which in some ways is why I love it. You feel drawn into the story as if you are there taking part in it. Even if you don't know what is always going on, your emotions are always revved up for whatever happens next.So am I saying this is the best movie ever? Nope. But its pretty darn close. And if part two does things right, it could be my perhaps my favorite series. Again, I hated Dune before hand. I'd urge people who see this to pay attention to everything said and done. Don't spend to much time overthinking what you see going on. Just roll with what happens and get swept up in the journey.",Dune

Too much time spent on irrelevant scenes, like a ship landing or watering the palms and little to explain the relation between houses, Bene Gesserit or Tleilaxu. Chani has modest time in the books here is on the spot from the first scene. They couldn't reenact the fight with shields, is the same as without. Knives are swords, fremen were supposed to look like arabs but, for the sake of the times, they are black, hindu, whites. The floating device of the baron, hilarious as the poison tooth scene. The desert, the heat does not seem to be affecting the protagonist as in the books, so the importance of water seem rather a religious thing than a need. The battle for Dune was too much, way too much. Apart from these they pretty much nailed the important scenes and plots in the book, maybe not the gom jabbar, I couldn't understand the pain.",Dune

362,blackoutH,What science fiction should be,10,31 October 2021,"This was exactly the experience I was looking for while returning to a movie theater, visually stunning, griping, dark, meaningful accompanied by a daunting soundtrack, there's nothing more to ask from a Sci-Fi movie.Based on the 1965 novel with the same name, the passion of the director Dennis for this story, is clearly felt on the screen, the set design, production design and overall cinematography is breath taking, this associated with the masterful soundtrack and sound effects - brings to life this stunning world that is a complete fantasy yet it feels somehow very real.The ensemble that was put together seems to fit each role perfectly, Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson as co-leads of the story are impeccable, but every other secondary character feels no less important and its role on this massive plot seems organic and connected to the overall story.Given the limited time a movie can have, I don't feel at all that this was a rushed experience, you might not be able to explore all the dimensions of the entire list of characters, and sure enough some elements of the plot might fetch that old and familiar over explored concept of good vs evil, however contrary to most science fiction blockbusters (including the one that ""took inspiration"" from Dune), you do grasp that grey area or three dimensional field that audiences crave so much (and rightfully so) these days.This is just the first part, but you can clearly see individuals with some internal struggles, and for a lot of them there will be room for character development in the upcoming sequel(s) and some hints were dropped that not everything is what it seems.I felt dawned to the story the entire time, it's the way it's directed and the creative world that was put together that has this magnetism, and of course it goes without saying that the parallels with the real world (even today almost 60 years after the original story) are as scary as they are accurate - this is the other major factor that a Sci-Fi strives on, being a metaphor for our real life experiences and Dune has done this beautifully.Even the way all the cultures and different world inhabitants were portrayed, with what seems to have been a multi cultural inspiration not only in the locations, but also the music and the actors, brilliant all around.",Dune
363,samratsingraur,Greatest cinematic experience of my life.,10,19 September 2021,"What we are witnessing is the birth of a mythical cinematographic saga which differs from the pretentious blockbuster sagas by its depth. Denis is a genius and he was able and knew how to take the time to set up a universe this astonishing and beautiful. The worldbuilding I just so perfect that it seems entering a real historical event in another universe. And for the aspect, the shots are grandios, magnificent landscapes which transcribe the atmosphere of Dune so well. The storytelling is done wonderfully. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is so surreal that it accentuates every aspect of this complex mystical universe. The performances are incredible. An excellent casting indeed especially Timothée as Paul.Dune is not just a sci-fi movie. It's an art. An art that needs to be witnessed. It's exactly what cinemas are made for.

364,IndridC0ld,God how awful,2,29 September 2021,"I'll admit, I saw this movie for free, but only that fact keeps me from giving this movie one star. Where do I begin? Well, let's start with something that is ever present in this film, the most ponderous and headache inducing score in the last ten years. Overloaded with deep base, it wears on the viewer like a necktie pulled too tight. As is so common today, if your ears are more than forty years old, the dialog is so muffled by the soundtrack and special effects that you'd better have a good idea of what the story is about. Having seen the, in my opinion, superior 1984 film, I could easily follow the plot.What is disappointing is the real lack of surprise or originality added to the film. It may be a more faithful telling of Frank Herbert's story, but that doesn't make it more enjoyable. The characters are dull and cartoonish. The rendition of The Baron Harkonen is nothing but a carnival fat man. I could go to Texas and see the same thing at any all you can eat buffet. The 1984 Barron was magnificently evil, and disgusting. A truly memorable performance. The new film shows no dramatic creativity. No nuance. We don't even get to see the Space Navigators at all. While we're at it, let's talk about the Paul Attrades character. The first thing that comes to mind is the title character in the movie Edward Sissorhands. His makeup, facial expressions (of which an upturned right lip seems to be his maximum effort) are just boring. I did enjoy the performance of the actress who played the shaddat mapes. She was the most interesting of all. All the other characters in this film, just look like dusty unimaginative and uninspired bit players. This film is just a bathing suit full of sand.",Dune

366,wolfghostninja,Disappointed.,5,25 October 2021,"Book fan here. The first thing I will say is that if you have not read the books, this will be an enjoyable cinematic experience and you should watch it. It is a pretty decent adaptation, but is almost a complete remake of Lynch's version, both exclude the same key aspects of the books and both films are poorer for that decision.The music is excellent (Hans Zimmer), and the cinematography (Greg Fraser) is sumptuous, but Herbert's Dune has been around for 40 years and in that time other Science Fiction has borrowed from Dune, and so a lot of the essence of this production doesn't feel fresh. The costumes in particular look plastic and generic.I wasn't a fan of the cast, but then I had felt the same way about the cast in Blade Runner 2049, and that film is one of the best movies I have ever seen, so Villeneuve had earned my trust. Unfortunately, the casting is a problem here and so is the character development, the world-building, and the writing.The Cast: Chalamet, Zendaya, and Robinson and Momoa are all miscast. Robinson in particular.Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is one of the best characters in the books, a member of a pseudo-religious sect called the Bene Gesserit - highly trained observers of body language to the point where they are accused of being witches, but in the film, the Bene Gesserit are brushed under the carpet and the character of Jessica is not portrayed as a formidable entity, but rather as weak and fearful.Momoa's character Idaho is supposed to be lithe and slender - because his agility and speed make him a deadly swordsman, not his strength and size.Zendaya is under-written and under developed, with one too many ""staring into the distance"" shots. It reminded me of an epic perfume commercial at times.Chalamet is just a passenger, and the whispering was an awkward creative choice.But....there are really only two reasons I didn't enjoy this adaptation. First, it is PG 13. Why?!!! Herbert's books are truly otherworldly, violent, brutal, cruel and sexual. Where was the Spice orgy? Or the hints at incest? Even the knife fights were sanitized. The Lord of the Rings were books written for young children, Dune was written for adults, but this film was aimed at a younger audience.Second, the world building was poor. The Bene Gesserit are one of the most interesting aspects of the books - a pseudo-religious sect steeped in psychology and genetic manipulation. They are almost witch-like, and crucial to the world-building of the books, but are underdeveloped in this adaptation.Should have been a TV series, not squeezed into a 3 hour film.",Dune

Other then the astounding cinematography and aesthetics, Hans Zimmer's mastery at composing sound environments that evoke the closest feeling to an out of body experience is beyond words.

369,caramia2002,Rather Watch the 1984 Dune,1,24 September 2021,"Which is no high praise for that version, but I'd watch it 10 times over this poor excuse for a Dune film (or any film). Don't believe the 10* shill reviews here (per usual, why doesn't IMDB do something about this; it's a huge problem), this is a real $165mil clunker. Yet another film in the current tradition of pure hype, throw money, have blockbuster, that Hollywood has become. This is such a disappointment. As someone who has read the books several times and a huge fan, uuuughhhh. It's really slow, been done before, and no real ending. I presume there will be sequels? I can see a lot of movie goers will be upset, esp after sitting through a terrible film, then no ending. And it's not always faithful to the books, in ways which don't add anything or move the film forward. And no Feyd!For faithful fans, the gold standard is the 2000-2003 Sy-Fy miniseries, which covers the 3 books. The effects are done on a TV budget, but the worms, palaces, and other sets are top notch. It is very faithful to the books while being well paced and absorbing. I own this set and have watched it many times over the years. With William Hurt, Susan Sarandon, Saskia Reeves, Ian McNeice, and Alec Newman, it's a top notch cast and the acting is great. Wonderful character creation by all involved.Conversely, the acting in this one is terrible and for some reason, a lot of yelling is involved. Timothée Chalamet is a very lackluster Paul Atreides and gives his usual childish performance. Oscar Isaac is not even effective as Duke Leto, and if Isaac is not good, then there are very deep problems with this film. Rebecca Ferguson rounds out the film as Lady Jessica, but she, too, is just so lackluster. These 3 have the bulk of the film, so the advertised actors are pretty much cameos, as the bait and switch by the studio.The effects and sets are unimaginative and have nothing new to show. The ships are ho-hum and don't seem like what Herbert described, and I never really saw the worm (will take a lot to beat the worms in 1984 and 2000 versions). I did fall asleep towards the end, so maybe I didn't catch the full worm. Even the Freemen blue eyes are terrible, for which there is no excuse. They use some horrible gray digital grading that just sucks the little life that there is out of this college project (and not even good for that). The desert is NOT gray! Plus the outdoor scene of the Atreides green home planet is not green.I can't believe that in 2021 they couldn't do a better job for a whopping budget of $165mil? This is a travesty of gigantic proportion! I doubt they will recover the budget and don't deserve to. Just no excuse. You have been warned. At least stay home and watch it on HBO, if you subscribe, rather than risk going to the theater and spending so much. Trust me, it's not worth it. This is the worst film of 2021 I have seen. Didn't help that I watched the gorgeous Foundation premiere right before...",Dune

371,chris-h-3,Definitely half a film,6,18 October 2021,"The film opens a little clunky with two separate pieces of natation from different sources but there is a lot to set up, in fact the first hour of the film is largely used to set up who is who.The sets, world building, costumes and cast are all fantastic although, given the large nature of the story, non of the characters get a lot of individual screen time or much development. I'm guessing its quite a faithful adaptation hence trying to fit everything in. At times it still feels like you are missing out on parts of the story or what x and so it not as involving as it could be.There are a lot of space ships going up or down in slow motion from lots of different angles and also too many dream sequences for me, I get they have a part in the story but they did drag on and, at times, they felt out of place like they'd come from a different YA movie. Also the music seemed unoriginal and at times it was plain irritating, you get to thinking how many more times will the ominous drone play during this scene.I enjoyed it more than this directors other films, which I've all found a bit disappointing. I'm still not a fan of the editing and there are shots that linger, or cut to another angle at the end of scenes which seem pointless and don't add anything, probably why this is such a long film.I'm surprised at all the enthusiastic reviews given there isn't a lot of action in the film and the story is only set up in this one. Its a slightly frustrating watch when you have all this build up and then no ending.It seems a strange/old fashioned way to make a film to make a part one and then hope you get to make a part two, and to expect the audience to enthusiastically wait 2/3 years to watch it. Would have made more sense to make it as a three part tv mini series I think.Did I enjoy it, yes. Mostly. Am I excited to wait another two years to watch the rest of it, meh.",Dune
372,omarcantbestopped,False Messiah,5,20 October 2021,"I've never read the books or seen the original but like a lot of you I agree and appreciate the Sci-fi genre and what Mr. Villeneuve did especially with set pieces were incredible and out of this world.Now I am not saying that Timothee Chalamet can't act but he did not show any emotions at all but one scene...I mean I didn't connect with his character at all and why does he or Hollywood always wanna make him The King, The Savior the false Messiah in a lot of his movies. That need to stop like YESTERDAY.The rest of cast were awesome aside from him and Zendaya didn't care for maybe more in the sequel.",Dune

Great visual and audio-effects.I'm on-board the hypetrain for the sequels.Definitely my movie of the year.

The acting, cinematography, score is beautiful and it's an adaptation many of us were looking forward too.But the works it's based on are so expansive that it just doesn't fit movie format. I'd rather have seen book 1 as a 10 or more x 1 hour TV-season. My only other issue is Jason Momoa. I don't mind him as an actor but he wasn't the right fit for this role, in my humble opinion.Overall great film but, given how long we'll have to wait for the continuation, I would've preferred it as a tv show.",Dune

Basically, an uninteresting little fella goes to check out a desert. Visually, the movie is deplorable and difficult to watch - dark, blurry, dusty, smoky, no colour, very ugly. Keep some pain killers handy for the eye strain. There is no memorable dialogue here. The acting is mediocre and none of the characters will captivate your attention.

377,severindringel,A film heading to be a Sci-Fi-Classic,9,22 September 2021,"That Denis Villeneuve has mastered the sci-fi-genre like no other has been known at least since Arrival. Accordingly, my expectations were high for his heart project Dune, originally a famous book that Villeneuve has loved since childhood and which, after years of delay, has now made its way to the big screen. Villeneuve is a great champion of cinema in danger of extinction - and what he already brought with Blade Runner 2049, he delivers this time on an even more extreme scale: a MOVIE FOR CINEMA.Since I see Dune as a potential saviour of cinema, it is more important this time to write about the film per se and not its actors and characters. These should be familiar to most beforehand anyway - both as book connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs. Because even though Villeneuve again relies on his tried-and-tested visual exposition, some prior knowledge of the family homes, rivalries and distribution of roles is certainly not a disadvantage. Therefore, rule number 1: roughly memorise the premise in order to be able to follow the plot comprehensively. As for the actors, it remains to be said that they all put on their absolute A-game. Timothee Chalamet shows that he can dominate blockbusters at a young age, although he is not the best despite a bravura performance. Namely, that's Rebecca Ferguson in the role of his mother, who pretty much downplays all emotional facets. All except joy, because no one really feels that in Dune. Now and then there are pseudo-funny one liners, but they are always overshadowed by the fundamentally dystopian and catastrophic atmosphere. This is just as well, because Villeneuve is not exactly known for making humorous and positive films. So, rule number 2: don't expect any fast-moving fireworks of words. What Dune definitely is is an audiovisual masterpiece display that you only get to see in this form every few years. Watching this film at home would almost be a betrayal. Such a feat does not deserve this act of cosiness; here the cinematic experience has monopoly. From the very first second, we are accompanied by elongated shots of the sky, high-tech headquarters and desert dunes. These left such an impression on me that after the credits I was at a loss for words and my legs were shaking. Rule number 3: Go into the film as relaxed as possible, because you won't get that feeling again so quickly afterwards.This guide on how to approach Dune properly is necessary to fully engage with the film. Otherwise, it could be complicated to get excited about it. Sure, the images should impress everyone, because this is where Dune is truly unique. The narrative style, however, is something that personally keeps me from giving Villeneuve's childhood dream the highest possible rating. In fact, I expected the film to be even more sedate and wordless, so in that respect I was pleasantly surprised after quite a few dialogues in the first half. Of course, Dune is not a film that needs many words, since its visuality speaks for itself anyway. Towards the end, however, I occasionally had the feeling that it didn't quite know when it wanted to end. Lethargic scenes suggesting that the film was now over were still followed by surprising twists. But that is a minimal criticism of what is, in my opinion, the ultimate revelation for cinema and metaphorical narrative structure.",Dune
378,sanjidparvez,Felt like a pilot episode for a long running series,7,19 October 2021,"As an introductory installment to Frank Herbert's epic saga, his massive world of Dune, needless to say Denis Villeneuve done his primary objective successfully. It clearly makes lots of promises with stunning audio-visual spectacles and A-list star cast but I'm not sure whether another 3-hour long movie would do justice to its original source material properly. This sort of epic stories epic stories ( i.e. Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings) fueled with politics, conspiracy, moral dilemma with conflicts and rise & fall of a hero or a villainous figure... need time & events to establish the characters, plot & sub-plots with their own fantastical elements.The characters were introduced here nicely but I think it may require few additional touches to grow on you. Hope the characters will land on their foot properly with lasting impacts in the next part (specially Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides) but when the scale is so large I was hoping to get more strong build up this time.Overall, felt like a pilot episode for a possible long running series or at least 4-part miniseries or quadrilogy.Rebecca Ferguson as as Lady Jessica Atreides and Stellan Skargard as Baron was the star of this show for me. They shined on their respective roles near perfectly. Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto also fits in their part but in limited capacity.",Dune
379,verminhater,Abysmal sound ruined the film,5,6 November 2021,Yet another big film with totally abysmal sound. I presume they mix the sound for a modern cinema and stick two fingers up to anyone in an older one. Ridiculous whispering followed by ear shattering music. I struggled to hear what was going on and of course that utterly ruined the film. This has sadly become an all too common experience. Having made it to the end I then find there's more film still to be released as this certainly didn't tell the full story. Maybe the fanboys already knew this but I didn't and felt aggrieved by it.On the plus side the sets were fantastic as were the effects and a lot of money was well spent.The original film was a poor effort and whilst I suspect this version was better you'll have to ask someone who could actually hear it for that comparison.,Dune

Ready for part 2. This rating might be higher once the second part reveals more of the plot.Debated for a while if it is a 7.9 or more than an 8.

383,FabledGentleman,DUNE - A Great Modern Sci-Fi,9,13 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible for decades, to write and direct a faithful adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. And I'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. And to this day, it's one of the best stories I've ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn't enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than Lynch ever could. But on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.From reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. It's kind of how they did it with ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy.But, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. I've seen it in IMAX twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. It's epic in every meaning of the word. And all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.The actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn't get enough screen time.This movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second IMAX viewing, i felt that Villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. But that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could've dived deeper into the lore. Two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. And with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.But that being said, I had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. I've been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. And still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made DUNE. It's finally here, it's gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it's two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it's still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic CGI and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. It's most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. We need part 2, we need it badly. This story deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template.",Dune

391,sackofwhine,See it on the big screen,7,15 September 2021,"There's no question: this is an epic film. You rarely get to see movies that look and sound like this, only a handful of films archive the kind of technical superiority showcased in Villeneuves latest. And yet, it saddens me to admit that though I was blown away by grandiose scale and vision in Dune, it lacked a core element that Villeneuves other massive Blockbuster from four years ago had: Blade Runner 2049 had a thematic substance and clarity that was both gripping and emotionally complex simultaneously. Dune Part 1 on the other hand, does not. Plus, as impressive as the formalism in Dune is, 2049 also triumphed in that department.With Dune I often felt zoned out from the feudalistic family affairs, the expository dialogue and namedropping of worlds, characters and substances that all sounded so interchangeable. I can't really hold this against the film since it comes with the constraints of an adaptation, but somehow I never had the problem with other epics such as Lord of the Rings.With all that being said, the basic story is pretty straightforward and enjoyable. This is due to Villeneuves elegant pacing and Greig Frasers eye for scope. I never felt like the film dragged on for too long, because there is always something stunning going on in the frame and you get lost in the anachronistic-futurism mise-en-scene. Theres images in this right out of dystopian-anxiety artworks.All that is left to say: Bring on Part 2!",Dune

393,majic-5,Dune done right,9,22 October 2021,"Most recorded entertainment is only worth half my attention these days, which is why I keep my phone in my hands as I watch. Fifteen minutes into this movie, I set my phone down and left if there for the remainder of the film. The cinematography and CG work, which employed hundreds of workers (judging by the credits), were better than flawless - they greatly contributed to the movie, and I'm grateful to the entire cast and crew for filming in the deadly hot seasons in Jordan to give us this level of realism.Chalamet's performance was a revelation. I am unfamiliar with his slim career to date, but he sold the idea that, as his film father said, great leaders do not seek to lead, they are called - then answer.Isaac does a fine job creating a believable bond with his film son. I truly believed the famous moment when he told Paul that all he ever needed him to be was his son. I also bought his basic decency as a man.The only weak part was the role of Lady Jessica. Given her training, the director should've instructed Ferguson to play her as a more confident woman rather than one who seems rattled by every challenge.I'm very glad that the director and the film production co. Decided that Herbert's book needed to be multiple films. I thought the same ever since the first attempt to adapt the sprawling novel. I'm eagerly awaiting the second film.",Dune
394,johnslegers,"Great start of a multi-part story, flawed as a standalone movie",7,25 October 2021,"Dune is a great start of a multi-part story. But in my opinion, it fails to impress as a standalone movie. After an early climax, the movie's pacing slows down to a point where I started losing interest, only for the movie to end just when it was starting to get interesting again... which IMO was a missed opportunity.I also think the movie would have been better had less screentime been spent on the rather repetitive vision / dream sequences of Paul and more screentime been spent on exploring the motivations, strategy & ""culture"" of the Harkonnen. Those vision / dream sequences add little of value to the story, really, and just drag out the pacing. Meanwhile, the Harkonnen haven't been nearly fleshed out enough to be convincing as the evil, depraved, hyperrich ""supervillains"" they're supposed to be.",Dune
395,Instant_Palmer,Dune's Director Denis Villeneuve is the antithesis of Ridley Scott,6,25 October 2021,"I'm not convinced Denis understands the concept of using ""story-boards"". This is a pattern in his movies. Most notably Blade Runner 2049 that makes 'Dune' seem briskly paced in comparison.However, 'Dune' still plods along too slowly for my taste - it seems self-indulgent, but I suppose this episode is going to be the basis for a franchise, and Denis seems obsessed with capturing every nuance of each character's thoughts multiple times in every scene so we absolutely understand/get the storyline.Valiant attempt to stay faithful to Herbert's book aside, movies require a pacing that enthralls the audience to keep ""turning the pages"". I was planning when to take breaks instead. Once you have me, try ending it on a high note...then go to the next scene please - the rest is overkill and detracts from the scene - frankly, it's a bit condescending that Denis thinks we need all the detail of every expression multiple times to understand the scene - we usually get it on the first look, and ""less is almost always more"" (more engaging, more interesting, and more effective).It has been decades since I read 'Dune', and there are too many scenes where I got lost. E.g. 1:10 - 1:20 marks in the film... Intentionally mysterious, filling in some narrative details would help without ruining the suspense. It is this type of decision-making by Denis that influences me to lower my rating. It just doesn't work at all in film.This first installment of Dune would have earned a 9 with more prudent editing and narrative fill - I realize it ""sets the foundation of this world"", and Part II will be more of a ""spectacle"" and ""pure fun"", but perhaps a reverse Director's Cut shorter version could be put together just to see how much fun THIS episode could be, and allowing some more story transparency.Apparently, it is a difficult challenge to transfer Herbert's writing to film. But given the budget of this film version, Denis could have used those resources on outside writing edits. Instead, Denis takes the film into critical battle mode instead of fundamental story telling mode - I suppose this makes an effective cover-up for screenwriting deficits. The script does not meet expectationsSimilar at times to BR2049, Dune suffers from dreariness and ploddingly slow pacing. BR2049 is much worse than Due, but what took 2.5 in this film could have been more interesting at 2 hours flat.For the lapse in consistently lacking screenwriting prowess, and tedious pacing, the film earns a 6.5 from me, and I'm NOT rounding this one up, so it's a 6 - still a passing/watchable (barely) rating by my conservative ""grade scale"" standards, but a disappointment overall.I frankly expected this after BL2049, but hoped Denis would change things up for Dune. He did not. Dune is a much better film than BR2049 which is at times unwatchable.On a positive note, Grieg Fraser's dark moody cinematography deserves praise and was the most impressive element of 'Dune' - Bravo Mate! 👏Looking forward to the next installment of Dune which Denis says will be ""pure fun"" now that the story's foundation has been laid. Hoping (vs expecting) better book to screen adapting, and more engaging pacing in part II.""THERE'S the power""""It's only the beginning""....",Dune

I couldnt take my eyes off for just a second. There were occassions when I felt the motions were real. That beckons great direction at work. The background tracks were suspenseful. It raises the desire to predict the next scene. This makes the audience to feel uneasy in their seats. Also, I will use flamboyance to qualify the exceptional wardrobe collection. The designs and patterns depicted affluence as vis-a-vis exploits of the Hakonnens and the Fremans.In sum, Dune is the best movie Ive watched post COVID-19.

397,lumieretrain,Dune: Part One by Denis Villeneuve,9,18 October 2021,"The novel Dune by Frank Herbert is still considered to this day, one of the greatest masterpieces ever written in the science fiction literature. Especially, for being a story which explores themes that are still relevant to nowadays, both politically and ecologically, to have actually predicted in how some events might have gone in certain direction, to have become in a way prophetic. The novel is captivating for how much it gets in the details of the characters, psychologically and emotionally, to understand their point of views and their motives to have taken decisions to be often times difficult. The auteur filmmaker Denis Villeneuve has been a long time fan of the novel, to have wished to direct one day a movie adaptation of the novel Dune by Frank Herbert. It has been later on, announced the making of the movie adaptation of Dune; as the movie will be divided in two parts, where first one of the movie adaptation will cover the first half of the book. After a long time of work, in 2021 came out Dune: Part One by Denis Villeneuve, with Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem. The movie's plot: In a far future, the son of the noble family Atreides, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), faces an unexpected journey, after the House Atreides has accepted to entrust the protection of the most valuable asset of the galaxy, in the planet Arrakis or also known as Dune. Meanwhile Paul has to learn the meaning of becoming a leader, as he is also the ducal heir of House Atreides, he starts to have visions in his dreams to be likely a prediction of what might going to happen to him. There have been several discussions on how the movie would come out, either to be a worth movie to be made or not; as to work on a complicated adaptation of a unique book, it requires a lot of details of the novel needed to be present in the movie. The movie has actually surprised a lot the audience, the critics and especially the fans of the original novel Dune; as the movie follows very faithfully the original novel, which makes the movie unique to let the audience feel the vastness of the material. The production designer Patrice Vermette has created a unique way to construct the settings with specific details, to make the environments look mythological fused with some futuristic elements and make the spaces express the emotions of the characters. The costume designers Robert Morgan and Jacquelin West have created the costumes with specific details of the shape and the colors, which fit the way the main characters and the supporting ones are represented both psychologically and physically. The cinematographer Greig Fraser has captured the shots of the scenes, in every camera movements and in every angle shots, which make most of the scenes unforgettable and unique; by creating the scenes more atmospheric and powerful, the lightings and the shadows have been elaborated in a specific way to get the scenes spectacular, especially in some of the most unexpected and thrilling moments. The editor Joe Walker has elaborated the narration's rhythm to make clear how the movie would be told from the beginning to the end, without distorting the result of the story and especially by using essential footage needed for the movie. The visual effects have been specifically elaborated to make the vision of the story mythologically immense, to let the audience feel vastness of the story's vision, by using specific details which would unexpectedly surprise the audience in some of the most spectacular scenarios of the story. The score by Hans Zimmer has been created in the most creative and unique way to let the audience feel the environment of the story's set, as well as the emotions and the majestic sounds of the story; especially for how the musical notes have been elaborated to use different instruments, different sounds and different voices, which have been mixed together, to get an unexpectedly surprising musical result. Timothée Chalamet did an extraordinary performance as Paul Atreides, the son of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the Duke Leto Atreides, who is the ducal heir of the noble family Atreides and he is the one who will learn the meaning of becoming a future leader; especially when Paul faces unexpectedly some of the moments of danger, as well as when he sees in his dreams several visions of what might going to happen to him in the future. Rebecca Ferguson did an excellent performance as Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit who is the mother of Paul Atreides and wife of Duke Leto Atreides, through the long journey of her son Paul she will be the one to be with him most of the time; as she will do anything to help Paul, but especially she will do anything to protect him with her life. Oscar Isaac did an extraordinary performance as Duke Leto Atreides, the father of Paul Atreides, husband of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the duke of the noble family Atreides, who will do anything to take the right decisions for the entrust which he has been asked to protect the most valuable asset of the Galaxy in the planet Arrakis; Duke Leto will also do anything to ensure the future of his son Paul, as he brings Paul with him in some of the most important moments of the story. Josh Brolin did an excellent performance as Gurney Halleck, the weapons master of the House Atreides and one of the mentors of Paul, who will do anything to protect the Atreides family no matter what kind of danger might come to them. Stellan Skarsgård did an extraordinary performance as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the baron of the house Harkonnen who is the enemy of the House Atreides and once he has heard about the news of the House Atreides that has been asked for the entrust, he will do anything to kill anyone of the House Atreides. Dave Bautista did a well done performance as Glossu Rabban, the nephew of Baron Harkonnen, who will do anything for his uncle Baron Harkonnen; even it would require great violence, to commit in what he is asked for. Stephen McKinley Henderson did a well done performance as Thufir Hawat, a Mentat of the House Atreides who serves the noble family, he will do whatever he is asked for his purpose. Zendaya did an extraordinary performance as Chani, a young Fremen woman who is often present in Paul's dream, as she means something very important to Paul; until something unexpected happens, where Paul will meet Chani in person and the dreams will slowly become real. Chang Chen did a well done performance as Dr. Wellington Yueh, a Suk doctor who is in charge to help the House Atreides; until something unexpected happen where it can be seen he is taking difficult choices for a specific reason. Sharon Duncan-Brewster did an excellent performance as Dr. Lite-Kynes, the imperial planetologist of the planet Arrakis, who will be the one to give the guidance to Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica on where they have to go to seek what they are looking for. Charlotte Rampling did a well done performance as Gaius Helen Mohiam, a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, who will be the one to understand the meaning of the visions of Paul's dreams, as they are not just simple dreams. Jason Momoa did an extraordinary performance as Duncan Idaho, the swordmaster of the House Atreides and one of the mentors of Paul, who besides to be in charge to protect the House Atreides he will be the one to live for a bit with the Fremen and try to help by making the Fremen ally of the House Atreides. Javier Bardem did an excellent performance as Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen tribe at the Sietch Tabr, who will do anything to defend the Fremen and he initially does not trust the House Atreides; until Paul will give a change in what it has to be done. Dune is one of the greatest movies of all time, as well as one of the best movies of 2021, based on a unique classic science fiction literature masterpiece.",Dune
398,lusciousmuffins,A middle finger to Frank Herbert and his flans,3,18 September 2021,"If you know nothing about the books that form the Dune saga and care nothing about the man who wrote them, then you might enjoy this film.Alas, if you are a fan of Frank Herbert's work, this movie feels like a desecration of his legacy.Are the special effects good?Absolutely. They were able to use advances in technology to do things the 1984 film simply could not.While the backdrop of Dune is a bit stark, the visual aspects of this film are easily its most successful element.Unfortunately, beyond looking amazing, there is very little to recommend this movie.Is the cast good?Yes and no.They have attracted some enormously talented people to this project; however, several were clearly selected to push a certain ideology and therefore stand in complete opposition to the characters as written in the book.To be clear, they did not merely change appearances and genders, they altered the fundamental personality traits of several key individuals.Lest you think I am being too harsh, what bothered me about this film was not a lack of complete fidelity with the book upon which it was meant to be based.I recognize a to the letter translation of the Dune novels into cinematic form is simple not feasible.I do, however, expect them to respect the spirit of the source materials, which they did not.The people behind this movie obviously had an agenda and it was most definitely NOT to bring the Dune universe as Herbert created it to life.Most egregious among their abuses of Herbert's original text is that the changes they made were neither subtle, nor merely practical in nature.The deviations from the text present in this version were calculated to push certain themes that were never part of the Dune saga; consequently, they come across as ham fisted and almost profane.Personally, I also found the attempts to inject humor into this retelling of Herbert's story particularly off-putting and very poorly executed.I suspect there is a very good reason they decided to release this film internationally BEFORE they put it into American theaters.That reason being that Herbert's largest, most active fanbase is in the United States and they are not going to be comfortable with the way the makers of this film took liberties with his stories and the characters in them.My ultimate take away from Dune 2021 is that it is another case of the entertainment industry hijacking the popularity of an existing story to deliver their messages.That they waited until after Herbert's passing to use his vision to push their ideology reads as sick and supremely disrespectful.",Dune
399,rogier-86785,"A majestic, suspenseful and highly original sci-fi story",9,11 October 2021,"Dune (I) is a grand, epic adventure film based on the book with the same name from Frank Herbert, that is dark and suspenseful. We follow the tribulations of the Atreides family tribe - specifically those of young prodigy Paul - who receive the mining rights to the only known fuel, or 'spice' ore, that allows intergalactic travel. Hence, mining this ore makes one immensely powerful.The catches are many: the spice is only found on a hellish, water-deprived desert planet aptly named Dune. The previous miners, House Harkonnen, have no intention of leaving. An emperor whose intentions are unclear lays in the shadows. An unknown cabal of women seems to be pulling many strings. Mysterious rebels live beneath the planet's surface (the Fremen). And to top it all off, the production of the ore seems linked to gigantic and incredibly dangerous sandworms.Dune's mix of corruption, freedom fighting and the natural elements is among the most explosive you'll have ever encountered. It does however, not explode right away, or even that much in this 'Part I' film. For many, the Dune universe will not be familiar, which can catch you off guard. This just isn't like 'normal' sci-fi. The original work is best described as slow and suffocating. It is extremely harsh and gritty, has a long, suspenseful built-up and holds many layers of messages about how we treat our own world hidden underneath its narrative. Dune is among the masterpieces of literature, and that makes it incredibly tough to catch in a film. The first campy attempt by the excellent David Lynch for instance has it's moments, but doesn't always hit the mark.Luckily, director Villeneuve has chosen to do it in his signature style we know from his Bladerunner and Arrival films; very slow, grand and epic, which suits the original material remarkably well. That makes the film look quite brownish and dark, without much contrast and color though. So much so, it might turn some people off. And if you expect a fast-paced film, you're also in for a cold shower.The thing here is: Dune is simply not your normal story. You won't be getting your usual sci-fi heroes. Even the main 'hero' of the story is scared he might trigger a jihad of sorts. All characters are complicated, and all are magnificently acted out, understated. What you get is an experience that looks and feels majestic and that needs to be experienced in a cinema preferably, rather than digested as a 'normal' film or criticized that it's not a pitch-perfect translation of the book.Let this one flow over you. You won't be disappointed.",Dune
400,Bek204,"""Fear is the mind killer""",9,8 November 2021,"Dune (2021) is an adaptation of one of the best Sci-Fi novels ever by Frank Herbert that carries the same title. I personally did not read the novel, and I know completely nothing about the story or plot of Dune. However, I have heard things about how the story or plot of Dune is complex and hard to turn into a live-action film as it requires a lot of work and not anyone can do it. Dune has been adapted many times and all of them failed. For instance, David Lynch's 1984 Dune was described as a ""flaw attempt"". However, when it was announced that Denis Villeneuve will be directing the upcoming adaptation I personally was sure right away that he will be doing the best adaptation. And he did.If you do not know Denis Villeneuve by now then you should. He is one of the best modern-day directors. Some of his films are Prisoners (2013), Blade Runner 2049 (2017), and Arrival (2016). As you watch all of his films you'll notice some unique and creative similarities between all of them. For example, the build-up and introduction of the characters or world of his stories. He is the only director who is capable of being brave enough to adopt such a hard and complex story or novel such as Dune. Or create a sequel of one the best and most famous Sci-Fi films after 30 years of the release of the original one such as Blade Runner 2049. And surprisingly all of these films turned to be successful and great.Villeneuve has his own way of introducing characters and building the world of a story by having such slow-paced films which will seem boring or long for many. Especially in Dune or Blade Runner 2049. But. In Dune's case, many don't know that this is the first part of a two-part film and story (possibly could be turned into a trilogy). However, this method or style of telling a story in a slow-paced way can be done perfectly only by Denis Villeneuve and in a way where it will be entertaining and not seem boring or long.Alongside that, his use and choices of cinematography, theme or vibe of the film, music, etc.Firstly, the music in Dune (2021) is composed by nonother than Hans Zimmer, Which felt different and unique this time than other films that Zimmer composed like Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), or No Time To Die (2021) where there are simple action or dramatic scenes. Dune is different and requires different and unique music for that world or story to be delivered, explained, and experienced well by audience members. The music score in Dune feels real, alive, and is speaking to you to deliver the feeling or action that is being shown on screen.Dune has a great cast. But, you will be surprised to know that not all of them have enough or long screen time like Zendaya. And again, that's because Dune is ""an introduction to Dune Part two"" so many of the characters in the first part are only being introduced to the audience but will play and have a bigger role In the second part.Timothée Chalamet plays the role of Paul Atreides and he is the one that we are with him most of the time since we are following his epic and long journey. Chalamet obviously plays the role very well which is not a surprise. Jason Momoa didn't present something new. It's the same type of character shown in most of his films where he is that big strong guy who goes around kicking everyone. But, it is still impressive to see him in the fight scenes especially that he is in most of them. Three roles that I really want to talk about and are a complete surprise. First, Oscar Issac as Duke Leto Atreides and the father of Paul Atreides. You could see the grandeur and nobleness in his walk or on his facial expressions. I have never seen someone who plays the role of a ""duke"" that well. Secondly, Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Atreides and the mother of Paul Atreides. Rebecca plays the role of that frightened mother who is willing to take good care of her son and sacrifice her life for him, and she does more than well. Finally, Stellan Skarsgård as Harkonnen. The makeup and hairstyle department did a great job in creating that weird ""creature"" who you won't know if he is human or a monster whether from the inside or the outside look. His voice, his face, his size, his body are all capable of frighting the audience.I really wish if the film was rated R. I feel like the story of Dune requires blood and violence to be able to show and deliver that world that is full of different characters, houses, and families that have or follow these weird different traditions. The film was missing some disgusting violence and blood specifically in the fight scenes and the "" evil villein side"".The beautiful cinematography and visual effects capture the beautiful world of Dune from landscapes like the beautiful desert with its sand that is designed pretty well and you can see the details whenever there is a close-up or extreme close up shot that captures the sand, and the huge ships and planes that are well designed. The film is considered ""visually stunning"", it's full of shots and still frames that are stunning to look at.The use of colors and the color palette of the film or each shot is great. The whole film has that brown sand color theme which adds more to the story and connects perfectly to the world and story of Dune.The sound mixing & editing are well done although sometimes I felt like whenever there is one character that is whispering I could not hear them very clearly. On the other hand, the sound of characters stepping on sand is very amazing. You can lethally hear every little detail especially the film sometimes has scenes that are in complete silence.Dune (the film itself and the story or world of Dune) is huge. It's a big project that is not easy to be done. But, with Denis and the rest of the crew, they were capable of giving one of the best Sci-Fi films ever. Hope the story and film stay on that great level with the 2nd part or the 3rd one if there will be one. Dune is a story that deserves to be told in multiple parts and not in one film.My rating is 9.5/10

401,nigepitz,Worth the wait,9,27 October 2021,"It's such a shame that we only get half a movie but it does seem that the second part is now going to be made. As for 'part 1', well it's a triumph. A brilliant, breathtaking spectacle that manages to keep the narrative arc simple enough that even someone who doesn't know the story can understand the plot. No mean feat. Because it's only the first part there are some underused actors but they have to be introduced now ready for part 2. It's dark, moody, intense and on a giant scale. Loved it.",Dune
402,nlgthunder,Left much to be desired for me,6,25 October 2021,"So many great actors in this film, but even their high caliber performances couldn't get me 100% on board.To start, it's totally possible I'm just not the target market for this film. I've never read the book or seen the original Dune. Despite loving action and sci-fi movies, this one could just be out of my realm.This movie left a lot up for assumption without as much clarification as I would have liked. Aspects of the planets, the names of people and groups, tasks the characters are completing, and more were all presented to me like I should have already known what they were. The dialogue was also much quieter and spoken very quickly when paired with the intense film score and the loud action sequences. It was hard at times to keep up with what they were discussing with so many foreign words and concepts at the heart of the dialogue. This impacted the movie's watchability for me.I also didn't care for some of the way certain lines and scenes were delivered. I understand the mood, aesthetic, and type of culture this was trying to build, but even within that framework some of it still felt rigid like a play (i.e., the scene with Timotheé and Oscar in the graveyard and Josh Brolin in the fight training scene). It took me out of it.Despite feeling lost for a good portion of the movie and hoping I'd feel caught up by the end (I did not), there were things I liked. The production quality of this film are of the highest caliber, the score brought the film to life (regardless of the volume discrepancy), the Fremen portrayal was done very well, and the characters of Dr. Kynes and Duncan were my favorite.Hope they go ahead with the sequel so I can give that another shot.",Dune
403,travisvincent,A visual spectacle.,9,26 October 2021,"Having not read the book or seen the 80s version I went into Dune knowing nothing. Having said that, Dune was visually stunning and while I found it hard to keep up with the plot about halfway through I could figure it out for myself. It's like Star Wars before Star Wars. The acting was top notch and the set pieces were great but again the main character was just how gorgeous the visuals were, I found myself just enjoying the atmosphere and found the movie to be very good. I would give it a ten but because it's clear from the opening this is part one, I know the movie would leave me waiting for part two. I'd prefer a complete movie without the need for additional chapters but from what I've read about Dune is that the book is much more complicated. It's still a great movie and I look forward to the remaining chapters.",Dune

411,sashamyshkina,I just had a spiritual awakening.,10,28 October 2021,"After a year of waiting, two watches of the 1984 version, 600 pages of book and £4.60 of popcorn later, I am happy to say that I am no longer the same person I was two and a half hours ago.Right, so, I- just- I don't even know what to say right now, I am so deeply shook. This is everything I expected from a Dune movie and more. I stumbled out of the cinema not knowing how to walk straight and not knowing how to process what I had just seen.I read the entire book earlier this year and watched David Lynch's Dune too. I really loved Lynch's interpretation, even if details from the book were changed. However, Villeneuve's Dune is THE modern science fiction epic for this generation. Staying literally 100% true to Frank Herbert's colossal novel, Dune is simple to follow even for people who aren't familiar with its universe, as opposed to Lynch's film which compresses the story to the point that it'll only really make sense for people who've already read the book.The exposition is well explained but not overloaded and expertly incorporated throughout the movie. And, of course, the best part: the visual effects. Lynch's ambitious vision was weighed down by some slightly questionable (but still lovable in a weird campy 80s way) effects, but the massive budget shows through in the truly gorgeous world building. The worms, the buildings, the spacecraft, everything - sometimes I was so stunned babe the onslaught of visuals I couldn't focus on much else. Hans Zimmer's score sent chills through me and complimented the visuals perfectly. I give 10/10s close to never, and this movie definitely deserved it.The sleek sci-fi landscapes are almost a world away from the industrial landscapes of David Lynch's version, and the entire thing just felt more clean. However, from time to time, I couldn't help but miss the weird campiness of it all.Dune is infamous for just how much STUFF there is - the number of interwoven characters, plot lines and ideas, the strange and complex terminology, the complex history. By wisely choosing to split the book in two parts, you manage to see it all. The ensemble cast all give very strong performances. Despite my intense dislike for Timothee Chalamet, he was very good as the lead (although I much preferred Kyle MacLachlan's performance).Dune is an intelligent science fiction blockbuster that finally did the book justice and is for sure Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus. Watch it.-Sasha.",Dune

You only hear mysterious sounds and characters talk mysteriously but there is nothing that fantastic in the plot. It looks like they try to fool you and create a serious mythical and wild environment but they can't. It may entertain you but poorly and slowly.Also, one may extract some metaphors and hints to the oil wars in middle east but again poorly and badly.So, I wouldn't recommend it to watch unless you are eager to watch some si-fi vehicles and a fantasy worm along with sand storms in a desert planet.

While Lynch's Dune looks and feels more mature , serious, and sinister, this Dune, does a great job of establishing a universe of interesting, if not a little cliché, characters, and phenomenal worlds. The visual scope, breathtaking landscapes and set pieces, to the intimate dialog, and moments of pure magic. Truly visionary in aircraft concepts and audible tones.

418,MackMonMay87,Satisfying as Long as You're Not Expecting Star Wars,9,9 November 2021,"The third adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune shows a lot of promise towards becoming the major sci-fi operatic epic that Star Wars should be. Since the Star Wars sequels starting with Force Awakens became progressively more and more low quality, a vacuum in the cinema world exists for big space opera, and will hopefully be taken by a new Dune series.As long as visual master Denis Villeneuve helms the rest of the installments, it should be in good hands. Dune is a massive epic, and I think some filmgoers and some of the other reviewers might not realize how much material and potential there is in the story. You wouldn't attempt the Lord of the Rings in one story, and trying the same with something like Dune is a fool's errand, and a large part of the reason why the David Lynch version of the story was a failure. This is an epic filled with lots of houses, characters, motivations, history, and bloodlines. It's not something that you could or should cram into a standard runtime.There are elements of the books that others have criticized the film for leaving out. There's motivations and character moments that would flesh out the movie had they been included, but from the perspective of what makes for a good movie instead of book, the cuts and things they left out make sense. It might've been interesting to have a little more background and history on some of the characters (the betrayal of a certain character is much more elaborated on in the novel), but as it stands, the movie is 2.5 hours long with more to come, and as long as you measure expectations and understand this is more about power, politics and how resources are managed rather than a non-stop action thrillride, you'll have a great time with Dune.",Dune

The acting was pretty spot on. Hans Zimmer did the music, but I found the constant presence of it a little on the monotonous side.

421,h_sarp,"Stylish, Well Crafted But Shallow",6,22 October 2021,"Dune will probably go down as the weakest link in Denis Villeneuve's strong filmography. His films often deal with deep themes, have a very powerful statement and ask for active involvement of the audience, often leaving with an ambigous yet satisfying ending. He always gets very good performances from his actors and is very precise with the tone and editing of his films.However at Dune, he seems to have lost his identity within the boundaries of mainstream Hollywood. The depiction of the story and dialogue is repetitive as in many big budget studio blockbusters from Hollywood. The way how story unfolds is very very familiar. Throughout 155 minutes, never manages to engage the viewer on an intellectual ground. As if film is trying to find its own audience among young viewers and build its own empire as Star Wars.Hans Zimmer's score and excellent cinematography are the only positive elements reminding us there's a very skilled filmmaker behind the camera.",Dune

Timothee Chalemet makes a good Paul Atreides, and there are great supporting turns by Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson and Dave Bautista. Zendaya makes for a radiant Chani, and the thunderous middle eastern laced percussive score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the overall feel of the pic.

423,mistabobdobolina,"Visually magnificent, well acted, and memorable",8,18 October 2021,"It's an impressive film. If you like the rather unique blend of camp and high-concept SF that makes up the source material, and if you aren't too much of a literalist about adaptations, you're likely to enjoy it. If you don't know the book but like epic spectacle sci-fi, there's a good chance you'll enjoy it. It isn't without its flaws, but for my money it's fun and satisfying and worth more than one watch.The visuals are stunning: everything from the costuming to the ship and building designs works really well. The spooky, featureless ovals of the interstellar transports, the design of the sandworms, and armor and weaponry of the various warring factions are all particularly noteworthy. House Harkonnen, the classic baddies of the original novel, are presented for once more in line with their depiction in the book, and the Sardaukar -- fanatical legions of the Emperor -- are both designed and depicted as genuinely terrifying and effective. The movie delivers in spades on both action and atmosphere.The acting is uniformly good across the cast. There are no weak links, and the Fremen in particular are excellent. Stellan Skarsgard's more reserved take on Baron Harkonnen is very cool (though it seems to upset people to whom the cackling monstrosity from the Lynch movie is ""canon""), Beast Rabban emerges as a real force, Timothee Chalamet's Paul feels convincingly like a teenaged boy with wisdom and capability beyond his years.All is not perfect. The Hans Zimmer soundtrack, for example, gets pretty monotonous by the top of hour two. It's not bad, per se, but the music is the one area where I do have to give the edge to the 1984 film.The film is not literal about porting over scenes from the book and cuts out entire characters and subplots or pares them back drastically: Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen makes no appearance and we get very little of either Thufir Hawat or Piter de Vries, who are major players in the novel. In most ways this is to the good, or at least understandable: most of the cuts remove exposition that the novel gets away with but that would slow the movie. However, some of what's cut is really missed. In particular, the way the novel sets up Dr. Yueh's treason against the Atreides, and frames his motives, is just missing here and it lessens the character.Other flaws amount more to minor quibbles -- like, I don't get a clear feel for how shields are supposed to work from what's portrayed on the screen -- but this adaptation got more right than it did wrong and delivered solid entertainment. I recommend it.(One further note: there was a weird quirk in the version I watched where it seemed to have no subtitles, which are necessary for following the movie's extensive use of sign languages and a variety of constructed sci-fi tongues. I had to switch on Closed Captioning. If they deliberately left subtitles off -- and there does seem to be a vogue in some productions for making the audience sit through long stretches of alien languages with only context clues to guide them -- then that's a mistake for sure.)",Dune

And despite a sizable cast of characters, Dune does a good job establishing an all-embracing empathy and likability without losing the story's thread
And yes, a movie without computers and AI, but a voice to control the mind. Great acting by the whole cast and extraordinary acting by Timothée Chalamet (Paul) and Rebecca Ferguson (Paul´s mother). I wouldn´t be surprised to see Oscar nominees for both of them. Then there is the dazzling casting, editing, and intense directing by Denis Villeneuve add and on top of this the music and sound mixing from Hans Zimmer. This is a master piece that needs viewing.

430,huntersmithx,Denis Villeneuve truly brings the spice to this long-awaited adaptation.,9,22 October 2021,"After so long of Science-Fiction being a niche prospect, 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey could've been another one of those types to be shelved in cinephile archives and comic-con conventions. Instead it paved the way for more to come like 1977's Star Wars, Blade Runner, Ex Machina, etc. Even before all of them was a peculiar novel by Frank Herbert. Once considered unfilmable, the closest we had was child's play tampered by studio interference (though it had a worthy director in one David Lynch). What better ambassador to achieve the impossible this 21st century than Denis Villeneuve, who resurrected another 80's Sci-Fi property into the mainstream?With the award-winning aid of writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, Villeneuve's scope translated the first half of the novel with ease. It manages to not fall victim to what some Part 1/Part 2 adaptations have in the past- Actually be a complete story of its own. Sure it does lean a lot into exposition and character development, but they're the best kind. It's also sharpened by the best world-building of Villeneuve's filmography in visuals, organic dialogue and oppressive scope. Hans Zimmer's score feels like a natural progression from his all-encompassing filmography of the 2010's; electric synth-waves and earth-shattering vibrations juxtaposed to world beats and Gregorian chants.Dune might have one of the biggest feats for an ensemble cast in a long time, and they're all worth the rave. When people look back at which actors exemplified the hottest talent of the Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides has echoes of his 1984 counterpart Kyle MacLachlan, but brings his own spin on the shy warrior. Jason Momoa brings his charisma and sense of humor to Duncan Idaho, Paul's brother. Oscar Issac and Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's parents bring chilling warmth and anxiety alongside Paul. Stellan Skarsgard's villainous Vladimir Harkonnen is one of several stunning evocations of 1979's Apocalypse Now sprinkled throughout. Josh Brolin is a worthy successor to Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck; Dave Bautista and Zendaya are also specialized in their smaller roles, though don't get too excited as they're kept to a minimum.Denis' prospect here fulfills his promise to strike the right balance between being blockbuster game and being true to his art-house roots, and the packed theater I was in was great proof of that. Here's to hoping that a Part 2 and what streaming series that may come will complete the cycle in making Frank Herberts' legacy as canonized as the most legendary of book adaptations- The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc. Once thought of as unattainable, now only halfway there.RATING: 3.5 out of 4 stars.",Dune

Dune is just great. Now, is it the next Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, not even close but this film is definitely a great sci-fi epic.Timothee Chalamet is excellent as Paul, I haven't really seen him in much so I didn't know how good at acting he is and this performance shows that he can act. I am excited to see his performance in The French Dispatch. The worms are awesome and giant. The worms are really cool.Denis Villeneuve is an amazing director. Dune is beautiful. I love how it is directed, the shots are so well done, some shots are taken from above, some for a distance and many shots are just beautiful. The color grading is great, the cinematography is phenomenal, some of the best I have seen in the while and the editing is impressive. The space shots were really cool and well done. I am surprised that this movie only cost 165 million dollars to make.I thought the plot was pretty easy to follow most of the time. The spaceships were very cool looking and the helicopter was really interesting. I thought that Oscar Isaac, Zendaya and Stellan Skarsgård's performance were pretty good. My biggest complaint is that I wish some of the side characters like Jason Momoa, Dave Batista and Josh Brolin's characters could of been more developed and this film felt like a lot of context setting up Part 2.Overall, Dune is impressive but not perfect but I am very excited to see Part 2.",Dune

None of the characters, except for the witch played by Charlotte Rampling, stand out in this version. They all just feel too polished.The slow pacing coupled with the intense music, which often does not seem to reflect what is seen on screen, works against the story where the character development is severly lacking. I felt indifferent towards every single character - even in pivotal ""emotional"" moments. The movie feels hollow.The visuals are impressive, as you would expect, but somehow not as impressive or memorable as the 1984 counterpart.

With long shots natural sceneries, intricately designed prompts and machines, and Han Zimmer's earth-shattering background music, Dune presents worlds of art and imagination combined. I truly appreciate the mesmerizing topography, internal furnishment, and various technology appearances, which entirely recreated the literature's description with futuristic machines. Regarding plot, the character tension and motive in the expedition was quite confusing, where in a book or stage act might make sense. But as we adapt to the epic and poetic atmosphere, the middle part when battles detonate and blades collide, the movie truly stars to temper with the audiences' emotion. Overall, Villeneuve's Dune is worthy of my expectation as a successful movie that accurately retells the story of Frank Herbert's Dune.",Dune

Impressive pictures on a big cinema screen, a breathtaking score, a well structured plot, an incredible cast and brilliant set design and costumes to dive into another world? Dune has all of these and is one of the best movies you can watch in cinemas.I was born in 2001 and I'm very sad that I didn't had the chance to watch Peter Jacksons ""The Lord of the Rings"" the very first time in theatres. I always wanted to experience such an breathtaking Epos by myself on the big screen. And I think I finally found my memorable cinema experience now with Denis Villeneuves ""Dune""I have to admit that I never read the books of Frank Herbert, only watched the (not very good) David Lynch movie of 1984 but always have known about the impact of the novels to the science fiction genre. So it deserved a movie that can introduce the world of Frank Herbert to more people.

I read the book many years ago. Good thing, because without that knowledge, I wouldn't have had any idea about half of what was going on. And I kept waiting for the actual story's stupendous climax but sadly, it doesn't apoear in this movie. My comment at the end, ""What?"" Who knew there's a part two? Had I known, I would've waited until that came out to see part one, avoiding any frustration. Had the movie encompassed the book's entire story, I probably would have rated it a 10. Just gave it a 7 only because it's Dune. Nice cinematography though.I then decided I needed to see this again:
It got a lot better the second time around. I watched the actual movie without judgement, this time armed with the knowledge that it would end where it does. I actually enjoyed it. I recognized the flow. I even raised the audio a bit so I could better make out most of what was being said.

443,TheLegendOfThe42,Three problems that stop DUNE from being an absolute masterpiece,7,17 October 2021,"Let's get to the amazing stuff first:DUNE looks fantastic. The design, the cinematography, the scope - absolutely stunning and masterful. An absolute 10/10.The cast is great for the most part, the acting is also mostly very decent.However, in my view, there are three big problems:1) The script: As much as I love Villeneuve, his sense of pacing isn't the greatest in the world, and you can easily spot this flaw in DUNE. While much interaction and even characters are omitted, we see a ton of close-ups, mostly in slow motion, taking up a lot of runtime. Instead of more character work to chisel out Gurney, Duncan and others, they feel strangely small and insignificant. This pacing problem becomes very apparent in the second half of the film.2) The score: As much as the above mentioned pacing problem would still be present, a better score would have made DUNE better in every way. At times Zimmer's score is fine, but it mostly just drones along with little meaning. No themes are discernible, no strong sense of identity or character with cunning instrumentation or arrangement. Instead, it repeats itself with one note drones held for minutes, overemphasizing much of the minor moments and thus robbing itself of all sense of epic scope for the big moments. Add in some ethnic whining, and voilà - here's your generic Zimmer score.A film's score can make up half the film's emotional impact, so this flaw is probably the most important one, and I would have loved to see what more gifted composers would have done with this stunning film.3) Zendaya. For the love of everything; I don't get the hype. At all. To me, this woman is a plank of wood. Zero charisma, zero charm. Maybe it's just me, but I would have imagined Chani as the exact opposite of that. And even though she doesn't appear much in this first part of the story, she is one of the most important characters in the source material, which means that Zendaya will be all over the second part (if it gets done at all, but let's hope for the best). Oh my.Of course there are other, smaller things, like the wildly inconsistent technology (interstellar travel, but altimeters and radio like in WW2) or the silly sand walk, but those don't spoil the fun too much.So in the end, I feel like DUNE is very close to being a complete masterpiece, having needed only a more merciless editor and a better composer, and I can only hope Villeneuve can complete his vision soon.",Dune
444,roondogbb,Excellent movie for complex story,8,23 October 2021,"Some stories are a lot easier to put onto the big screen than others. So much so, that some movie makers will just avoid attempting to make the movie in question due to likelyhood of failure. In the case of Dune: Part One however, directed by Denise Villeneuve everyone involved gives it their best shot and In fact, end up coming out with an excellent movie. The creaters of this movie from the outset, had the option of making a movie that tries to condence what is a very complex story into probably 3 hours, which would have resulted in a claustrophobic movie, albeit, perhaps an easier to follow movie, A to B to C style. Yet to my surprise and a positive surprise. It feels like only part A of the story has been told. The background to the universe, and world building was the focus. Beautiful cinematography, a rich soundtrack, provided by the ever talented Hans Zimmer is focused on. The CGI isn't the draw of the film but rather it is just implemented when needed. To show off an alien world, large and epic in scope. Careful and talented use of CGI is just fine. The actors and actresses in the movie did a good to pull you into the world. Timothée Chalamet was great in his role as Paul. The only downside the film is not in the quality itself but rather in its inability to be longer and give more. If you are a Science Fiction fan go see this movie, Same if you are a fan of beautiful cinema and are interested in complex narratives. However if you like your films with simplistic and common beginning/middle/end. You might be let down by your expectations. Several people I know called the movie confusing. Overall 8/10 from me however as I see great potential in this franchise. Hopefully a sequal is on the way.",Dune
445,guskeller,The best movie of the year,10,22 October 2021,"Dune is everything right with movies. Legendary source material helmed by today's hottest filmmaker, Dune is a triumph of cinematic accomplishment. Every aspect of this film is masterful, but the production design stands out. Blending futuristic with ancient, Dune's appearance brings a unique universe to life and feels vastly immersive. This is driven home by the fierce soundtrack which cements the timeless atmosphere. Simultaneously, the special effects and cinematography are visually stunning. Elaborate sets, props, and rigs center the experience in gritty realism. While focus, lighting, shot composition, and color design produce artful imagery. As expected, Denis Villeneuve strikes a vivid vision yet again.Furthermore, the stellar cast is electric. Timothée Chalamet, in particular, nails his nuanced role. This strange universe could've easily felt silly, but everything is grounded around Chalamet's layered performance. Meanwhile, the editing and sound design elevate the production like few films can. The pacing seamlessly switches from its meticulous foundation to forceful dream sequences and action scenes. The sound is a rich combination of primal, technological, and mystical environments. Conclusively, Dune is a beautiful movie from head to toe and one of the best films of the year.Writing: 9/10

The look and feel is how I imagined in my mind and the casting job is superb.My criticisms though are that there are still details missing which would have explained things clearer. If I hadn't read the book then I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this. It could have been split into 3 films rather than 2 to get the details.As loan other trait which is becoming all too common is to have whispering characters with too loud a background noise going on.

This journey contains growth and death.Dune does not 'wow' me, but it keeps me engaged throughout the film while challenging me to wonder what is next. There is a lot of foreshadowing that leaves you with anticipation for part two. The film has languid pacing as it immerses you into this new universe. A new world filled with technology, different languages, political warfare, and inequalities. There are strong themes drenched in the plot, unexpected character deaths, and it's visually cultivating at times. Although the pacing is slow, the action scenes made it worthwhile. You may have to watch this a couple of times to understand everything that is going on.Verdict:
Dune, Part one is a foundational setup for more parts to come. Dune does not 'wow' me. There are similarities to the Star Wars universe here, with ""the voice"" ( the force ), technology, the difference in people, and combat.Does Dune take me to paradise? Not quite! But we are getting there.",Dune

The direction, sets, costumes, make up, music and cinematography are all top tier.

456,pseawrig,"Drab, Dreary, and Dull",3,23 October 2021,"Imo, watching this movie was a chore. It moves very slowly and methodically, as if it were completing a necessary but unloved task. And almost all of its performances are rigid and muted, as if the actors were putting on an elaborate pageant instead of enacting a drama. Nobody in this film appears to be inhabiting a fully fleshed out character. Instead, the actors move around like game pieces, delivering lines by speaking into the ether.A multitude of reviewers have described this movie as visually stunning. I do not know what they are they seeing. I see a dull looking movie- all grays and beiges. Besides the drab color scheme, the shots are generally static and the sets look nearly empty. If anything, this movie looks flat, the very antithesis of stunning.Its story is also leaden. We have a limp hero, who expresses little if any will, as if he's just along for the ride. As played by the languid Timothée Chalemet, he appears to have only two expressions: blank and mildly engaged. I cannot remember a lead actor who expressed less interiority in a movie, except maybe Ryan Gosling in Villeneuve's similarly plodding Blade Runner 2049. Gosling's character at least had a reason to be empty: he was an android. Chalemet's character is rumored to be charismatic, at least according to the plot.David Lynch's previous movie version of Dune was admittedly jumbled and confusing, so much so that he briefly disowned it. Still, despite its flaws, Lynch's Dune never felt catatonic. Villeneuve's does. I'll take Lynch's flawed version over this one any day. At least Lynch's crazed mess felt deeply alive. Villeneuve's feels dead.",Dune

Nor was it as wooden or overly-dramatic as the 2000s ScyFy series.The whole experience of it was somewhat, I would say, poetic yet serious in the likes of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy especially when it's augmented with Hans Zimmer's score.I would also like to highlight that there was a tinge of the 2015 Justin Kurzel's ""Macbeth"" where the atmosphere at times felt grim and gloomy. But that's not a bad thing. It just adds to the seriousness of the movie. Speaking of Macbeth, the movie does give off that Shakespearean quality about it which I very much appreciate it; hence why I thought this Villenueve's Dune is rather 'poetic'.Before going into the movie, I was afraid that it be a snooze-fest just as Villeneuve's take on his ""Blade Runner 2049"" despite it being visually stunning. But as a fan of the books, I'm certainly glad that it was far from boring. I don't feel like it is in any way a slow burn as what some reviewers described it. The pacing was just right like it was right out the book. Yet I couldn't say the same for those who are unfamiliar with the story. They might, I worry, get very impatient with it.And not to give anything away or spoilers, there were definitely changes from the source material. In particular, that dining room scene from the book where disagreements were expressed out among the characters was not in the movie. Another point to take note was the use of spoken languages among the various groups which I don't ever recall Herbert used in the book. Such that, they actually took the effort in creating languages to distinguish which group of characters they're from. It was interesting take that Dr Yueh was speaking in Mandarin while conversing with Paul and the latter responded with the same. I mean 'Yueh' is, after all, a Chinese name so I think it's kinda appropriate. I also picked up some Arabic in some of the scenes especially when the Fremens were talking to themselves.As for performances, it is definitely Timothee Chalamet's shining achievement. This is his movie. Rebecca Furgeson also gave her possibly emotionally wrenching performance. There were scenes whereby I could empathize with her pain, not as a Bene Gesserit, but as Paul's mother. Oscar Isaac, too, was compelling and had me convinced that he was good enough to be Paul's father. Collectively, both Isaac and Furgeson played it excellently well as Paul's parents to give him enough care yet with firm sternness to protect their son.The scope of the movie was indeed epic in terms of the scale. For example, the sizes of the heighliners in comparisons to the smaller ships. Those were massive. Think those individual alien attacker crafts in ""Independence Day"" compared to the main mothership, except that the latter was three to four times larger. And those Ornithopters were perfectly made to mimic dragonflies yet upon closer look they do resemble helicopters. The costumes were stunning. So much so that I'd described them as being ""lyrical"", if that makes sense.Hans Zimmer's score is also worth mentioning. It fits the movie perfectly but it does not overpower the feel of any scenes. Although I did find his use of bagpipes to be out of place. And sadly, we did not get to see Gurney Halleck strum his baliset. It'd be interesting to see how Josh Brolin would sound like if he were to sing.For me, personally, the only thing that was amiss was the exclusion of the Emperor since he was mentioned many times throughout the movie but with no physical representation of himself on screen. And as many of us already knew, Feyd was not included in the movie and it did give the strange feeling that the main Harkonnen players were around except for him. Or Count Fenring, for that matter.Yet, all in all, they did capture the gist of the book so I'm not disappointed at all. Dune was a beautifully made film that I wouldn't mind going for a second viewing. And I could certainly see that it would garner quite a substantial amount of nominations especially in the technical categories.",Dune

The casting, cinematography, sets, script, direction... everything is top notch. I have nothing negative to say about it. Thank you!",Dune
460,benjaminwg,"More than Dune-Lite. A lot wrong, but a lot right, too, and a few improvements even over the book. Picture needs a dark venue & high projector lumens sufficient for room size.",9,6 November 2021,"It's not 10,191 CE/AD, but rather After the Guild (AG), which puts it well over 20,000 yrs in the future. Early deep space missions in the Dune mythos were generational ships. People have been on some of these planets longer than humans have been on some of our continents on Earth. Crazy far into the future. I had a great ""So you'd like to... Read Dune for the first time"" tutorial on Amazon, but for some reason the Amazon dolts have been deleting those, many reviews, and now the comment sections loaded with incredible discussions. But I digress...You expect things to be dropped or changed, but within limits. Nothing here about the Butlerian Jihad or humanity's past problem with thinking machines. You want to show technology in Dune as sort of antiquated or weird at times, and there unfortunately seemed to be little of that except for some analog stuff in the thopter cockpit. And how do you completely leave out references to Dune's Orange Catholic Bible in all of these versions, especially with AI in the news?Goofy pronunciation, similar to the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries. I did notice in the credits at the end that John Harrison was an executive producer on this, and I assume a consultant. They could have gotten away with having some people pronounce words one way and others pronounce them
another, similar to how people pronounce ""Oregon"" or ""Nevada"".Making the Harkonnens pasty and bald was an odd choice. Does it eventually work? Sure, and it certainly allows a stark contrast with the way Giedi Prime is visually done, but while Villeneuve said that Lynch's version had no influence on this, that's clearly a fib once you get to the counter-pronunciation and see their heads. There was no basis for the red hair in the two prior versions, so the baldness becomes an attempt to not be like the prior versions. I presume the pasty villains is some sort of 'woke' stuff injected into the movie, similar to making one of the male off-worlder characters who has gone native a black woman now. Why were more Fremen in this not Arabic, for that matter? This is supposed to be an allegory for Bedouins and oil.Max von Sydow was a shoe-in for Kynes in Lynch's, but my favorite is probably Karel Dobrý in the Sci-Fi Channel version. Dobrý's scenes and that lovely Julie Cox scene with Alec Newman during the dinner party were probably two of the best chunks of acting in any of the three iterations of Dune. Yeah, the production values of the Sci-Fi Channel version were sort of terrible at times, but the DP Vittorio Storaro mostly just didn't know how to shoot painted backdrops. The rest of people's complaints on that one can be mostly traced to the cheap but functional CGI. Oh, and the battle scenes were mostly inept on that version, too. My philosophy is to treat that version like an elaborate, filmed stage production to rein in such expectations. Again, I digress...Anyway, changing the Kynes character to female as a result of the Me-Too movement or putting as many African or mulatto actors in this as possible after the crazy BLM riots that corporate America is now terrified of (or both) wasn't that big of a deal to me in the end, though I thought it would be. Sharon Duncan-Brewster did fine, though I didn't quite get the worship of the worms thing. For that matter, I don't think there's a single mention of God in this version, and both the Atreidies and the Fremen are supposed to be essentially mono-theistic in the classical Judeo-Christian-Muslim sense, with the worms being more of revered 'messenger' beings symbolic of the presence and path of God to the Fremen. I don't recall it ever being said in the book that they out and out worship the sandworms or that the sandworm is their 'master'. So that's maybe another change, though obviously this explicit worm worship is only a slight re-interpretation as far as I can tell. The subtraction of the word ""God"" from this adaptation entirely is perhaps less forgivable.Thufir's barely in this. Paul has not only been trained by his mom, Gurney, and Duncan, but Thufir who is a human computer. The special way Paul analyzes things isn't explored at all. No references to the massive focus on human mental improvement in this era, their power over their own bodies, or the freaky materials science advances, like wires a molecule thick or blades that cut through bone like butter. No mention of the nuke ban on human targets, or nukes at all, actually. No grand unified-field theory (GUT), Holtzman Effect, the problem of lasers & body shields, or why suspensor fields are used fully on the rich baron and slightly on the emperor's soldiers, ultralight glow globes, and that hunter seeker. The big battle failed to even show many bullets bouncing off body shields. Villeneuve claims to be a huge Dune fan, but at times you wouldn't guess from the movie, like he's barely familiar with it.In retrospect, I do have to begrudgingly agree with some other reviewers who've complained it's tame and PG-13, though during my viewings it didn't occur to me or bother. In some ways this may have been better done like Game of Thrones for a mini-series on cable TV, and considering it was sadly co-released on HBO Max, a lot of people are only going to see this at home, after all, even though Villeneuve shot this on very high-end UHD digital for IMAX aspect.Now for the positives on 2021 Dune... It's gorgeous to look at and to listen to. It's not painterly like Lynch's cult classic (for which better fan edits exist), but Lynch is literally a painter. The 1984 version that the De Laurentiis studio took from Lynch and butchered into something they could quickly release for profit (they shot themselves in the foot with that dumb move) has stills that are works of set design, costume, and still photography high art. Some are saying this 2021 version is muted-looking, and it is, but I thought it worked well for the visual motif Villeneuve was going for. I actually agree with the choice of not showing the sand sharks, I mean worms, too soon. Restraint here is a virtue.The music, while at times overly-slathered with clichéd female Arabic vocalizations either too loud, too soon, or at all like some kind of early-2000s movie on Islamist terrorism, does go to some interesting places, and not always forgetting the Lynch version completely. Hans Zimmer I doubt will fib by saying that Eno and Toto were not at least subtle influences on him. Zimmer's Atreidies theme was spine-tingling. The separate sound design was great, too.All the dialogue is more naturalistic, informal, and condensed. I considered doing it that way, too, so it didn't bother me, and certainly that choice enhances accessibility, as does the aforementioned PG-13 if we want a sequel. We get more of an emotional Paul than prior versions, and while I thought the tent scene could have been longer, even more fleshed out, and better hinting at hidden mysteries to come, it emotionally went to the places I've wanted it to go for a number of years of thinking about how I'd do it. So at least emotionally that scene nailed a better iteration than the book, which is necessary, because the book is admittedly not perfect. I mean, you literally have to read the appendix at the end first to understand the rest of the book. The source material can be improved, folks.Another improvement: the Duncan character is beautifully enhanced and given a larger role than the book, including lines from other characters now given to him. This was wonderful. Bravo. It finally justifies and realizes the others' affection for him and his reputation.Another particular welcome change was a later confrontation that's flipped into a teaching moment from what would have been a mentor in an alternate timeline had circumstances or choices been different. Something that in prior versions and in the book is arguably anti-climactic is now the opposite. Paul here never lethally-kicked that Harkonnen in the head earlier, either, so that's another smart change that makes this new version's climax work even better. To have Paul experience the instructions and wisdom from this alternate path was brilliant and allowed this scene to have far more power & poignancy than ever before. It also allowed further insight into the intricate mechanisms & utility of Paul's growing prescience.Most of all, this film moved me, not only from lines or events on screen, but sometimes just this adaptation fully-realized... witnessing this achievement. Breathtaking is what I keep describing it as, in spite of its flaws. But heck, they've got plausible & believable ornithopters finally, and they didn't leave out the burning palm trees, which in my mind was always one of the most cinematic moments in the book that I couldn't understand why it was left out of the other filmed versions. That both those details were done well here meant they could have screwed up much more of this Dune and I still would have enjoyed it once. I've seen this several times in the theater now and then at home, was enthralled every time, but I strongly encourage it be seen in the theater.One last point: I was concerned when I heard Villeneuve wants to enormously expand the Chani role in the sequel compared to prior versions, including the book. I assumed this was more Me-Too 'woke' stuff motivating it, but now I'm not so sure. First, part one has demonstrated it could expand a character successfully. Second, Paul needs mentors, with Chani well-positioned for this. Third, the romance between them needs expanding. Finally, Chani has potentially even more desire for revenge than Paul. It'd be a rather ingenious awakening from idealized 'dream girl' to eventually disappoint the real her to avoid a particular future he's desperate to prevent. Some of the vision sequences here surprisingly hinted at that stronger connection, and that's a very impressive interpretation and potentially another improvement over the book if they pull it off in the sequel.",Dune

A fantastic cast with great direction and production. Part 1 is the entre and was needed to more truly show the characters of the main players, and gives insight into how they will react when things develop.

463,nooshie-33142,Style over substance - I'm still waiting...,6,6 November 2021,"I was eagerly anticipating ""Dune"" more than any movie of the past couple of years. I loved the books which I read as a teenager and was disappointed in David Lynch's crack at the story and the tv mini series with John Hurt. Sadly, I'm still waiting for the books to be brought convincingly to the screen. Yes, the movie looks good and some of the action set pieces are well done but the pace of the film is so boring that the actors seem to be sleepwalking through it. Perhaps Chalamet is the wrong actor to play the pivotal role of Paul? He's not dynamic enough and perhaps his acting style is not suited to a blockbuster movie and he's better in more intimate drama. You almost need to be bigger than the special effects and he just isn't. The rest of the cast do a workmanlike, nothing special job and leave it to the effects guys to produce the real substance of the film. The effects are fine but not as great or as exciting as I'd hoped. It was all a bit of a ponderous yawnfest and I really hope the sequel is better!",Dune

There was no tipping point in the story and it was like a lullaby suitable for wide screens or cinemas.",Dune
465,scott-1657,A beautiful adaptation,9,23 October 2021,"As a sci-fi fan, I read the Dune books back in the early eighties and was captivated by the series. It didn't go unnoticed by me how much of that was adapted by George Lucas into some aspects of Star Wars. I've seen the David Lynch film probably about half a dozen times-first, when released in the theater, and then on videotape and DVD. Must admit, I've fallen asleep every time I've seen it except for the first. However, it remains iconic, with its Baron Harkonnen and Kyle MacLachlan, Sting (!), and Patrick Stewart. I think Lynch did a very good job with the Guild ships and the Guild navigators, though the mood he struck seemed very different than the novel(s). But that's David Lynch.I watched Denis Villeneuve's version of Dune on HBOMax, on a decent-sized screen with a very good home sound system. It was spectacular to me. I'm sure it would be even a much more immersive experience in the theater. Maybe someday. People around here aren't great with masks and vaccinations.All that said, I think this is a masterpiece. Dune is an incredibly difficult book and series to adapt; because there's so much going on, how do you fit it in two, three, five, six hours? (Oh, I did see the TV adaptation with William Hurt and can honestly say I don't even remember it.)The visuals, effects, and music (Hans Zimmer for the latter) are beautiful. Most of the acting is par for the course for this type of film. I'm still a little undecided on Timothée Chalamet as Paul, because, as someone in another review commented, he seems a bit skinny and emo, but ... let's see who he grows into in the second part. I'm not sure Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica was perhaps as commanding as I remember her from the books. Josh Brolin was great (hard to fill Sir Patrick Stewart's shoes) but Jason Momoa ... I guess in a long line of ""hunks"" who really can't act, he seemed, to me, a little out of place in this movie. Javier Bardem as Stilgar was a little amusing to me; his accent reminded me of Tevye from Fiddler on the Roof. ;) All the other actors, including Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, et al., generally did what they were supposed to and were as three-dimensional as screen time and plot would allow.I think it was a wise idea to do this in (at least) two parts though, really, this one film is preparatory to the crux of the story. For its running time (just over 2-1/2 hours), I felt it moved pretty quickly, especially considering all it had to encompass. One thing I admire about the script-Dune (really an allegory) is pretty complicated, but I felt that everything was explained very clearly and unobtrusively enough that even a newbie who'd never read the books or seen previous versions could follow it. In fact, it almost seemed a bit simplified to me (in a good way), especially over the complicated Lynch version. Then again, have read and seen the previous iterations, it all came back to me anyway.In my opinion, this is by far the best, and maybe the ultimate, adaptation of Frank Herbert's first Dune book. It excels on many levels. And, finally, visual technology has caught up with storytelling. This is a film I will watch again.",Dune
466,prberg2,Really impressive film,9,27 October 2021,"Wow... what an Amazing experience! A very powerful experience. I saw it in the theater on opening weekend and it blew me away. Everything really worked well for me. Amazing score, amazing acting, wonderful cinematography, just a really well done movie. I like a lot of sci-fi.. but this really went past a regular sci-fi movie. The story was bigger than that.. and touched so many different aspects.In some ways it didn't feel all that different from the older Dune movie. But this certainly had it's own style and put more focus on different parts of the story. Really enjoyed it and it created such a unique and powerful world that the characters could live in. I think it captured more of the spirit of the books..and takes you on a journey all the while.Such a fun and amazing experience.. see it in the theater.. so worth it!",Dune
467,tobydale,Fantastic! Spectacular and brilliant.,10,21 October 2021,"Just got back from the cinema after watching this. First reaction; Fantastic!I suppose it would help if you've read the books - but I read those 40 years ago. I remember being completely gripped by the books - and hey, I was gripped by this part one of the adaptation.Frank Herbert's Dune has shaped Sci Fi - so much so that Star Wars of 1977 had to begin on a desert planet just the same, and the subsequent saga charts a similar coming of age. But Herbert did it first!Just about everything in this is perfect; story telling, imagery, photography, characterisation, music. It's hard to fault. The best stories ""get into your head"" - and this version of Dune certainly does.Paul Atreides finds himself swept by dreams and images that he has no understanding of. In him we see possibilites, potentials and promise. Much is left to the imagination - in our imagination as much as his. Timothée Chalamet is absolutely perfect in this role. I mean BRILLIANT - exactly as you'd imagine someone who knows he has power but doesn't understand it and is searching for meaning in his life.Dune is mesmeric - almost overwhelming. It builds brilliantly. The final 45 minutes is as good as any film you'll ever see. Stunning. I was almost breathless by the end and had tears welling. Not many films have this effect. Go and see it!",Dune

469,Filmiarvustus,Don't be fooled - this is ONLY PART 1 and SUPER SLOW PACE art movie,9,17 September 2021,"I am doing a full Dune wave here - going through all the board games, video games and even rewatched the 1984 movie, 3h version. Watched the 2 SyFy series as well and this was my most expected movie of the year.Movie premiered here tonight and damn I was excited. About hour into the movie I realized - this is not going to be full movie. The pace is slow - like slow below acceptable. The first half of this movie builds the world, sets the stage - I understand that, but the moment Paul and his mother escape the Harkkonnen, it comes to almost a stand still - it takes them the other half of the movie, up to like an hour, to reach Fremen. To compare, in the 1984 version this was about 4-5 minutes top. In the books it is like 2-3 pages, focus being on the tent scene between Paul and his mother. Why is this here so long? Do they want an award for adding runtime?The score of 1 is here until I can actually see the full movie. So we might have to wait 5 years, it might never come. Visuals and general production is superb. Music, acting, etc. Just pacing is very wrong - it feels wrong.Why was Jason Momoa in this movie? Bautista had under 1 minute of screen time? What is happening here?Be very careful on expectations here - the movie has almost no purpose and is like a pilot episode, that never got the series to explain and explore it.",Dune

At 2/3 of the way through, I am not invested in anyone, and I don't care what happens next, and i think i just won't finish it. The costumes are bland, and even though it's a sandy planet drenched in UV light, every piece of fabric looks brand new and never worn. Was that Charlotte Rampling behind those generic black beads? Really? What was the point if you couldn't tell. I thought she had no presence at all, could have been anyone. I like the actor who plays Lady Jessica, but not in this role, she has no charisma, no weirdness. While there are passages of fine sound design, the orchestral stuff is so ordinary and forgettable. Such bold casting, picking Jason Momoa to play Jason Momoa, bet the beancounters loved that one. And a smooth Nordic to play the vile-on-vile Baron, which fearless committee landed that buck of an idea? So many shots just needed another level of magic that's just not there.

""Ireland is coming"".The movie is not bad, but it looks like watching the first movie into sleeping pills. I do not see the point.And all of that for me is because of the artistic choices and the narratives who are weak.The kind of movie you watch 1 times each 4 years and no more.I was hopping an astonishing visual movie, i got a correct tv show
with low artistic choices.Something really important is missing : You never ever ear Paul talking to himself. Then, no more description of what happen by Paul himself. What is something who was important into the books and the first movie.

476,lurpak,dismal drivel,1,28 October 2021,"On the plus side, compared to the David Lynch version, I could actually follow the plot...on the down side, now I understand the plot, I realise why David Lynch avoided following it.The suspension of disbelief in the logic and scale of this drawn out tooth extraction, is your old trope about a prophesied special Harry Potter/jesus/avatar/king Arthur/endless other ""you're a wizard harry"" coming of age and finally their powers and destiny are revealed story.Combine this with the darkest dismal grey but over scaled cinematography supposedly set on a desert planet which has a super hot sun...you'd expect to actually feel the major issues that are supposedly the adversaries of life and development of this planet done so well many times in any desert based film, sadly not really explored other than telling you its dry. So how about letting us feel like its a dried out hot planet, not just an inconvenient plot hanger when it suits.I'll give it scale...for some reason everything is built huge, from walls to doors which are neither aesthetically pleasing or serve functional design purpose. So why did anyone bother building halls and rooms with 200 foot tall doors that they can walk down in ceremony like kings in GOT??? 10 people who walk through them a day? Why on a resource tight planet, are you building pointless empty grand gery and drab palaces???...because its the future...Erm ok!Theres these sandworms, what 300m long did they say? The size of tall buildings anyway, who survive on this planet and manage to grow to that size by eating what???? The occasional desert lost soul, and huge building size mining tanks...tasty! These creatures hear sound vibrations of your footprints on the desert as long as you walk with a stable beat...in which case they ignore you and carry on swimming through the sand crapping out spice. Which is easily avoided by maybe not walking, and using some of the endless hovering anti-grav tech, but for some reason people tend to prefer to walk across this desert. Because...well plot requires it.Theres the opportunity to terraform the planet we're told, but they decided not to and to live in a wasteland while they mined the spice, because ""Spice"". Yes, they couldn't terraform tthe whole thing because they found spice and that was a better commodity, however nobody thought to terraform a small part of an entire planet they live on for some reason, so they live in hell.There's some spice hooked natives whoiare in the millions, but need rescuing by the boy, even though they are better fighters than any man has ever seen, and outnumber the bad guys like a million to one...but they take the inhumanity and suffering while awaiting our Harry potter to finaly arrive and rescue them from the tirrany....because...well prophecy, they need him to lead them, without him they're busy recycling spit, because water is so scarce.This is set around an emperor ""of theknown universe"" with millions of planets under his command, double crossing the growing power of ""house atraidees"" (sp) which he fears (about 100 people I reckon, lead by our Harry Potter, his mum and dad. So being so powerful Emperor ruling over planets and solar systems he sets them up to fail, loyal subjects that they always were and seemingly not plotting against him, they need to die anyway (but not mum and boy thats part of the agreement). The army of miners who had been plundering the planet and being bad guys in general to the locals are in on the plot, they hand over the keys to the fiefdom of the spice planet to house atraidees. With crap mining materials so that the good guys will fail, and tehy swoop in and kill off whos left, which have not been killed by the harsh nature of the planet. After like 5 die by a worm eating one spice harvester, house artraidees are sufficiently weak enough for Hakkans to return and launch an attack of their 1,000 vs Atraidees what 50? (remember this is the emperor of the universe and an interstellar battle were meant to believe), with ships the size of moons, and millions of crew. (off camera for convenience).The tech, wow I love the dragon fly ships, awesome, nice original concept...despite being 10,000 ADish, people fight hand to hand with knives and tiny assasin drone needles that look like beetles, because guns are not suited to the plot.Oh, the agreement not to kill atraidees mum and son because theyre part of some matriarchal dynasty, but just because the Hakaans agreed not to kill them, there's no reason they shouldn't just keep letting them go assuming their dead in a Austin Powers Dr Evil assumption, where they use their super powers of ""telling people what to do"" Jedi mind trick is developing. And used to convince baddies to let them go. Yawn!But yes, its huge budget and huge scale spent badly so you know your seeing a lot of money and therefore something so expensive should be great...but its really not, when you look through the cracks, its superficially awesome in scale.. but cannot live up to the grandeur it pretends to be.Good visual effects does not make a great film, this is not great film and this idea that throwing money at effects means something is good is becoming all to common, its disappointing that people nowadays are so easily tricked into believing they're seeing something significant. Please look through that veil of effects and scale, and look at the drivel you are actually watching.",Dune
477,benjaminskylerhill,"A spectacle to behold, with not much to feel.",7,22 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite filmmakers. He is able to take grim stories of desperate characters and bring a sense of visceral beauty to them. And Dune: Part One has that awe-inducing beauty in abundance...but no tangible characters.This film is a translation rather than an adaptation. The plot of the novel's first half is very faithfully and stunningly adapted, which will please fans of the book! The political and scientific world building here is done flawlessly, and the exposition rarely, if ever, feels heavy handed. That is not an easy feat to achieve, and they did it effortlessly!It goes without saying, but the cinematography, visual effects, production design, and costumes/makeup are all beyond top-notch. Several Oscar wins are in order here.But beneath the glossy surface, the film suffers from the same flaws that plague other film adaptations of epic literature: the world-building crowds out the emotion and characterization.The heartbreaking betrayals and frantic fights of the novel are emotionally bereft here because we don't get inside any of the characters' heads like we do in the book. We rush from event to event and never have time to see how people think or feel about what is going on.I certainly felt a sense of wonder while taking in the beautiful world of Arrakis, but I didn't feel connected to it in any way. Perhaps this experience will improve retrospectively with Part II.",Dune

479,AGood,Did I watch a different film than everyone else?,1,25 October 2021,This film was quite literally one of the worst films I have ever saw. It was 2 and a half hours of nothingness. Almost nothing happened throughout but people standing around having conversations with each other. Which also weren't interesting at all.The trailer makes great emphasis to suggest Zendaya is the star of the film. Or at least has a big part in the film. I am not exaggerating she is literally in the film for around 5 minutes at the very end and says only around 5 words total in the whole film. Why did the trailer try and deliberately mislead people with this?There was no action in the film whatsoever. The only action scene in the entire 2.5hr film was a brief street knife fight at the very end. And a brief two minute scene to get out of being captured on a plane. That is all.I really wanted to like this as I love Denis Villeneuve movies. But this was just 2.5hrs of pretentious boredom.,Dune
480,Jonas1969,Serious attempt to film the ultimate Sci-Fantasy novel,8,22 October 2021,"Frank Herbert's novels still stand as the pinnacle of creative sci-fi-fantasy more than 50 years after it was written. In 1984 director David Lynch made his version a very shortened and almost cartoonishly exaggerated version. Denis Villeneuve takes a very different route. With a visual tone reminiscent of his films Arrival and Blade Runner 2048 and a somber tone and steady pace he delivers an interpretation much closer to the source material.Where the 1984 movie cut out all but the essential parts of the story Villeneuve splits the story in two and tries to include as much as possible from the book. This approach is probably better for those who know the source material but ends up including many characters that we barely get to know and never have time to care for in their brief appearances - unless we already know who they are.Detailed as it is it can't be as detailed as a book and I don't think those who haven't read the book will grasp the full scope nor the finer details. Despite all this it is still a fine film. The grandeur and scale is staggering, the visual detail is exquisite and an impressive cast manages to insert a lot of life into characters in the sometimes brief moments they have on screen.I hope a lot of people see it because otherwise part two may never get made and I really want to see if Villeneuve can tie it together because then it may become a classic just like his last two movies.",Dune

How in the world she keeps getting roles is a mystery to me. She's completely unimpressive in everything from talent to looks.I'm getting this first part a 5, and I think thats generous.

It's nowhere near LOTR. Yes the visuals are stunning and it would be a waste to see this kind of movie on small screen, but still comparing it with LOTR is futile. The story telling in LOTR was a lot easier on eyes and enjoyable. Here it's complex. Maybe if you copy the movie exactly from the book, this would be the result.

486,thatfilmperson,They forgot the story.,6,17 September 2021,"It physically pains me to leave a negative review for ""Dune"" and to give the film that I've been eagerly waiting to see for 2 years such a low score. Note: this was my subjective experience and I'm about to give my personal opinion on the film; I should mention that I am the only person I know who did not love it (although not many people have seen it yet). In any case, I suggest you still go see it in a theater by yourself and form your own opinion about it.A little intro for those of you who hear the word ""Dune"" in the context of a movie for the first time. ""Dune"" is a 60s science-fiction novel taking place in the time of advanced space travel. The family of young Paul (Timothy Chalamet) is burdened with protecting the planet Arrakis, a home to the most valuable resource in the galaxy: ""spice"". With it's hostile native people, giant sandworms and interstellar wars, ""Dune"" is described by some as ""Star Wars for adults"". This best-selling epic (which I haven't read) was not very successfully adapted to screen by David Lynch in 1984, but this 2021 film here was supposed to be The Adaptation that will please each and every fan and revive the epic story for the newer generations. The director Dennis Villeneuve has proven himself a master of filmmaking over the last 10 years (Blade Runner 2049; Arrival; Prisoners; Sicario). He seemed like the perfect man for the job, considering he did the impossible and made a sequel for a classic movie ""Blade Runner"" that turned out better than the original. As I saw it, ""Dune"" was supposed to be the biggest, the most exciting and the most expensive film of the year (just look at the cast), and the last time I've been that excited to see a film was probably Infinity War 3 years ago. I went for the best possible cinematic experience - IMAX 3D; and bought the tickets for the first release date in my country. Three hours later, I walked out of the theater in a bad mood. As they say: ""my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined"". And, after pondering on it for two days, it isn't at all because I set my expectations too high.There is this little thing called ""dramatic structure"": how any dramatic work such as a book or a film are or should be built. There are obviously deviations and different versions of it (things like Memento and Pulp Fiction still exist), but probably the most commonsensical, useful and widely-used one is called the ""Freytag's pyramid"" and consists of five parts: exposition (introduction to the characters and setting), rising action, climax, falling action and resolution. They give you this structure in school as an essay-writing guide. ""Dune"" is a 2h 35min exposition. There is no plot. They forgot the story. The movie is finished before any kind of rising action begins. After waiting for two years and three hours, you get a National Geographic documentary ""Life of Paul: Struggles on Arrakis"". I admit that I had no idea Villeneuve had planned that Dune would be a two-part movie from the very beginning, but I also can't be blamed because it was not at all clear from it's marketing; judging by the fact that the whole audience looked around in confusion after the abrupt non-ending - I wasn't the only one. That really doesn't matter though, I did not come to the cinema to watch a three hour introduction to something that may never even be made - Villeneuve never got a contract for a sequel yet, it will only be made if this piece of work makes enough money. How can you make a film without a cohesive story that relies entirely on it's continuation without ever being absolutely sure that this continuation is in the making? Why would you ever face those odds and why not make at least something of importance happen in part one, so it can be viewed and enjoyed as a standalone picture?It doesn't stop there. Perhaps this is more of a criticism of the source material, but Dune is like a made-up history book with all-too real actors, politics and little details. It's like ""The Martian"" with it's extreme scientific accuracy, but here the author thinks up a world and maximizes realism, thinking through all the little details about how this world functions: trade, spice harvesting, religion, wars... Usually it's amazing that authors pay so much attention to details, but in this case it doesn't work. It feels like you're watching a drama-documentary about some ancient (despite it being set in the future) civilization with every meticulous little detail built in. Like, really? You had a whole universe of creativity at the palm of your hand, an ocean of unlimited potential, and you chose to simply dress ""Earth geopolitics"" in a science-fiction disguise? I felt like setting these artificial intellectual boundaries by tying the story tightly to real-life problems and patterns seriously hindered Dune's creative potential. My point is - I did not come to the movies to watch the news.The annoying thing is how contrarily perfect the cinematic and visual aspects of the film are - Greig Fraser's cinematography, strongly reminiscent of the work of Roger Deakins, does not get any better than this. The unimaginable scale of the film is truly Nolan big, and the IMAX sound makes you feel the sand brushing against your cheeks. You can almost feel a slight, subtle scent of peaches emanating from the main character. Also, despite the limited room to play around in, the acting is simply top notch, an admirable ensemble with every single actor in their perfect place. However, when it comes to the soundtrack by my beloved Hans Zimmer, it felt pretty plain - cool at times, but very far from remarkable in comparison to anything of his previous works, from Interstellar, Inception and Gladiator to Lion King. But all these positive elements could not have ever made up for the biggest failure of them all - the simple lack of story. I watched the movie with my girlfriend and my cousin. They both loved it and I asked them to explain to me in 2-3 sentences what the movie was about. They couldn't. And neither could I, because it isn't about anything. It's a three hour introduction to a film that may never come to exist.Honestly, the trailer was more exciting than the film itself.",Dune
487,bradykitchen-33648,The start of something great,8,23 October 2021,"I loved this movie. Everything from the cinematography, costumes, choreography, effects, score, all flawless. The Acting holy cow the acting was phenomenal. Everyone did amazing and I was throughly impressed with Chalamet. He worries me usually but he did great. The story is intriguing and interesting and paced very well you don't feel you're there for 2.5 hours. They did a great job with the world building. They fleshed everything out and made it make sense. I have two issues with this movie first it can be a little confusing. They throw a lot of information at you and if your not paying attention you may be lost. Also it didn't really feel like the movie ended and that is because it technically did not. This is part one so once part two is released this criticism will essentially be mute. Dune is does an extremely good job of building this epic of a world and pairing it with actors that make their job look easy. From a technical standpoint it is flawless but required you to pay attention. Although their isn't an ending yet it sets up a sequel very well.8.5/10.",Dune
488,Tobeshadow,Great style and a genuine identity!,8,27 October 2021,"Just back from seeing this and on the whole I really enjoyed it. It didn't seem too concerned with over explaining plot points, rather letting the visual styles tell you where you are in the story. I think this is a smart way to bring new people into the world of Dune, particularly if they haven't read the book. The story is very heavy and the original film suffered from an overload of exposition which put a lot of people off. This new version still has to convey the same rich story but for me does it in a more organic way.The music and sound effects are immense in places, really pushing the low end and accentuating the grandiose moments being seen on screen. There were one or two nods of reverence to the original film but by and large this very much had its own style. The costumes were superb and it was just genuinely refreshing to watch a new sci-fi film that felt like it had its own identity. For me, too many modern sci-fi films fall into the trap of copy and paste CGI that makes the overall film very bland. Here the style feels fresh and each element feels like it belongs. My only criticism would be that I would have liked a slightly richer colour palette, particularly the scenes in the desert, but I sense this may be something explored more in the second part.Despite its shortcomings, I very much grew up with the original Dune and it holds a special place for me. I was therefore very nervous about this new version. I'm pleased to say this was unfounded and it was a real treat to finally see a director get to tackle this epic book with sufficient running time and more importantly some faith from the studio behind him. I will always adore Lynch's effort but very much look forward to seeing where Villeneuve takes this for Part Two!",Dune
489,vader1948,OMG not the book,1,22 October 2021,"I have given this film a fair look. It is visually ok but I believe who ever wrote the screenplay either never really read the book or just thought they would grab the cash and run. If FH were alive to see this he would be pretty upset. Wasted introduction unlike the original Lynch film, it gives no background to who what why or when. Far too much time spent on Paul's redundancy of the same vision. Way too many character changes by story and yes gender etc. I don't think I will waste time on ""Part Two"" and I feel sorry for those who have spent a large sum at the theaters to see this. Thank goodness it was free on my HBO/MAX streaming. The producers should have asked Peter Jackson to make it, it would have been awesome. !",Dune

I feel this director is following the book more closely. Anyway, this Part One of either a Two or Three part movie series was AWESOME!! I loved every moment of it!

493,benedictmichael-03235,Lawrence of Arrakis,10,22 October 2021,"A top rating because of Villeneuve's technical facility and aesthetic sense. Being easy to follow this film seems to have done okay in outlining the story, though it is not without its shortcomings.The most obvious is the soundtrack/music. Hans Zimmer's score is intrusive, noisy, and bombastic. It adds nothing to the film. It might be argued that it subtracts from it rather. It is emotionally hyperbolic and serves as unnecessary emotional signposting. I hope there is a version of the film without Zimmer's strident contribution or one where it is greatly, greatly reduced.Performances were good. Of the principal cast, the standout was Charlotte Rampling (Reverend Mother Mohiam). Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Dr. Liet Kynes) was out of her depth, alas, so her character's death was a mercy. Zendaya has nice smile but we'll have to wait and see if she can act.When Lynch stirred the pot back in the 80s, I tried to read the book, which was everywhere at the time, but it wasn't my cup of tea, and I didn't bother with Lynch's film version, as I hadn't liked 'The Heffalump Man', and didn't like the ham, Sting, having a role in it (a ham roll, if you will).An academic in the humanities can be defined as someone educated beyond the level of their intelligence. So it was that an academic has written rather foolishly that Paul leads a jihad not a crusade. It needs to be remembered however that 'Dune', the book, was written in the afterglow of Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia' and its extraordinary success. Paul Atriedes is clearly the godson of T. E. Lawrence, and Lawrence a northern European of Welsh descent.",Dune
494,Chris_Ego,A modern remake in hard competition,7,2 October 2021,"First off I read the graphic novel and watched the Lynch film again only one year before the Villeneuve version, so my comparison is undeniably evident. While this 2021 version of Herbert's ""Dune"" focuses solely on the first half of the original book director Villeneuve introduces the characters and the basic story. I guess two sequels will follow.The cinematography and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are impressive as you might assume. Some aircrafts like the firefly choppers are weird to watch and hard to imagine being airborne. The architectures look really good, but not as convincing as the buildings and the interior were portrayed in the Lynch version. And there comes the inevitable comparison: David Lynch put it all darker and grittier while Villeneuve made a shiny and polished remake. And why? I do not know. Let's hope the sequels make a soulful trilogy because this movie doesn't stand on its own.",Dune
495,alejandro-bonilla,"The proposal offered by Denis Villeneuve is a better one, a very different approach from the one that in my mind had been created by anticipation.",8,30 October 2021,"When you have been waiting for several years for a movie to come true, the expectations are so high that it is so easy not to meet them and that you end up disappointed, it has happened to me many times. But Dune is not the occasion, on the contrary I feel that it did not meet my expectations but that the proposal offered by Denis Villeneuve is a better one, a very different approach from the one that in my mind had been created by anticipation and although in some way it has everything I wanted . I remember the first time I was introduced to the fantastic world created by Frank Herbert at the hands of Alejandro Jodorowsky in the documentary that recounts his odyssey to create this movie (which is why I never wanted to see David Lynch's version). Now that is what stands out the most of this film, although at the beginning I was impressed by the detail of its costumes and makeup, the cinematography little by little will take over the focus of attention, together with an excellent editing work and the disorientation compas of his music. A movie that if you had to define it in one Word it'll be elegance. Elegance that is appreciated in each of its technical aspects and that allow us to enter this fantastic new universe where we can appreciate shadows of our own reality. Ultimately it cannot be denied that this elegance is provided thanks to the perfect administration of Villeneuve in time, form and structure.",Dune
496,trcky1,"Great visuals, awful sound editing",5,10 November 2021,"Score might've been higher if I'd seen it at home with subtitles on. Great visuals, pretty decent plot movement.However a lot of the story gets lost because half the dialogue is inaudible as the sound effects are deafeningly loud and painful and the decision was made to have the characters whisper about half the time with a loud score playing or sound effects playing. I'm sure the story would've been great, as Villanueve is a great storyteller, which is why it was excited to see his adaptation of Dune. I understand whispering for performance effect but the dialogue volume has to be increased if the scene is set to loud effects or music. I tore up some napkin to place in my ears, and the effects and percussions were still too loud and painful at times. This is very fixable, as a trailer for the Batman played right before Dune and every spoken word was clear and audible in that trailer, even when set to dramatic score or sound effects. I hope this can be fixed in a re-master and in any subsequent productions.",Dune
497,Millennialprince,Solid film,8,22 October 2021,"Slide, slide, slippery slide, I do what I want just to survive. Just say hello. Sorry, I couldn't resist, I had to make a Lakeside reference. I can't help but think of that song as Lady Jessica and Paul were doing the sand walk to avert the sandworms. Before I continue I want to point out I haven't read the 1965 Frank Herbert novel. Nor have I seen the David Lynch film from the '80s, so I'm coming at this film from a fresh perspective. You know before I watched the film, I saw all these critical blurbs on television calling Dune the next Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Honestly, after watching this film those comparisons are erroneous from my perspective.Dune is a slow meditative story about the nature of power and how it corrupts. It's not a simplistic yarn about good versus evil. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings have their place in pop culture but Dune is a different beast altogether. Dune is a social commentary about how the thirst for natural resources splits people into political schisms. And if you want to compare Dune to anything it's Game of Thrones. The main character Paul is groomed by his parents into being a leader for House Atreides, but he's conflicted about being a leader.He doesn't like the political machinations of House Atreides. His father the Duke wants to form a political alliance with the Fremens so they can fight the Harkonnens. Paul feels that these political calculations are dishonest and manipulative. And I like having a protagonist in a film that is conflicted; it makes him come off as more relatable and human. This film is very dense and it took me a while to get into it. The first hour of the film does a lot of world-building and planet-hopping but I was able to understand it. Clearly, spice is meant to be an allegory for oil, so the parallels to our world are easy to understand even to a plebeian like me. This film isn't perfect by any means.Certain characters are sacrificed just to serve Paul as a character. I know this is a deconstruction of the messiah story, but I wish they would have focused on the relationship between the Emperor and the Duke more. That way when the Duke gets betrayed by the Emperor in the second act, you feel the sting of the betrayal more. But the Duke does get a badass moment, where he almost kills the Baron with poisonous gas. So I guess that made up for any story shortcomings I had with the film. On an acting level, this film is pretty solid.This is a huge ensemble film, and I didn't find a single false note with any of the performances. Honestly, Jason Momoa stood out to me; he was so charismatic and funny that I was bummed out when his character Duncan Idaho died. I guess that's a testament to Momoa as a performer. Also on a technical level, this film is impressive. All the starships feel unique and different from other things I've seen in other space operas. I love how a lot of the starships look like dragonflies; it gives the world of Dune a very alien feeling.They also don't overuse the sandworms in this film. The sandworms are a very powerful and looming presence. And you get the sense that whenever they show up; things might go south for our heroes. In conclusion, I would highly recommend Dune if you like more thoughtful science fiction films. Although this film has spurts of action this isn't an action extravaganza. This is more like Game of Thrones, where you have an internal political struggle between ancient dynasties. And I must say at 147 minutes the film never bored me. I look forward to seeing what Denis Villeneuve does with Dune part 2. Nuff said.",Dune

That's it.,3,23 October 2021,"This movie draws heavily on David Lynch's version os the story.Naturally , the story was deformed to align it to politically correct standards.If you like the books, you're going to resent this. Frank Herbert created a vision of a desert-dwelling people, in all aspects similar to the Touareg. There are no women in leadership positions among the Fremen, though they are an integral part of society and by no means frail or defenceless. Throughout the story there are important, influent and even brutal women.There was no real need to mangle it.They changed so many relevant aspects of the story....many that die in the book (and in Lynch's version) are kept alive, with obvious repercussions.Gurney Halleck and Lyet Kines (now a black woman and, thus, virtually untouchable...) survive the attack on Arrakis. Kines lectures Paul.And they do die shortly after, in the most stupid and predictable way.It's a freak show, actually...Of course, fans of the books will see this movie.

500,Nixon_Carmichael,A beautifully made and well crafted snoozer.,4,23 October 2021,"Dune is the remake of the remake of the Frank Herbert novel of the same name, from the 1960s. Denis Villanueva masterfully crafts this movie as meant to be seen on the biggest screen possible, the problem is that it's a nearly three hour slog.The pacing of Dune is not a slow burn, it's a no burn. Also problematic is that this current version only covers the first half of the first book, in which nothing happens.Think of this as the cinematic version of Season 1 of Game of Thrones, in space.The acting, cinematography and score are all top notch, the problem is that the screenplay is a disaster. It is three hours of world building with absolutely no pay off at all, like whatsoever.See it on the biggest screen possible if you must see it, just for the spectacle itself. Watching this on HBOMAX would be an exercise in futility.",Dune
501,korereviews,I love Denis Villeneuve...,6,25 October 2021,"...but this was quite a letdown. I can't help but wonder if the poor box office of Blade Runner 2049 had something to do with the Dune we ended up with here, and I suspect the director's cut of this film will be better. That said, I think there were more fundamental problems that a re-edit won't fix.First: the soundtrack was awful - ranged from boring to irritating and overall was very generic and bland. Usually Zimmer delivers better than this; certainly his BR 2049 score was vastly superior. By comparison, the main theme for Dune 1984 was imperious, dramatic and immediately set the mood for the film. The score for this version sounds like it could have been for any of a dozen different films.Second: the pacing and storytelling were poorly executed, as pretty much everyone has noted. Villeneuve insisted on splitting the first book into two parts, but this first part doesn't feel like it needed to be its own film. The entire thing just feels like a preface to the film you want to be watching.Third: the best and most interesting aspects of this film were sped over to make time for its least interesting aspects. The Harkonnens were one of the coolest elements in the film, but barely even appeared. The space guild looked amazing, but were hardly present. Ditto for the Bene gesserit. But we have endless tedious slo-mo shots of Zendaya's face and Paul's visions. Poor choice of priorities.Overall, the main thing this film reminded me of is how awesome the 1984 David Lynch version was. It has been (I think, quite unfairly) panned over the years, but it was much more daring and creative than this version. Admittedly, it also contains some cheezy aspects that don't stand up well, but on the whole, it offers much more of what I want from sci-fi: to be transported to an evocative and alien realm.Villeneuve's Dune is beautiful, but feels much more terrestrial than alien - almost banal at times. The buildings on Arrakis mostly reminded me of brutalist architecture from the 1960s. The ""ornathopters"" and battle scenes had a very ""desert storm"", American miltary feel to them. Nothing had a very alien ambience - except for the elements I mentioned above, which they passed over much too quickly. Ironically, Villeneve's ""Arrival"" was amazing for resonating with a truly skin-prickling, surreally alien vibe. It's a shame more of that didn't translate into this film. And despite being a dark and serious sort of film, Dune 2021 lacks the weight and gravitas of Dune 1984. The latter felt like an event, in a way that this new one just fails to capture.In terms of casting and performances, the result is also mixed: all of the Harkonnen casting was great, Rampling as the bene gesserit mother is perfect, Ferguson and Isaac were solid as Paul's parents. Probably the standout character for me though was Javier Bardem as Stillgar, who was almost alone in bringing genuine presence to his character. But Chalomet as Paul fell rather flat for me. He was okay; but the protagonist of your film needs to be more than okay - he needs to have charisma. And Chalomet doesn't. He comes across more as a limp, annoying millennial. Overall, the casting of Dune 2021 offers nothing to surpass Dune 1984.",Dune

503,vadim-berman,"Best adaptation so far, but some nuance is gone",8,19 September 2021,"Dune is a spectacular movie, but I can't give it 10 having read the book.The visuals are a gold standard. Villanueve is evolving as an artist, and if you imagine what the person who made Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 can do with a bigger budget and a bigger universe, you get Dune. Every single element of the Dune universe is faithful to the book and is beautifully realistic.The cast is great, with Chalamet and Bautista being standouts. Glossu Rabban is given a bigger role than in the book, even though it's still minor, and Bautista does not disappoint.The story: the universe of Dune is complex and the narrative is full of intersecting plot lines. Instead of blindly following the book, the adaptation is more focused and the expositions are not on the nose.However, maybe it's inevitable with a big screen adaptation, but some important plot points were lost. For example, the revelation of Paul about their connection to the Harkonnens, or the more detailed explanation about the imperial politics and the great houses. The importance of the spice production and what it does is not highlighted. Instead of the tangled web and complex origin story, it's basically foreign invaders oppressing indigenous people to extract resources. We are shown the mentats, briefly, but they are basically advisers... and that's it. Where is the mention of the ban on the thinking machines?The House of Corrino, the Spacing Guild, Feyd-Rautha are not shown. Hope they will be featured in Part 2.I suppose that's one of Villanueve's strong points, the ability to focus. But I remember the book well, so it feels like parts are missing.",Dune

505,yooniverse,"Beautiful, but not necessarily better than Lynch's Dune",7,18 October 2021,"The movie is well-written, directed and beautifully shot. There are few things that I thought was glossed over that took away from the epic tale. Much of the depth of characters is discarded early. For example, Dr. Yueh's backstory is entirely omitted (Suk School grad), which would have given more weight to his role. The Baron and Rabban also lack the same sort of repulsiveness and sinister ruthlessness. The Spacers Guild is just a mere sentence or two in the narration. In that regard, Lynch did much better. And since most of the fremen won't be relevant until Part 2, their presence in this movie is negligible.What is done right is the.flow of the story and the stunning visuals, and the limited narration to make it easier for those unfamiliar with Dune to jump in and follow the story. In a way, the whole screenplay is stripped down to the bare minimum. You have to appreciate how difficult it must have been, given that Villenueve spends two-and-half hours for half of the first book, and how impressive it was for Lynch to get the whole story crammed in just under three hours.The acting is generally good, though only a modest improvement for a few of the characters vs. Lynch's cast.I'm looking forward to Part 2, if it gets made! If not, this is an incomplete movie that can't stand on its own, and I think many will be very disappointed.",Dune
506,smoothrunner,Villeneuve in his best!,6,20 October 2021,"Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune unexpectedly impressed me, at least much more than Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. Perhaps because I didn't expect much from Villeneuve's film. The fact is that, firstly, Herbert's book is fundamentally impossible to film, since its ""highlight"" is focused on the thoughts and inner experiences of the characters, which often do not coincide at all with their behavior. Secondly, the political climate in Hollywood and the United States in general is now not free from the influence of one of the ideologies, which openly imposes certain taboos and prescribes certain conventions for filmmaking. The first could not but lead to a simplification of the plot by the director, inclined to visual narration. And the second factor inevitably destroys the balance built by the author between factions and sexes in the book, as well as the atmosphere in general and Herbert's religious and political hints. Both of these factors are present in Villeneuve's film, but, surprisingly, Denis still managed to ""loop between the drops"", creating not quite an adaptation of Herbert's Dune, but quite a fascinating version of his own ""Dune"". The audiovisual component, as always with Villeneuve, is luxurious, and even to some extent compensates for the simplification of the plot and the unrevealed thoughts and experiences of the characters. Modern political taboos and conventions are also present, manifesting themselves in cut out ""politically incorrect"" dialogues, shifted accents, altered scenes, races and even the sexes of the characters, but they are skillfully smoothed out without disturbing the atmosphere or mocking the common sense of the viewer, thus not destroying the wall between viewer and narration. Villeneuve has managed to make the viewer, at least me, to wait for the continuation of the narration, interrupted in mid-sentence. By the standards of modern Hollywood, Dune is a great movie.",Dune

For some reason the heavy dialogue of the books, where all the disparate things are connected has been replaced with slow motion scene's, lots and lots and lots of slow motion scenes. Having read the books I understood what was going on, but at times I was like, what's the point of this scene? When pivotal characters die, I was just like, whatever. One main character just vanishes completely! At least the ""woke"" has been toned right down. Also if I remember rightly Dune is set like 10'000 years in the future, I mean it's been 20 years since I read the books, but I don't remember them using MPH? The battle scenes... not sure how you make a battle involving 10,000's of people boring and incidental, somehow Villeneuve managed it. I actually fell asleep half way through and had to watch it in two goes.Herbert created a living breathing galaxy in the books, they don't need interpreting, just put the books on the screen, a al Lord of the Rings, that's what this movie is a ""Villeneuve interpretation"". I even got a sense he may not have even read the books. It's like he watched the previous movies took notes of the pivotal moments then tried to fit them into his vision of some kind of desert movie.

So you cant say ""this movie stole from XYZ"", in fact it might be the other way around, but this still feel like an unnatural and forced combination of Star wars and MadMax, when it comes to the story structure and cinematography.The ""story"" is 0% engaging, the movie is only 2.5 hours long but it feels like 4h and I dont know how often I checked my watch during this movie. It drags on for way longer than it should and I still cant remember much of what happened.This is what happens when an amazing star esemble cast meets too many effects and focusses to little on the writing and dialogues.

510,jditch,Cinematographic Masterpiece,10,20 October 2021,"If Dune (80s) is a Bob Ross, this is the roof of St Peter's Basillica.Sometimes the way a film is presented makes an impact so powerful you question how others got it so wrong. Dune does that. Every scene is scattered with frames you could print and hang on your wall. I think this will be the film that we look back on in decades to come and say ""That was Villeneuve's masterpiece"".I'm not book obsessed. I also can't delude myself that the original Dune film can stand up under the microscope. Unfortunately like much of what we love, time tricks us in to remembering events as better than they were. This Dune is better in every single way.The cast is good, but their performances are fantastic. I've often thought of Momoa as somewhat overrated. Now I see the talent and intensity that he brings in a unique way. Timothee Chalamet is magnificent, something I almost expect at this point. Ferguson was fantastic too, as was everyone. Even small parts were acted wonderfully. But this goes back to the way the film was directed and produced. Angles and introductions are often made in dramatic but thematic ways. I can't speak to specifics without spoiling things. I won't. But let's just say that many times, characters we've heard of but haven't met are introduced in equally fitting ways. It's smart filmmaking and creates a feeling of everything being in it's correct place.The digital effects were right on point too. Nothing looks unbelievable, which is impressive in a world set 8000 years in the future. Everything seems plausible, every impossibly large vehicle believable. This is hard sci-fi at it's absolute best and I can't think to another film that did it better. Some maybe reached it equally, but not better. It's special, truly.It was refreshing to not know where the film was going, too. I've started reading the first book, Dune. But I haven't yet finished it and I'm glad I didn't. I had no idea what was going to happen and my expectations were exceeded.Perhaps somethings are different to the books, I can't tell you if they were. But if it has, I'm not so sure it really matters. Some will tell you the original is better, it's not. Those people with all due respect are insane. The cast, audio, digital effects, cinematography, acting, script are all superior in almost incomparable ways.

But I also think Dune is just too dense to be done well as a feature film.Even at 2 hrs 36 minutes run time, and where this film was only half of the book, it still felt rushed. Not enough character development for Halleck, Idaho, Thufir Hawat, Rabban, or Baron Harkonnen. And no Feyd Rautha Harkonnen at all... I guess in this version Rabban is supposed to be heir to House Harkonnen? It's just weird that we wouldn't even see Feyd Rautha if he is going to be in the second film, but Feyd Rautha was a primary foe of Paul in the second half....The first 60% of this movie was very well executed, but the battle for the city felt rushed, and it just didn't feel like the movie ended at a spot that made sense. I wish the film had ended before meeting up with Stilgar.In my opinion, those scenes with the Fremen didn't portray the emotional weight of the books.... I mean, these are a people meeting their ACTUAL MESSIAH for the fist time...And Paul has to kill a man for the first time ever to prove his mettle.

I appreciate his previous works, Great cgi, visuals, cinematography etc. I didn't like the actor choices though. As if there is an unwritten rule in Hollywood that every scifi movie has to cast oscar Isaac. Also I waited a one liner from Batista almost every scene he's in. Yet the major problem here is the this is clearly first half of a completed movie. I guess they've splitted it to two halves and this is the first one. I understand it from the false advertisement. Almost every video clip and still images that I've seen before watching the movie belong to the last 10-15 minutes and even from a possible sequel (second half of the actual movie).Character development is pretty weak and director focuses on visuals rather than character backgrounds. It reminded me a Tarsem movie. I couldn't grow any sympathy or connection to the characters at all. And most importantly because of it's the first half of the story, it doesn't stand on its own as a movie.The major issue here is that this is not a tv show. We won't be able to see what's going to happen afterwards in a week. It'll take at least a year, maybe more. And if the viewers are not satisfied by the movie, maybe we will never see it.

515,jdank37,Can't wait for part two,9,22 October 2021,The future is bleak in the beautifully desolate world of Dune painted by Denis Villeneuve. I did not read the novel or see David Lynch's 1984 version but loved this movie and want to now. It is a bit of a slow burn but at the same time is immensely gripping and leaves you wanting to watch the next 3 hours.,Dune
516,computer2computer,"The original of 1984 was a masterpiece, this new one is good, very good at best",8,21 October 2021,"1- In the original Dune of 1984, Paul Atreides was an inspirational peerless Messiah...

And considering how long it is you never feel any connection or feelings for any of the characters. The action scenes aren't as good as the original, the sound quality is poor, and so is most of the acting. Having a few big names in it isn't going to help if the script is poor.

518,zanghi_james,"Visually stunning, but lacks everything that is truly important about the story",4,26 October 2021,"My interest in Frank Herbert's universe of ecology and politics in a science-fiction world started at a young age, but I didn't really get interested until watching the iconic documentary about Alejandro Jodorowsky's Dune. I since watched both cuts of Lynch's Dune and seen the extended cut of Harrison's Dune miniseries and now, very recently, I have watched Villeneuve's Dune. And In the immortal words of a certain son of Krypton who appeared in a vastly superior film earlier this year on the same streaming service: 'Not. Impressed.'Visually, the movie looks great. The casting is near-perfect. The special effects are breathtaking. But the script is basically a rehashed version of the first part of Lynch's Dune, minus the Sonic Weapons.The story is really the most important part to Dune, and this film butchers it completely. There is so much left out that would have given this film such a more epic feel such as things like Princess Irulan, The Butlerian Jihad backstory, the Guild Navigators, Feyd-Rautha, the Padishah Emperor himself, Count Hasimir Fenring and Lady Margot Fenring, the State Dinner which introduces us to the Spice Smugglers, Thufir Hawat's confrontation with Jessica where she uses the Weirding Way on him, Piter de Vries' lustful feelings for the Lady Jessica and the choice he is offered by Baron Harkonnen. All this could have made this Dune far more interesting and John Harrison was able to pull most of it off in a low-budget miniseries episode.What infuriates me also is that Denis Villeneuve claims that he is being true to the story and he doesn't want to 'fracture it into pieces', yet he is literally doing that. It would be one thing if it was studio interference like with Zack Snyder's Justice League, but there reportedly wasn't at all with Villeneuve's Dune until I know otherwise. Until I do, I consider Villeneuve' a total hypocrite.Also, the movie claims to cover the first two thirds of the novel. Having actually read Frank Herbert's book several times...it barely goes over one-third of story in the novel. To me, ending the movie right after the Jamis knife fight and arriving at Stietch Tabr is not two-thirds of the book. Two-Thirds of the book means Jessica takes the Water of Life and Paul starts teaching the Weirding Way to the Fremen Warriors to take back Arrakis from the Harkonnens.So, if you want a more accurate and faithful adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel that not only tells the details but also elevates and expands the story, watch the SyFy miniseries by John Harrison. It's far better even though the special effects are pretty bad. Also, the score by Graeme Revelle for the mini-series is almost iconic in comparison to Hans Zimmer's instantly forgettable techno beats.",Dune
519,JoelAlexanderr,A immersive visual feast that proves to be the sci-fi event of the year,10,24 October 2021,"Never has the simultaneous release on HBO Max and theaters been a disservice to a movie more than it has for DUNE, the new big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel. From an outsider perspective, it seems like every single shot of this two hour and 35 minute epic cost millions of dollars to produce, and every cent was worth it to create one of the most visually staggering films of the past couple years. Despite the film's very lengthy runtime, the film never seems to drag or be anything less than enthralling, and by the end of the movie I found myself thinking that I could have watched two and a half hours more.Part of the genius of DUNE is how it makes the lore of an 800 page sci-fi novel feel simple and understandable to any audience member who may choose to watch. The main story follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the young son of the very powerful and influential House Atreides, led by his father Duke Leto Atreides (a standout Oscar Isaac). Once the former rulers of the desert planet Arrakis, the House Harkonnen, pull out and return to their home world, House Atreides is tasked by the Emperor to become the new harvesters of the most valuable commodity of the universe, found only on Arrakis. Hidden rivalries, mysterious prophecies, and dreams that foretell an uncertain future are all powerful players in this complicated chess game, yet in many ways this film is just a simple coming-of-age/hero's journey story akin to Star Wars.The way that director/writer/producer Denis Villeneuve, who is easily one of the best filmmakers working today, manages to make DUNE both a grand epic about imperialism, feudalism and the corruption of politics while also centering a very human and personal turn of events involving a boy trying to live up to his father's legacy and make the world a better place is on the same level with some of the best science fiction ever put to screen. Even during scenes that contain some of the largest and most sophisticated visual effects physically possible, viewers will find their concentration focused on the characters and the impact these events have on them. Villeneuve has already proved how fantastic he is at delivering grand, yet personal films with projects like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, but here he proves just how gargantuan he can get budget-wise while continuing to deliver incredible stories.Similar to his previous films, Villeneuve delivers such an extreme feast for the eyes that he can almost get along on that alone. Director of photography Greig Fraser contributes to the gorgeous imagery, knowing exactly when to drain the color from a shot while creating a visual that comes across similar to a futuristic painting. The way Fraser's lighting combines with the out-of-this-world visual effects creates an immersive experience like no other, and makes this the clear frontrunner for both awards at the Oscars (The Green Knight needs to watch out). It goes without saying, then, that the world-building is utterly spectacular, to the point that when the movie ends it feels like stepping out of a portal to another dimension. For two and half hours, the audience is in another world entirely, and only when the first credit comes on-screen do they remember the obligations they have in their own lives.While the movie is a bit long and a lot to take in, it never feels like a slog to sit through or a waste of time. Even in the more personal scenes with two actors planning out the next political move of their house, the stakes are felt and the audience's understanding of the DUNE universe expands ever so slightly. Part of this is due to the effortlessly great acting on display, even on scenes where one is not conscious of the many A-list actors scattered throughout this movie. Timothée Chalamet proves that he can carry the emotional weight of an 165 million dollar sci-fi epic without even batting an eye, which is no easy feat. Those who aren't already on the Chalamet bandwagon will have a hard time staying off of it between this and The French Dispatch. Rebecca Ferguson also quietly flaunts her versatility as an actress by playing the mother of House Atreides, and Oscar Isaac is the emotional core of the film, delivering a typically strong performance that will get no recognition as per usual.DUNE is one of those movies that single-handedly pushes the bar higher for what is visually and artistically possible with big-budget adventure films. I would say this type of occasion is a rarity, but Villeneuve has accomplished this great feat with his previous three films along with this one, proving how genius of a filmmaker he is. While it is hard to compare DUNE to Villeneuve's previous masterpieces (Blade Runner 2049 and Prisoners are still vying for my personal favorite), this is undoubtedly a film that will stand apart from the rest in many ways, while becoming the definitive big-screen version of Frank Herbert's Dune (sorry, David Lynch). DUNE may not be for everyone, especially for those who want a fast-paced action-thriller or those who are only watching for Zendaya, who is in the movie for all of 15 minutes. Whatever one's personal thoughts, DUNE is a film that will be brought up in conversations decades from now, which to me is definitive proof of the awe-inspiring experience one will have after entering the theater.A+",Dune

But nearly all the footage featuring that creature made its way to the promotional video material. Outer space has even less screen-time and the spaceship design is unimaginative. And again, the machinery does not occupy a lot of screen-time. As for the plot, there isn't much of it, especially for such a long movie. Some of the actors are good, but the script does not really care about the characters. And when it does, it raises pretty serious questions. Take the main character, for example, isn't he supposed to look better than the way he does? His body belongs in one of the ""Hunger Games"" districts, not in a noble family bathing in wealth and resources, let alone training for battle. The kid makes Kylo Ren look like a colossus. And why do they use cutting weapons instead of firearms or blasters? They have mastered interstellar travel and yet they use knives in a war. Why not wooden sticks, then?The plot is scarce, boring and dumb, the visual effects are strong, the cinematography is not. Again, there isn't anything much to look at with the exception of a handful of moments. Like the sandworms and some of the brightly colored dream sequences the main character has. But those are moments, nothing more. The music was an unstoppable stream of tasteless noise with one memorable melody. That melody, like the sandworm, is featured in the promotional materials. The soundtrack is just annoying, it is not good. And, interestingly enough, if one is to compare this movie to another like it, a good comparison would be Disney's ""John Carter"", only that movie was a naive fantasy. Naive, but also beautiful and heroic, and adventurous, however old-fashioned and out of place it was in the twenty-first century, it was, at least, entertaining, and it wasn't pretentious.

It's slow-paced and sometimes seems a bit long and repetitive. Performances are great and so is the direction! And 'This is just a beginning'. Highly recommended! ❤",Dune

527,knifemagnet,Look at all that pretty CGI!,3,26 October 2021,"Why does the emperor want to get rid of these people - why would he fear them? Why would the spice planet have anything to do with this - couldn't the Atreides be taken out without giving them the spice planet that is, for some reason, oh so important? What is spice and why is it important? By the way, who is the emperor? What's the Harkonnens story (beyond the one sentence we get)? Where is character development (it took me four tries to meander through this and I couldn't give a toss about anybody in this)? It's the year 10,191 so why is everyone running around like it's 1191 with swords? Why is the volume all over the place - with some parts so low you can hardly hear anything? Who cares - check out that CGI!I can put two and two together and don't need my hand held but this story, as edited here, is hardly a story. This film is a convoluted mess and what they give you, if you are not a Dune fanatic that has read the books, is scant.It seems some people forgot what movies are supposed to be about. Movies are supposed to tell stories first and foremost. If you watch a film and come out raving solely about the cinematography, the visuals, etc, something is wrong. And what's wrong is you just witnessed a vacant film propped and dressed up substantially by CGI and effects. Read the reviews people have written; you will see all sorts of comments on visuals and not much about the adaptation of the story. That's telling.",Dune
528,Seb_3,A visual audio odyssey,10,19 October 2021,"Earlier this year I read the book by Frank Herbert in anticipation for the movie and fell absolutely in love with the world, political systems and characters, and I think that every sci-fi lover should read the book, despite the high page count. There really is a reason why this is a timeless classic and I can truly see how this changed sci-fi for years to come and inspired some of the greatest like Star Wars. Now that being said, does the movie live up to the book(s), definitely! I personally loved it!Denis Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer, the perfect duo for a movie like this. Together they truly manage to capture the essence and feel of dune. They understand the material and bring the movie up to a whole other level of epic, and with a star studded cast to back them up, this comes no short of a masterpiece in my opinion. Everyone brings their A-game to craft something truly spectacular.Even if you're not a fan of sci fi or dont know the books, its a must watch, just for the experience. My mate who didn't know anything going in, absolutely loved it. The sheer scope and bombardment of mesmerizing visuals and sound, its a feast for both your eyes and ears. Each frame prettier than the one before, every audio cue and song feels handcrafted and thought out for the world.Denis Villeneuve's style isn't for everyone, but I feel like this will go down as a classic for what cinema has become. Personally I love his approach to filmmaking and think he is up there among some of the greatest.Of course this is only the first half of the book and some may feel that it ends in its second act, but with a movie like dune, you have to split it up. To me It felt like a concluding ending, for now, but still with so much more to come. To me, this is a modern masterpiece that needs to be experienced in a movie theater! Dune was everything I could have ever hoped for and I can't wait to see what they have in store for part 2.10/10.",Dune
529,scotrep,Beautiful but lacking,7,21 October 2021,"Although, the feel of this offering was more like reading the book, I preferred the characters from the 80s movie. 2021 Baron was just a fat man....80s Baron was REALLY sinister and powerfully played.Reverend Mother wasn't very commanding either.

530,patrick-91640,An overwhelming experience,9,19 September 2021,"Dune is an experience made for cinema. Do yourself a favor, spend your money and don't wait for it to appear on streaming. The Visuals, music, and sheer epicness are overwhelming. These alone are worth your watch.But that's not all. Characters, actors, set pieces, plot, and the whole production value is also top-notch.I haven't read the books so I don't know if the film stays true to the source material. But other reviews hint that this is the case. So even Fans will get their desired dose.To put it short: dune is a modern masterpiece and a Must have for any sci fi fan.",Dune
531,Deux_Vega,It begins with the end,7,25 September 2021,"Lets start with saying I loved the new Blade Runner and Arrival from Villeneuve. I thought they were very masterful movies. I thought picking him for the long awaited and highly anticipated Dune classic novel was an obvious choice.And he didn't disappoint in terms of presentation and atmosphere in Dune. That somewhat dreamy, arty, raw style Is becoming a trademark of him. The mix of dreamy and disturbing sound effects helps bringing those abstracted pictures to an intriguing state. The cast is very good as well.And yet, I was conflicted the whole movie. At times I felt almost bored and annoyed with the abstraction of the images. Those empty, sepia, greyish slowed down scenes did really bother me at times. Enforced by the fact that It caused me to not really connect with the characters. I would have loved a bit more diversity in the images, but also in the timing of things. It all kept going in the same pace and style.The mix of that abstraction and then the mother crying all the time, in a sort of distant observing state without any connection just didn't make sense to me. Especially knowing her role in the whole epic being a strong pragmatic woman in one scene and a sad little bird in the next one. It made her character confusing.The emptiness of every shot enforced that feeling of being an observer, It created distance instead of immersion. Yet, at the same time, that arty imagery, the sound effects with a somewhat spiritual layer kept me intrigued as well. There was this constant anticipation of something epic that was about to happen. But in the end It stayed somewhat modest In what It delivered. I know It's only part one but to be honest, I can't deny the feeling I've been watching a 2.5 hour intro to the real movie. At times I thought the storytelling was a bit vague. And to me vagueness Is only strong If the dialogues have a certain abstraction with some strong meaning or philosophic touch, but they were a bit to plain to add to that mysticism. It's a constant push and pull between brilliant parts mixed with almost generic and boring parts.It's all so serious and raw. There's no release or diversity. And If that's the plan, than at least bring some content to that rawness. Make It more disturbing and unsettling. I can't help but think this is more like a Disney movie hidden behind raw, stylistic and slowed down shots. It's just a bit conflicted in the deliver, almost becoming somewhat pretentious.I expected a bit more from this. It leaves me wanting to watch the next episode, because I'm still anticipating something epic to happen, so In that regard they've got what they wanted, commercially speaking, but in terms of content and entertainment It was a bit of a let down. Great production though. Even though some SFX at times actually weren't that great, but were mixed with really good parts.To conclude: they didn't lie when they said It begins with the end, because that's literally what this movie is about. A lot of picture, sound and ""setup"" for the next parts, but not a lot of content or entertainment as a stand-alone.",Dune
532,rrkawase,If you haven't read the books...,4,27 October 2021,"If you haven't read the books, you will probably be as lost and confused as I was.The movie plot is very confusing at every level. Characters are not properly introduced, the main conflict starts out of nothing and the worst part is that in the whole movie there are no two consecutive scenes that are connected to each other.Scene 1 the audience drops in the middle of some dialogue discussing some conflict/drama.Scene 2 some other completely conflict dialogue with different characters.And this keeps going the whole movie...Also, there's zero background build up of any of the characters. Thus you don't find yourself attached to any of them, no one is relatable and there's no empathy at any level. So, who cares who dies or who lives?You don't know who is good, who is bad, what each one of them are trying to achieve, what are their motivations, and why anything of this is happening.At the end is just a nice visual (incomplete) movie.It's well known that Dune series inspired Star Wars... Dune is more grown up, no toys, no goofy characters, etc... but when it comes to tell the story on the screen and captivate the audience, Dune producers should try to learn something from SW.",Dune

It's like a blow by blow account of a typical rich American's dysfunctional family in therapy agonizing about the heir to its corporation, who is a drug addict. Sound familiar? The level of acting is post-Fame level. La Mamoa obviously spends more on the highlights in his hair than any acting classes.

But the film lacks in the dramaturgy. Every scene is slow and heavy and Zimmers pathetic soundtrack doubles its inertia. There is no room to breath or a change in pace. It doesnt help, that dune part one only tells the first half of the story. For what is happening on screen, its one hour too long, becoming as pathetic as the lord of the rings. Lynchs adaption has more mystery, more crazy and interesting characters. Here we end in kitsch with a story of a so called messiah, dreaming of a loveaffair with a blue eyed framen girl. Its a missed opportunity, what could have been the lawrence of arabia of science fiction, is half a tale of 1001 nights in slow motion.",Dune

Only thing I got from it is the main character is the messiah (of course, why wouldn't he be). That's pretty much it and everything else just seems like you had to read the book this was based off of to understand. Not good for new audience and also not a unique story from what I was able to pick up.",Dune
537,lennybuttz,B-O-R-I-N-G!,3,24 October 2021,"Holy cow this movie is so slow moving, I was bored to tears waiting for something to happen. I was shocked to see the movie is 2.5 hours long and it only tells half the story?Being a big fan of the Dune books I've read all of them several times and I have to say this movie is loosely based on the original Dune book. They got a lot of the facts wrong. I suppose since the books are so old a lot of people aren't familiar with them so the director figured he could get away with taking so many liberties but I found it quite distracting.Please, Timothée Chalamet as Paul Attredes? What was he thinking casting that tiny whimpy boy as the leader of a revolution. His voice hasn't even changed, I wouldn't be surprised if he hasn't started puberty.I think most of the rest of the actors were well cast. I know most of them can act but it sure isn't evident in this film. You can only do so much with what you have to work with. The writing is terrible. If I didn't know the story so well I wouldn't have had a clue what was going on in the movie because so little is said.The sets are disappointing the costumes are disappointing and the score is horrendous. The music is very overpowering almost like it's a character in the movie? I found the music depressing and tedious. A great musical director who's name I can't remember once said, if a movie is scored properly you don't really notice the music, you feel it. The only emotion this music invoked was pain.I'd say don't waist your time or money on this dreck watch the original Dune by Dino De Larentus, it's true to the books and does an incredible job telling the whole story in 1 movie. It's exciting and emotional and it does have a great score as well incredible costumes, sets and actors.",Dune
538,tkdlifemagazine,Masterfully Done,9,25 October 2021,"George Lucas has credited Akira Kurasawa's Hidden Fortress as a major influence on the Star Wars Franchise. It clearly was; however, not nearly as a large an Influence as Frank Herbert's Dune Novels. The trouble is making a film adaptation of this complex novel in the post Star Wars, post David Lynch Dune world is a formidable task. Denis Villeneuve did a marvelous job bringing this to life. It is brilliant and as visually stunning as I could have ever imagined. The acting and Direction are both top tier. The storytelling is masterful, as this is a hard story to tell and follow and yet he does it here without losing a thing. Timothy Chamelet is Paul and he embodied the spirit with grace and charisma. The entire cast is incredible. This one sucked me in from moment 1. It is hard to believe that this is a stand alone, rather than made in whole and released in parts. I can't wait for more!!! I hope it lives up to the ground work laid in this opening installment. I want to read the novels again.

There are not too many informations about her link with Bene Gesserit and what they can do. And why in the world if you have a white male character you change it into an african-american woman?

Everything seems to progress in slow motion, albeit via some epic shots, but Dune never feels like it progresses into epic territory.The cinematography, score, and visual effects are top-notch, and Denis Villeneuve has proven himself elite once again. I just wanted more of the story to play out like a film and less like a dramatic reading. The plot unfolds itself in what feels like a series of small montages as opposed to one cohesive masterpiece. Definitely worth viewing, but there needs to be some more glue holding all of the pieces together.Also, without giving away any spoilers, I think it's worth warning viewers ahead of time that it says ""Part 1"" for a reason.",Dune

And that's about it.Living in NM, and visiting White Sands often, i always thought Dunes should have been filmed here with the bright hot sun, piercing blue skies and pure white sands, or use the same scenery as Lawrence or Arabia, or Indiana Jones (Sean Connery version) but except for mentions of 140 plus temperature, I never felt it was hot..... everything was dark and gloomy.

553,Pozdnyshev,"Eh, It Was Alright",6,1 November 2021,"This was a pretty good science fiction movie. You understand the motivations of all the characters, and the plot makes sense. But there was just something somehow lacking in its substance.The main character, the Chalamet dude, I'm not sure what it is about him but I just never fully bought him as the Chosen One. Even though he went through all the motions, struggling to improve his skills, he still struck me as just some skinny snot-nosed rich kid. The guy in Lynch's Dune, I don't know, I just somehow bought him as both high-born AND a warrior.The film had an annoying and manipulative habit of drawing scenes out far longer than they should have, and absolutely drenching them in music. I found this unnecessary. Like, you'll be seeing yet another panoramic shot of vast almond-shaped ships dropping bombs on a desert city and the aboriginal singers will start belching to the beat of jungle toms and there's a huge flashing sign that says ""EMOTIONAL MOMENT."" it's like yeah, I get it.But then sorry, I just don't really care that much about the characters. Like the movie just isn't as profound as it thinks it is, despite the millions of dollars being thrown on the screen.A big gripe is how they portrayed the Harkonnens. Like holy wow, what a grand chance to show an awful villain in the Baron. Well they dropped the ball. His first toady played by the big guy from the comic book movies looked the part, but the Baron himself... He wasn't scary. He was just disgusting. He was a languid old fat guy who was photographed and soundtracked like he was SUPPOSED to be scary, but he just wasn't. He barely even friggin' does anything!But still, as a modern movie (most of which are terrible), it was okay. There wasn't any obnoxious Wokeness in it. I give it a 6.",Dune

The 2nd almost thrilling half of it might have been worth waiting only to find out it is a cliffhanger - so it really sucks. Like Blade Runner 2048 years (same Director) there is too much focus on visual shots that aren't necessary; including shots of unnecessary moments that could have been edited out ( a lot of it coming from the 1st half). What's the point of the first part when the story pivots 180 degrees to another direction on the second half which makes part one pointless; unless if this was a tv series I would totally understand- but it's not. The only good news about this picture is that it is a better version of the original 80s film; including are the good actors, cool costumes, beautiful cinematography, and discovery channel like landscape shots.",Dune

Essentially it appears to be about a tremendously large-scale ware by drug dealers who mine something called Spice.It seems odd to see a massive ship land and then people have to walk down a ramp that must be a few kilometers long. Same with the loading.The strangest parts are the simplistic weapons and archaic fighting. We, as a nation, are hardly as advanced as those in the movie, but at least we have drones and other weapons which mean we don't have to engage in knife fights after traveling through space.Spice must be very, very profitable considering the massive equipment used to transport the armies to their knife fights. Such spectacular battle scenes intermixed with people running to fight with knives. They should have invited William Wallace, he's pretty good with a sword, which is much bigger than their space knives.The knife fighting scenes remind me of that movie where they did the gunplay like it was karate. I don't remember the name of it but ridiculous nonsense describes that pretty well.I gave it four stars because the special effects are spectacular. Insect warcraft, however, not so much. Why the insect wing crafts if they have clearly mastered anti-gravity? The huge transport ships have no such wings and float effortlessly, as do the worm and battle droids. Also, the giant sandcrawlers will definitely make any Jawa envious. Too bad the sandworms eat them up. Also, the need for the insect wing crafts and others to have bright lights so the pilots can see is a big contrast to the advanced technology. Like the battle knives, it seems nonsensical for them to exist here.Spice, spice, spice. It is interesting that the creator of this tale decided to use a drug for the reason everyone is fighting. The hero of the movie literally gets high on his own supply and almost gets killed by a sandworm.They should have added a galactic police force with armies larger than those of the drug dealers, I mean ""Spice"" dealers.This must have been one long, trippy book.I read Star Wars at least ten times waiting for the movie to come out in '77, and loved it, at least until recently. I read all three Hobbit books in middle school, and can't say that was worthwhile. I probably would not have made the Dune book a priority, there is too much emotional nonsense, too much crap to keep track of and nothing to care enough about.Oh, and the hero of this movie keeps getting high on Spice. Don't worry, though. His mommy helps him get back on track. The weirdo scene with everyone spitting in the glass was gross, space or no.I won't spoil the ending though. It seemed dumb, but maybe the author had a thing for Moses.",Dune

Dune is a good variety slow drama which is delighful due to numerous factors.cinematography,dialogues,acting performances and background score are well done which is the backbone of the whole adventure. The acting performances that stood out among a stellar cast are Rebecca Ferguson, Timothee Chalamet and Jason Mamoa who nails their roles quite perfectly. All the far future world setting and its execution is the main thing to praise in the whole movie. All these factors have contributed in the making of an absolutely intense drama.Lack of intensity of action sequences can be spotted here and there followed by some flawed VFX at times. The average cliffhanger instead of an intense one provides the incomplete feel which was not supposed to be delivered in the end.In the end, a satisfying drama that sets things up for a brighter future.Rating:73%",Dune
560,Valentijn78,Best Dune adaptation,10,22 October 2021,"This is Part I of a two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel Dune. It ran a little long with the escape to the desert, but did an impressive job of introducing the multitude of necessary plot details.Even more striking was how artfully the movie recreates the emotions and awe of the novel. It's been 25 years since I read the books, but this movie pulled me right back into how it felt. The special effects were flawless, and the soundtrack achieved the drama and grandeur of the 1984 version without following it in going over the top.Perhaps the biggest improvement over earlier versions is the superb casting and acting. I also appreciated that the gender imbalance in the novel was slightly corrected - extra point for triggering the people who can't handle a supporting character packing different junk.

562,shaqmbile,Long time Dune fan,7,3 November 2021,"I've watch the movies, the miniseries (all of the them), read the entire series, and I've read a lot of the extended books.The biggest weakness of this movie was probably the reason it will succeed. They cut out a lot of the depth from the book, abridged the entire first two thirds of the book, and cut most of the mystery and world building.That being said, they improved the pacing and made it a lot more accessible to people who don't like that kind of ""game of thrones"" large scale story building.It was a good movie, better than I expected. The performance were great except for Liet Kynes. Casting was pretty good but it pains me to say that Oscar Isaac, while good, did not have the air of dignity that I wanted from a Duke.The environments are stunning. The changes to the story are understandable. Nothing felt disrespectful. Jamis was played to perfection. Liet Kynes was gender swapped but it's of no importance to the story. The effects were good. The Voice was handled well.Good job! If only they would have had a little more faith in the viewer to enjoy a deeper experience. We still have the books and miniseries though.",Dune
563,ohroonoko,Competent but emotionally FLAT.,7,23 October 2021,"I felt nothing when Duke Leto Atreides was betrayed by Dr. Yueh, or when he sacrificed himself to kill Baron Harkonnen. I got nothing from Lady Jessica when she realized he had died (did she even LOVE him?). I felt no surprise when Baron Harkonnen survived his assassination attempt. I felt nothing when Duncan Idaho fought to his death. I felt nothing when Dr. Kynes died. I don't even remember if Gurney was killed but I assume he was. I felt nothing when Duke Paul Atreides was accepted by Stilgar as a Freman. This movie absolutely failed to resonate with me on an emotional level even though there were so many opportunities to do so. The acting was suitable but not inspiring (maybe the casting choices could have been better, too. It seems the casting director aimed for familiar stars from Star Wars, Marvel and DC instead of truly fine actors that are lesser known). The screenplay was a decent adaptation- if and only if there really is a Dune Part Two; otherwise it's an incomplete and unsatisfying story. But it is certainly the director's fault for a distinct lack of emotional resonance. Denis Villenuve is a competent director, but a cold and calculating one. It's well produced, with amazing set pieces and costumes and cinematography. Maybe I expect more from Denis Villenuve since he works on films with grandiose visions. I just wish directing for emotional drama was in his tool bag (it's not).As for the story, I hope there's a sequel because this film simply does not work as a stand alone film. It ends on Act II with an unclear path for Act III. This really should have been a 3 1/2 hour movie that finished with Paul Atreides leading the Freman to retake Arrakis from the Harkonnen. In other words, it should have followed the same outline as Dune 1984. And that's why I still prefer that version to this; it's simply a complete story.",Dune

I mean, the lushness of the universe that transpires in the novel - and that the 1984 version rendered imperfectly but still better than this new version? Certainly, the 2021 version is more adequate, more introverted, more developed, and better overall. But it is unfortunate that Villeneuve has confused desert with austerity. If this had not been the case, we would have had a masterpiece. Here, we are obliged to wait for the sequel before being able to pronounce on the global quality of the adaptation.",Dune

I never watched the 1984 version, but I did watch the 2000 mini series version. It was almost 20 years ago but I remembered it pretty well. I have to say that events wise its almost identical. So when I was watching this movie there was no element of surprise. I basically knew what will happen. It's a better looking remake, but if you know the story it will be predictable. Besides that I really don't get the fuss about Zindaya shes nothing special. The lead guy is ok but nothing special either. I hope they'll make part 2 anyway.",Dune
567,DirtyStarling,"Very Good Adaptation, But Still a Distillation of the Novel",7,24 October 2021,"""Dune: Part One"" was a respectable adaptation. The original novel is one of my favorite books, so nothing will ever measure up to the book in my eyes, but this adaptation was respectable. It streamlines the novel and distills it just enough to tell a coherent story that's still, essentially, the story from the novel, but the result of that distillation is that you lose a lot of good character development, political intrigue, and interesting world-building details.Still better than Lynch's 80's version... though I will say of Lynch's 80's version... even though this new one is the better movie, his version is much more interesting visually and has a lot of neat ideas and weird stuff thrown in that make it kind of endearing. It's an incomprehensible mess at times and it makes massive changes to characters and events for... important David Lynch WTF reasons and also studio interference reasons... but it's still fun to watch because it's interesting visually.My problem with the new version is that it distills the novel to the point where nothing really sticks with me... except the thopter design, because who doesn't love ships based on dragonflies? I LOVE the new thopter design.Bottom line... this new one is a better movie and a better adaptation, but the 1980's version is going to stick with me more just because of its interesting visuals and weirdness. And the novel reigns supreme over both of them.",Dune

It's everything a big-screen movie should be.Even if you're clueless about the franchise (like I was), you'll pick up the story fairly easily (despite there being many layers to the it). The character and world building is excellent, and by the end of the movie you're left wanting more.Go see it. Make sure there's no distractions when you do.

571,teiixeiral,Denis Villeneuve with another Sci-Fi epic.,8,23 October 2021,"Dune is a visceral, beautiful, well acted and directed epic. What an experience it was to watch this in the theatre. Hans Zimmer's score is brutal. I've never really watched a movie with a score like that before and it's ability to physically wear you down. He deserves the Oscar.I love the attention to detail that Denis' infuses the film with. He is meticulous and takes his time to make every frame/scene complete. I've heard people describe Dune as a sort of Game of Thrones but in space and I agree. The political machinations, chosen one archetypes and warring factions make for a very convoluted story and it's a hard one to adapt.Yes, the story is the weakest point. There's just so much dense exposition that needs to be told and the source material isn't exactly exciting. But the fact that our attention span as a society is historically at its lowest has people calling this film bad is unfortunately incorrect. It's not a bad film.Ultimately, I'm giving this an 8 because the craftsmanship is outstanding. Everything other than the script/story is perfection and that deserves a high rating. I really hope we can get a part 2 so Villeneuve and co get the opportunity to end this on a high note.",Dune

In this instance I truly think there is nothing that could have been done to make it better, it was faultless. An amazing start to what I hope will be an amazing trilogy!",Dune
574,Dunkaccino,"""DUNE"" Makes a spectacular viewing experience.",9,16 September 2021,"From the director of ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"", comes another sci-fi epic ""DUNE: Part One"" based on the novel.It's the year of 10191. There are different planets with different species of human. Our main character Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the future of House Atreides. He is on an adventure to Arrakis, a beautiful planet that produces spies and full of dangerous sandworms.This is all I can say without spoilers. The thing about DUNE is it's stunning direction and breathtaking cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual image. Not to mention the amusing score (by Hans Zimmer).I watched DUNE in IMAX. Frequent shots of enormous spaceships and battle sequences are always a pleasure throughout. The making of this movie should be rightfully appreciated.It's a movie forcing the audience to pay attention, in a good way. The plot takes time to digest but once you know what's going on, it's a lot of fun.A lot of characters are introduced. Gurney (Josh Brolin), Glossu (Dave Bautista), Duncan (Jason Momoa) and I could go on. During it's 155 minute runtime however, not everyone gets enough characterization. I'd like to see certain characters explored more. Maybe in the sequel.After all DUNE is still a beautiful sci-fi movie. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's still a great piece of modern filmmaking.",Dune

The director of this film Denis Villeneuve has so much experience on Sci-Fi films like Arrival (2016), Blade Runner 2049 (2017) so he will knows the best Visualisation for sci-fi films.Dune was super awesome movie and more than I was expected cause there's people said that this movie was boring and make them sleep.From the movie was started I was really really shock surprise about the visual and the cinematography, So beautiful so perfect and bonus Zendaya and Timothee face they're both are so beautiful and handsome. With this budget this movie was so epic and boom for the visual,CGI,cinematography and more. There's a scene that makes me kinda shock when Paul voice change into super scary voice.I know in the middle of the movie it's kinda boring but the audio and the visual of the picture or the beautiful scene of this movie makes me enjoyed the movie and didn't make me feel sleepy at all, cause the storyline is very slow.But i feel like we need more minute's or times for this movie cause the ending was make me super curious, when the movie was end I was like ""what?! I need more"". Hope the sequel will be more epic more beautiful visual, and perfect like this movie.There's to many people die in this film, why Jason momoa die I thought he will alive and be together with Paul, and that one girl from Fremen. For the violence there's a lot of people die and get burn, blood when Paul see future that Zendaya kiss him and then stab him with a knives.I thought that Zendaya will have more screen time but she just get in the ending of the movie. Zendaya with blue eyes it was so cool, can't wait to see the other epic movie from dune, the sequel. For opening film for dune series this movie was so good and have a detail of the story, but it was kinda complicated and little bit confusing me. But I really really recommend you this movie.",Dune

Superhero voice desert power cool fog scenes religious themes and general badassery placate me while i gripe about how short this 2 hour epic felt.

I remember being entirely skeptical of the cast when it was released but I am so happy that I was proven wrong, because everyone is amazing. Jason Momoa proves himself to be a formidable actor and Timothée Chalamet shows his versatility through the callous Paul.

I got the book and I've been reading it and thoroughly enjoying Frank Herbert's Novel soo much and at the end of the day- it stays faithful to the book. The Cast Is Wide And Talented, Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin ARE MAGER STANDOUTS, Rest Of The Cast Did Good Job. Hans Zimmer's TRIUMPHANT SCORE IS TOO DIE FOR And A MUST GET SOUNDTRACK. The World Building Of Arrakis Was HUGE And Very Realistic AND VILLENEUVE DID A Glorious Job Of Capturing It RIGHT. Cinematography IS GORGEOUS And Breathtaking. Epic Action Scenes, Alot Of Same Sci-fi Elements, The Spice, Ornithopters And The Fremen suit, But ultimately the Sandworms- Which I Gazed And Adored. 2 hrs And 28 minutes suprisingly flew by and didn't feel long PACED. Story WAS BASICALLY Part 1 and did go into some religion and politics, but exactly focused on Paul Atreides Journey into conflict. Villeneueve Mastered And Created Such A Huge Beautiful World With Its Exact Same Developed Characters, Same Elements, Complicated Story, The Flowing Spice, The World Building Of Arrakis, Detailed Costume Desings, Got Me Getting EVERYTHING I WANTED, Also Wanting To Return To This World SOO BADLY. That Ending GOT ME HYPED AND CHILLS. Which Already Makes Me EXCITED For Part 2. Totally Re-watching This Film TONS. Totally WORTH THE IMAX EXPERIENCE . If You Are a Dune Fan, You Will Go Into this loving it. If not a fan , then definitely get into Due if you can.

579,MennoMan,"7 for Visuals, but far below expectations",7,21 October 2021,"Visually spectacular. This is to be expected given the development of special effect 38 years sine the original movie and higher budget and newer effects of the 2000 made for cable series with William Hurt.1st this the worst Book Abdaptation of all, but it clearly seems to be made not follow previous abdaptations.Both the 1984 Movie and the 2000 Series, though still short of book, were both far closer to book than this version .Sound wise the 1974 had a better soundtrack but of course Eno and Toto played a part in that.For 2:20, I wish it would not have skipped important character development that both prior version had.Few character are truly developed such as any of the Harkonnen's or even the primary characters simply shown with no idea of who they are (Gurney nor Yeuh, i.e.) And the Emperor's daughter, key to the books is only mentioned.I will give credit the the Recue and Escape from ecology research station left our of prior releases was included.Like the 2000 series, it appears no Weirding Module weapon will be featured. This probably will work fine since the Series excluded this also.But a story standing on its on... it was ok for me. I just wander how someone who has never read the book would keep up?Anyways waiting to see part 2.

And he's just takes up the game for every movie senses then. This is a epic movie and after seeing the movie 3 times it's easily the best movie of this year. Because of the Corona virus this didn't become a box office and we won't get to see another one. That's why I'm a little worried. And why give it out on HBO as most companies know that the movie gets out on the net for free. Ok if hbo paid 250m dollars for the movie and promised they would do the second one. But that's not possible. Let's hope that Apple takes up the second movie they are probably the best game to play at this point. Because you're left hanging at the end of the first movie I would just give a 7 out of 10. Even if it's a masterpiece a second movie ain't happening. If they ok to a second movie then watch this but otherwise it's just going to make you frustrated and disappointed. Why I gave it 10 of 10 is because of all the hater's on IMDB.,Dune

I found myself waiting for the film to end.And the ending, when it came, was very unsatisfying.Timothee Chalamet captures the awkward naivety of Paul Atreides, while Rebecca Ferguson's performance as his mother is intense but loses impact due to over-exposure. Most of the other big-names in the cast have little more than cameos, with awkward scripting that often gets buried beneath mumbling and sound effects. Stellan Skarsgard as Baron Harkonnen is almost comical.Bear in mind I have seen the David Lynch film (which was terrible) but have not read the books.

So much money wasted on effects that ultimately fail. Because the director is untalented, but full of ego.Oh, and if the atmosphere is identical to Blade Runner 2049, this is because it's the same director and he doesn't have many tools in his kit.It is incomplete, because that so-called director announced two more. Somehow I doubt he will reach the third, because I am convinced the second will flop. So far this one hasn't even broke even at box-office.10 for Chalamet, who is superb as always. 0 for the rest of this train wreck, notably for Zendaya who has no business being in movies and has the personality of a pencil.

However, if you accept the movie as a stand alone interpretation- it might work for you. Just like lord of the rings - it's not time and place to fully capture the content and message of the books. As a filmmaker you also need to satisfy the audience with some action.Just like the new blade runner, the movie was lacking some personality, although the visuals are stunning. The acting is good as well, but not great.However, I do appreciate this attempt to adapt quality litterateur to the big screen. The stakes are high and the task is almost impossible.In my humble opinion - a more ""artsy"" approach might work even better, more like David Lynch's version.

There are very few directors and screenwriters capable of doing something like what has been achieved here. While I don't think it's a masterpiece, this movie manages to blend an epic story with science fiction very well.Beautiful photography, performances at the height of history, visual and special effects according to the best that this year can deliver and Hans Zimmer also shines with his soundtrack.It will be acclaimed, it will be a success and it will be the beginning of a cult legend.",Dune

I went expecting to be disappointed or at least, to be met with another Blade Runer flop from the director. All because I have read some reviews that have lambasted the film, mostly from so-called professional critics.I don't get it. I really don't. The pacing was just right, the editing was fantastic, the music was amazing, the casting was perfect and the film was a visually amazing experience that I will surely enjoy again.I'd have given this a solid 10 if it wasn't for the fact that the film ended when I wanted it to continue, a rarity these days.

There are some good things about the film but it tries too hard to be taken seriously and ends too abruptly all to ""set up"" a sequel.There was some great actor choices but others were down right horrible, like Zendaya who is supposedly going to headline the sequel!As a fan of DUNE and have never enjoyed anything other than the written material, I was really let down by this newest attempt.",Dune
596,bertrandborn,"wow! awesome and epic, despite some minor flaws",10,19 September 2021,"Before watching the movie I thought the many good reviews of the film were fake, but after having seen it... this is hands down one of the best films of recent years!Superb visuals not just in terms of CGI but the graphic storytelling via retro archaic style of buildings, atmospheric settings and lighting and soundtrack, stylish costumes, spectacular desert landscapes and retro high-tech machinery, great cast and acting, clever story with intrigues and political backstabbing all work extremely well together.This remake is one of the few exceptions that by far outguns the original on all levels, and is sci-fi cinema at its best!Only negatives are: the movie's a bit drawn out in the end and could have been 15mins shorter. The ""he's the chosen one.. oh but he doesn't look like it"" mantra is a repetitive and a lame cliché - it's unnecessary to mention it and the story would work well (actually better) without random people constantly saying it. Also, the characters are a bit flat and linear and could have a lot more depth or controversy to them, indicating their motivations, inner tensions, what drives them etc. - so far the characters seem a bit like puppets on autopilot.But all in: amazing and potentially epic film and looking forward to part 2.",Dune

While it tries hard to do so, but the characters arent fleshed out enough for you to even care about them and certain editing decisions are a bit odd which hurts the flow and logic of the movie. Scenes that appears totally random or rushed and adding nothing to the story. Again the personalities aren't fleshed out which makes the viewer have no empathy for whats going on. The whole watch was like a hallucinated bad trip, maybe it was intended to be that way, in that regard it is a succes lol.",Dune

If you liked the movie, you'll love the book.If you didn't like the movie, you don't quite get some of the ingenuity of the book.I'll give an example: each chapter starts with a seemingly irrelevant historical retelling of history in this world; very sterile and dry, a statement facts. But peppered in are some important events that haven't happened yet in Paul's life. Such as a possible death of an important person early in the film. And it just gets thrown out there as ""no big deal, it happened a long time ago.""You get glimpses into the future in sporadic, random slices - just like Paul.

600,hydralien-40230,Grandiose visuals and great acting with little story background,8,6 October 2021,"To be honest I wasn't expecting it to be a first episode in the series of films, so that was a disappointment at first - but then I realised it's just impossible to put whole book in one movie in any meaningful way (with all my love to the Lynch's version, it didn't do the book much justice), so splitting the story into several parts is actually a good decision.Problem is, even with this division the film doesn't really provide much of the background details on who all the characters are, what's the state of the world, why spice is actually important to the navigators, who are the navigators and many many different important well-thought aspects that make the book so great. Instead there are long scenes focused on the main character, surroundings, futuristic machinery and so on.There are two more outcomes of such screen usage:
1. It all looks absolutely gorgeous and amazingly well designed - ""firefly"" fighters are incredible, harvesters and their delivery is awesome, and many other things are equally stunning. And oh, the costumes! The costumes are the best.2. Major actors playing secondary characters don't get much time at all - they're all playing their roles very well, but we barely see them at all (save perhaps Jason Momoa, but even his screen time is scarce).Overall it's a great cinematographic feat, and the best Dune adaptation so far - but we'll have to wait the rest of it to see if it holds true. I only wish they'd put more world-building details into the narrative...",Dune
601,Kassdhal,Dennis delivered,10,15 September 2021,"Worried like every time a great material is adapted it usually does not deliver on expectation.Here Dennis Villeneuve did the impossible: staying faithful to a complex and rich universe and a fantastic story with a masterful demonstration of direction, stunning visuals and solid acting.Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skasgard and Javier Bardem in particular are impressive while Chalamet was solid.My only (slight) issue is the fact that Lady Jessica is too emotional compared to the original character, and that we never see the emperor and the Navigators.I was afraid that the sex and race swap of Liet would feel forced and woke but it is well done and feels natural in the context of the film.So hat's off Dennis Villeneuve, this is another masterpiece under your belt.",Dune

605,ravenosa,Depressingly empty viewing experience.,4,19 October 2021,"First off, I'll say I love the book and I think the Alan Smithee edit of 1984 Dune is a guilty pleasure of mine.Outside of the 2021 Dune's production design, I'm having a hard time thinking of anything positive to say. The original story has been completely ruined - many arbitrary changes, key characters left out, soul-sapping scenes of exposition and not really any heart going into any of the character, nor is there any tension in relation to the plot.By the 2 hour mark, I didn't think there was one single entertaining scene that captured the beauty of Dune, the characters felt like they were reduced to wooden cutouts, and all the otherworldiness of the Arakis was missing and it just felt like a sleep-inducing slog in your average desert.I wound up leaving at the 2 hour mark, can't say I have any interest to see where they decided to stop telling the story and there's no way in heck I'm going to waste my time with part 2.Hopefully one day they'll actually try to adapt the book for cable/streaming; preferably as an 8-10 episode show.",Dune
606,kuner-59029,"Ambitious, cinematic, but fails where Lynch succeeded",6,19 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors working today, and after the surprisingly good Blade Runner 2, I eagerly awaited his take on Dune.Right off the bat there is no doubt he is attempting to create his magnum opus here. Every single shot feels grand in scope and ambition. The movie is pure bombast, pure cinema. But this is precisely where it falls short. Dune is more than just cinema. For all its craft and technical achievements, the spirit of Dune slips through Villeneuve's fingers.How so?Dune 2021 feels too sterile. Too predictable. Too banal even. Nothing truly stands out. Nothing feels as otherworldly and entrancing as Frank Herbert's universe demands. The grand designs and of the 1984 movie, the lived in environments right down to comfortable looking antique leather chairs, the lavish pomp of the emperor's throne room, but also the atmosphere of imminent dread and even body horror from the 1984 movie has been replaced by clean, polished greys. Speaking of the emperor, he is nowhere to be found. Dune 2021, in its longer runtime, omits much of the story. We don't get the world building prologue, we don't get any scene with the emperor or spacing guild, we don't get to see a navigator fold space... instead we get endless slow motion shots and repeated dream sequences of Zendaya's Chai doing her typical squinting.The Gom Jabbar scene is another exemplary of dumbing down the viscerality of the original. Where in the Lynch version you could see flesh melting off Paul's hand in a truly disturbing scene, here it is replaced by a CGI hand (which looks worse than a playstation game) burning in safe bloodles CGI like any random superhero movie.There's nothing shocking anymore. No pus oozing baron showered in gore and dirt, no vagina monster navigators, no deformed mentats. It's all gone.Even the Dune video games, above all the incredible 1991 Cryo Adventure game had these elements.The video games are a large reason why Dune continued to live on for so long, with gamers even making unofficial ports, remakes and mods for them to this day. The production designers of Dune 2021 would have done well to look at what made them so memorable.Also gone is the opulence found in the Lynch version or the games, replaced by sterile functionality. Yes, the scale of everything is grand, but it never feels lived in. The environments are mostly just brown walls in inconveniently large rooms.Most importantly, the new movie isn't as hypnotic as the original or even the games. I attribute this mainly to Hans Zimmer's droning score, which steamrolls to center stage throughout the entire movie. The score by itself isn't bad, but it lacks the grand scale of Toto's 84 soundtrack and never reaches the ethereal, spiritual heights of Brian Eno's Prophecy theme.Likewise, the soundtrack of the 91 game by Stéphane Picq is a perfect example of how to score Dune. (Youtube link: watch?v=Hl3jkKoM_EM )
It's psychedelic and alien, passionate, melancholic, dreamy... it's Jean Michele Jarre meets world music.All this dreamlike quality is missing from the new movie, replaced by sterile banality.I suppose we can be thankful, that Warner didn't dumb down the story too much, though the gender swap of Dr Kynes and the prologue about oppression are idiotic injections of current day American sociopolitics, which should have no place in Dune, which is about much bigger ideas.Alas, why did I give the movie 6 stars? Because the story is still magnificent. And even if it's a bad Dune movie, it's still ambitious cinema. It's not an assembly line garbage superhero movie. In this day and age, that alone is worthy of praise. But the more I think about the new Dune movie, the more I just realize what a treasure the Lynch version is.If I were Warner, I would can the sequel. This one isn't the franchise launching hit they're looking for. Scrape together the old Westwood Studios and Cryo production teams, who truly understood and cherished the material. Get whoever is still alive from 84 Dune's production designers, bring back Alejandro Jodorowsky as consultant and go through his and Giger's original designs. Get Jean Michele Jarre and Stephane Picq as composers. As director... maybe throw a couple million at Lynch to get him out of retirement. Or Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven... a veteran. Give them the same budget as this and watch the magic happen.For those looking for the ultimate Dune movie experience: I'm sorry, but this isn't it.

Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV. versus Jason Momoa,2,17 October 2021,"Derp derp derp""Dune 1984 is worth watching simply because it does a good job of bringing the audience into this bizarre universe. ... The 1984 movie has the right amount of weirdness mixed with beauty, whether in the costumes, sets or campy green screen scenes. So the movie is fun to look at""Dune 2021 is simply a bloated Hollywood Artsy-fartsy knockoff of the truly fun and fleshed out 1984 version (Even with the campy flaws and poor pre CGI modeling but at its core an enjoyable romp around the galaxy with a memorable cast of heroes and villains , if you're a fan of Dune you probably have watched it again and again three or four times)Back to 2021 woke dreckSo many major plot charaters are missing in Dune especially the sinister Spice Guild and their interactions with Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV and how he played the different Landsraad houses against each other.This is a major plot hole equal to the back peddling Star Wars misfires.Instead focusing on mystical CGI screen saver vistas.The post woke revolution replacement actors are the typical self righteous whispering (poor excuse for gravitas) talky talky diversity mob of B and C actors dragooned into another bloated CGI Marvel Happy Meal .That honestly couldn't act themselves out of a paper bag without being lead around on a leashWhiney angst actor Timothée Chalamet copying Hayden Christensen's style as Paul Atreides .Focus!... the Harkonnens are at the shield wall gates, what we need is Francesca Annis ,Richard Jordan and Patrick Stewart to teach this boy some gravitas !New Paul's sense of duty is lackluster at best as he spends way to much time day dreaming about a Polynesian/Dune beauty queen than trying to defend House Atreides and make his father Duke Leto Atreides proud.Where's the bad-ass ""We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis. The Guild and the entire Universe depends on spice.""...he must have screamed that rebel yell in the latest incarceration but I must have been dozing on my cell.Also, Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 sucked, overwhelming CGI visual with a underwhelming trash bag of disposable forgettable fast food characters just like his latest grandiose dumpster fire called ....

Many people praise visuals, but it's just blatant green screen every scene. Bladerunner 2049 looks MUCH better than this one. I only really liked music, too bad it couldn't save this movie.

610,Lefteris-Anagnostopoulos,Decent Movie But Don't Trust The Hype,7,4 October 2021,"Saw the film at the Athens International Film Festival.When DUNE started I honestly was in awe because I realized that I missed seeing an epic on the big screen. I loved the slow pace, I loved taking our time and learning about the world. I hadn't seen something like that in a long time and every shot, every costume, every set is so well-crafted that you could lose yourself on the screen. This movie begs to be watched in a theater. There were moments that I honestly thought to myself, ""It's like watching Lord of the Rings again!""So this is Dune: Part One, they want to divide the book in three movies, that's not so bad since it's a big book. What's bad is that in my opinion this is a good and at the same time a bad adaptation not only of the book, but bad as far as adaptations go. Let me explain. It's good because they try to be faithful to the source material and it's bad because in the end the movie fails to stand on its own. The same thing that plagued movies like Batman V Superman is present here. It wants so badly to tease you on what's coming next that it forgets to tell its own story. It's just boring to watch vision after vision after vision that leads to a disappointing finale with the attitude of a TV show that's going to air next week. The next Dune movie will probably come out in 2-3 years, you can't end a movie like this like it's a TV episode. It just ends and there's no climax, it's just ""see ya!""Now the next big issue is that some exterior and all the interior lighting is just bad. There's no other way to put it, you can't see what's in front of you, I had to squint my eyes many times and let's say that it doesn't matter when there's just dialogue. It's just unrealistic to sit in this darkness and talk casually but okay. But when there's action?!? During the final thirty minutes it was impossible to see the visuals and the scenes were exterior at night. Scenes that were shown in trailers with better lighting, and that leaves me with two conclusions: A) They just made it dimmer for the final product, or, B) There was a problem with my screening. Either way I have to watch it a second time. I could forgive the bad ending but not be able to see?In conclusion, what I liked from the book and what I disliked (about the story) are here. The world is fantastic, our protagonist is uninteresting, I'm just past the vanilla ""Chosen One"" cliche. The production is one of the best of the year if not the best and the score by Hans Zimmer brings Arrakis to life. The acting is good but in the next one I could do with less whispery dialogues. And just write a better stand alone movie, people pay to watch something now, they don't pay for the set-up to the next one!",Dune

616,sundialpictures-01657,You Should Have Guaranteed The Second Half Before Filming,6,24 October 2021,"I feel that this movie suffers from what I call the Deathly Hallows effect. It's where you take a story that would be too big for one movie and you split it into two movies. The first movie would be the first half of the story, which covers all of the set-up, which isn't really the most exciting material but is necessary to get out of the way. The second movie winds up being what everyone wants to see, the exciting action, the meaty parts of the story. That's the unfortunate situation we have here with Villeneuve's Dune. He's designed his adaptation to be like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but he's done so without the full commitment of the studio. Whether or not we even get that exciting second half, the big pay-off for our investment of time and patience, hinges upon how this film does financially. I think that was a huge mistake because this half of the Dune tale is so dry and so lacking in momentum and the characters are so boring that you're hardly excited to dive back into this world. You leave this first film with a shrug, and muttering things like, ""Well, I guess it was okay.""

I have to say that I agree with the naysayers. Beautiful cinematography but the movie dragged with overdrawn film segments. A full 2-1/2 hours yet the story lacked necessary detail and character development.I'll add that the action scenes looked fixed; much of the fighting did not have a real feel to it. And too much was obscured by dark scenes which additionally allowed the direction to hide elements of the action.Lastly, we appreciate HBO Max running new Warner Bros releases but HBO Max, with its buffering issues and useless pause-screen limitations, is probably the worst of the premier streaming networks.",Dune

Those familiar with the book will no doubt have a similar experience.The casual theater visitor is likely to come out of this dazed and confused.Visually stunning this still feels like someone put Blade Runner and the 1984 version of Dune in a blender with added CGI-sause. Had special effects made for a better film, Blade Runner 2048 would have been a better movie than the original. It was not.It took me decades to fully figure out the original version and a good few of my adolescent years to get a basic grasp of it.

620,iboso64,The Biggest Letdown of the Year. I Wish I was Kidding.,2,28 October 2021,"This started off with such great promise. Amazing imagery over Hans Zimmer reworking Pink Floyd's ""Eclipse."" Sadly, that was the first trailer. The second trailer wasn't very good, and it all went downhill from there. BTW, the title on screen... and literally nowhere else... is ""Dune: Part 1."" Now, I kind of guessed that it was going to be spread out over several films, given the original hardcover book weighed about 50 lbs, but this is blatant false advertising. The more proper term is ""Bait and switch,"" and HBO/Warner should be a)ashamed of themselves and b)sued. Worse, I realized immediately that there wouldn't be any finale, satisfying or otherwise, just a place where the movie drifts into the credits...Probably in a Lord of the Rings-style line up, walking toward Mordor or destiny, or whatever. And yup, that's exactly what happens.As for the movie itself... Forget the massive plot holes and absolute lack of logic, it's visually unappealing. At least in IMAX. Rather than have whole sequences shot in that format, it literally bounces back and forth between 1:33 and 1:65, from shot to shot, throughout the entire movie! And, aside from the bravo performance of the sandworms, there is absolutely nothing that breaks new ground. Heck, I'd dare say it takes a few things back a few steps.On to the score: Hans Zimmer.... Well, he had to poop out a bad score eventually and boy, this is it. Want to hear a great score? Listen to just about anything else he's done, especially the new Bond soundtrack, No Time to Die. The problem here seems to be that he's dipped into the atonal well just one time too many. But hey, at least you know when an important image comes up... The sudden atonal punch to the ear will wake you up, each and every time.I think it was round about the 9th or 10th flash forward/vision thing that I suddenly realized that I didn't care one bit about anyone or anything in this movie. It's a damn shame, too, because that first trailer really had me thinking that someone finally got it right.They didn't.",Dune

I went into this movie not knowing anything, I purposely avoided trailers and reviews on IMDb. In the opening sequences the visuals in this movie blew me away. They are stunning to say the least and I'd love to know if the cities are computer generated or miniature sets because they looked so real.When watching some of the scenes, I was transported back to my childhood watching 80s and 90s sci-fi movies where you would see certain scenes and just know that they would be ingrained in your mind forever as an epic scene.The soundtrack is fantastic, Hans Zimmer is my favourite composer and I can understand now why he turned down working with Christopher Nolan's Tenet to work with this. Each scene is complimented by his epic soundtrack.The character costumes and designs are awesome, they did a great job of giving the audience an easy task of distinguishing the different houses and characters from each other. The sand worms also looked surreal too.I can't recommend this movie enough. My only gripe with it would be that sometimes it was bit slow paced, but I really enjoyed the plot and I felt the build up was worth it. It's been years since I've seen a movie that resembled this, the first movies that come to mind are the Lord of the Rings, so if you're a fan of them, go see this ASAP.**
I went to see it for the second time and did not mind the pacing this time as I knew what would happen. On second viewing this is the best movie I've seen in the last 10 years.",Dune
623,mpf101,Wow. Frickin' wow.,9,27 October 2021,"The Lord of the Rings and Dune bookended a decade for me - Tolkien in fall of 1960, Herbert summer of 1970. I suffered through various attempts at making each into a satisfactory film until the Peter Jackson miracle, and have been waiting all these years for what only the amazing Denis Villeneuve could have done. For this fan, perfectly realized. So why not 10 stars for one of the greatest stories ever told turned into a spectacular film? I could quibble with some clunky dialog, but my greatest concern is accessibility. I've read Dune many times, and this film completely satisfied me, but I suspect that many viewers who are less familiar will fail to follow the political and cultural nuances that are essential to its greatness. Whatever. Villeneuve is the greatest visualizer of stories in the business, and this is a worthy addition to his resume. As for young Chalamet, there have been and will be greater roles for him, but I cannot imagine a better Paul Atreides.",Dune

Instead of relying on a suspenseful story, Villeneuve underlays beautiful (landscape) shots with such a powerful, loud and dramatic music score that it tore me out of the story every time and I began to think about why these scenes, which were rather insignificant for the process of the story, had such a dramaturgy. It almost seems as if Villeneuve is afraid that his movie would be too boring without. Blade Runner 2049 had the same problem. Villeneuve seems to use epic images and a dramatic and loud soundtrack to distract from the fact that he just doesn't have what it takes to tell exciting and good stories.",Dune
629,Nummer9,A beautifully burning dumpster fire,5,24 October 2021,"First things first. The visuals were great. The space ships, the town, the armor and shields, the technology. All of it very well made and it fits perfectly to the story.And that is where the trouble begins. The story. They changed for absolut no reason significant parts of the story. Also they cut out, that you hear the thoughts of the characters, wich is essential to even knowing what is going on. I am certain that viewers, that have not read the books or watched the brilliant Dune movie from 1982, have no clue whats even going on. Their thoughts are the story, which are literally explaining everything. Without that, whats left are spaceships, armies marching around and some nobles say a couple of dozend meaningless sentences. But no story.And the actors are a mess! Lady Jessica is described as extremly elegant and beautiful. Well Rebecca Ferguson just does not fit that criteria at all. And Chani? She looks like random pretty girl number 532 that you feel like you have seen in a couple of dozend movies before. She is not outstanding, but she should be! Also what the hell is Jason Momoa doing in that movie ruining the immersion with looking exactly like he did in Aquaman? And last but not least. Who on gods earth thought it would be somehow acceptable to make out of Dr. Liet Kynes a black rasta women? And now i really have to ask that question. Is there in every Hollywood film studio a gestapo woke officer that checks you production and if it is not woke enough he brings you in front of the studio to shoot you in the head? If so dear Hollywood people give us a sign, we will help you to save future movies from unnessesary wokeness.To summarize it. This movie should not have been made in the year 2021. The actual movie industry is just not fit enough, to handle stories of such importance. It could have been made in 2005 before the whole movie industry went down the drain or maybe in 10 or 15 years from now. When hopefully people took over, that want to make movies just for the enjoyment of the audience again and not making their own worthless interpretation of a classical story or to transport ""a message"".",Dune
630,johntheholder,"A mediocre , clumsy and wrong film at best even disregarding comparisons to the book",5,21 October 2021,"I haven't even read the book so I am not an angry Dune book fan who can't believe what happened to the book's story.No , this is just my impression after just watching the film, as a standalone thing.It felt weak from the beginning.I see Oscar Isaac and I 'm not buying it , I 'm not into the story , I feel like I am watching an amateur stage act. I see Jason Momoa and still I am not in the story , I think of Aquaman , I am not in Dune. I see Josh Brolin , noting here that I like this actor , and think of his performance in ""No country for old men"" to be great, but I have to say , I see him in Dune , set supposedly in a date far into the future , and I am not buying it , I see him and he is the same guy from No country , he is a Texas sheriff or some sort of that spirit , he isn't a Sci fi character , he can't be a Dune character. Now about Rebecca Ferguson I have to mention the director and his thing with mothers. What is it with this guy and he has to have the mothers to be characters to feel sorry for , characters who cry throughout the whole film. (see ""Incendies"" where the mother also just cries in the whole film , that's her role.) so irritating , so frustrating , and no I am not a mother , I am a guy. The only good aspect of her character was that as a face , as a presence , I did buy her character being in Dune as the mother , even despite the whole crying business.The only other actor who I saw to fit in Dune and I had no trouble with was Javier Bardem , whom I also like as an actor ( being in No country for old men is coincidental , I 'm not prejudiced , I liked him in Almodovar's films greatly and even in Woody Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". It's just that seeing him in Dune , my mind wasn't resisting , saying , no he can't be in Dune , he is just acting like it did with most of the other casting.Lastly the main actor Timothee Chalamet , he wasn't bad , but nothing great either.Other wrong things about the film:Very bad , awkward dialogue. Nothing good said in the whole 2 hours and 30 minutes. But what's good? No it isn't that , it's that like the actors casted , the dialogue also feels wrong , more than that , it certainly is wrong (and sloppy and amateur).Story wise , in a film that runs at 2 and a half hours , there must be some sort of record here , for least character exposition. We see them appear , ok. Who are they , what are they about ? No not much of that.Direction was mediocre at best. And since they think of Villeneuve as "" a name "" among directors , let us do compare the direction of "" Dune part one "" to Stanley Kubrick's "" 2001 A Space Odyssey"" , to Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"", to the Wachowski's ""the Matrix"" and even to Andrew Niccol's "" Gattaca"". It isn't nowhere near their caliber. And to name some other films from books how about Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the rings"" or even the Harry Potter films. No , ""Dune part one "" can't compare to those either , falls short , too short.The whole production is sloppy , the sets are amateur , the whole film is amateur looking , it doesn't look like what a positively good director should make as a Sci fi picture or even as a film no matter the genre , no matter that it comes from a book.To conclude , it is watchable but mediocre ,nothing more than that.",Dune

Here's hoping Villeneuve and the studio(s) are seeing the box office returns and critical praise and solidifying the next installment. If they don't, I'm gonna have to come back and deduct a few stars.I watched on a small (by today's standards) 55 inch television and it was immersive enough that I don't think I'll seek out an IMAX any time soon. If anything it makes me want to look into home projectors and a large pull down screen, but I digress.There aren't many faults with this version of Dune, but they sure better come out with the next part. In fact, Zendaya who is all over the posters and marketing materials doesn't even have a single spoken line that I remember. Her character appears in a few dreams and then again at the end. That part made me think this is being handled in a very slipshod manner. Again, please please actually do the Part 2!!!",Dune

That are the good things to say about this movie. This might be enough for the popcorn munchers.But for those who haven't read the Frank Herbert books or seen the very good 2000 mini-series, it may have become quite clear that the director can't tell a coherent story to save his life. Many cuts seem to be too abrupt, without the necessary bridging, without explanation why the next scene happens at all. ""Anecdotes and Pieces from a Good Book"" by Villeneuve, is more like it.And another thing that bothered me was the acting. There are good young actors out there, but Chalamet, Ferguson and Zendaya aren't it. The often lifeless performances with flat emotions, if any, left a lot to be desired.Conclusion: a forgettable remake.",Dune

639,hjemmefra,Drab (2021),4,26 September 2021,"I have to confess I never got around to reading Frank Herberts Dune-saga. But I did see the Lynch-version when it came out in '84 and remember it as a somewhat creative, but ultimately underwhelming snooze-fest. Then a few years ago I saw Jodorowsky's Dune, the absolutely brilliant documentary featuring the enthusiastic titular directors account of the first attempt at realizing a film-version of the books . Jodorowskys vision of Dune is presented here with imaginative story-boards and beautiful conceptual art from artists like H. R. Giger, Chris Foss and Moebius.And to top it off, Salvador Dali was to act in the 14-hour epic for a fee of a million dollars per minute of screen-time.It was however ultimately an overblown, underfunded vision; and the project ended up as «The greatest film that never was».But great it's influence certainly was. Though never near celluloid, the brilliant remains of the stillborn beauty metastesized through the pop-culture, mushrooming into groundbreaking projects such as Alien, The Terminator, Star Wars and The Incal, to name a few.Upon hearing Villeneuve was to helm this latest attempt I was cautiously optimistic, as he had amongst other good efforts made a decent sequel to Bladerunner. Only worry I had was his sustained teal-palette from that movie. Making for great stills, but a somewhat underwhelming near three hours of blue-greens inn mostly moist conditions-. But still a visually impressive spectacle. Also his earlier sci-fi excursion The Arrival, although cerebral, did not bode well visually.Dune deserved more.So, I had my misgivings.I've seen it now. And the good news is; there's not much teal.But Villeneuve definitely loves his color-coding and here he digs his way down the color-chart, tunneling into the earthier palette of umber,ochre and sienna. -Or drab, as it is.And a very diciplined 2,5 hours of visual drab it is, as you sit there ostriched down in the dusty browns and dirty yellows, contemplating ticket-prices.As this is a science fiction movie and the year supposedly is 10.191, you might hope to see some interesting stuff from 8000+ years of innovation. Some inspired ideas and designs, maybe? Forget it. Most everything they wear is H&M desert-chic and the «futuristic stuff» is what «futuristic stuff» always look like. You even have a guy using an umbrella with absolutely no design-improvements from 8000 years prior. Every room is barren, even the rich folks' digs are as unfurnitured as the gaze of the protagonist. And the warring races with all kinds of high-tech veaponry (All of it shrouded in dust and dirt, so as not recuiring much effort or talent for prop-design)still almost exclusively fight with knives. So we get battles as humdrum,boring and underwhelming as you've seen a thousand times before.I will not comment on the plot, as there is not much of it. Villeneuve seem to have barely gotten past the first few pages in the first of six books.And then there is the inane «Sandwalking». I get the Sandworms just dig the beat. But if you need to walk or run arythmically, you can do so in a straight line, varying lenght of step and speed. -Easy.«Sandwalking» like a spastic with a vily smokers leg, painting half-circles in the sand with your toe every few steps might help rid your sandal of some accidental turd, but as an effective means of locomotion I suggest conserving energy. Get to where you're going, -then dance.And then there's the Spice-harvesters. When the circling drones detects Sandworms approaching, the enormous thumping Spice-harvesters have to be periodically shut down,rescued and airborne. Quite a lot of time,manpower and energy must be spent on this and we have a scene showing the inefficiency and danger of these rescue-operations. Then right after we se everyone using practical bowlingpin-sized «Thumpers» to attract or distract the worms, to great and immediate effect. Would it not be more rational to use these to lure the worms away from the harvesters,too?Safety Protocol (revised):
Drones detect incoming worm and signal harvesters to turn off engine. Drones shoot thumpers into the sand, leading worm away from harvesters. Problem solved. Much safer,cheaper and less downtime.All in all; there is a sense of cohesiveness here though. As the unimaginative script and visual drabness is supported by novocained actors and scored by a tonedead soundtrack of droning base-notes, pathological wailing and prologed wheezing through ""indigenous instruments».This is well thought through.Like tastefully bland IKEA-art. Hung on the Wailing Wall.The level of sustained unimagination showcased here makes Villeneuves Dune a true epic. On every level of drab.",Dune
640,ChubbyChecker,Not quite the Kwisatz Haderach of Dune adaptations - at least not yet,8,31 October 2021,"My love affair with the Dune franchise started in the nineties as an impressionable teenager watching the 1984 film for the first time. I have since read the book, played various computer games based on the same material, and watched the mini series. While I accept that the Lynch effort is flawed I still hold it dear to my heart. Perhaps my criticisms of Villeneuve's Part One stem from comparing it too closely to that film.Firstly, and most glaringly for me, this film just didn't feel as epic as the 1984 version. A lot of the shots are close ups which focus on one or two actors, and when comparing scenes from 2021 and 1984 side by side the 2021 version does at times fall short. I could give specific examples but don't want to put this review in spoiler tags.Secondly was the casting. Most obvious of which was Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica. While I totally bought her as a concerned mother I really didn't see her as a Bene Gesserit, despite concrete examples in the film of her exercising her skills. Other examples of what I felt to be lackluster performances include Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto, where I felt the performance was simply not as convincing as the 1984 effort.Having said the above I still feel this film is about as good an adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune novel as we could get in this day and age. I have high hopes for Part Two, not least because that part of the 1984 version was deeply flawed. Villeneuve now has the opportunity to give us the definitive adaption of Dune in two films. A luxury that Lynch was not afforded.",Dune

642,TheDragonTrader,A movie with the Gom Jabbar at its neck,6,29 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is a master in his craft, there is no doubt about it, but the choice for the project of Dune was one for a project on slippery ice. The book of the same name by Frank Herbert has such a cult following behind it that touching their sanctum is a precarious enterprise.Consequently it's pleasant to see he remained close to the original (the first part of the original, mind you, but I can understand the average moviegoer doesn't want to eat popcorn for five hours straight), but adaptation is the art of choosing and choosing to translate certain elements of the book to the big screen goes at the expense of other elements. This choice is often painfully arbitrary, but in this case could have saved the movie from its mediocrity. Instead of deepening the personal drama, Villeneuve mostly gives attention to the grandeur of Herbert's worldbuilding and the spectacle of the science fiction genre. Impressive, but dramaturgically moderately interesting.It's especially a shame that the story is still in it's infancy at the end. There also doesn't seem to be a real finale. Dune - Part 1 - ends on a strange chord that mostly reminds of the previews of your average soap: watch again next time, because then it wíll be exiting.Yet, Villeneuve knows what people are paying for: a star cast that undoubtedly gave the treasurers of Warner Bros a fright, a grandiose cinematography and a subtle, but surprisingly interesting soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. It's a cocktail that works and makes those two-and-a-half hours fly by.The result is a film that looks and sounds amazing, but that in essence remains shallow. We were promised a movie that would honour the book, but we got a copy-paste of a blueprint that mostly raises the question whether the book should have been adapted in the first place. But it is here now and this Dune-film is probably the best we're going to get. It's all in all an entertaining overture for the sequels that will follow.",Dune

The acting was not great . The fighting scenes were bad and laughable. The original Dune movie in 1984 was much better . The characters are not deep. Alot over-acting by characters like the Aquaman guy and the blue guy from guardians galaxy are just overacting ao bad . The lead actor kid is just so bad at acting almost robot like. . Very disappointing if you watched the original Dune movie or read the book . Just very weak overall. The hand in the box part was just laughable. Watch the original 1984 Dune movie is 20X better.Also the original movie in 1984 showed the whole story. This Dune2021 is basically Dune 1/2 because shows just half the story! Very disappointed.If you watched Dune 1984 then you will feel this new movie is such a disappointment and so lacking in alot of things and the new movie has many illogical parts compared with the old

He makes Mark Hamil's Skywalker seem exciting by comparison. It's as if Hot Topic got a cashier to play the lead.The only character that has a personality is played by Momoa. That said it's as if he walked from the Aquaman set and changed wardrobe. Not much of a stretch.Almost two and a half hours to cover what is an obvious attempt at a franchise starter. It's as if I read half a book.Lynch at least tried to incorporate fun and wonder. This just makes me wonder why everyone wants everything to be a Masterpiece.",Dune
657,jens-257,Its a sold meh,6,21 October 2021,"Watching it in the cinema was a bit annoying since the IMAX sound seemed to be turned up higher then the actual equipment was capable of reproducing sound so that the quiet scenes were fine but whenever anything loud happened the sound was distorted. Visually though it is really epic but that's about it, the acting was middling and some of the characters were much more annoying then I remember them from the books.All in all if you have nothing else to do then its worth a watch but not a second watch.",Dune

The haters are just haters!!Yes it's a slow build but the directing, actors, composers, effects, literally everything you can think of are there making the slow burn exciting, every scene I want to know what's going to be happening next in a good excited way!Personally I'm hoping this is a trilogy at least, if it carries on like this I'd be happy to see a fourth to finish it though.A beautiful film and almost flawless in any regard I can think of as a film fan.",Dune
661,laurenjfree,A Tremendous Achievement,9,24 October 2021,"Dune has everything in a movie that I typically dislike. I was set up to hate it, but much to my pleasant surprise, it was my favourite theatre experience of the year.For a sci-fi film, Dune didn't have an abundance of action scenes. The action that did take place wasn't just given to the audience, it was rewarded. The build up and anticipation was so satisfying to watch pay out, it felt right.Timothee Chalamet is force to be reckoned with, giving one of his best performances to date. Although I doubt Dune will receive any acting nominations (simply because those categories are very tight this year), it checked all the boxes. The cinematography is stunning. The scores are transcending. Editing, sound design and production design are undeniably perfect. I do not believe anyone could have done Dune better than Villeneuve, who adds another hit to his filmography.Despite an intimidating run time, I gladly would have watched hours more. The world Denis created is incredibly immersive. Although it heavily relied on CGI, it felt real. I felt I could reach out and touch the walls, feel the sand, breath the air. Even with giant sand worms, space ships and invisible force fields, I never found it unbelievable (which is something I've never said watching a Marvel movie, no offense).This is a movie meant to be watch on a big screen. If you have a few hours to spare, I beg you, I plead you to run to your local heater and see this now!",Dune
662,brianmlucas,What? I couldn't hear you over the oppressively loud and overplayed score,6,4 November 2021,"I've been a fan of Hans Zimmer ever since that iconic Miami Vice theme. But just as that fantastic score was the only thing heard during that show's intro along with fantastic visuals, so too it is too frequently with this movie. Entire scenes, battles even, important characters single most critical moments, are completely drowned out by the booming score. The actors aren't whispering as some reviews have commented. They just can barely be heard over the oppressively loud and overplayed score. A score that is otherwise great, Hans Zimmer at his best. But it's overuse in both decibels and timing has the effect of rendering the scenes, dialogue, story, characters, everything else secondary to the very stunning IMAX visuals. That's great if you want to watch a 2.5 hour CGI postcard from space.",Dune

This coming from a person who has NOT read the source material.The Background score by Hans Zimmer is good, but, nowhere close to his best work. Cinematography was good, perhaps the best of the year, but again there have been several visual spectacles better than Dune that I have had the pleasure of watching.Of the cast, Rebecca Ferguson was the scene-stealer and was brilliantly supported by an actor I respect, Timothy Chalamet. Of the supporting cast, Oscar Issac was decent and Peter Skarsgard did a good job, all the while reminding me of Marlon Brando from Apocalypse Now.To surmise, if you would want to watch this movie, watch it ONLY on the IMAX screen.",Dune

669,abasu0819,Dune: a frabjous sci-fi excellency!,8,3 November 2021,"In the land of sands, tells a story of consequential ambitions, political struggles & a fated destiny. Dune, originally written by Frank Herbert, is one extravagant grandeur. Adapted by the renowned director, Denis Villeneuve alongside Warner Bros. & Legendary Pictures, the breathtaking journey of 2 hours & 28 minutes lays the most astonishing foundation for what's yet to come.For someone who's not been fortunate enough to have experienced the novels, I was in complete awe of such brilliantly laid concept. Usually, in a sci-fi series of such manner, you'd expect a lot more action deriving from its character driven tendencies rather than a sense of complexity and depth present within the story itself. For Dune, however, you get the perfect blend of everything with a very clear idea of what's there to come and what more could there be from your perspective. The suspence and excitement on the course alone leave you satisfied enough towards the end, if the film itself hasn't managed to amaze you properly yet. But given its slow-paced nature of storytelling, which was indeed a little wearying at times, one may find it hard to keep their attention level consistent or may even go onto dislike it, and understandably so. But considering how well crafted the film is, one is certain not to be left perplexed with the vast world of Dune.The story is arguably the film's strength. Those who've seen Star Wars will undoubtedly be reminded of the iconic trilogies at the beginning of Dune, but it manages to set itself up for us to be able to espy the collosal differences. Much bigger, much more serious, more detailed conceptually, more emphasis on lores, a little less dramatic & overall more profound as compared to the hopeful, glamourous, straight-forward, heart-warming & action-packed saga's of Star Wars. The story itself is deriving from & driven by the themes of oppression, colonialism, political differences & faith, establishing itself something very unique excellently & quickly. The conflict between the Harkonnen & the Atreides possibly brings about the most significant contrariety. It's a political predicament stemming from the seeds sowed a millennia back, which itself leaves an opportunity to develop the characters, story & the world further. It's most definitely not a simplistic story of the ""the dark vs. The good."" It's much more nuanced than that, and even with a limited presentation, comprehending what exactly it's attempting to do is not too difficult. Perhaps, the realisation of the difference also hits harder upon the revelation of the fact Dune is, in fact, much older than the Star Wars franchise! But whether you find this or that amusing depends upon your perception. Personally, I'm a big Star Wars fan!The direction, that apparently has taken quiet a bit of artistic freedom, has turned the film much more than anything you'd otherwise expected it to be. Right from the very beginning, the film makes it clear that the political tensions reign over everything else out there & as the sensational story progresses, it only becomes further evident. The sense of tension was brought to life with a spiffing work of direction that left absolutely no holes to dig in further. What's more, you've this massive cast filled with characters of different cultures, coming together to create and prevent chaos alike that it becomes significantly difficult to choose just one or two characters you want to explore further. For this fine presentation & near-perfect utilisation of the characters to create an impact on the story alone, the director surely deserve a lot appreciation.Perhaps, one complaint I could think of ironically comes down to the very same characters who were so monumental to this extravaganza's success. Having so many characters in a film that's main purpose is setting up the world in a very limited screen-time always comes with one flip side: lack of enough layers, or depth within. You'd wonder what has led the certain characters, specifically Paul's mother in this case, to become what they've; or why are they seemingly so very monumental in driving this grand story forward. Perhaps, that's the cost a ""part one"" of such a complex & ambitious project comes with. But seeing how carefully the film has been crafted, and with its sequel coming in two years time, one can be more than certain that all the questions will inevitably be answered when the time arrives. Though, when's that remains another mystery funnily enough, confirming what has been the preferred format for serious movie watchers for years now: binge-watch! Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or Avengers wouldn't have been the kind of impactful classics they are if people didn't dive onto them again years later to experience them at once to form a conclusive judgement and solidify the love further! After all, not every franchise is James Bond!Coming down to the protagonist - Paul - I feel like he started off in a very generic manner but quickly grew into something much more worth of our attention. Charming, smart, rational, a little hot-headed at times, ambitious & not particularly nuanced just yet but basically, everything you'd usually expect from a lead character of a sci-fi. The world is certainly poised to revolve around him (while having the consequences of its own) & given his strong sense of ""developing"" resolve, which is thematically paralleled to the themes of the film itself, I felt his subtle growth throughout the film was presented ideally. Nothing too extraordinary, but rather perfect enough to lay the foundation and show the potential.Now, now, how could you just watch Dune and ignore the presence of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Chang Chen, Jason Momoa & everybody else? All of them, irrespective of their limited screen-time, did perfect justice to their respective characters throughout. The screenplay definitely enhanced the value of their participation as well. Be it the early interaction of Paul & his father, or the scene of Paul & his mother in the desert, the performances coupled with some great screenplay left an impact in the mind for sure. Oscar Isaac & Jason Momoa, in particular, were the stand-out actors for me despite the fact that they couldn't manage to get a good chunk of the runtime. Perhaps, they were little too good for the film, haha!Coming along, another minor-or-major-or-whatever complaint I could think of was the lack of further exploration of the world, its science & its culture. Given how amusing the world seems to be, it's not my fault to be wanting to experience it further, right? But perhaps, the limited exploration was still not enough to limit the greatness of one of the best cinematographers out there currently - Greig Fraser. The coruscating way in which he managed to capture the sense of tension, the fast-paced action sequences and the mind-blowingly crafted CGI & VFX atmosphere as a whole played an enormous role in glorifying the already so dazzling piece of work! Surely couldn't have happened without the impeccable assistance of Legendary Picture & Warner Bros. Though! And coupled with some background scoring as peerless as ever by the stalwart Hans Zimmer, the experience of Dune is something to remember for long time to come.Living upto the expectations is not so practical for everyone. There are elements in filmmaking which you've to add or sacrifice to spice it up, at the cost of leaving the a small fraction of the audience dissatisfied entirely. But Dune Part One is something that's bound to satisfy you in one way or another. Whether it's the concept, story, characters or the technicalities, Denis Villeneuve has undoubtedly done his finest as always. To sew this up, if Denis' name, the cast & the critically acclaimed novel series wasn't enough to convince or diminish the hesitance in you, I hope this review helps you sincerely in some ways because I reckon, you most definitely wouldn't wanna miss on getting aboard this wonderful rollercoaster of around two and a half hours... Not a masterpiece in any sense just yet, but a true extravaganza in every sense! A classic in making!",Dune

671,inc-133-70013,Beautiful. But...,6,25 October 2021,"2021 Dune does opposite that 1984 version does; If David Lynch tried to put a huge story into limits of a typical movie length and failed, this one is going the other way and stretches it out needlessly. They could easily reduce all the ""looking at the desert thoughtfully"" and ""What shall we become? / Hmmm / Fate will tell you""-type pointlessly poetic non-dialogs, make it either a hour shorter or pack in more content from the original story.The attempt is extremely beautiful to look at, does the world-building quite well, especially at first third of the movie, and doesn't cut too much out from the book. But the movie never gets anywhere, and amount of story that's shown could be explained with just ten sentences.Also, actors look quite sameish, with their metal rock band beards or bald heads and dull clothing. Nothing like the very memorable and colorful characters David Lynch's version or various video games did. That makes entire thing even more dull. Same goes with set/tech/clothing design. Every interior is dark and made of dull stone, spaceships look like giant bricks, clothing and armor is just grey plastic mass. I actually liked David Lynch's art deco craziness more.Acting is pretty good, although Paul Atreides comes off as way too horny and high on drugs sometimes, and Jessica Atreides constantly jumps between being scared out of her mind and then full-on Sarah Connor-type of warrior. It's way too extreme to be believable, since movie can't really show inner monologue, unlike the book, so it looks unbridged and random.Since the first movie tells so little, I would have preferred to wait until entire saga is out, and watch it all in just one go. Right now, it leaves sort of a bitter aftertaste, like you've invested two and half hours, waiting for something to happen, but didn't quite get much out of it.",Dune

Completely blew the original 1984 Dune out of the water, and not just because of better cinematography, and cgi.Just 24 hours ago I saw the original Dune in preparation for this new remake, and my main criticisms for that film were bad pacing, poor world building, and story telling. I am very happy to report this new remake takes care of all the criticisms I had, and then some. This film takes it's time to set things up with such care, and attention to detail.Of course the visuals are stunning, especially in IMAX. I implore all of those who go out to their local cinemas, to watch this film in any premium large screen format. All the visuals are backed up with one of the best scores Hans Zimmer has ever produced, right up there with films like Gladiator, Inception, Interstellar, and many more.Casting here is also very well done, everyone gave such a great performance. Though it did leave me wishing to see more of certain characters/actors on screen, and fleshed out more.This film fixed all the problems I had with the original, and left me wanting more.

674,Fanatic_movie_goer,Masterpiece,10,18 September 2021,"Dune is a very well done movie with a great cast, music, visual effects, scenery and the direction of the camera. It's an amazing feeling to see a movie that is payin an homage to the book.Frank Herbert made a great book about society and an messiah that is getting the feeling of a savior of the people. Denis Villeneuve took that book and made the best movie of the year with Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolinand many others.Timothée Chalamet shines in this role as Paul Atreides. He takes it all like he is the character and makes an amazing performance. Also he has the same qualities as Daniel Day Lewis and maybe he will be the next Lewis (John Campea said it first). Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem doesn't do much in the movie but while their on screen, they don't act the are the characters as does everybody else, but I just had to mention this two actors.The music is by Hans Zimmer and although it's all about the sounds and not the music that works for me. When Paul and his mother are fleeing for the second time that music was breathtaking. Zimmer has completely changed the way I listen to music, 'cause even I now will listen to just sounds and get emotional over it.The camera is so on point with all of the scenes. It has a way of showing you every little thing with out the audience yawning. I felt that the camera and music were really beautifully placed together and I had an emotional feeling to them at the same time.The plot is is really good but we have seen it already by David Lynch, this time we were waiting to see something different from the director of Arrival, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve. He is the master at tge taking time and gets you to feel the movie.",Dune

You can see how much love Villeneuve and the actors put in and I really want to see more. This is the beginning of a new universe.

So in a way watching this movie is kind of a reminiscence for me. Still kinda boring, but by boring this time I meant that the pacing was slow. I get that they have to introduce us to the world, to the families and to the overall socio political background. But it could be executed to be more interesting or at least entertaining. Cinematography was great, as I said it was a visual feast, almost every frame is shot beautifuly, I love the muted down colour palate they have going on here, usually when you see scenes in the dessert, they oversaturated the colour to annoying orange yellowish hue. So this toned down colour is actually very pleasing. Cast was freakin awesome! Love oscar isaac, josh brolin, jason momoa, rebecca ferguson, timothe and javier bardem. The cast elevate the movie, without these actors the movie would be a disaster. The effects are good, the CGI is very well done here. Am I excited for part 2?

678,evgenycaruana,Bring on Part 2!!,9,5 November 2021,"This was Part 1 of probably multiple parts of a franchise that has the potential of being top tier quality cinema.After reviewing the trailer for this masterpiece I went in this movie not knowing anything about Arrakis or Spice or anything about Dune lore. I had heard that it inspired Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones so my interest was peaked.I have always enjoyed Villeneuve's films, they have a particular style to them that just works. Dune Part One was that kind of film to me. I was immersed in the gargantuan epic scale of the visuals as well as how the story progressed. The flow just worked. Combined with Hans Zimmer's appropriate soundtrack which was definitely in his element of music choice. The music certainly set the correct tone for this masterpiece.The cast was beautiful and just right for the roles they were playing. Timothée Chalamet stunned me with his powerful acting portraying the role of Paul Atreides. Zendaya does a marvelous job at not being Zendaya and actually made me interested as to who Chani was. Chani is barely in the film because this is only the first part and Paul Atreides finally meets her in the last few minutes of this film. Even though we see only glimpses of her through dreams, she still left an impression at the end.Jason Mamoa's Duncan Idaho was a fun, charismatic and charming character which left an everlasting impression as well. I actually felt emotionally attached to this character especially when he dies as sacrifice in order to aid Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to escape the Harkonnens. I actually was seeing Duncan Idaho and not Jason Mamoa, that is what it felt like.The rest of the cast was fantastic, the Emperor was really menacing and definitely sold me the notion that he must go. Bill Skarsgard does an amazing job at this role, simply scary and true to the lore I must add.Seeing the scale of which the director filmed this, mesmerized me as well as kept me engaged with the flow of the story. I was absolutely gob-smacked by the sheer scale of the Dune giant sandworm Shai-Hulud. It felt like I, the viewer, was actually there and it was truly a terrifying yet beautiful sight to behold!I am really glad I saw this movie in a cinema and not at home for this was definitely one of the best cinematic experiences to date. Cannot wait for Dune Part Two! Go see this film in theatres, you will not be disappointed!",Dune
679,vinifernandes,Go to the Cinema! WOW!,10,22 October 2021,"Wow!Easily the most beautiful movie of the year!Denis Villeneuve knows how to create the setting for science fiction stories, however, the dedication in portraying every single detail of the Dune universe was amazing!We also need to acknowledge the editing and photography teams, and the writers as well, considering that they've set an masterpiece. Another thing to note, is the effortless appeal on the CGI, making everything seem so natural.Obviously, a big part of the movie is the incredible sey of actors, and they did not disappoint! Timothée, Oscar Isaac, and Rebecca Fergunson deliver an academy performance, with a special addition of Momoa and Stellan (""Baron"" - with an amazing make up and creative way to portray the character).It is a perfect, detailed and creative movie, with heart and soul! Great action scenes, different connotation within the main story, in which the profecy has a much bigger impact than what was portrayed in the 1980's film.The only thing that can be questioned is the time, and the huge appeal for the sequence, in which many people can feel as a studio guidance on contrast with the art itself. However, it's comprehensible, considering how the movie contains detailed content from the book.In conclusion, this sequence of movies can really be the new ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" of our generation. It was an amazing experience, with an incredible plot.Ps: WATCH IT ON THE BIG SCREEN.",Dune
680,shaunvanhaelewijn,A real review,8,15 September 2021,"Is it a good, fun and visual stunning movie? YES, without doubt. This is by any means a slow burning sci-fi opera with one of the most beautiful cinematography in history. Is it a masterpiece? NO, absolutely not. I'm a huge Villeneuve fan. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most underrated movies in years in my opinion. The atmosphere he created there almost was perfection in it's finest form. Somehow he tried to do something similar in this movie, and it just didn't work out for the best. Visuals are important and are decisive factor for the atmosphere in the movie. Villeneuve does this as none other. You will be flabbergasted at many occasions. This in combination with the sound mixing and music by Zimmer really works out well. I love how he captured the somewhat religious vibe in the costumes and decor. Not many movie directors are able to let you believe this world could very well exist. The architectural minimalist approach of the decors really help to get you into the story. And here is where Villeneuve gets it wrong. Somehow the story never really gets launched. Mainly to do with too many bleak characters who are not able to carry the story. This results in a visual stunning sci fi opera with not too many story. And the little story you get is just too little. If you have not read the book you will leave the theaters with the feeling still not knowing what it was all about after 1 1/2 hours. The main problem was that Villeneuve couldn't decide where to end part one, resulting in a messy plot that wasn't a plot.Still I absolutely adored this movie. Because of the excellent atmospheric style in the movie you could not, not be mesmerised with what was happening on the screen. I have big hopes for part 2 where the story will actually really start. Perhaps splitting this movie in only two parts wasn't the best decision. Many people claim it was to slow. I think it was not slow enough and should really have focused more on an audience that doesn't know the full story.",Dune
681,ruidanielbarrossss,This is not a story about white saviors.,10,17 October 2021,"What can I say. Not only did I watch this movie, but my body was astrally projected to Arrakis.I got goosebumps whenever Hans Zimmer's melody pulsed through every sequence in this movie. I was surprised by the scale of the film's production. I went into trance together with Paul Atreides when he discovered that the tragic fate he envisioned was coming true.This movie only partially loses because it's half of a whole. I want to see more but I can't.Boring! For those with terrible taste, I have no doubts about that.As for the criticism of the white savior, read the damn books. Or just pay attention to what you're watching.Midway through the film, Paul has a vision of the future, in which the dangers of charismatic leadership elevated to godhood are thrown in the viewer's face.

And thats it, that's all the good I can say.Some of the acting was poor, and characters that did feature didn't feel believable.

687,fosnock,Brillant and visually spectacular but...,9,22 October 2021,"A movie should stand on its own merits. I should not have to read the book to get the full grasp of the movie. Saying that the movie does a nice job explaining things without exposition (The first Dune (1984) had way too much exposition). It even explains things a bit more logically considering the condensed material, as they eliminated major plots\characters. Unfortunately this movie leaves out critical details, like a lasguns effect on a Holtzman field (shield). This leads us to a scene where they are using a lasgun to try and destroy a shielded thopter. In other scene we see what looks like cluster bombs being use on Atreides house troopers who should be shielded. Their are more than a couple of faults along this line (would it kill you to explain who is Thufir Hawat, or what a Mentat is, or who are the Saudakar ) which I will not go into, but you know their are issues if you have not read the book and you're left scratching your head wondering why they are not using the lasers to kill everyone. And if you read the book you're scratching your head wondering, how the hell can they risk subatomic fusion like that.",Dune

There was a difficulty in understanding the words from some of the characters.Unsure if this was a creative decision or editing error, but the movie looked too dim at some parts and could use a bit more brightness I feel, to capture facial expressions and setting better, nevertheless the cinematography is one of the most beautiful I have seen, this truly is picturesque beautiful like the milky way at night.To Dune fans - Frank Herbert would be so happy, the film captures the novel's spirit, and you will truly feel Paul's wit, anger, sadness and journey to Muad'Dib, thanks to Timothee Chalamet and the production.Expect few minor changes; Sardaukars are more dangerous, Baron doesn't look as disgusting, Fremens are much accurate and cooler, memorable lines from the novel are not in the film, dialogues spoken from different characters than the original from the novel.We all know how difficult it is to adapt Dune, if people though Lord of the Rings was hard, they clearly never read Dune. Do not expect perfection because the lore is so deep, it would require multiple prequels, or a prelude to Dune prologue explaining the vast universe of it.

As a Frank Herbert fan I was confused at the disinterest the filmmakers apparently had in the story and what their objective was in remaking this film. I mean really, why would you remake a David Lynch movie if you have no interest in the story?On the plus side, Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson delivered strong performances with the rest of the cast at least better than middling.All in all, this would have made a great TV miniseries but really lacked the vision for the big screen, and in particular for a remake of such an iconic cult classic.",Dune

Baron Harkonnen was not even a 10th as revolting, mad or disturbing as the original's, so yes, all very pretty with its cinematography, but no depth of character. It didn't feel like Hamlet, more like ""meh"". Peter de Vries was a conniving muffa f'cker and you could TASTE his deceit in the original. Also, dragonfly inspired aircraft?

Even more sad since this is yet another movie of Denis Villeneuve that I couldn't get into. Something about his work really doesn't grab my attention or interest.Now I've never read the books or even know anything about it aside from the keywords ""sand, spice, sandworms and Star Wars in desert"". And the movie really doesn't help newcomers understand much of the lore. Its shot so anti-climactically and has the usual Denis Villeneuve somber color palette it just couldn't keep me invested in the story or the characters. Half of the movie is literally shown before it happens through visions and it really doesn't help with how extremely predictable it already is. Maybe its just I've seen too much of blockbusters to feel a thing now but it wasn't even a fun time.Overabundance of CGI didn't even make the action scenes feel entertaining. Half of the movie is ""Mexico color"" and other half is dark as a DC movie. It just doesn't work for me. It was neither the action blockbuster nor a deep interwoven story that I was expecting. What it was, was a 2hr 30mins waste of time for me.I really don't get what people see in this movie or the lore for that matter(I haven't read it, based on just this movie). I also do not get why people regard Denis Villeneuve as one of the best directors but most of all I don't understand whats it with Villeneuve movies that simply doesn't grab me like it does everyone else. There is a part 2 already in the works, hopefully it does something for me.Lastly I have to say even though I know nothing about the lore or the story DUNE really shouldn't have a movie adaptation. I felt like there is soooo much that is missing and are being swept aside to maintain a release runtime. Maybe if it was a series and it took time to establish said character I would've been much more invested. Every single character here was wooden and uninteresting and thats a shame looking at the stellar ensemble of creative actors playing the role.RATING: 6.5/10.",Dune

704,badcgishark,A beautiful but hallow film,6,23 October 2021,"I realize that it is a herculean task to convert thousands of pages of text into several movies that will likely be around 6-9 hours long total. Add to the fact that, this was originally written in the 1960's and has been aped by countless other pieces of science fiction over the past 60+ years since its original writing. Due to these two issues, the film comes across as pedestrian at times with enough sci-fi and fiction tropes to trip over nearly every minute of the film.A boy is a chosen one. People can be commanded to do things with a special voice power. An indigenous people who experience genocide due to resources on their land being mined by evil corporate greed. Angry men fighting non stop. One spy that can disable all defenses of a military base with tens of thousands of soldiers. An antagonist that is completely evil and two-dimensional. Being challenged to trial by combat and needing a champion. The chosen one possibly being good or evil...Here's the sad thing - these things in the 1960's were still novel. The spice plot device works well enough and I can imagine that these books were so well received because they were one of the frontrunners for science fiction as we now now it. In 2021 however, so many copycats have covered these topes to death, and to see them in the film is even more sad as I am sure that people will think that Star Wars or other sci-fi did these things first and that Dune is copying them.The special effects and action scenes are great, but the film under delivers with a by the numbers plot that is incredibly stale at this point.6/10.",Dune

This is the first film I've seen Timothee Chalamet in, and he was fantastic, absorbing almost all of the screen time. The only other performance that rivaled his in this movie was Stellan Skarsgård, as the behemoth villain Baron Harkonnen. In my opinion he was the actor that made the biggest impact in the shortest amount of time. The visuals and sound design are impeccable and you can't deny that Denis Villeneuve has a vision for what the Dune franchise should be.

However we can't forget the fact that some features of the plot are a bit too unrealistic that we can certainly be sure that they never would happen; like the biggest problem of it as it's the absence of communication technology which the movie is based on it, there is no phone no futuristic kind of internet or communicating technology while the humankind has managed to conquer the universe and live on every single corner of it! It's more like to be a mutation in human inventions in the exact middle of "" medieval era"" that has let them to go everywhere in the world while they still have an old fashion of medieval era beside the communication technology of 1950s! It's potentially unrealistic and never the mankind would lose their technology powers to this down level! That bothered me a bit, but totally it's an awesome movie!So well made that even while events are almost happening in sands and dunes at the middle of nowhere, but still you don't feel bored and keep up with characters(IF you like the genre, for sure; otherwise you can't even imagine what it is all about as I've already seen people complaining about it)By the way I can't hold it not to talk about the music! Man, that's absolutely amazing!Hans Zimmer never disappoints anyone and every single project he works on, is perfect. You should listen to all tracks individually and you notice goosebumps all over your body!! Seriously, I mean it, the Dune soundtracks are in another level! They give the movie the sense of what it all tries to be, in the best way that it could be!Although it bothers once the whole movie encourages you to follow the events from the very first moments to a special point but then suddenly the movie ends in an open end of an upcoming beginning, but it does gives you a desire to remember it and wait for the next at the same time! :DAs a fan, I'm Just waiting for Next Dune(s)And by the way, the genre is not for everyone, many people seem to have got bored, cause they want so much actions and explosions, etc etc...!

708,cmantafounis,Dune,6,24 October 2021,"After directing two magnificent sci-fi films in a row (Arrival and Blade Runner 2049), Denis Villeneuve has tried his hand at adapting Frank Herbert's celebrated novel Dune, featuring music by Hans Zimmer and an all-star cast. Given the immense amount of talent poured into this project, then, the final result can only be considered underwhelming. Despite the rich philosophy and patient storytelling of his previous two works, Villeneuve's latest renders Herbert's political and religious allegory thin, discarding any substantive subtext in favour of an action blockbuster; what is left is strictly spectacle. Characters are given minimal development or, in many cases, zero defining attributes that set them apart from any other member of the never-ending list of names. That Villeneuve is deeply enamoured with the source material is always apparent, often to its detriment - I struggle to imagine how confused someone might be who had no previous knowledge of Herbert's creation. It is never made clear why the audience should care about the events on screen, in lieu of a discernible protagonist to identify with, or what the relevance of the numerous expository narration sequences are; the viewer is bombarded by fictional terms to the point of being overwhelmed. Indeed, I fear the brief moments of emotional attachment I felt while watching was solely the result of my fondness for the novel. The film is loyal to a fault, yet parses multiple scenes that might have added to the characters which so sorely lack any depth. Yueh is barely granted five minutes of screen time before his betrayal, making the supposed reveal utterly meaningless. The whole affair feels rather thrown together: scenes follow one another in disjointed fashion, with a profound absence of any forward momentum. The film feels as though it were about to end several times, making the eventual conclusion comparatively random and sudden. Dune is not exactly a novel of two parts - though stopping just after Leto is murdered would perhaps have been more natural - and this is apparent in the adaptation. Zimmer's score regularly employs one of my least favourite types of movie music, that being discordant choral sounds and/or tribal chanting (think of Wonder Woman's theme in Zack Snyder's Justice League, or the *climax* in Munich - bleh). Obviously not all bad, as the cinematography and VFX work stand out as stellar; too often, however, the landscapes are unappealingly monochromatic, generally a dull grey or sandy orange. Deakins' absence is felt - Blade Runner 2049, this is not. Runtime mostly glides by, and there are some adequate performances. Just can't help feeling that this is merely a two-and-a-half hour prologue to the real story that is teased throughout in premonitions, a second part which hopefully will feature character arcs and actual substance beyond the action and effects. Here's hoping.",Dune

The thing that stood out was that Baron Harkonnen is into young boys and has a thing for Paul.

As Vladimir H. Was also much more dark and brooding than Kenneth McMillan and Ian McNeice, which I appreciated (not that those actors did poorly). The reason why I'm rating this the same as I did the previous versions is that I didn't really feel surprised or inspired... other than the way it looked or sounded, I didn't feel like I got anything new (Keynes being a woman doesn't count - that's a wonderful change but her gender doesn't affect the story so far).Part II will be the decider - if Feyd or Chani brings something new to the table, or perhaps Alia or Irulan are presented in a different way, I may feel differently.

714,MrWeenie,"Less Goofy, Better Effects",7,22 October 2021,"I don't think I can rate this higher than the original based on better special effects, because then you're only grading the present state of technology as better. That aspect of this you'll probably find more enjoyable, naturally.I think also that the original was made for a younger audience being influenced by Buck Rogers and Star Wars, undoubtedly a decision by the studio to cash in on a trend. This new version is slightly freer to be itself.Where the new version is not freer, however is that it is just the latest action movie, another Godzilla vs Kong, another Transformers. Accordingly, its drama scenes are not as intense as in the original. I think this enabled Lynch to do a better job of explaining the complexities of the plot and he even did so in a shorter runtime.I think in the end, I enjoyed that the remake is less goofy and has better effects, but I wish it had been better at storytelling. There was something lost in this version on that end which, again, may've been a producer's decision.",Dune
715,radursm,"Too little, too soon, too much package but an ampty content",4,13 October 2021,"Even if you had at your disposal a notable cast, a script that should not fail (because it's just an adaptation of a famous novel, appreciated by many people), an en vogue composer for the soundtrack, you do not have all the ingredients to make a good movie. And it came out with a rumble: Dune 2021 is only part I of a series!Remember the disappointment after the first movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy? At least then the Fellowship of the Ring was an attractive, original, and dynamic film. This is not the case now.Dune 2021 is a collection of beautiful images, with background music that is meant to be uplifting and mystical, but it's (actually) a Dead Can Dance overuse/abuse.., in which fashionable actors appear (Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brollin, Javier Bardem, Oscar Isaac), but who, poor them, have only three or four dialogues throughout the film.Let me develop a little:
Jason Momoa is Duncan Idaho, I think you can see him in about 7 minutes ( the movie is two and a half hours). He does a little fight, as he knows best, but the given scenes are neither spectacular nor funny.Stellan Skarsgård is Baron Harkonnen, who looks creepy and crazy, but he's not nearly as impatient and disgusting as 1984 David Lynch's (played by Kenneth McMillan), nor does he inspire perversity and go-getterism like the 2000 version, well played by the brilliant Ian McNeice. This one is a banal negative character, he could be any murderer in a typical police movie.Josh Brollin is not Gurney Halleck at all. He doesn't stand out, you don't see him playing ""the baliset"", he's not the romantic killer Gurney is, he doesn't behave like a grandfather to Paul. He's just the head of the guard corps!Javier Bardem is a bit far from how we know him, but he may be the only one who can get close to the character he plays (Stilgar). Unfortunately, he only appears for 5 minutes in the movie.Oscar Isaac surprised me. He's better here, as the Duke, than Poe in Star Wars. He's serious, he plays decently.Rebeca Ferguson could just as well have gone to a shopping mall. She's not Jessica, she's not a mystic, she's not a protective mother, she's not a weaver of destiny, she's not in love with the Duke, she's not a Bene Gesserit witch. I think in her mind she was thinking about how much more she has until the end of the filming program, because she seems very bored ...Timothée Chalamet is not necessarily a catastrophe, but he struggles to look deep, and on big horses. He falls into introspection (a lot, in my opinion) like a foolish daydreamer. And he dreams of details of swirling cloth, grains of sand, sunbeams ... Or, on the contrary, he has a nightmare: he is shown a bloody dagger, the Jihad of the Golden Way (poorly illustrated) and how he kissed Chani. But these more dynamic visions appear seldom, as he rather gives in to dreaming more sunlight and more sand.It's not the actors' fault! I think Denis Villeneuve got into a thing a bit too complicated for him. Dune is not easily put into images. It's okay to dare to screen it, but either you do it weird and atypical, as David Lynch did in 1984, or you see green horses on the walls (but you leave it after a while), like Jodorowski wanted in the '70s, when he began preparations for the screening of the novel for a 15-hour film, a project that included big names: Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, Gloria Swanson, Pink Floyd, Moebius and HR Geiger, but, hey, he was on LSD, or you don't expect something grandiose, but you are loyal to the novel (The 2000 series, which also had heavy names: William Hurt, Susan Sarandon, Giancarlo Giannini, Ian McNeice, James McAvoy).Until another one movie will be made, even if it has special effects for a PC equipped with Pentium 2 and an ATI RAGE 2 graphics card with 4 MB VRAM, the 2000 version (SciFI Chanel) is the best, in my honest opinion.This Villeneuve version might become acceptable after seeing the sequels (as many as there are, I have no idea), but I would be surprised if it did.A waste of time and money.",Dune
716,ffiisshh,Made for Dune readers and everyone else.,10,22 October 2021,"I must congratulate Mr. Villeneuve. Never have I seen before a Director staying so true to the original source material, the brilliant Novel by Frank Herbert. As a LONG-time Dune reader, I did not know what to expect in this latest adaptation of the book. I was pleasantly surprised that this film captured the very essence and feel of the Dune Universe. It was as if someone reached into my mind and recreated imagery of the majesty and scale of this magnificent masterwork of literature. At the same time impressing the audience with jaw-dropping scenery, the movie also captures the detail and subtlety of the characters in a way that was truly unexpected. I must admit, I didn't think that anybody could have pulled this off, but I was wrong. Also, the cinematography and art direction were absolutely amazing. The scope and beauty of the dessert imagery were captured in a way that is almost reminiscent of the great films of David Lean, ala Lawrence of Arabia...et al. I am amazed that the film was well paced, yet had the good sense to take moments to pause and reflect (even in silence, in some parts)... a refreshing change from the typical action block-busters with intense over-the-top constant action. This is what Cinema is all about. I love that this film series is now in the hands of a master Film Maker, like Mr. Villeneuve. As a devoted fan of the Book series and a lover of great movies, this one will, definitively, stand the test of time. Enjoy!",Dune

Then the next 1hr & however many minutes left in the film is when it got somewhat interesting. The sand worms automatically made me think of Beetlejuice & Star Wars where Luke has to save himself & Han. The main huge battle was interesting, the machines designs themselves were interesting.

721,BrentCowey,Faithful to the story but still misses the target,6,18 October 2021,"Just watched Dune, I had been looking forward to this for soooo long!My vote-
4/10 if you haven't read the books and don't know the story.7/10 if you DO know the story.Review:
I have read the books so many times, dozens of times.... I know them so well. Unlike the 1984 film version this is pretty faithful to the books (with some small deviations) but many of the scenes and film story will only make sense to those that have read the books and know what is going on.If you don't know the story/books then many scenes will leave you scratching your heads. The Harkonnens and the Baron were not represented well enough to portray their evil/ruthlessness. The big battle scene was confusing, the Voice and the reason for using/not using shields and laz blasters was not made very clear (worms yes, atomics and shield feedback no!)
Liet Keynes' ending was not as the books, and Pauls prescience was not very well explained.That said, much more faithful to the books then the previous travesty, but too slow and probably a confusing mess to the non-reader. So much detail and nuance was lost despite its 2 ½ hour run-time and it was JUST finally getting better when it ended.This is only part 1, it had great potential but sadly missed the target in this initial release
(I HOPE there is a much longer Directors Cut released with extra back-story and detail)
Mostly I now hope they actually release part 2 and it does not get cancelled due to this slow, confusing (relatively faithful) initial film.",Dune

726,humzahladiwala,Dune,8,23 October 2021,"Dune is a very well directed and made sci fi epic, that was a enjoyable experience and it delivered exactly what it promises. It should be renamed in IMDB as Dune- Part One, because that is exactly what it is, and it definitely feels like that. I have read the book, and I believe it is more enjoyable this way because it felt geared towards those like myself. It was a very faithful adaptation, that didn't add anything unnecessary and only took Frank Herbert's (author) own plot points and didn't mess with it too much. It is definitely no Lord of the Rings and weirdly, it doesn't feel like it wants to be despite the obvious comparisons one can make. The actors were solid, but I still have a bit of skepticism about Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides. He feels too delicate, too much of a boy, but I believe the second part can redeem his performance by making him stronger and more fremen-like, just like the book. The standout, or at least the performance that is burned in my head is Baron Harkonnen. Nah man, that performance was creepy as HELL, and full credit to the makeup team, they better get something for that incredible effort. Overall, Dune Part One is what it wants to be, and I have no problem with that. I can't wait for Part Two, and you can't ask for anything more.",Dune

I have since read all of the books available, but always prefer those by Frank Herbert.I was excited to see this movie. However, it has many flaws. First, it is so painfully slow it really needs to be recut. Second, Chamalet as Paul Atredies. He looks more like a dancer than anything else. I sincerely doubt he could fight his way out of a wet paperbag. Third- some of the scenes are so poorly done with CGI that you can literally see the blue screen behind the actors. It almost shimmers. I could go on, but you get the picture.The good things- some of the CGI is good. However, I would say the 1984 version of this movie, with it's many flaws, got more things right with limited CGI ability, than was available for this movie.All in all?

735,Scotslad_007,Newer Not Always Better Just Different,6,24 October 2021,"Have not read the book so this is a comparison of the 1984 version, which I imagine is true of the majority of people. Not a review of how it differs from the book, but I read that making a movie from this book is a real challenge if not impossible and only really through interpretation can it be done. So this review is of the screen writer's interpretation. My initial reaction is 1984 is a classic which I've re-watched many times so know it very well, and when you have come to know a movie well you will critique the next to a higher standard. You want them to take what worked and improve upon it.Character and dialog: The first thing I missed was the 1984 use of communicating inner dialogue at key parts of the movie, the hand in the box test, the attempted assassination of Paul, etc. 1984 Paul from acting to dialog is just far superior, same for his mother which has an even wider gap. 2021 Duke Leto character/script was very good and I would say better. 2021 Duncan, The Baron, etc, are all very muted compared to their 1984 counterparts. Which really then takes away from the story its trying to tell when you have this in the back of your mind.Story telling: Again the 2021 just didn't do as well of a job showing Paul even in the few comparable scenes on his home world. Those same scenes in the 1984 are very intense although the CGI is not comparable 84' did it way better.The Baron is very toned down in the 2021 version, trying to make it palatable I imagine for today's audience. Well, it killed the bigger than life character provided in 84'.The Doc, even worse in building this character and providing any depth as to his closeness with the family and to his betrayal.Lady Jessica is simply bigger than Life in the 84' version, 21' I'm not sure how but this is not a close comparison.What I really like from the 21' and they did a better job was making the worlds feel so much bigger and immersive.Finally how Paul and Lady J meet the Fremen is a big part of the 84' version and nothing clicked in the 21' interpretation of the same events.I know this is part 1 and I will always appreciate attempts to interpret this book. I'm hoping part 2 changes my mind :-)",Dune
736,GeorgeMezori,6.... watch 1984 version,6,22 October 2021,"I was really hyped up for this. The old version is a tiny bit dated here and there but there's a LOT of good things about it too. So I was excited about an updated version. And I didn't care if it was 3 parts. 3x as much right. WRONG. I like so many things about the original more than this one. I watched the original again after. Acting is so much better. Pacing is really good. It's not 3x more. It's like less action and drama than the original spread about in 1/3's. So it's kinda slow crawl. Beginning of original had that ultra cool part with the Guild visit. The sets were big for 1984 too. The Harkonnen (why did they cfhane the pronunciation?) were much more creepy. I was really looking forward to a new interpretation of the Harkonnen and.... I was deeply disappointed. 1984 vesion there were anti-human uncivilized in every way. I thought maybe the 2nd part the new movie will be like Empire Strikes Back and be much darker. But they already skipped my Guild scene, let me down with Harkonnen, and did the betrayal/invasion/war etc. Already and left me thinking the original was better in almost every way.",Dune
737,demented_peruvian,Potential marred by bad lighting and pacing,6,24 October 2021,"The latest adaptation of the first 40% of Frank Herbert's novel promised to be more faithful tham prior adaptations, while adding great visuals from Villeneuve. Unfortunately, it only adapted a few more details, offered no visual innovation, was unnecessarily slow and repetitive, and hid two thirds of the movie in very low lighting.For reference:
-I am a fan of the Lynch version.-I have read Herbert's novel and enjoyed it.-I am sonfamiliar with Herbert's opinion on the prior adaptation, which was more supportive than that of his fans, who often complained of.omission of details that existed only in their imagination.-I thought the Sci-Fi channel miniseries from 2001 was fair but not gripping.-I have enjoyed most of Villeneuve's work, especially ""Arrival"".Strengths:
-When you get to see the cinematography, there are some very good visuals, about 20 of which could be framed.. Sangren takes over for Deakins but imitates him closely.-The effects are seamless.-The supporting cast is interesting, stand out from each other, and quite good.-A few more details are captured about Dr Kynes and the ecology of Dune, even though much of it was still left out.-Hans Zimmer 'wailing' score works at times, before it becomes awkwardly overused.-Enough interesting dialogue is kept.Weaknesses:
-Most of the movie is shot in unnecessarily dark rooms, or outside at night, or at shadows near sunset, or against the brightest sun. Thus, you clearly see very little of what is on the screen. Some characters' faces are barely seen in their entire presence in the movie. It also ruins scenes like the 'jom gabbar' test or the trap of the floating needle in Paul's room.-The first 40 minutes consist too heavily of whispering.-The same shots of dreams and visions are shown over, and over, and over.-Chalamet acts okay with his oral delivery, but his facial expression is the same mopey one throughout. His physique is credible as an adolescent, but not as a warrior.-Baron Harkonen is barely featured.-For a movie that was heavily hyped around what Villeneuve was imagining, I was let down by seeing visuals that were just a mix of Lynch's original, the desert scenes of ""Batman V Superman"", the latest ""Star Wars"" trilogy, a sprinkle of Tarsem and ""Avatar"", your average Hollywood desert epic, and a few callbacks to Villeneuve's prior movies.The ending and some of the vision scenes promise more interesting visuals in the second part. I hope it is so.",Dune

740,cwkenreich,Pure cinematic beauty and a faithful adaptation,9,24 October 2021,"Villenueve's attempt at adapting the unwieldy epic novel has proved a major triumph. The accuracy to the source material is truly profound. You could feel the spice, taste the desert; the costumes, the acting, the production design; you forgot that the Fremen were fictional people. The nuances of their culture; It was as though they were a legitimate branch of Islam. One major aspect of the book that the film didn't fully capture was Jessica's inner dialogue as a Bene Gesserit. Nonetheless, Rebecca Ferguson's performance was a standout with moments of genuine concern for her son, her sixth sense of Bene Gesserit hyper-awareness, and internal conflicts between faith and family.Naysayers will dismiss the film as just another opulent and soulless cash-grab thrown together by the whatever remains of Hollywood after this pandemic. There is some merit to that, especially in the beginning as robotic-looking CGI armies march in unison. Also, you're not fooling anyone with special ""fight choreography"" these days. The action scenes in Dune were by no means cliche or poorly-crafted, but it is a testament more to the emotional weight of these scenes rather than the quality of the visual effects. The greatest moments of Dune were moments of pure grandeur; where the individual pieces of film shine on their own or are flawlessly integrated. A simple shot of Paul walking on Caladan with Hans Zimmer's score swelling, Jessica and Paul staring defiantly at the intricately crafted sandworm, and especially, the meditating darkness of space. Personally, the uncanny form of the Baron and the deep-throated voice of the Sardaukar were brilliantly designed. Nothing is delivered in excess. The full form of the sandworm only appears once, but the longer than average duration of every shot forces you to absorb it all at once and never look back.I agree with other reviewers in that any shortcomings in terms of the story are overshadowed by the scope of the film; although, little to none were evident. Some criticize the pacing, but that's exactly what one should expect from the restless audiences of today. Since this is Villeneuve, expect the pacing to be similar to Blade Runner 2049. Some of the greatest films of all time are drawn out slow burns: including Blade Runner, 2001: a Space Odyssey, The Shining, Once Upon a Time in the West, and Lawrence of Arabia. While these films test the audience's patience, they are also the most rewarding cinematic experiences. In addition, note that the story only covers about half of the book. Just like Lord of the Rings, the first film ends on a cliffhanger, but appropriately placed after sitting through the 2.5 hour runtime.The music of Dune is nothing less than Hans Zimmer. The ancient drums and lamentations are combined with the more futuristic techno elements, making for a uniquely sweeping complement to the visuals; always slightly foreboding and never romanticizing the harsh desert landscapeThe cinematic experience itself is unforgettable. Considering that the source material influenced both Star Wars and Game of Thrones, Dune is undeniably blockbuster material. If you plan on watching, expect the sci fi elements of Star Wars, the family feuds of Game of Thrones, the grandeur of Lawrence of Arabia, and the direction of Blade Runner 2049. Dune gives a friendly tour of the desert during its first half, only to thrust you into its clutches for the second half. The sense of fatigue combined with Paul's hallucinogenic sensations place you under a sort of spell, that you wake up from only when the credits start rolling.",Dune

742,zacharyrivas21,In Desperate Need of a Sequel,7,26 October 2021,"'Dune' was good, but for its budget, it fell short.Visually enticing with a brilliant ensemble of Hollywood's elite. The cinematography was breathtaking and the soundtrack brought you right into the action... however there was not much action to be brought into.And that is where I think 'Dune' fell short: it didn't entertain; it wasn't as epic as it was portrayed to be. I come from the perspective of not knowing anything about the 1965 book or even the 1984 film coming into this movie. Based on that perspective, 'Dune' was a whole lot of exposition of never ending introductions and rising action to relatively no climax.It truly is a compelling story, but, unfortunately, it is such a huge, intricate narrative to adapt to the big screen. So much so that even a director of Villanueve's stature struggled to do. With that being said, 'Dune' desperately needs a sequel that will actually live up to the hype because this one did not.",Dune

Seriously, Timothée Chalamet was born for this role and it's nice to see Khal Drogo, i mean Jason Momoa, kick some intergalactic ass! Hans Zimmer did an amazing job again with the music. And those landscapes! I don't think I've ever seen a better looking desert in a movie before!I like that it's not too much on the funny side, the overall atmosphere is very moody and dangerous and i like that.I personally thought that there wasn't enough blood during the action scenes, like, many characters get killed but, unlike Game of Thrones, you just see them falling down and that's it. I personally like it better when a movie or TV show is a bit more generous with the tomato sauce but ok, that's just a matter of taste i suppose.Overall, it's a visual treat with a slightly slow (but never boring) story!

749,santiagofdec,"Fantastic, complex, singular film experience!",10,4 November 2021,"There are varied interwoven layers and tunnels into the new film adaptation of Frank Herbert's highly influential and previously though to be unfilmable novel Dune, one has to have the will and focus to submerge into them. These depths arise from the narrative elements that exist within the novel itself, but what makes Denis Villeneuve's film great is that they are also mended together into the visual and sonic representations of these ideas using screen craft (acting, cinematography, production design, costume, props, sound, music, special effects, visual effects, etc.) and so, cinema's potential to create a visceral and sensory experience that expresses the essence of the novel wholly in non-lingual terms. It may be easy for modern audiences, who are accustomed to rapid narrative stimulation, visual diabetes and intellectual underestimating, to either delve deep enough to grasp these ideas and place them in the forefront of consciousness, or to experience the overwhelming, almost physical reaction to the cinematic experience. This is part of what makes the film so extraordinary, also a commercial risk, and why it has taken so long to bring it to the screen. It is at the same time an epic in multi-million-dollar proportions, a journey requiring extensive visual effects and thousands of human resources; and an arthouse film that has a character's spiritual coming of age at the center of a complex metaphor for the state of humanity in the last 120 years, a critique of materialism, colonization, greed and gluttony, environmentalism and the devastating hunt for our planet's resources that has caused war within ourselves and the destruction of our home. It's a calling to embrace our humanity, while at the same time surpass our most animal instincts and overcome ourselves. It is at it's very core a person's search to ignite his deepest potential and come to be with one's self and the universe in divine harmony.",Dune

Usually, a single movie in a series still brings a closure to a smaller story within the larger story arc to further set things up for the next chapter of the arc. For example, Avenger: Infinity War ended on avengers losing to Thanos and losing half pops. It further sets up for Avengers: Endgame's climatic battle - and that was the whole Act 1, a complete story within a larger story with a closure. Dune: Part 1, on the other hand, didn't have any closure, nor cliffhanger...again, it just kind of ended nowhere. It really should've been the first movie of a trilogy, cutting off a bit earlier at a major catalyst event (no spoiler). Or better, this should've been a multi-seasoned show like GoT on HBO Max or something.I really hope Dune: Part 2 happens but hopefully it will be better paced if it happens because this has some serious potential, just some pacing adjustments shy of a timeless classic.",Dune

I hope he doesn't stereotype himself remaking sci fi films but I was a huge fan of the original bladerunner and Denis's remake bladerunner:2049.Dune: 2021 is brilliantly filmed and the casting is so spot on.

We all know George Lucas stole the ideas for Star Wars from Dune, but I didn't know how much until I saw the film: The Force/The Voice, Paul/Vadar, etc, etc.However, I'm going to be honest and say Lucas, albeit a thief, modified it into a better story. Star Wars is just more intriguing and The Force is different than The Voice, it's more like a religion than a skill.But Frank Herbert did an amazing thing considering he invented it all.Definitely see the movie, it's quite good. But Star Wars beat them to the punch, so Dune hasn't moved me as much as Star Wars did.",Dune

Imagine a masterpiece like the LOTR getting a low rating simply because it was 'slow paced' or didn't have a proper conclusion haha.If you enjoy the art of storytelling; worldbuilding, character development, etc. Complimented with amazing acting, memorable scenes, and enhanced further through masterful cinematography and a legendary score, then this movie is definitely for you!I appreciate not everyone needs to 'love' this film as much as I did but at the very least you should also understand that a movie can be told over the course of a series rather than always having a beginning, middle, and end.Please try watching this film in IMAX for the first time, you'll thank me later!",Dune

Not to mention the DR had potentially the most interesting back story that they could have dived more into later in the next movies but they won't I know they won't. ""How do you know that.""

I have heard that the second part will only be made if this is a box office success. Is that really true? How to gamble with your career Mr Villeneuve if there is any credence to it.Character development was thin to say the least. Anyone feel anything for Duke Lito's demise? Anyone feel any sympathy for Dr Yueh and his plight?Music was more akin to artisitic noise - the volume of which along with the overuse of bass made some characters extremely hard to hear - if at all.Some great cinematography mixed in with speights of darkness and machine gun edited fight scenes where you just couldn't make out what the heck was going off half the time and just have to kind of go with it.Grandiloquent is a word that slots in nicely to describe this film.Expected far better but some books do not translate well to the silver screen.

Nowhere until today did I see ""Part One"" in the title, no pre-release info that caught my eye mentioned this. So I was baffled when it ended. Then I went online and found out more about it. This marketing tactic disinclines me to watch the second one when it comes out. The sound mixing was bad, because in a lot of spots I couldn't understand the dialogue but the background music was very loud. I also do not know the source material (except for vague 80s memories of cultural references to the Kyle MacLachlan version) so I didn't understand about Paul's mother and the old priestess and so on, until after the movie ended and i looked it up. So, a nice-looking movie, believable CGI, reasonable acting, but probably not gonna bother with the second one unless I'm bored and it comes out on HBO Max again.",Dune
768,pete1-2,Makes David Lynch's Dune look better.,6,21 October 2021,I found Villneuve's interpretation of Dune to be underwhelming despite decent visual effects.

769,docdra,"Not bad, but...at least the worms...",5,17 October 2021,"This 'remake' apparently put style over substance. They wanted popular young actors, they wanted to use more modern tropes, they essentially wanted a pretty version for younger audiences. As a result they cut out or changed many things that were central to the original book and that made the first movie better in my opinion.While the Lynch version was a bit quirky in some spots and didn't completely adhere to the books, it did so more than this version and was better for it. I also feel that if you overlook the special effects, that were limited at the time, you can see that it had a grander presentation that did a much more effective job of showcasing the beauty and scale of the desert planet. I will say that this modern version finally gives the sandworms the justice they deserve.I'm honestly at a loss as to some of the changes made in both the story and characters. Actually, I get the latter with politics the way they are now, but the changes to the story didn't do this film any favors - it simply opened plot holes for anyone not familiar with the books or made the story feel a bit dumbed down.I really don't get how they basically removed almost all of the scenes that directly showed the political intrigue that was going on between the emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the various Great Houses of the Landsraad. I should say they removed the versions from the books and first film. What they substituted it with was a watered down version meant to play up the young actors in the main roles - actors selected for their popularity with young audiences.It isn't a bad film though, it just didn't do the books better and certainly didn't really improve over the older movie - just showed a more modern version with better effects and a reduced storyline. It also lacked any sense of awe or wonder, as it mainly went by the numbers, taking no chances with investor's money - except for the worms, I'm glad they at least got that right, even if they barely make an appearance.",Dune

I wanted to ensure I wasn't acting on a knee-jerk reaction. I can say that this film is one of the best made films I have seen in years. The Lord Of The Rings trilogy is comparable, if only in scale and grandeur.The cinematography was perfection, the casting choices were near-perfect, and the story was nowhere as convoluted as the books or 1984 film, yet it still told the story quite well. The acting was on par with the scope of the film, with everyone doing a great job with their characters. Stellan Skarsgård's performance as the Baron stood out as the best in the film. Hans Zimmer's musical score was excellent without being overpowering like it was with

I'm literally bowled over by the beauty of Dune, there are so many breathtaking shots throughout the runtime. Just to cite one , I would pick the first glimpse of spice sand sequence, as it literally appeared to me like a Victoria secret model with its sheer beauty and visual curve which instantly made me utter few words in the theatre "" holy cow, sexy shot man "" (weird comparison , can't help it ) and that dessert mouse close up shot is the one to look after, wow. The lighting, focus, detailing, everything is presented and captured aesthetically. Sand worm shots though ,surreal.Here come the master Hans , who gave life to Denis Dune with his heart pounding and exhilarating score, as he invariably enhanced the viewing experience. I did feel the dune world atmosphere and the adrenaline rush vibe through his score. Mesmerizing. Lets give a shout out to Greig Fraser and Hans for making Denis vision so grand and elevating it to a notch higher with their work.House Harkonnen, Atreides , Arrakee set pieces are astonishing and so are the costumes. Especially Bene Gesserit's dark figure black costume is incredible. The detailing and designs deserves an appreciation. GreatFine performances from the lead cast , be it Rebecca, Oscar, Timothée everybody put up a good act. Rebecca as Lady Jessica is literal Goddess and carried the role with élan. Zendaya is seen in bits and pieces throughout, but she gonna rule in part 2. More than the performances, it is Denis vision , Greig's cinematography and Hans score which makes this one a visually stunning experience. These three put their heart and soul into this, visible. I wasn't bored at all, a good sign.Considering the source material, it is touted be an "" unfilmable "" subject. However, same is not the case when "" Denis "" helms , as he made this one "" Filmable"" with his master tactics and used the material in such a way that, the story detailing, characters , set pieces , visuals everything takes you into his "" Dune "" world and immerses you completely.

A lot of the scenes are in the dark; which probably look beautiful in most theaters, but it was not adjusted correctly in our theater so we couldn't make a lot of it it out. Regardless?

Some may have thought there was possible improvement for Dune (1984), but this new Dune is only a slight improvement because of the advances in movie making technology.The casting reminded me of Oliver Stones ""Alexander"". The hero is a guy that is five foot three and weighs all of 103 pounds? Please someone take him to McDonalds and buy him some Extra Value Meals for about 5 months. He would be perfectly cast as a racehorse jockey but not this. His parents must have a lot of money.And his future companion, well its hard to beat Shawn Young, so you shouldn't even try, but you really missed the mark.And then a rerun of Hans Zimmer Blade Runner 2049 soundtrack, that threw me over the ledge. This guy peaked with his soundtrack for Thin Red line which was meaningful and heartfelt and way good.This material may have been interesting back when it was written, but there has been so much science fiction material since then, why revisit it. It may be a classic but not like the real ones (e.g., Moby Dick and the Iliad).Although the ending suggests a sequel, i don't think it will be successful enough to merit one.Please.

If you have read the book you know it, and if you haven't, it is not important, your imagination will will it in.Superb acting performances, with a very believable low key style.This is not an action sci-fi, super-hero action movie, it is a genuine space Lord of the Rings. I imagine there will be rumblings of discontent like there were after the first one of those was released.The worst thing about this movie is now we have to wait for the second. I honestly have nothing bad to say.Special praise of course to the director, the screenplay adaptation, and the performance of Rebecca Ferguson. The best movie I have seen in 10 years.

Like Blade Runner 2049, it took me until the following day to fully digest the assault on the senses. The difference this time around, is that it reminds me of certain Euro art films from the 70s where there would be long close-ups of expressionless faces. Perhaps Villeneuve was inspired by Jodorowsky's Dune in the 70s that was never made, that was supposed to have Pink Floyd composing the soundtrack? Otherwise, it is very dark and brooding like Blade Runner 2049, and very much like the book and the mini-series (script-wise), but nothing like the 80s movie. Jessica is a little more vulnerable compared to her 'regalness' in the novel - at least, that's how I remember her from my reading the trilogy three times. And one person has changed gender! Dr. Liet-Kynes is now played by a woman. Regardless of gender, Max Von Sydow in the 80s film stands above the rest, because it is Max Von Sydow and his uniquely quircky personality that can give an added dimension to any role.

Yet with the exact same reason, the movie struggles with the vast amount of plot points that needs to be conveyed in the 2.5 hour movie.

Lynch did go overboard with some things, but his film tells the story in one movie. The actors are clearly lesser in this Dune, delivering their lines less well, even if I thought the actor's playing Thufir Hawat and Beast Rabban was better in this movie (due to not overacting). LD was also slimmer, this Dune adds several scenes that were in the book (I think) that only adds time but no world- or characterbuilding. Music was much worse in this Dune compared to LD, at best the music is as good as the ""Children of Dune"" miniseries, at worst the music is just annoying noise.But the special effects are better, the ships, shield and weapons feels more real in this Dune.

I knew the Lore it could not be made in to a movie. This is true the tech was not there.Well 2021 the tech is here and Denis brought the Dreams of this Sleeper to life. The scale was truly worthy of the story, I hate using the word ""Epic"" but in this case it is warranted.I gave it a 10 because we cannot give it a 9.5. It is not a perfect 10, there is issues with the story (There is a lot of backstory missing people who have not read the books will be lost because of) It really needed a Princess Irulan, Opening Monologue, the one we got was useless and a waste of bringing the casual audience up to speed.The story Moved along at a slow pace when so much more could have been added in that time instead of wasting it on to much of the ""epic scenery / shots"". Final draw back was way to much of of the Soundtrack, Most shows dont have enough this one was way to much which in certain scenes detracted from the Movie.

Epic, complex stories must have room to engage and explore their worlds.In 2.5 hours this story feels both very long, and ridiculously short. Long because each sequence drags and there is not much conflict to keep my interest. Short, because each main character is given a couple of minutes of screen time, and every personal relationships between them is nothing but a couple of scenes.But there is obviously a lot of story here to develop, and given enough time I am sure this could have been something like Game Of Thrones.The other thing making it tedious is the production design. The whole movie is the same brown, with fog, clouds and dust.Adding insult to injury, this movie is not even a complete experience. It just ends mid story without closing any of the initial storylines. I hate that. The only reason to do that if it was an episode of a series, where the next episode will be available swiftly. But this is a standalone movie that may never get a sequel.My recommendation is to skip it, and maybe give it a try if and when the second part is available.",Dune
798,gsanvin,Excellent! Well Done!,9,22 October 2021,Very well done and an excellent move to break this up into 2 parts as there was so much source material for the story from the book series that previous films have had to leave out due to time constraints.For clarity it helps to be familiar with the books and/or previous film adaptations as the film does seem to assume a little bit that you have some background knowledge.A must see!,Dune
799,johngraham1964,Long yawn without a climax,3,25 October 2021,"I wonder how many times the director said to himself: 'Oh yes, we'll have yet another fast forward in slowmotion'? Or: 'Yes let's have another fast forward in slowmotion to events that we don't get round to in this film'???OK the scale of the production is big! Huge sets. But dull sets. Uninspired design of sets, ships and battles. I liked the ornithopters. But that's about it. Clearly Arrakis doesn't believe in colour anywhere. I know it's a desert planet - but I'm sure they could have imported a few tubs of Dulux!Deciding to (optimistically maybe) title this film: Dune Part One it means that we leave the film at a point where nothing is really going on. No hook to bring you back for part 2. Just a wander off into the desert without time to develop Paul's relationship or his leadership of the Fremen. I trust Zendaya got a decent pay check for her few lines.Once again the Emperor's motives for kicking out the Harkonnens and shipping in the Artreides only to have the Harkonnens boot them out again remain too obscure. And he doesn't turn up in this film, which did surprise me. Admittedly it's years since I read the book so I can't remember if he is in the first part. Sorry for my memory there. I was also expecting to see the navigators who use the spice to fold space time, but no. Maybe they don't turn up till later either.Which left two hours of slow tracking over planets (especially desert!) and hardly a glimpse of an actual sandworm!BTW if you are using a huge machine to mine the spice and know that it will attract a sandworm why not have an escape shuttle on the roof all the time, rather than call one in that is faulty? It must be far less efficient to have a craft flying round at all times just in case an evacuation is needed.Most of the characters were underdeveloped so you don't feel much for their eventual demise.I have a horrible feeling that, if part two does come out, it'll be the boring bits of The Empire Strikes Back all over again (Luke's training/Paul learning to ride a sandworm) with a battle at the end we already know who wins.I think I'll wait for the blu ray.

In a vast world of many different lords in an empire, you follow a young boy , and his journey to light a spark that turns into a flame, and then a raging fire that will shake the whole humanity. But you see all this from his perspective, and this is in my opinion a big mistake in this epic tale. There is no mention of the things going on other places, than Pauls homeworld and Arrakis, no mention of why they fight with swords and why nobody have any computers 8000 years into our future. You get a glimpse of a mentat, but no explanation. Then we have the music, today almost 40 years i can hum both the music in the battlescenes or the calm theme of the movie, as the main melody of both comes from four notes, can anyone say the same thing about this movie ?Acting was good, and the sweeping photo of the different landscapes was nice, if you are into nature documentaries.

I can't stress enough that you should go in with a fresh mind. I haven't watched the miniseries but am a big fan of the 1984 take and it's something that is close to my heart. But Lynch's version is it a de facto telling of the story and shouldn't be used as such.This film is a masterpiece. It brings justice to the story and the characters, and is every ounce a fantastic example of storytelling through the writing, cinematography and the audio.Being far more faithful to the book, it focuses more on the story of the characters than the ""events"" that translate to sci-fi spectacle. The film accomplishes something incredible in that the use of the sci-fi tropes is merely done as a storytelling aid and not a replacement for storytelling.I can't wait to see this again and to see the inevitable second part.",Dune

Which is, neither of them know how to write engaging stories in their recent works. But worst of all, Denis doesn't know how to direct convincing action sequences. All of them are quite cheesey and cut off all over the place. Characters are forced into dialogue that doesn't feel genuine and their reactions often make them look silly and or idiotic. And, honestly all the cool character moments that could've happened were completely erased and shoved into a drawer like an unevenly folded pair of jeans. None of it felt real. Most of this is definitely more noticeable in the final half, and I found myself looking at a lot of camera angles that were genuinely lazy, I'm sorry. And the interactions are so dull, I honestly feel Jason Momoa has the best performance out of everyone. And no, I don't like Fast & Furious movies like all the arthouse crybabies claim.

Most scenes are dragging for an uncesessary ammount of time. It's not suspense and it's definitely not a psychological movie, nor ""an art"" movie just because of the long and way too often slow mo scenes. It's just boring and bad.The cinematography is average at best and the character devellopment is suffering because all of the unnecessary scenes where literrally nothing is happening. A lot or good actors having nothing to act except exchanging some wooden lines. There is a total lack of emotion and every character interaction feels fake.I read the books when I was young and I also saw the older Dune version. Big budget and better filming technology are not enough to make a better movie. Not at all.",Dune
807,hugues-talbot,"Enjoyable, this is only the beginning",8,10 October 2021,"First one has to realize this is based on the eponymous 1965 sci-fi classic book. This is not some new storyline that would be a rip-off of some Star Wars themes. Rather, the opposite is true.Several high-profile filmmakers have wanted or attempted to bring the book to the screen, and have not been very successful. In 1984 David Lynch made a full adaptation with an interesting cast, including the singer Sting as Feyd-Rautha, but himself considered his adaptation to have been a failure.The book is detailed and include many notions that make sense to a modern audience. The ecology of a seemingly failed planet turned into a full desert, the notion of a Jihad ; but also many elements were not detailed and emerged in subsequent volumes. This makes it a challenge for people to understand what is going on, and even more so on the silver screen where time is limited. This is not helped by the fact that many historical elements in the book seem to be very strange, like the non-existence of computers and the reliance on enhanced human capabilities; also why is everyone fighting with swords?On the plus side, this adaptation is very faithful to the book, extremely spectacular, and the cast is top notch. The actress who plays Jessica is my favourite, and the actor who plays young Paul is showing a lot of promises.Nonetheless, there is a lot of necessary expositions in this first part that make the film seem slow and low on action for a long time, and when action does develop, it does not seem to make sense for a while. Why are the Harkonnen allowed behave like they do? A prudent Emperor would play one House against the other, and let neither have the upper hand. At the end, one party seems in shambles and to have lost all hopes. It's not a very cheerful movie.However, the best and most epic is yet to come. Based on this first instalment, I hope part II gets done and gets the success it deserves.Overall I loved the movie, having read the book several times. My 15-yo daughter was lost and found the film spectacular, but long, slow and hard to follow, hence a less-than-enthusiastic mark.",Dune
808,ClintWardley1,At last the Book and entertainment.,9,7 November 2021,"At last the Book and entertainment.It happens all the time. You read a book and grow to love it.

Finally it arrives, and you sit down hoping and praying they produce on the screen the book you love. 98% of the time you leave the theatre disappointed.David Lynch's attempt was passable, but was limited by De Laurentiis's. And I felt Lynch just didn't fully understand the intricacies of the book. The Sci-fi channels attempt was just a more in depth remake of the David Lynch's attempt.Now Denis Villeneuve's version. And surprise surprise, I think the director has actually read the book and understands it. (Lynch never read the book until he was hired, he was not invested or a fan).Denis Villeneuve understands the grandeur and the intricacies of Dune. He is able to understand the plots and the Machiavellianism of the Emperor and the Harkonnen's. Most importantly he understood the relevance of Shields. Shields change warfare, tactics and politics.He has made a movie that readers of the book will love and entertain those who have yet to read the book. The interesting fact was my wife, who has never read the book, has seen Lynch's Dune and thought it weird and mediocre, whereas she really enjoyed Villeneuve's version and wanted to know when part 2 was going to be available and was disappointed when I said 2023 or 2024.I give this a 9, only because I was disappointed that it ended halfway through the book.THIS IS the thinking man's Star Wars of the 2020's, Episodes 4, 5 & 6, not those abomination's 7, 8 & 9.",Dune

816,brtree,"Tedious, Oh so Tedious",2,27 October 2021,"This movie tries too hard. We are supposed to be overawed with the scenery and cinematography but somehow it all seems like a retread from other movies. Some effects were pleasantly unique but 98% retread. The Orinthopters took no imagination at all. Cool...make a 80 foot wide mechanical dragonfly that is totally out of place among antigravity starships. Didn't make sense in the books and visually looks ridiculous in the movie.I was a major fan of the books 45 years ago and that's the only way I could have any hope of following this movie. The world was different back then, the politics were different and the story didn't age well. Very big stretch of credulity that we'd devolve in the high tech future 10,000 years from now to having this galactic feudal system of Houses and Lords. It's like Tim Burton slept with Steven Speilberg and Dune was their aborted wet dream. The Emperor gives the House Atreides the great honor of kicking the Harkonnens off of Arrakis, then hires the Harkonnens to exterminate the Atreides about 3 months later for seemingly no reason (in the movie). I watched this on streaming so there was no way for me to walk out of the theater but I would have if I had been there.And what is it with this Timotheeee Chevrolet? His acting is far far from anything special. Oh he can balance a tear on his lower eyelid for an eternity but is this the new feminist pick for a leading man? All 5'2"" and 90 lbs of him? It doesn't make sense. I have the feeling he is the boy of the moment much like Shia LaPoof was. Here today gone tamale.Sighhh. Dune is just one of those books that should remain a book. It's too big, too complex and too slow to adapt to the screen, no matter how many flashy CGI artists are employed. Give it a rest and leave this sleeping dog alone.",Dune

818,pixfarina,A faithful but undramatic retelling,7,2 November 2021,"Dune was a curious miss in my estimation. The adequate special effects are not enough to paper over a visually dull experience, and other rather obvious flaws.In this planned two movie retelling of the Dune Story Villeneuve's stays very close to the book and the film is visually branded with his unique visual style. But he engages in no exposition, which leaves much of the fabric of the supporting story an unexplained mystery. So although Dune is a long and complex story, and although Villeneuve did not leave anything out of this 'part 1', much is missing.The universe of Dune is supposed to be a spectacular and exotic environment, yet is portrayed as something that is unrelentingly drab, remote and austere. For instance a powerful sandstorm on screen pales in comparison to still images taken of the real thing right here on earth. Architecturally the city of Arrakeen is indistinguishable from the Palace of Arrakeen. And Dune itself, Caladan or any of the other worlds, are swallowed up in a mediocre and monochromatic rendering. Little time is given to them and no sense of place is ever established.Primarily Dune is a story that is driven by characters and the mystery and mysticism they represent, and it is these crucial ingredients that are badly fumbled. By comparison David Lynch's Dune, though weak on special effects, it had a very strong cast whose portrayal of even fringe characters made them memorable. Villeneuve has done the opposite. Great effects (to a point), but a cast of characters who do not convince. At the upper end of the credits Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica is not believable as a noblewoman. For instance in the scene where she has to chose a housekeeper it would be hard to pick her herself out of the presented lineup. The problem with her playing Lady Jessica is not simply that she has no gravitas, but she possesses none of the visible traits that would denote Jessica as either noble or worthy of being a concubine. She shares no chemistry with Duke Leto, who is also rather two dimensional. At the lower end characters like the Shoudat Mapes are all but invisible, or like Doctor Yueh or Mentats, utterly forgettable. The Navigators are entirely absent. The Sardaukar, who are supposed to be the most fearsome and cruel warriors in the universe, but they are dispatched by the hand full in battle (and battles themselves are dull, smoke shrouded and dream like affairs that lack any a sense of alarm, danger or any real struggle). What is left is a big burden placed on the central characters, and with the exception of Timothée Chalamet, they all fail to hold up.There are some other oddities, like why are the Fremen of multiple races? According to the books Fremen society was not monogamous, so it would be impossible. Would different races even exist in the year 10,091? Personally I would not care if the Fremen were any race, but that it is a group of different races makes no sense at all. It is a token I would prefer had not been offered in the way it was, because it does not work. It would have been more viable to make the Atreides black, or even the Emperor, when he appears in Part II.Overall Villeneuves Dune is simply not as iconic as the story is. The 1984 Dune had its flaws, but not being Iconic was something it could not be accused of. Lynch went to some lengths to deliver a visual style designed to evoke feudalism and mysticism. By contrast the 2021 version seems to be part of an already established visual franchise, one that does the story no favors and offers little more.",Dune

822,vandalz,Epic film adaptation of a beloved Sci-Fi classic,9,22 October 2021,"Adapting a beloved classic into film is an exercise in avoiding pitfalls. French-Canadian filmaker Denis Villeneuve has proven that he is not just superficially familiar with Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, but he knows it well enough to know exactly what needs to be included, and what can be trimmed, what parts of the story needs to be retold precisely, and where he has license to edit.The original novel is well known as the best-selling sci-fi novel of all time. It's epic in scale, and Villeneuve has wisely chosen to tell the story in two parts, which is, coincidentally, how the source material was originally published (as two separate serials in Analog magazine). The first part sets up the backstory of the inter-galactic feudal conflicts between House Atreides, House Harkonnen, the Imperial government, and the fight over planet Arrakis, the most valuable world in the universe.Villeneuve's vision is stunning. CGI effects, scale models and costumes are all meticulously created and jaw dropping. It's a movie that's best seen in a theatre, preferably an IMAX screen, but is also so detailed that it holds up well to repeated viewings on a good home theatre. Lets all hope that Dune Part Two gets the green light, because the second half of the book is where the story really gets interesting.",Dune

I actually leaned over several times during the movie to provide her with some context as to what was happening. Ultimately she was not impressed.She did agree that the overall visuals were majestic, while the soundtrack wasn't overpowering. The main problems: too much weirdness and too little character development.I loved the book-it was the longest I had ever read at the time, which was when I was the same age as Paul, and I absolutely devoured it. The real challenge is orienting the audience to a ""world"" or society that has some familiarity (feudalism, tribalism) but is so far removed from our current, much smaller world that it's hard to grok. (How's that for a little nod to another SF masterwork from the 1960's.). I also liked Lynch's stripped-down but surreal attempt in 1984-it was like GWTW's valiant attempt to cover the entirety of the American Civil War in just 4 hours!Hopefully we'll care more about who lives and dies in part 2.

We finally get a real feel for these locations, something that neither the original nor the mini series can offer to 2021 audience. Anyone unfamiliar with the book or previous versions may find themselves a little confused about the different groups and planets etc as not enough time is spent developing those aspects. People may also be disappointed to realise it's only the first part of the story. The cast is pretty solid with a few underutilised, but the visuals are what give this the 8 stars, that and the fact I am a fan so for me I wasn't confused by any of the plot. Fans of Dune will want to see the continuation of the story, I'm not sure however how good a job it does of winning over new audiences or those previously unaware of the franchise.",Dune
828,The_Man_XX7,I respect this movie but definitely not for me,7,22 October 2021,"Before watching this movie i expected it to be slow paced,patient and visually stunning movie coming from Denis Villeneuve and mostly i was right and it it a good movie but did it live up to the hype for me...noThe first half of this movie was a slow burn,took its time with the story-telling,lingering shots character introductions and mainly focused on world building complimented with amazing visual shots from Denis Villeneuve and although i enjoyed some aspects of the world building,great visual effects and scenery and the mystery of the story and Paul Atreides' involvement in it, the first half of Dune was mostly uninteresting to me especially with mostly average characters(more on that later).The second half however picks up with the pace and delivers the sci-fi epic that i wanted with good action, amazing set pieces and i know i've said it before and i'm gonna say it again THIS MOVIE WAS VISUALLY AMAZING and directed well but most importantly the story and pacing started to gel together well too along with the mystery aspect of the movie kept me kinda hooked but still had problems with paper thin character arcs and the when the movie is getting really interesting it ends abruptly.Now on the characters, besides Timothée Chalamet's character Paul Atreides who is the protagonist of the movie, i didn't feel an emotional connection with most of the characters most of them didn't have interesting arcs if any at all and it's not because of the acting, i mean look at the cast of this movie it's impressive and there wasn't any poor acting performance in sight all the actors gave their all in their roles but that can only carry yoy so far if i did'nt care for the characters. The most interesting characters were Duke Leto Atreides, Lady Jessica Atreides and Duncan Idaho(Jason Mamoa was the only one who looked like he was having fun in the movie and was badass too) and was the second best character of the movie. Zendaya wasn't really in this movie as i thought she would be even though it's implied heavily she is integral to the story but that payoff doesn't really happen. The villains were your typical bad guy villain with average motivations although Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was creepy.For the protagonist Timothée Chalamet gives a good performance as usual. Paul Atreides' story and journey was your typical hero journey although it's uniquely told as his arc is full of mystery as doesn't really get resolved by the end of the movie but i liked the dynamic between him and his parents especially the beginning with his father which was a cool moment.So with Dune being a slow burn, patient movie and average characters it relies heavy on the plot and story-telling for it to be a success and for me personally i feel it wasn't enough to make up for the flaws i had with Dune like the heavy slow paced and kinda boring first half,not feeling invested with most of the characters and some of the world around Dune feeling mostly empty for a sci-fi but i did enjoy the second half more, the action was well directed,the acting performances were really good and the movie is a visual joy to experience thanks to Denis Villeneuve's directing complimented with good cinematography and some aspects of the score(kinda annoyed me at times but it was mostly good).

Flawed, perhaps. But excellent. Small omissions are made that don't *really* affect the story (explanation of Mentats, Highliners, The Spacing Guild, CHOAM, and shields+lasguns=bad), but they don't make much difference. And, if part 2 explains them: perfect! And that's essentially what my thoughts are. If there's a part 2, then it's perfect. The criticism of the film feeling half over is just so stupid to me.

It is 147 minutes long with no end in sight and drags on and on with great music and great scenes of landscapes made out of pure CGI. Not sure why the rating is so high, but guess this sort of movie appeals to people who want to see some Oscars in the bag, instead of entertaining the viewer and keeping the action sequences flowing. The 1984 version was so much better, and if it had the CGI that is capable now, would make this version pale by comparison. Sadly, this is what the current audiences seem to want. Dave out!",Dune

Those complaining about pacing or acting either watched a different movie or, dislike films which aren't non-stop action and which take the time to flesh-out the characters.

847,MovieTim14,Denis does Dune divinely.,10,24 October 2021,"Dune has been my most anticipated film of maybe... ever? My excitement initially stemmed from the announcement of Denis Villeneuve, one of the best living directors with a proven track record in sci-fi (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival), helming what I knew to be widely considered the greatest and most influential sci-fi novel of all time. As that excitement grew, I delved into the novel and became completely engrossed by the universe that author Frank Herbert had created more than 50 years ago. I also came to see why it has been deemed ""unadaptable"" for so long.But how did the great Denis fare in doing just that? As far as I'm concerned, a greater screen version than what he accomplished here is not possible, with the only exception being a longer cut of this film. This adaptation of Dune is everything I pictured in my head while reading the novel and so much more. This is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. Every single frame is a sumptuous feast for the eyes, and Villneuve achieves a staggering sense of scale across the worlds we visit.I've seen some complaints about the visual design, mainly that certain elements look ""dull"" or not imaginative enough. I think that the art team here struck the perfect balance between completely otherworldly without being alien for alien's sake. The practicalities of life on Arrakis are very important to the story, and a deeper look at the lore reveals why certain technological advancements that would seem obvious aren't present. On the other hand, I felt a sense of eerie unfamiliarity as a result of the design throughout. There is a lot here that bears little semblance to our own world, with even certain branches of humanity being so far removed from what we recognize today that they end up being more alien than human.In addition to the design, the cast is immaculate as well. Every single actor manages to perfectly embody their character while still bringing parts of themselves into the role, and they all bring a powerful performance. Now that I think about it, this applies to every element of Dune, from Hans Zimmer's score to Villeneuve's direction, and every part of the production design.The only criticism I can levy against Dune, which I do not even really consider a criticism, is where the movie cuts off. Cutting the novel into two parts is absolutely the necessity that Villeneuve said it was, in order to capture the richness of the text. Still, I am surprised that this movie didn't take more creative liberty to embellish the story at parts to fit a typical three act movie structure better. Thus, the height of this part's drama and stakes occurs about halfway through the movie. Following this, the action does not feel as climactic, and the movie does not try to create a sense that it is. If anything, what this ""criticism"" amounts to is that Dune is too faithful to the novel.Dune was never going to be able to capture the richness of the original text. No version, save for a very long prestige series, would be capable of exploring the immense intricacies of the themes, cultures, politics, history, and characterizations that are detailed in the novel. Being familiar with the novel though, I think Villenueve fully succeeds in communicating the key elements of those facets, and most importantly, the spirit of what made Dune so special.Dune is one half of an incomplete masterpiece, one that completely blew me away. I implore you to see this movie in theaters! If Warner Bros ends up feeling that this didn't make enough money to justify making part two, it will be a true cinematic tragedy.",Dune

Perfect execution across the board.Villeneuve has officially surpassed all living directors in my opinion with 'Dune' (directed three of my top 10 sci fi films of all time between 'Dune', 'Blade Runner 2049' and 'Arrival').I'll have to give it a few more viewings, but after the first (in IMAX, which I'd recommend) I'm happy to report it's by far my favorite film of 2021 and top five sci fi films of all time.

853,stomach17,Obviously the definitive film version of Dune,9,22 October 2021,"Disclaimer: I am a big fanboy and am not at all impartial. I have read the book 4 to 5 times. I will say that this film is just great for people like me and definitely exceeded my expectations. It adheres closely to the novel and is a very accurate representation of the written story. I would easily put it in the same category as Jackson's Lord of the Rings in this regard. Seeing it on the big screen is a must. The soundscape of the film is intense. The acting is excellent and, and I don't mind saying that young Timothy Chalamet may have stole the show--coming across all at once as a skinny kid, a young man wise beyond his years, a person of powerful empathy, as well as a very natural born leader. Anyway, while this film was partly made for people like me who love the book, I am concerned that it may not go over as well with those who are unfamiliar with the story. This is no Marvel movie. It could be quite confusing I think. Also, while I enjoyed the cinematography, I am unsure how some people will react to its very brown shadowy settiing. There is a lack of HDR contrast that we have become used to in recent years. Its very shadowy and figures are often concealed in a way that you don not see them clearly. Again, very un-Disney like and some people may be turned off. Personally, I found the pace of the story just right. It does end without the story concluding of course, but I can't wait to see the continuation! I went in with rather low expectations I must say. I am happy to say now, we are dealing with not only another Dune attempt, but obviously the definitive film version of Dune. 9 stars out of 10.",Dune
854,faerlian,Arrival Part II meets Blade Runner 2049,8,16 September 2021,"I've not read Dune, so I don't know how close it is to the book, so I'm going to have to judge it on its merits as a standalone film.And with that, this is going to sound nitpicky. If you've seen Denis' other works, you kind of know exactly what you're getting with Dune. That's not necessarily a bad thing; in fact I thought, as I saw the trailer ages ago, that Villeneuve was just about the perfect director choice for this movie, and after having seen the film, nothing has changed. Its just....Like, I get that this is set in the far future and ergo there will be lots of unique weird designs etc. But can we change it up a bit? And I would appreciate some spacecraft designs that make at least moderate physical sense, y-know?Although the movie clocks in at a meaty 2 hours and 34 minutes, somehow it still felt too short. Even knowing that this is one of two parts, I think that an extra half hour, Endgame-style, to flesh out a bit more worldbuilding and supporting characters would have helped a ton. A lot of characters' screen time felt comparatively way too short and you don't always know everything you would want to ahead of time. I would gladly watch a 3 or even 4 hour version of this movie.And while it was a wise decision to split a book like this into two parts it kind of suffers from Mockingjay syndrome where a lot of the movie is setup for part two. Don't get me wrong, a lot happens in the film, but once you watch it you will understand what I mean by that.That being said, the subject, theme, and visuals fit Denis' strengths as a filmmaker. I presume the flashbacks (forwards?) are part of the book's narrative as well. It is definitely a moviegoing experience and I am absolutely looking forward to part two.You already know the acting is impeccable with an all-star cast and the leads carry their roles. Timothée and Rebecca are absolutely perfect.But I can't rate the film overall as high as some of the other folks here.TL;DR: Does Dune stand on its own merits? Yes, it does, but expect some mild déjà vu. (Unintentional choice of words, but it's kind of funny that that phrase is also of French origin.)",Dune

Trouble is it's a long and complicated book, and you can't easily go slicing chunks out of it and keep the sense. Which is what David Lynch found when they hacked his budget. On top of that SFX was clearly going to be an issue.Even understanding the need to wait, the waiting clearly pushes up expectations. 45 years of waiting sets the bar really high.And I'm pleased as punch to say that Villeneuve has bided his time and kept his powder dry and he too has waited until it became possible to do it right, and then pounced. (Would it be carrying the metaphor too far to say he waited until he saw the blue of their eyes?)Fans of the book - fear not, it's here in all its glory. OK - to ensure the ubergeeks have something to moan about there are a few lines missing here and the odd scene there but every key element is present, unmolested. This is for you in spades.Those who have not read the book... if you like your SF hard, not just any old random gobbldygook rammed together with some fancy fx slapped on top, this is for you too.Now, where am I going to sit and wait for Pt 2...?",Dune

I didn't find it toooo confusing but it felt as though corners were cut and key moments not explained all for the sake of confusion.

861,willkthewpboy,Weak second half drags the movie out,7,23 October 2021,"The first half of the movie built up a lot of potential with its worldbuilding and perfect use of tension. However all of this tension that was built up simply dissipates in the latter half of the story; the second half felt more like a few tv episodes stitched together.The sandworm, aerial chases, and Duncan's escapades all happen in the first half of the story, which are the most notable parts of the movie.Although they hinted at it in the movie that the body shields make them somewhat invulnerable, I'm confused why they fight with swords when they are capable of interstellar travel? Do controlled explosions or explosive projectiles to bypass these body armours not exist in the Dune universe? Not even sound waves can penetrate these shields? It wouldn't make sense that it can't withstand a few swings of a sword but it can take on kinetic energy from sound or explosions which should be several magnitudes higher than a sword swing.If the movie hadn't dragged so long in the second half, it could have been a highly entertaining standalone movie that deserves a scoring of 8 or better. Most critiques of this movie are spot on; the visual effects were impressive but I had little to no emotional investment in these characters. Also in my opinion, the use of prophecies as foreshadowing and as a plot device hardly ever works well. I've rarely seen instances of it being executed well within any narrative. However I'll hold off my judgement on this segment until part 2.",Dune
862,Polotovar,A proper cinema experience after a long time,8,31 October 2021,"Undoubtedly the most enticing trailer this year, especially with its musical background. Yes. I was intrigued by the film and decided to see it in the cinema. I am so very glad I did. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer really gave this movie a kick. But apart from the music, the film didn't lag behind visually and it is definitely a nice spectacle full of sandy locations that I really enjoyed. So the film is nice to look at and nice to listen to when the music is playing. But what about the plot itself in the finale? This is where it's just beginning and I'm slowly not sure what I should start with first. I'll be honest. As much as I enjoyed the film and was interested in what was happening on screen, it just had some minor cracks in the finale and a few things I didn't understand. I thought that the fault was on my part and that I simply wasn't giving the film enough attention, and ultimately I still think that now. On the plus side, a couple of friends told me after it was over that they didn't really know what was going on in the story, which is a bit odd after all. I'm not saying the movie is complicated or that it throws too much information at you in too short a time. On the contrary. New Dune is 2 and a half hours long, and it's only the first episode. There's plenty of space, but there are just a few families, a few names, and I just don't know how it happened, but I got lost here and there. After it was over, I spent the following days reading information on the internet and read the plot a few more times and I'm pretty clear. I'm even more sorry that I didn't understand some things during the movie, because the story of the new Dune is great in my opinion, although it's kind of one big intro that prepares you for the next installment. I am, however, looking forward to the next installment, and incredibly so. Both to find out what happens next, but more importantly I hope it will be another excellent cinema experience like this one was. I understand director Denis Villeneuve wanting to throw this film into theaters. While it will also be an experience at home with some better TV on salted audio, it still won't be the same feeling as sitting in a cinema with a proper screen in front of you with proper sound. For me, a great film that I recommend.",Dune

Liet Kynes is a girl, Paul Atreides is a girl, the worms are... anything else but Dune's worms (a pimped car wheel maybe?).Also the CGI is weak, costumes are meh, the fighting/battle scenes are scarce and unconvincing with so many closeups one will think it's a low budget indie movie.

No emotional connection to the viewer or even connection to the book. It's trying to be so big that it becomes soo small. The cast choices makes you scratch head also. Aren't there any other actors in the Hollywood than Momoa or Bautista? Momoa rocking the same haircut with man bun like in any other movie he ever made including his fully sick bro talk and back patting. That sword mini fight of his was like a scene cut from the See series. Bautista looks like he just left set of Guardian of the Galaxy.

Lots of pretentious ""deep"" dialogue dragging themselves for minutes that should have been seconds.

Fate & Free will, tradition and customs (especially Middle-East), Coming of Age, Religion & Politics have always been seen in some of his other projects as well as these are considered to be main themes surrounding the story of Dune.Like I said previously, his past work with projects like Incendies (2010) where he handled tales from Middle East and Arrival (2016), a sci-fi movie that is about breaking down the prejudices and communication and many more projects crafted him more and more for a potential trilogy of Dune. He already showed his masterful storytelling with the movies like the former one and only superimposed over it with the ones like the latter.This movie is just a beginning, and maybe it's why it is quite lacks the storylines because of it but could this be anymore beautifully looking. Greig Fraser puts his signature in here as well. Every shot is nearly is like looking into a painting.I understand why if anyone thinks it was slow, or lacking any actual spark but considering it will be a trilogy, it's such a promising film that builds the world of Dune.Also, shoutout to Rebecca Ferguson and Timothée Chalamet. Truly amazing performances...Edit: Of course, this review won't be taken as helpful by everyone, but some users are just here to spam this and many reviews in here. Please, respect who are those actually trying to express themselves.Not all reviews, praising the movie are paid or biased.",Dune
869,danalaura-cazacu,"Villeneuve loves Herbert! Thank you, sir!",10,27 October 2021,"I think Herbert would be proud of Villeneuve! I loved Dune as a teenager, and it remained one of my favorite books. I cannot be objective, but Villeneuve has done an amazing job with an almost impossible task. Dune spans off a universe and thousands of years, on top of that it is philosophically complex. Villeneuve is seamless, doesnt show off himself as ""the director"", but rather he shows us what he imagined reading Herbert! Visually stunning! A masterpiece in its own right!Yes, in the beginning, it might be hard to understand ""why"" things are happening, but not ""what"" happens as some say here. These is just half of the first book.Darlings, most of us read six books to get the why, if we got the ""why"", dont expect that much in 3 hours. Have a little patience or read the books!I really hope this is just the beginning and I get to see more of Villeneuve's Dune. Much more! All of it! Thank you, sir!",Dune
870,doncorejp,Beautiful,10,26 October 2021,I am glad I did not read the book before watching because it allowed me to be moved and surprised by the grandeur of this film. One of the most beautiful looking films I have seen. I was surprised by the raw power behind the film. If you don't watch this in theaters you are missing out on a once in a lifetime film that begs to be seen and felt as big as possible.,Dune
871,daveboo,Long time Dune fan of the orginal film and books,10,23 October 2021,"And I loved this film, yes it could have had more adult content and maybe stuck more closely to the books but in its own right I think this was an excellent attempt of a very difficult film to make and I haven't enjoyed a film at the cinema this much in years maybe even since the matrix all that time ago :) go watch please, we need part 2.",Dune
872,jason-16503,Ponderously Boring,5,23 October 2021,"C'mon man. If you are going to do a remake almost 30 years later, at least make it a better film. Paul Atreides was an unbelievable character. Chalamet acted the role well enough but even less fit for the role than MacLachlan in the 1984 version. He reminded me of a brooding ANTIFA basement dweller and I expected him to strangle Jamis in their challenge with a pair of skinny jeans then finish him off with a steaming hot soy latte. Zendaya as Chani was also a lame fit. Couldn't remove her association with the silly girlfriend of Spider-Man in the latest Spider-Man series. All she did was pose and give looks. Best actors had the least screen time. Stretching it out to set up for a Dune 2 could well be a joke; if you liked the desire to gouge your eyes out this time, come back again. It's probably also time to accept the fact that the story of Dune was never that good to begin with and just stop trying to adapt it to film, thinking it will be better next time.",Dune

But my god what an incredible film this is. I was worried the story would be too difficult to follow but Villeneuve lays it all out naturally and perfectly through dialogue. The best way to describe it to anyone wondering what kind of story it is would be Star Wars for Adults. 10 outta 10 will be seeing on IMAX again and can't wait for Part Two.",Dune

I believe the lead actor Timothy is a miscast. Movie looks nice and expensive, but it is boring, slow and I way to artistic. In some ways 1984 version is better. Especially Baron Harkonnen.",Dune

877,onemckinney,Sand and Sound,7,18 October 2021,"The eiree sound track by the most famous Hans Zimmer does add something to this movie. I was new to Dune, having never watched the predecessors or read the book it has a good cast and the storyline has depth. It's a slow burner but with some good action scenes and I can see it being a great bunch of movies, though I'm not sure how many there will be. Definitely worth watching on the big screen.",Dune

It is a treat for fans, you can even see glimpses of Alia very early on, which makes me longing for the full series. It is visionary, perfect pacing and setting up the scene for what is to come.But, and here it comes: when the movie finished, a guy sitting beside me started complaining that he doesn't need a next chapter, because he already almost fell asleep watching this one. And my fear is, that a majority of people will see it that way. Because many have forgotten that sometimes a story needs time, characters need time and also we as an audience need time to arrive in a universe as complex as the Duneverse.So my hope is, that also a majority of people will love it the way I do. And that Denis Villeneuve will bring all the books to life. But in the meantime: Thank you Mr. Villeneuve for this movie. It was the first one I saw in a cinema for almost a year. And it reminded me why I love going to the movies.",Dune

But the story rolls too slowly, dialogues are poor, and above all, I didn't feel any on-screen suspense, a sense-of-adventure (despite the epic backdrop), and it didn't once feel like a sci-fi.

882,sarahrayburn,An Immersive experience,10,9 November 2021,"Ahhhh! I haven't had a movie truly take me from my seat into a new world that made me sad to leave. I walked into the theatre not knowing what the story was about and left in love with the world, characters, and story. The cinematography was gorgeous with beautiful shots of the planets and locations. The acting was top tier and made you feel each characters emotions. It did not feel like an almost 3 hour movie.This is not a movie that hands you things. Upon second watch I discovered more details I missed the first time through. This movie was made to be digested, to have you think long afterwards, to have you talking about the motifs. I loved how it made me forget reality but also having me questioning it. This is by far my favorite movie of the year because of the whole experience of it. It was also a refreshing break from the faster paced, action packed movies that are so common in cinema today (and don't get me wrong, I love that too). This truly is a must watch.",Dune

I haven't read the book, so not sure if this movie is the entire story or just part of it. But suffice to say the plot is rather flimsy for a 2.5 hour play time. The graphics are impressive, if somewhat implausible (it is sci-fiction after all). At the end, I felt I'd sat through a long movie just to set the scene for sequels. I don't like that feeling.",Dune

The story was expertly handled and I enjoyed every minute of it.If WB does not finish this movie arc, like they did with Snyder's JL, I am going to explode. I really want to see Part 2!You need to see this in theatres, it was one of the best movie experiences I have had!",Dune
885,parkerviale,Stunning visuals,8,24 October 2021,"This film is one of the most visually appealing films I've ever seen! The cinematography and the VFX were done so well, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. The cast is also amazing, Timothèe, Zendaya, Rebecca, Oscar, Jason, Dave... it doesn't get any better. In terms of the story, I've never read the books before so it was a first for me. The story was very confusing to me, I had to rewatch it a second time. Watching it a second time definitely helped me understand the story more. I didn't like how the backstory's were told, not shown. I'm more of a visual person, so I feel like it would be a lot more clear if they were shown. I'm still unsure of what happened to some of the characters, but I'll consider that this is Part 1. I'm definitely looking forward to Part 2 to see what happens with the Freman.",Dune
886,tqmybbwr,It's Gorgeous,10,21 October 2021,"People complaining about the pace makes me feel like we're living with simpletons that have short attention spans due to their endless swiping on tik tok. There is something about the desert that thrills me so others might be over the slow beautiful shots like we see throughout Dennis's other movies. This is story telling and this is Dune. The next film will have picked up the pace with more intense action through out then the first film. It's like watching the first season of GOT, it's slow and its building the narrative to the point its explosive with epicness. The first film does set up the world very well and characters and once that 2nd film comes out, people with the short attention spans will come to appreciate the narrative building of the first.Also watch this twice if you feel like the story seems complicated. It's really not. The book Dune inspired Star Wars and GOT so If you like those two things then you'll be surprised on how uncomplicated the story is in the telling of this first movie.Idk what other reviewers feeling no soul in the movie is about bc I'm definitely feeling soul. Perhaps some people think Timothèe is bland and Id like to say he's supposed to be 15, the son of a powerful dynasty, sees possible visions of the future, understands he's in a position of great responsibility and so there is this reservedness I appreciate from his acting. He's reticent and self contained, and ultimately the story is about Paul becoming a man and making his own choices and just like with any man or woman that is when their character arch shines.",Dune

891,light-rock,Maybe there is hope,7,24 October 2021,"Having watched this new one 4 times now, and the 1984 David Lynch version many times over the years, and having read the book(s)...There are some things this movie did better than the 1984, some of the acting was better, some was equivalent, some was just as... not so great. The story-telling ability of the 1984 version, SO FAR, is superior, this one suffers a bit by having more special effects and less character character in a several key characters.Maybe the music is great, I can't tell, they keep playing the same clips over and over just like the 1984 version.I feel like it has been a wasted opportunity to do any significant re-imagining.HOWEVER... the over all quality of this work, the length of it, and the idea of a part II... well, the part II is set up very well and perhaps the opportunity for reimagining is yet to be seen in all its glory.Maybe this sounds negative, but I am eager to see the next one even if it is more of the same, it is still good work. I am just bummed, it could have had a better re-think.I gave it a 7 out of 10, it is better than a lot of things out there.Apples to apples I'd give it an equals 1984, but with a bigger budget.Many scenes from 1984 stick in the mind more indelibly, a lot of this one is forgettable.

But seeing Villeneuve have the extra time and waste it with repeated and unnecessary stuff, I realize that more is not necessarily better. I hoped for more and got less.Based on Villeneuve's other movies (BR 2049, Arrival, Sicario) which I've seen, it seems he likes actors to be very repressed in their emotions. Which worked because the plots in those movies moved along at a good pace. But when the plot is crawling along and the actors are moping around in a malaise and all you have is music and CGI landscapes... you get BORED.",Dune

And I'm not even dumb. Honestly! I'm not. Kinda felt that way now though watching it to be honest.The movies set designs, costumes, overall look, and acting are all incredible. But I didn't like the movie because it was just too hard to understand with all the overlapping language, weird names, Paul's dreams, who the characters were and what they entailed to the storyline.... It's one of those movies that you HAVE TO STAY WITH or you're lost.I wouldn't say not to watch it. Lots of male eye candy, that's for sure! The movie didn't completely suck.

897,captainvideoblogger,So it is a remake of half of a movie?,7,9 November 2021,"This movie really feels like it tries to remake Lynch's version of the Dune instead of going for purely fresh interpretation of the book. It is fantastic looking movie while still failing to deliver lots of the atmosphere it should be able to convey. For example, you really don't get the the desert feel of the Dune planet - maybe because every scene has extremely busy and bombastic music blasting behind it. Main fault of the movie is that it just cuts off. It doesn't deliver a full and proper story and it uses it's time for beautiful shots that are more of the shallow variety instead of deep pondering kind. It is still OK film but it is nothing special.",Dune
898,aovannor,"Just not good enough, read the book if you're interested in Dune",4,19 October 2021,"It's a popular opinion that Dune is too complex for the big screen and this version proves that yet again. I imagine that people new to the IP will be utterly confused about what is going on because in order to understand it fully you'd need a seperate movie just to set up the universe before even attempting to tell the main story.Visually it's great but they lean on the mystical vibe far too much with drawn out screens of nothingness that simply look pretty. You'll spend a good 30+ minutes of this movie looking at shiny sand blowing across dunes or staring at oversized sci-fi looking structures.Other than the obvious adaptation issues it has, sound design was one of my biggest gripes with this movie. They do this weird thing where they bring the somber soundtrack to the forefront during scenes which are supposed to be exciting, urgent and action packed. It completely ruins those scenes and lessens their impact.Ultimately, this is not a substitute for the book even if books aren't your thing. If you want to experience this story without the book then you should just move on and forget about it because you won't get what you want from this. You'll just think the whole Dune thing is massively overrated instead.",Dune

Immense, immersive world-building comes first, big action spectacle ignited the screen later but Denis Villeneuve never forget to masterfully bring forth intimate character moments. But hey, no disrespect to Villeneuve who directed this with impeccable skill sets, for me Rebecca Ferguson and Hans Zimmer are the real heart and soul of Dune. Ferguson performance not only breathed a whole lot of depth into Lady Jessica herself, she also serves as a medium and allows you to understand Paul. Zimmer on the other hand composed a youthful cosmic music that is constantly telling a story of it's own. The entire experience was enthralling to say the least.

901,ratiocinator,The director was trying to be clever. He failed.,1,19 October 2021,"This movie is for those that already know the Dune story. This is clear because the storytelling of this movie is atrocious, and non-existent. It fails entirely in this respect, and the CGI (which is too dark, overall) does not compensate for it.This movie is pretentious garbage. The moviemakers are only concerned in appearing elitist to their peers, and in doing so they produced an utter waste of time of a picture. Furthermore, they have many characters eating while delivering dialogue, which is disgusting.I tolerated this irritation for longer than I should have, before switching it off around half-way through. The script is useless.So, if you have read the book and are intimate with all the characters, and all the groups, and locations named within it then you might appreciate this movie. This, however, is pure conjecture on my part because I have not read the book, and I do not know the story, and watching this movie did nothing to tell me this story (assuming there is a story).Don't waste your precious time on this drivel. You can't get your time back. Heed my warning. This is yet more pretentious, overhyped vomit from talentless, overpaid Hollywood elitists that should not even be commissioned to produce a local school play.P. S.

This film is heavy and you need to pay attention to the details. The cinematography and visual effects were incredible!

I saw the trailer and I actually wasn't interested as the story didn't grab me (and hinsight shows I was right); but my friend convinced me to watch the film saying it was like lord or the rings meer star wars. Well i feel duped!My biggest issue is that this was not advertised clearly as Dune Part One. If it was, I would never have gone to see it. The part one had no standalone story or ending so I felt like it sucked.The only think I liked about it and what made me give it 45- I recognised some actors from other bit ilms like the avengers,spiderman, star wars, aquaman, call me by your name etc most of these people gave good performances in a film that had a weak story. Of course the downside of an all star cast is instead of thinking about the film I was watching, I was instead thinking (and laughing) to myself that Thanos and Aquaman were in a film together. Maybe , I'm done wirh these types of films!Spoilers and plot issues:Why did Jason Isaacs family and his whole family leave their own planet/home go to the desert country just because the empire said so? ! As a plot point this made no sense and wasn't properly explained. We were never introduced to the emperor and this was incredibly weird. At least in the avenger movies, or the lord or the rings or star wars films, we're usually always aware or who the enemy is and why the main characters are on the path they're on.2. Who really cares about spice production?! Why is it so special and lucrative that people risk they're life for it in this dessert?! Is it the same as ring that will control all or middle earth? Or infinity stones that can wipe out whole worlds and species of people? Again, coming in cold, I just don't think this was explained clearly enough. And made no sense.3.

912,carsarecoolmab,Just WOW,9,27 October 2021,So I myself have never read Dune by Frank Herbert. So I was going into this movie off of the knowledge I sustained from YouTube videos. So basically I had zero knowledge of the world or the story of Dune.From the very first trailer we got for this movie I knew this movie was going to be difffrent. How every frame of the movie just is visually stunning how even some of the more minor characters still have a role to play in the story. Hans Zimmers musical score for this movie has to be in my top 10 favorite movie scores.Now I would be giving this movie a 10/10 and it 100% deserves that rating. But there were a few things that held this movie back. Now for any newcomer like myself to the Dune franchise this movie dose not hold your hand on telling you the full story and expects you to know it going in to the movie. The marketing for Zendya's role in the movie truly disappoined me when she only got 7 minutes of screen time. But I would like to see more in the Dune universe than just the main line Dune movies.,Dune
913,Mainecoon999,This is only the boring beginning,5,18 October 2021,"What to expect from this remake will determine your experience. If you like great 3D visual filmmaking, then you will love Dune. If you expect a story, then let me tell you there is almost none.First half of the movie contains zero action. You only meet new characters that you have to invest or already know this universe from novels or something. Basically boring but great looking frames, CGIs and VFXs...Second half of the movie actually delivers some action and character development but it's mostly dark desert journey scenes with two main characters which you will most kijely won't care less.Villeneuve did his best with this Dune 101 boring orientation and yes, there are millions of film audience who are also looking for a story structure other than 3D experience with popcorn and soda.",Dune

Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""79/100The hardest book saga to adapt into the big screen returns, Villeneuve being the captain of the ship this time around.I hope this doesn't come across as me giving ""ThE BooKs aRe BetTeR"" vibes, however, having read the book, some chapters and aspects of it were either shaped in poles apart or completely binned. The chunks that received the second treatment from the book to the film were, in my opinion, essential for the first half's storytelling and, this picture not having them, does leave you with a bittersweet feeling.Instead of placing those sequences into the film, it has some methods that do everything in its power to remind you that, what you're watching, is nothing but the first half of a story that leaves you wanting for more, but also knowing that it could've gone a tad bit further. What's more, the dialogue was, probably the worst in a Villeneuve film I've seen, presenting several without a purpose and that, personally speaking, didn't catch up into the bigger picture.Villeneuve has, debatably, delivered some of the best visuals in Dune. The sentiment to one's liking of seeing him improve an aspect that was already delightful enough to keep me happy, that might be one of the film's biggest forte's.Zimmer also delivers a frighteningly beautiful score that, for some reason, the way the film is edited, retained the soundtrack from fully shining through. Even the IMAX treatment didn't make me overlook it.There's a reason why the film has a star-packed cast. Some scenes wouldn't have translated into the screen as well as they did if it weren't for the actors involved. Truly one exceedingly pleasant aspect of the film.Dune delivered just enough for me in regards to the overall anticipation I was feeling for it. The technical aspects feel sharp and well-finished. Wish I could say the same for everything else since the film tumbles along its acts -the second one being the best out of them all-. There IS a feeling of potential success for any potential installments if the people involved commit fully to the franchise's future. Whether that'll happen or not is up to the future to decide....",Dune

928,dwknuj,Stunning!,10,28 October 2021,I have read the Dune books. I have seen the 1984 mess of a film. I saw the 2000 rendition that aired on the SyFy Channel. I have even wiled away far too many hours playing the Dune board game that was issued by Avalon Hill. With the possible exception of Frank Herbert's original books that created vivid images in my mind no one has been able to create the jaw-dropping imagery that Director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser were able to generate.I think that this film may be a little confusing for anyone that hasn't read the books (for example Baron Harkonnen's anti-gravity globes aren't fully explained).

What Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings, or what Kubrick did for 2001, Villeneuve now did for Dune -- and it deserved it to the fullest. The dark mood teeters on the border of Game of Thrones fantasy, brought now to the scifi realm where we are treated to beautiful brutalist interiors, vintage-modern tech, and some characters straight out of some sort of a surreal dream.

Frank Herbert's books are on my Bucket List. I've watched this 2021 film twice on HBO Max, and will do so again before they stop streaming it. Why? It's very entertaining. Bottom line, that's the only reason I watch most movies. I don't care how it compares to the 1984 film. They are very different, exceptional presentations by very different, exceptional filmmakers. To me the first Dune was pure art by a creator of the weird and wonderful, sort of the Salvador Dali of film. Think ""Frank Herbert meets Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet"". On the other hand, Dune 2021 presents a more conventional underlying story almost incidentally set in the distant future. 2.5 hrs flies by and leaves me wanting more. The acting and technical details are first rate all around. Once more, in a sea of A-List actors giving fine performances, young skinny little Timothee Chalamet shines and owns every scene -- even opposite some real beefcakes! He's proving to be an immensely talented actor with broad range. Anyway, 2021 Dune Part 1 is an excellent origin film that feels way too short in length. Can't wait for Part 2.",Dune

Anyone who has read the book knows that while there's a lot to it, the story develops very slowly and there really is almost no action. A book can take its time with that kind of thing, a film cannot. Every part of the story where something remotely exciting happened was done to the extreme for this film, there were even a few action scenes added to keep the audience watching. Meanwhile much of the plot development was rushed or even glossed over to reach the next visual spectacle. I did appreciate the effort in bringing some of the more political and religious aspects to the foreground, Dune can very easily become Pocahontas without that.

941,rich-mac,Epic! Dune delivers...,9,20 October 2021,"Dune slowly reels you in. It takes some time to establish the setup, but it's time well spent. Although I found a lot of the interiors a bit cold and gothic and out of human scale the overall effect the movie creates captivating.The characters work straight out of the box with believable intensity and the screenplay is very tight. Hans Zimmer's music is somehow extraordinarily apt, and the effects and cinematography well up to the task - at times the cinematography and score are the main story teller, but these transitions are both seamless and engrossing.I didn't read up on backgrounds before viewing, I guess, given pacing, if I'd thought more about it sooner I would have expected it to be a 2 or 3 episode event - but I didn't - so the only real criticism I have is that it doesn't state up front that this is Part One. Some may think that's a trivial observation, but, from the point of view of a story arc, it's not really. Of course little is resolved and much is untold, this is part one - but if you don't know that your subconscious reading of what transpires is different, and after all, it also has to work for people with no intro or background to either the books or previous movie, and inform them appropriately.The overall effect is that you've set out on an epic journey. The worlds and drama created are complete enough to take hold of your imagination and attention and keep them focused - an impressive accomplishment given how understated some aspects of this movie are.I think it's a shame that they didn't shoot both parts and just leave post production to be completed for part two. I hope this project doesn't run out of steam.If you like Sci-Fi Sci-Fantasy don't hesitate. Dune absolutely does justice to the epic saga on which it is based.",Dune

But in typical Hollywood fashion let's pull a money grab with little substance. There was nothing of quality added besides the updates in technology since the 80's. With even less story and character development than in Lynch's movie taking longer and only telling half of the story. How is this even possible? If there had been more history of all the factions or even on the myths I could understand needing 5 hours and 2 movies.It's amazing that this movie is getting so many positive reviews but my wife really enjoyed it as well.

Excessively dark scenes create a mood, I understand, but frequently being unable to make much out at all is a waste of my time. Then there was the excessive explosive scenes which seemed to go on and on and on covering the screen with nothing but bright flaming images that, had they been filmed further back, put into a wider context, would have created a better effect. And what about all the images of things that appeared to be simply geometric patterns or other unrelated objects having no, zero, relation to the story and wasted viewing time.But that's not all. The sound was horribly done as well. Either you could barely make out the dialogue or your ears were, often, nearly blasted to deafness by the excessively loud music.I offered 2 stars only because I thought Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson portrayed their characters well. I wasn't as impressed by Timothee Chalamet, though. If nothing else, he seemed far too slight a physical figure to fill Paul's shoes. The screenplay and direction were abysmal though, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, Dune: Part one is disappointing in all respects but graphics and visual effects. Even the dagger fighting scenes with the protagonist are awkward and clumsy. It is amazing to observe the planet, the machinery and the scenery with their massive budget. However, it ends there. Some actors cannot play their part well, some are a bad choice for the characters they are assigned to and the plot never gives the audience a chance to appreciate what semblance of character development there is. The plot moves way too fast way too quickly and, what little downtime there is, they focus on bizarre irrelevant and inconsequential scenes. By the end of this movie, one is left apathetic to any of the characters and the plot. This is not a good way to tell a story.If only the 2000 Dune mini series had the same budget as Dune: Part One. It's such a shame Dune: Part One has squandered its budget on bad actors, bad script writers and bad directors. If anyone thinks this Dune is good, they should watch the other Dunes.

No, it fails at that, which is telling.The pacing is slow, when the film should be trying to economize on time to encompass such a huge story. Certain aspects of the story are neglected, such as the Emperor, Navigators and the Harkonnen, in favor of empty drawn-out scenes. The hand in the box leaves you cold, there is no sense of the intensity that should be felt in that scene. Villeneuve assaults the senses with excessive noise, as is his hallmark. Likewise the excessive use of color filters gives a bland look.The second half of the film is torture, as the plot hardly moves forward in 90 minutes, a masterclass in bad screenwriting. Truly awful adaptation from book to film there. It does seem as Villeneuve is going to show us less of Dune in 6 hours than Lynch did in some 2 hours.There are some bright spots, such as the battle for Arrakeen and the Sandworm attack.

I watched some explanation videos and there was a lot of references to the books or other movies and it's like we were expected to understand the world that it was based in. But I had no clue!Probably an interesting watch for someone who's read the books but I don't plan on watching it again.",Dune
961,neildanderson,Didn't really get it.,4,23 October 2021,"Sorry, but I didn't get the fuss about this. It was far too long, with lingering desert shots, moody music, and weird flashback/forwards, but little actual story, and Timothy Chalamet has the charisma of a pantomime horse. Maybe it makes a difference if you know the book, but I won't be rushing back for the next one.",Dune
962,imdb-702-986813,A proper epic,8,19 September 2021,"I grew up watching the 1984 movie and had seen it a hundred times before I even knew the book(s) existed... :) so to me, this movie feels like ""a remake"" and not ""a new adaptation of the book.""Naturally, I can't help but compare the films.The pacing is much slower here, and I feel it gives the story a ""proper epic"" feel without going full Peter Jackson (The Hobbit/3 movies).There are enough differences between the two to constantly keep things interesting, though I feel some things are better explained in the 1984 version (less confusion and explaining things to my wife).Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this version, as I wasn't super-excited by the the first trailer.Given the strange economics of today's movie world, I'm not sure how the studio will decide whether or not to go ahead with Part 2 ... but I intend to vote with my dollars by seeing this at the theater at least one more time.Thanks!",Dune

Not sure if you will ever swallow.",Dune
965,Chronic_Cuntlyf,"Denis Villeneuve's weakest film besides Sicario, but we ABSOLUTELY need a Part 2.",6,22 October 2021,"I should probably start by saying that I haven't read the book, and my only other exposure to ""Dune"" is the spicediver fan-edit of the 80s David Lynch film adaptation.A lot of people don't like the Lynch movie, and I understand why; it's often goofy and poorly paced with a very rushed 2nd half. It's also supposedly not very faithful to the original novel, although a lot of story beats in this new adaptation from Denis Villeneuve do seem very similar to what I saw in the Lynch fan-edit. Villeneuve's movie is much better paced, and far less goofy though.The pace is slow, the tone is serious and the atmosphere is thick (thanks largely due to the soundtrack which is very memorable and sounds incredible, aside from some typical Zimmer Inception horn cliches that need to be retired at this point).Dune is often referred to as being something like ""Game of Thrones in space"", which comes across much better than it did in the Lynch version through the bloodthirsty politics and behind-the-scenes scheming of various members of different Family Houses, religious groups and even some characters' personal motivations. My favourite element to come out of this being that the lead protagonist, Paul Atreides, is having none of their BS.I like this version of Paul Atreides much more than the David Lynch version. He doesn't like all the scheming, including that which is done by his own family, and while his character development is nothing particularly new, I do appreciate the depth put into his own personal beliefs and how this may go on to have conflicts with responsibilities he will later face.Baron Harkonnen is also very imposing and a great villain to have on-screen. He's much more intimidating than the cartoonish take on the character in the Lynch movie, and I wish he had more screen-time.In fact, the same can be said about a lot of characters in this movie, so hopefully we'll see a lot more in a Part 2, which absolutely needs to be greenlit.Even so, I wouldn't say this film was all it was hyped up to be. For one, this is probably Villeneuve's weakest film, but only because this is a story that's been told before and it doesn't feel anywhere near as revolutionary as some of his previous projects, both on a technical and thematic level.Newcomers to the Dune universe may falsely judge that the voice powers in the film are ripping off jedi mind tricks in Star Wars, even though the Dune novel came first. In fact, I'm sure a lot of comparisons to other major film franchises will be made. Hopefully this doesn't impact overall reception and lower chances of a sequel.On repeat viewings, it may even become tedious to sit through many of the slower moments of the film that are more focused on providing great spectacle (that is bound to have much more impact in the cinema than on a TV or laptop screen) rather than telling a story or conveying a message. The cinematography, directing and acting are all brilliant, but occasionally border on wanky considering how familiar and simple the story is overall.For all the hate that the David Lynch film received, even from Lynch himself, it did have some very unique effects and designs that - sometimes for better, sometimes for worse - will probably end up being much more recognizable than the very well-shot but also very plain, brown and grey imagery offered up by Villeneuve.6.5/10, but leaning closer to a 6.",Dune
966,Manolo2001,Mixed feelings but overall very positive,8,18 October 2021,"I am generally very critical of movies based on books, and definitely did not like Villeneuve's Arrival at all. In this case, as has been said frequently, it is a tad slow paced, but the cinematics, the cgi, is flawless. So many takes are works of art, it is a beautiful movie, there is no doubt about that. The plot does stick mostly to the books, it is enough and sufficient for it to be called Dune, not for example what has sadly happened to The Foundation. This is a take on Dune, there is no doubt about it, but it is a subdued take in terms of plot and the strangenesses (new word) the book has. There are a few missed opportunities, with the Harkonnen, the Sardaukar, Navigators, etc. By this I mean that although the uniforms, the visuals etc. Are amazing, the 1984 movie was much more weird and intense in terms of portraying a foreign or future universe. This is much more mainstream, the plot could take place in any average sci fi world filmed before. As amazingly grandiose as it is, it lacks Duneness (new word again), I would have hoped for a bit more spice in the movie.I will watch it again, as it is a very good movie, and would be quite awesome were it not for the book it is based on. But, having read the books (all of them) multiple times, it does fall short when compared to them. I would place it between the TV series and the 1984 Dune, closer to the original movie than the series, as it is stunning, but not as gruesome and intense as it could have been. The fremen also lack a bit of punch, I will not go on, as I think the point is made. Looks amazing, but lacks a bit of spice.",Dune
967,Warlock72,HORRIBLY BORING,1,25 October 2021,"James Brolin is in this movie about five minutes. Jason Momoa gets around fifteen minutes, and after the kid, he is the main character. Zendaya only shows up in the same vision over and over again, for a total of about five minutes of screen time. Ninety percent of this movie is Paul Atreades (Timothy Chalamet) talking to his mother, played by Jessica Ferguson. ""Mommy why am I special."" If you enjoy that kind of lame mother-son relationship dialogue, then this movie is for you. I thought it was beyond boring.There is no action at all until the last thirty minutes. Then it is basically watching how badly the Atreades clan botched everything, and how incompetent they are, and how they get the entire population of a city massacred due to the negligence of their top security man, James Brolin. I can honestly say nothing positive about this movie, except that it was a big waste of time.",Dune
968,trevholmz,Another masterclass from DV,10,25 October 2021,DV is simply the Director to go to for such films. He perfectly pulled it off with Blade Runner & now he has with Dune (which was never in doubt). DV is the best Sci-Fi Director there has ever been.,Dune

The Mentat's ability to find and solve problems was not explained and therefore his role and position with the Duke was left wanting. Similarly the Dr's position was not fully explained leaving a few minor plot holes that I had to explain to my wife and son.All in all it was truly wonderful, I can't wait to see what happens next or even if they make the other books into such masterpieces.",Dune

Not only are there amazing fight scenes, amazing scenery and a storyline that seems to make sense but it really does look and feel like a movie worth watching. Jason Mamoa is great, stays true to his charming yet brutal nature, Josh Brolin is great as the weapons master/general and. Oscar Isacc manages to be both regal and fatherly at the same time, often successfully showing the contradiction of his desires for his son as well as partner. Stellan Skarsgård manages to turn his character into both an alien as well as a creature worth fearing. Then again, at least three of his sons (Alexander, Gustaf and Bill) are also amazing actors of note so I wasn't surprised at the calibre and subtlety of his skill.Basically, well worth watching and best watched WITH the second part together :)",Dune
974,Jason24321,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Seriously.,10,20 September 2021,"We all know Villeneuve is an incredible director. Blade Runner 2049 is perhaps one of the finest movies of all time. In Dune, Villeneuve once again demonstrates that he is a directing genius. Dune has been widely considered to be one of the most difficult book adaptations. With much of the story told through exposition, such dense lore, and the magnitude of the universe, many believed it was unrealistic. They said the same about Lord of the Rings, but Peter Jackson proved them all wrong. Villeneuve has done that with Dune.Everything from set design, to costumes, to choreography, to effects, to score and sound, to (and especially) cinematography. Villeneuve does a masterful job of pruning the unnecessary exposition to focus on the core story, telling it in a dense but expertly timed two hours and 35 minutes. My wife, who previously fell asleep in Blade Runner 2049 and has never read a Dune novel, was rapt. I, who have read 15 Dune novels, was rapt. Villeneuve has somehow turned Dune into a movie with mass appeal, while staying true to the source material and giving fans everything they could have ever asked for.Villeneuve took the bold action of writing ""Part One"" on the title screen to ensure audiences understand that this is the first part of the book; but also to perhaps place some additional pressure on Warner Bros. To green light part part two. It will be an egregious injustice to the universe if Villeneuve is not granted the right to produce the second part of this movie.I watched this in IMAX and cannot recommend the experience highly enough. The soundscape was awe inspiring. I will be watching this a second time in IMAX.This movie is 10/10. I have extremely minor nitpicks which are not worth mentioning. Villeneuve has cemented himself as my favourite contemporary director and I look forward to watching anything and everything he should create in the future.",Dune

The size of the spaceships won't fit on a small screen the sheer scope of this movie is grand. The story is there and the actors too I couldn't take my eyes of this.

976,VVirak,Dunno,6,27 October 2021,"Why this isn't a mini-series? Certainly felt like Episode 1 of a big-budget TV show from 2021. I get the part about the cinematic experience of it (the production design is as advertised), but its dependency on the sequel(s) has left me with a feeling I hadn't watched a movie. Aside from the fact that it cannot function as a standalone thing (thus hard to judge, hence the review's title), my main problems with Villeneuve's ""Dune"" are that it offered me nothing new, no author's stamp to add/ change the perspective on something (I'd go even further and say that Lynch's adaptation had some better solutions of certain images, and we all know the infamous reputation of that project); secondly, almost every scene that should be big and add to the mythos of this world comes a tad short or barely misses the mark, promising something it fails to deliver (like violence - I can't believe it isn't a Disney picture; also, whichever department is in charge of one-on-one battle sequences, it failed to create an atmosphere of anything other than a rehearsal), too long here, too short there, here and there focusing on the wrong thing. Finally, the tempo of the movie is such I couldn't follow its rhythm.",Dune

Cinematically appealing; but, rather bland. My love of the books and the story bias me to like anything done about them; but, the worms that are so important seemed just two dimensional and the viciousness of the Baron and his family seems underplayed and I miss the guild navigators. It's a whole lot to cover in the span of 2.5 hours, so I understand the need for part two; but, I wish I was aware of that at the beginning. The ending is really not that satisfying.

984,ayaa1977,The Most Spectacular Film I Have Seen All Year,9,24 September 2021,"Today I watched the most spectacular film I have seen all year. It's visuals are breathtaking, characters are well drawn (for the most part), and the allegory of the story (how spice and Arrakis are stand in for oil and the Middle East) is unmistakable. Hans Zimmer's score combined with fantastic art direction, and beautiful cinematography, all work intandem with Villeneuve vision as a director, to make this ambitious film worth the long wait, and a must-see in the biggest screen possible. The performances are all around great, although Rebecca Ferguson is the MVP. Timothée Chalamet acts like a sad emo for most of the film, but I suppose that's what's asked of him in the role. I don't agree with anyone who says the film is dull, but I suppose I am a sucker for the palace intruge part and all the politics, betrayal, and backstabbing, so the film having more drama and less action is fine by me. This is half a film (it says Dune-part 1 at the top of the film), so expecting a story that wraps up by the end of one film, is just as silly as being angry at ""Fellowship of The Ring"" ending with Frudo and Sam at the top of the that mountain looking at Mount Doom. I for one found this film very effective in building the world and preparing for the next part of the story, and I really hope we don't have to+o wait too long for part 2.",Dune

I will say that at the pace he's going, the first Dune book will take at least another 12 hours of screen time or more to finish. Much like his sequel to Blade Runner, this not only was long (2 and a half hours) but it felt long.Visually this movie looks great. However, if you're a fan of the book I expect you'll be disappointed. There are scenes that aren't in the book that feel like we're just filling space because they plan on making this into multiple cash cow movies.

I am not a huge fan of the Dune from 1984 but I love the genre and I love pretty much all of the cast. I have been waiting to see this for a long time and I was not disappointed.

The hero could have come accross as a whiney little emo, but the actor managed to make that not the case. Plus Jason Momoa finally gets to keep his shirt on.Only real criticism is that the music is a bit generic. It could have done with a memorable theme or two. Not bad, just generic. .It ends on a bit of a to be continued thing.

Virtually all the performances are great. You can tell a lot of love went into this film. Denis's direction rarely seems to take a misstep. The whole production is masterful.

More like pretentious emptiness. Everyone just talks the same. Someone said 'be dramatic'. This is not acting.Anyone who likes this version of the film didn't see the original by David Lynch. Yes, terrible CGI in comparison, but a worthy, strong cast. Distinctive character building. You all just want are different stories told the same way. Superheroes or Star Wars or this.

I was GLUED to the screen and didn't take my eyes away not once. You MUST see this in your local IMAX theater because my god.....the scope and scale of this film is bigger than any movie ever made.

Ok the casting is good, the set designs great. The movie is very dull boring bloated and long winded. I actually like the 1984 version better. You don't see too much of the worms. Then there's the end which they say to be continued . Last time they did this was the movie Stephen kings IT. But that was much better than this bore fest.will I watch the next part? I doubt it. Worst movie I've seen all year. My opinion is the David Lynch DUNE is more interesting.",Dune

1011,jcsallows,Star Wars for adults,10,24 October 2021,"I know the title of this review might offend some hardcore Star Wars fans but there's not a lot of ways to quickly sum up this movie. People have also said ""Game of Thrones in Space"". I think it's worth noting that the original Dune story pre-dates all those properties. And the influences are clear. If you want an epic fantasy story that spans multiple years, among many characters, there's only so many source materials you can reliably pull from.Introducing Dune, with some of the best world-building, visuals, characters and intertwining plots in a Sci-fi film since...you guessed it, the original Star Wars trilogy. It's obviously not as ground-breaking, but you have to respect a story written in the 1960s finally done justice.Denis Villeneuve is simply a clean director. Some people critized Blade Runner 2049 for it's awkward moments of silence (by the way I loved that movie, go watch it), but surprisingly, you get none of that here. The pacing is very deliberate and, at least for me, even at 2 and 1/2 hours, it didn't feel long.There isn't a lot of action but there is enough to not feel bored. Denis makes up for the lack of action with one of the best movie soundtracks I've heard and some of the best visuals I've seen in a Sci-fi film. This is one of those few movies go to IMAX for.The acting is top-notch with a ridiculously stacked cast. The dialogue and story are good (no surprises there) and you can just tell this movie is taking it's time but at a pace that isn't wasting ours. That's hard to balance.I never read the book but just from watching the movie, I can tell the material is dense. There's a new side-character every 20-minutes and they always speak yet another alien language (don't worry there's plenty of subtitles). Lady Jessica has a chunk of her lines in a type of sign-language, shorthand. Just like Game of Thrones there's houses, family members, heroes, villains and so on. I wouldn't worry though, you really only need to know what's generally going on and you can follow it.The story actually made sense to me and I think that's this movie's greatest achievement. I can talk about Dune without getting confused or confusing others. That's what this film adaptation needed, just enough of everything so we all understand what's going on in this world. Well done Denis and crew. Give us all the sequels now.",Dune

On second viewing I realize there's actually a lot of dialogue I didn't at first pick up on, but once you understand the basic concepts you can go back and see the subtle things people say and do and you appreciate the film in that second viewing.

1016,documentaryman,"A sad, souless, experience",6,25 October 2021,"Dune the great work of fiction novel is first and foremost a human story, preoccupied with the question of what it means to be fully and completely human within a civilization that values power and and its antecedent, greed. The journey of Paul, not a random choice of a name, rest assured, is toward his full potential, mystical if you wish, but, sublimely natural within the world of Zen Buddhism and Sufism, that were Frank Herbert's inspirations. So, what has Denis Villeneuve done with it? He has reduced it to an atmospheric action piece, long on action, short, very short, on soul.It's not that he didn't gather around him a crew and cast talented enough. The actors are terrific, managing to inhabit their limited roles with full on grace. Their casting is mostly inspired, except, unfortunately for the one character necessary, assuming a better screenplay, to elevate this chablon from a mostly interesting, if somewhat boring action film, to a masterpiece. Timothy Chalamet simply doesn't have the gravitas for Paul and his journey to become the Kwisatz Haderach. He just doesn't. But the shortcomings of this Dune shouldn't rest on his slender shoulders or coiffed head. They belong solely to the director's graphic novel vision of the source material. Brilliant as a visual extravaganza, it simply falls far short of what the novel is about.",Dune
1017,jeffdiggy,"If Marvel Films ""Turned Us Into Zombies""...THIS 'Dune' Will Turn Us Into STEPFORD WIVES!",4,19 September 2021,"Well. Well, well. Villeneuve made the DARING claim that he 'FINALLY' made this film 'right'. As if to say it hasn't been made 'right' before. As if to say Alan Smithee's (David Lynch's) version...just DIDN'T even exist. Well it DID exist! It DOES exist! IT is STILL the 'benchmark' for Frank Herbert's 'Dune'. Though people will ENDLESSLY argue ""the movie's not true to the book""...Smithee's version is STILL the 'Dune Standard' as far as film. I am actually rejoicing in Villeneuve's hubris. The age of 'the Police' and 'Synchronicity' (which came out a year before the original 'Dune') set the stage VERY well for 'Dune '84', we'll call it. The outfits and the grandiose to more serene acting from the diverse characters was TRULY, TRULY epic for that time. Sting IS Feyd-Rautha...as Reeve will FOREVER be 'Superman' (not Routh).'Dune '84' was colorful, HELLA futuristic, vibrant...BEAUTIFUL and CLEAN! Crisp. Inspiring, hopeful, Brave! It flowed. UNPARALLELED in movie cinema! Yet the 'bad rap'...even from its creator. The pigeonholing it as 'camp' or 'melodramatic' or 'corny'. Ask yourselves, late 'Boomers' to early 'X'ers (who SAW the original 'Dune'...'84'...when it came out)...: Did 'Dune '84' GLORIOUSLY fit the times...with its TOTO Soundtrack...as made in heaven for it as Queen's was for 'Flash Gordon' four years earlier? 'FG' - yet another timeless CLASSSIC that is disparaged to 'camp' status...though a more VIBTRANT, IMAGINATIVE action-sci-fi movie (considering the times and its special effects tech.) would be complicated to offer up.Fast forward 32 years later to what we 'Dune' lovers have been SALIVATING for...HOPING it COULD be better than our sparkling gem from the mid-eighties. SPOILER!! NO. A pretty much resounding one...largely based on the director's ('Villy's) BOLD claim/s. This is basically a REHASH of the 1994 Dune...with more pretty and Avant gardy, monolithic ships (Btw, the shields on their suits are HORRBIBLE! They don't relay 'protection' in the sequences in ANY way!). OK, that's (ergonomic ships) nice and all...but it wears thin VERY fast! Even the 'dragon-fly' joints. It wears thin so fast because the screenplay and dialogue IS A BLATANT RIP FROM '84 Dune!! REALLY, Villawhoever?? Come on? No REAL originality other than the special effects?? Really? And you DARE to 'shade' 'Dune '84'!?? Wow. MONEY grab...setting up a Dune II (when that SHOULD have been 'CHILDREN of Dune'!). Just...wow. HUGE disappointment. Lucky for Holly wood today's 'kids'...just don't know any better...to call THIS a ""masterpiece"".Kids, at Thanksgiving 10 years from now (knock on regal oak wood...like in Paul '84's imperial quarters)...I'LL be seeking out and watching Kyle MacLachlan as the Kwisatz Haderach, THANK you! NEVER...and I mean NEVER gets old! Right about this time some OTHER directorial upstart will be claiming...""I have the better Dune!"". Yeah, right.Face it guys...face it. 'Dune '84' is one of the BEST Sci-Fi films EVER made. This new one...is LITERALLY a dark, morbid, bland SHADOW of 'Alan's' 'Stillsuit'. You CAN'T just casually and uneventfully re-deliver MAX VON SYDOW'S, 'MING'S'!!, words/lines! You MUST be unique and different in/with your delivery! OK. 'Aquaman'!! And 'Thanos' unmakeupped is NO 'Jean Luc Picard'! ""They'll COME...for VIOLENCE!"". Villeneuve did half a/the job in pursuit of that STILL unrealized 'innovating of 'Dune'. David Lynch! ""Your time has come!"". STAND as the premier extrapolator and interpreter of a geniuses' timeless novel! Timeless novel...Dune '84' now a timeless rendition/movie. 'Dune '21'? Not even 'Don't Stand So Close To Me '86'...when Sting/Feyd morphed into a sleek and futuristic-looking 'Piter De Vries'.I can't even say 'valiant effort'. Didn't even fit the whole story in. HALF a story. What a joke. My guess is that people who are ACTUALLY calling this a ""masterpiece""...never saw the original! COULDN'T have! WOW! This new-fangled is actually it's ANT-denouement.",Dune
1018,schlomo-jones,Best adaptation yet,10,23 October 2021,"I wasn't sure what to expect, this is the best adaptation yet. The cinematography, acting, effects, music, all are perfect and capture the feel of the books much more accurately. It cuts many of the scenes you may be familiar with from the 1984 movie and the early 2000's miniseries, but it includes key scenes from the books that those adaptations left out. Although this is just Part I, I think it drove through the core themes of the novel that previous films missed the mark on.Standing out are the design of the ornithopters, which looked much better and more believeable than anything I've seen before. I also really liked how the potrayed the voice power. I was watching in an IMAX theater with the bass turned way up, so you really felt the theater shake when it was used. The voice really feels as powerful as it should be.The sandworm design I didn't quite like, I don't think anyone has gotten it right. It may be just because I grew up the David Lynch movie, but this big mass of teeth that looks like an anus wasn't that impressive.The fight choreography was the weakest part. At least we're not dealing with the ridiculous ""weirding modules"", but the fight scenes were just not well done and looked like a bad community theater production where people are slapping each other with knives and then the knife actually cuts off-screen. Don't know why, was this some censorship issue? Anywhow, I hope they do better fights in the sequels.There is an interesting casting choice where they made most of the Fremen black and brown actors. I'm not sure how I feel about that given how Paul is obviously lily white, and I'm not sure if this is sending a white savior message. Also, readers know the fremen were heavily based on middle eastern movements, not African.All in all, if you're fan of the books you will enjoy this. If you inexplicably think highly of the 1984 cinematic abortion that David Lynch is still ashamed of to this day, and you actually think this is somehow worse, then I don't know what to tell you. But anyone who isn't blinded by nostalgia will tell you this is the best adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune so far.",Dune
1019,greg_bbb,"Better than the Last one, and Mostly Good",8,22 October 2021,"Overall it was good. Good video graphics mixed with stunts and action. Well conceived script that captures a great deal of the Book.However:
1) Baron was a BORE, and there were No scenes related to his homosexuality due to fear of charges of Homophobia. So even with the great Stellan Skarsgard there is no menace there.2) No Feyd Rautha, instead we get Rabban who has few lines, and those are poor
3)Piter DeVries is nothing. One or two lines, nothing from the book, and he is one of the best evil characters along with the Baron.4) Sardukar are OK, done well
SO, the Harkonnens / Bad Guys are not remotely as menacing as in the book, and that was perhaps the 2nd best story element. Lost here.5) Duncan Idaho played by Momoa was good, and he did a great job with it.7) Thufir was done quite well, but had few lines. Same with Yueh, As this movie version was long, and if they had included these minor characters and their stories, it would have probably doubled the length. So much was just sacrificed.8)Fremen - Done well, and Stilgar was great. Zendaya wasn't bad, and they had inordinate screen time of her face,without saying much of consequence. I think she could have done better, and maybe part 2 will show. But for now, I say ""tell me about your home world, Usul"" sticks
9) Paul was the best improvement and carried this film with a great performance. Timothy is easily better than Kyle was and was both Child, and Duke, and saviour, and full of doubts. Tough to do well, but he did it. And shined at the End especially.]
10) Oscar is always good.I liked the film, but this material is obviously better suited for Series or Mini-Series as it is too much for 2-3 hours

As a story to screen, it is in the same company as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, in terms of producing a screenplay that works to capture and audience. If can't do this the audience is lost, especially for 2hrs 35mins.Well, Denis Villeneuve and his exceptionally talent team pulled it off. Totally captured through the whole, film. This didn't feel like a long film to me. Looking forward to part 2, I need to know where this goes!From the opening scenes the whole film is a visual stunning experience. The artwork , costumes, soundtrack will be definitive Oscar contenders. They get my vote without any doubt.There are a lot of mainstream actor's. In this film.

I was especially impressed with Jason since as a Dune fan I didn't think he would fit the image I had from the books.I keep hoping with all this woke nonsense invading Hollywood they would start to portray women as strong and powerful but they keep doing the over emotional tripe they have been doing for decades. Instead they had Rebecca Fergusons portray Jessica as scared and weak for most of the movie. She is supposed to be a strong womanI took stars off for the above as well as pacing, music and the washed out look.Overall I was not terribly disappointed in but it is not something I would pay to watch a 2nd time.",Dune
1027,criztu,like watching turtles fighting for survival,4,24 October 2021,"This ""Dune movie part 1"" is not like the book. The density and depth of imperial machinations and intricacies are scrapped, reduced to video games cut scenes, as if the good stuff would begin when I press ""start""..The movie is mostly characters standing around talking, a couple of choreographed fights and a few computer generated sets briefly seen from a distance so you don't get to realize their lack of inspiration.No sense of grandeur what so ever.. no world building, no sign of a Galactic Empire and its Emperor, Great Houses and small houses, Space Guild and Bene Gesserit.. it's only dudes and dudesses standing around babbling how the Emperor is gon' do this, the Great Houses gon' do that.. the Bene Gesserit gon' do this and that and more!.. but nothing is shown, just characters sitting, standing, moving from point A to point B, bla bla, next scene!Then BAM! Chalamet has yet another vision of his chick looking at the camera with the sun glaring behind her so we can't see her good. She watches in slow motion, and Chalamet Omelette watches in the distance also in slow motion. For hours.The art and designs are 2004 videogames level.. at one point Duke Leto is in armor, turns his head, but can't turn all the way because the armor's collar hits him in the face. There's glimpses of a Guild space potato ship standing near the planet, a few cargo ships taking off and landing, and some tired helicopters and a combine.And everything is static and slow, like drool from a bulldog's mouth. At one point there's an attack, the bad guys invade the planet. You'd expect some action, right?Wrong! The elite Sardaukar troops are slooowly deploying standing, not doing much, just checking... director Villeneuve simply can't do battles.. he can only do dreamy tv commercial snippets.For me this was a disaster :(",Dune

Mysterious atmosphere throughout the film works quite well and acting is also very good.Overall I've enjoyed this movie and looking forward to the next one.The things I have not liked are:
-Pacing could be better, some scenes feel stretched without enough substance-Fight scenes feel a bit awkward, also the visual for 'shields' is a bit distracting and I think could've been better.-A lot of stuff introduced in the movie lack explanation, how shields work, why swords etc. As someone that didn't read the book I would've liked a bit more backstory throughout the movie.",Dune

Everyone of those actors do their parts nicely and they are right for their characters too. Initial build up was nice, in fact the whole movie was about building up to the next movie. I like the fact that it does not rush or cut parts out to make the movie shorter. I havent read the book or watched the original movie, but this was a nice way to get into the Dune series for sure. Loved the music, cinematography, loved the whole world theyve built, very nice indeed. I was waiting for this since last year, because I loved the director's previous works like Arrival, Prisoners and liked Enemy and Bladerunner 2049. But I read some reviews in here and was ready to be disappointing just like with so many other movies these days. But it was everything I hoped it would be.",Dune
1030,outrunkid,Visually amazing mixed bag,7,2 November 2021,"Firstly, let me say I've never read any of the Dune books, nor seen the 1984 movie so I'm coming to this completely fresh.Overall, the film is flawed but the absolutely stunning visuals and incredible sound design/score mostly make up for it's shortcomings. The spectacle immerses you and keeps you completely hooked from beginning to end.But there are parts here that need work. The story is actually relatively simple to understand but the additional world building, character revelations and exposition make the plot feel quite convoluted and frankly, to me at least, a little silly. That said, there are many elements on display here that have never been attempted before in film so that alone is commendable.It is a hit-and-miss film - what it hits, it hits a home run on but what it misses it misses by a just a few inches, but it's still a miss.A mixed bag but mostly a very good mixed bag.",Dune

1033,falbpe,"CGI, CGI and more CGI / An exercise in dreariness and brutalist minimalist architecture",1,28 October 2021,"I loved the cold industrial desert of Blade Runner 2049. I was mind-blowing with the metaphysical desert of Sicario. I really liked the urban desert of Enemy and the psychological dreariness of Incendies. But I can understand people who don't like those movies. Especially, I can understand why people didn't like Blade Runner 2049. It's long, slow, dark, and existential. Now, I don't like them, but I can understand why people like Marvel Blockbusters. I can understand people who want to have fun. But, what is beyond my understanding, is that someone might like this movie, ""Dune Part One"". I have to say, Arrival was silly, but at least it was entertaining. The new Dune is the nonsense of Arrival without any fun, not a grain of sand. Everything that works in Blade Runner 2049 doesn't work here. It is overused; the monochrome palette, the darkness, the ominous soundtrack, the minimalist aesthetic. This movie is dull and boring from the first minute to the last. In the year 10191 people don't smile (except Aquaman, that too, I don't understand why he appears in this movie, the same with the girl who is a pop star or something). Blade Runner 2049 seems like a roller coaster of happiness now. I never saw a movie so dead, lifeless. The only thing that mattered to me was that the cinematographic torture ended soon. I'm done with Hollywood. What is the point of this movie? We know that Villeneuve and company are excellent photographers. The shots are technically perfect. And that's all. Everything is lifeless, as if the entire movie were the regurgitation of an AI algorithm. CGI, CGI and more CGI. Minimalist and lifeless CGI. Where is all the fantasy? Where is the imagination? Ok, I won't lie. I was never a fan of ""Dune"". I never understand the hype. I think the 1984 movie is just ok. I never read the books, but as far as I know, the premise is basic and forced, political at the most flat level, mixed with biblical stories about prophecies and saviors of a lost tribe in the desert. The spice is the oil, Arrakis is a place like Iraq, etc. There is no complexity, there is no depth, you know everything just with the first two lines of the script. But when I think of Dune I imagine something psychedelic and baroque, organic, from the seventies, like Moebius illustrations, not some exercise in dreariness and brutalist minimalist architecture. Lol. The spaceships are like floating bricks, the buildings look like the exact same ziggurats from 2049, the celestial anti-gravity thing doesn't impress anyone anymore. Everything is cloned. Even worms are boring. And the characters, the mother of god, the characters ... They violate the first rule of character creation. The bad guys are always bad and evil, the good guys are always good and polite, even when they are treacherous. Outside of some very small Rebecca and Skarsgård moments, the cast is as flat and robotic as everything in this movie. The guy doesn't seem like a hero or a chosen one. I don't buy this guy. Never. This 2021 movie is so robotic. I don't know what thing is being injected into people, if even Villeneuve makes garbage like this now. It's like a movie made by body snatchers. Sorry, but everyone who rated this politically correct and unimaginative bland inoffensive film 6+ is either a robot or a liar. Not to mention the plot holes. Lol, you need to cover your mouth and nose at random in a Martian desert with 800 km/h winds, but never your eyes. Soldiers fight only with knives, when they have anti-gravity technology and lasers that cut through walls. Etc. What a paradox that the adaptation of an ecological novel wastes 160 millions and countless energy resources without any reason. That's what strikes me the most. What was the purpose of this movie? I don't think they are even making profit. I just hope Part Two, please, never see the light of day, for the sake of this planet.",Dune
1034,dishjones,"Good, but not as amazing as I'd hoped",9,23 October 2021,"To be fair, even in two parts, and book like Dune is very difficult to adapt. Overall though, it's a very faithful adaptation in regards to all the major plot points, themes, nuances and most scenes from the book. My main complaint in this regard is that there is so much narrative ground to cover, the grandiosity or depth of the Atradies/Harkonen fued never fully has a chance to materialize. So it's harder to find yourself invested in or caring about Paul or his family because things move so fast. And certain scenes just don't have the emotional gravity that you would think they would based on their weight in the book. Also Denis Villeneuve style is great at times. Can be very sleek for sci-fi. But sometimes it's very muted and boring. Almost sterile. I'm hoping part two really brings it all together.",Dune
1035,svenfuhrmann,Big disappointment for me,6,19 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is a really good director in my opinion. But his strong films are the ones in which the characters carry the story. And unfortunately I have to say that they didn't affect me emotionally. I can't say what the exact reason is, but unfortunately it was. I haven't read the book, but maybe the story of the book isn't intellectual enough or the director had to simplify the film a lot. I dont know. In any case, there are strong images, yes, but images that don't really trigger anything in me ... If it really should only be a Star Wars for adults, maybe the director has achieved his goal, who knows? I actually expected more and I hope to see more challenging films from Villeneuve again in the future. Apart from that, and there I am clearly for myself, Hans Zimmer's music is actually the worst he has ever created and the worst ever. Very uninspired and inconsistent. Nothing stayed in my head. Really a shame, because Zimmer, like Villeneuve, is so gifted. This work as a whole did not appeal to me.",Dune
1036,triton_ogletree,"""He who controls the...what is it called again?""",7,22 October 2021,"I have read Herbert's book, seen the original David Lynch film, watched the mini-series and I saw the documentary about the film that never was (Jodoworsky's Dune,) so I feel like what I have to say is fairly valid. In other words, I had knowledge and expectations. Hearing Pink Floyd in the original trailer made me think they took a lot from Jodoworsky's Dune. Knowing that the general public (in general) despised Lynch's Dune made me think they would dodge some of the bullets that movie created. Having extra time (whether post or pre-production) before its release due to COVID certainly made me think they would iron out any flaws.I'm not able to say that all of the above occurred if any at all. It certainly wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't as great as I had hoped for and it gets worse...Again, I read the book and so on but not everyone has. This was a huge flaw that occurred with the original Lynch film. It was as if they assumed everyone knew the story. It is just as untrue here as it was then. For instance, the original film downplays a lot of characters and situations and doesn't fully explain key moments or important things. This one did the same but in different ways.In most ways, this film is visually greater than its predecessor but it also fails along the way too. An example of this is The Harkonnen family. In the original, they are grotesque to the point of nausea (which is essentially the same as the book.) In this version, they're barely in it and seem like typical bad guys without much umph. Many of the characters of this film are barely fleshed out and several are completely ignored...so far...Jodoworsky's Dune had a visual, musical and surrealist style that would have been incredible had it been made but alas it was not. I truly thought this version would steal some of the concepts while staying faithful to itself and the book. I guess not.Ultimately, I feel like it was a decent film and certainly well produced but the story and characters fall horrendously short of most expectations based on the various media versions available. Most importantly, they downplayed the spice which, (aside from Paul,) is basically the main character. They barely mentioned its powers or reasons for being so coveted. To me, that's the biggest mistake the film makes. I unfortunately know the plot already so as a person who does, I could understand everything that was going on but I am not sure everyone will fully understand it as it is not explained correctly for someone who is unfamiliar with the story. Again, not bad but not great.The movie involves a family made up of a son, mother and a father. They are given a planet to rule that just so happens to have the most important resource in the universe. Treachery, betrayal and so on ensues. There's more to come (it's only Part 1 of 2,) so maybe I judge too harshly but I say again, it didn't live up to my expectations and I am doubtful it will live up to yours. Honestly, while not as impressive, the mini-series did the story the most justice and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't care to read the novel.",Dune
1037,malte-neumann,Okay,7,28 September 2021,"I've got what I expected. Visuals were great, but the story didn't affect me at all. I don't consider Frank Herbert's Dune a remarkable novel and it's only interessting character, Liet Kynes, is reduced to a escape helper in this movie. I liked Rebecca Ferguson's performance, the other actors were decent. It's a good si-fi movie, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece (like Blade Runner 2049).",Dune
1038,the_wacky,Not what i was expecting...,5,22 October 2021,"Now, i get it that it's going to build up in further sequels so it will take some time to develop more on characters and storyline. But i was expecting a whole lot more. To me, all it was, is walking pass the desert plains without dying or get eaten by the giant worm and get to the north side. Whereas the trailer was showing all the best cool bits but didnt ex0lain much. For a movie that went on for 2 hrs, you'd think they'd have time to explain more about the north people, considering the main dude had these dreams about them and especially Zendaya's character. I thought she was going to be a huge part in the movie but all she was, was nothing more but an asset. Chances are, will probably appear more in further sequels. Action-wise, not too bad. I've seen way better. Storyline: ... what??",Dune
1039,Roddingham,Faithful,9,25 October 2021,"I've read all the books numerous times and was so pleased that the film truly stuck to the book with no added elements like the 1985 film. Casting, direction, and music score was great. Hope it's successful enough to make a part 2.",Dune
1040,steve-butten,Thoroughly Enjoyable,8,21 October 2021,"I'm one of the few that actually enjoyed the Lynch movie, but this is much better. Told at a slower pace to accentuate the spiritual side of the books is a good thing, although I was a little annoyed at the forward looking visions of Paul, they took up too much time and I found them jarring.Chalamet is excellent, apparently weak, but ultimately very strong. The effects and the stunning score by Hans Zimmer enhance what is already a highly watchable film.For me the books were pretty much unreadable once the Atreides were out of the picture, descending into a monotonous religious drone. So if this story turns into a series I hope they do what the mini-series did and stop at Children of Dune.",Dune
1041,paulblawrence,I really wanted this to be a masterpiece...,6,1 October 2021,"Anyone who's seen a Denis Villenuve film(Blade Runner 2049, Arrival) know that they will be in for a visually beautiful film thats missing more substance than it really needs.Dune 2021 is no different.Let's get the good off the ground...visually and audibly, the word, beautiful, does not do it justice. From the planets, to the costume design, to the special effects, to the music, to the way the film is shot, Dune 2021 is a movie one can watch over and over.Another great aspect of this movie, is the casting of each character is spot on. Stellan Skarsgard is perfect as the Baron Harkonen, and I cannot wait to see more of him in Pt 2.That's about where my love for this film ends.So where does the movie go wrong?The biggest problem is the fact that the characters, again, casted wonderfully, are not flushed out enough. While the story does need to unfold, there should have been more time to explore this new take on the universe, and its inhabitants. It doesn't.Speaking of characters, why did the director decide to skip out on showing several characters that many Dune fans wanted to see? Where is the Emperor Shadaam the IV? Where is his daughter, Irulan? Where the hell is the Guild Navigator? Or Feyd Rautha? These are essential characters that are not only introduced early on in the story, but play vital roles as well. Yet the film doesn't bother to show or even mention them. Only The Emperor is mentioned. For 2 1/2 movie, they had the time to bring them in.Another problem I sensed right away is the underlying tone of a narrative that I am sick and tired of having shoved down my throat, which is black oppression. The film opens with the Fremmen fighting the more advanced invaders who want their land and its treasures.(sound familiar?) In this case, the Spice. Also, you'll quickly notice that the Fremmen are pretty much all minorities, and the invaders are mostly white. Especially the Harkonens who are really, REALLY white. If this movie is just another liberal narritive that has ruined so many movies before it, I won't even waste my time with part 2 of this.Another problem, and I'm sure you all already knew this, is that this only one half of a two part film. And while I do appreciate the decision to extend a movie in order to give it more substance, I felt the choice to split it into a two-part film was a bad way to go about it. With a story like Dune, the more logical choice should either have been one 4 hour movie, or an HBO series like Game of Thrones. Doing so would give the viewer a only a week until the next episode. NOT A WHOLE YEAR!The film also leaves the viewers disappointed with how the film ends. There is no conclusion, nor does the ending feel like the end of a chapter. While the director does try to wrap up the movie as best as he could, it still feels like it comes to a crashing and unsatisfying halt.My last complaint is of the character, Chani, played by zendaya. While I get that the protagonist, Paul, has visions of her in the story, we get way too many in this film. And while I get it is to give the actress more screen time, the decision to give her the beginning voiceover, the several dreams of her, and her finally making an appearance at the end is annoying. Furthermore, her character comes off as just plain unlikable.I really wanted this film to be the answer for the 1984 disaster that was David Lynch's Dune, but sadly, it isn't. And while I am looking forward to the second half of this film, it is very disappointing to know it will be a long time until I get to see it.Hollywood needs to stop milking fans of their money by any means necessary and just give us what we want. And what we want us a clear, concise, competent and COMPLETE film! No woke bullcrap nartitives. No more parts 1 & 2. Give us the film we want!",Dune

Amazing cinematography, cool space things, good acting, the works! On the other hand... if you are normal... and dont constantly huff the lord of the rings franchise... this movie is actually kind of boring. There was a lot of moments that were supposed to be Really tense, but were undercut by bad writing. Dune is so self -obsessed with all its funky little mans and dude with cool powers, that it forgets to make the characters Characters. There is no growth and development. There is no audience bonding with a smile or real relatable stories. It is 75% repeating made up silly words and talking about ""The One."" Chosen one ideology is also kind of lame. His premonitions make the story feel static because the audience already know whats gonna happen. Paul cant die here, he had a vision thingy. There is no tension, no relatability, no connection outside of political structure. It just doesnt have any stakes, and doesnt make itself easy to enjoy. In a world of youtube, i couldve spent my time much more wosely if i watched dune on x2 speed. Maybe theyll get james gunn for the sequel and the series will be revived idk lol, dont waste your time.

Very few compare to the grandeur and artistry displayed in Dune. Denis Villeneuve has created something beautiful in this nearly 3 hour film. It is the first half of the first book of Frank Herbert's epic novel and as a fan of the series, I can say that Villeneuve's adaption sincerely holds up. I left the theater grinning from ear to ear. I couldn't believe he pulled this off so spectacularly. And can I just take a second to talk about Hans Zimmer's masterful musical score? The notes flow as easily as the Spice and in an IMAX theater you feel it in your soul. Everything about this movie is on the most grand and immersive scale I've seen in over a decade. The performances here are amazing. Timothée Chalemet has become Paul Atreides. I will admit that I had initial doubts he could handle the role. I was wrong. Wildly wrong. He's bringing the heat here. I honestly could go on and on about how great this film is. Talking for days about it. I suspect that people will be talking about Dune for years to come, the way they talk about Star Wars, or Lord of The Rings, or The Matrix. It deserves all the praise it's been getting, and I desperately hope that the second part gets greenlit immediately. Dune is why we come to the movies.",Dune

1048,balder777,Denis Villeneuve does the best he can with the script.,9,21 October 2021,"This is without a doubt the best rendition of Dune yet, which is almost expected considering the qualities of a director like Villeneuve.Incredible visuals: Villeneuve nailed Arrakis. From the desert environment, to the look of various characters & civilisations (Harkonnen, Atreides, Fremen), the look is perfect.Incredible score by Hans Zimmer.What I consider a negative point is that Villeneuve cut the film in half, into two parts.The film very much cuts abruptly in the middle of the story, for no good reason in terms of plot progression
Basically, the story of Dune should make it in a single 3 hour film, as it has a very clear structure, like a play (introduction, main part, conclusion).I feel that Villeneuve shot himself in the foot here, by cutting this into two parts, instead of delivering a complete epic product (which he was very capable of).Still, I expect that once part 2 is released, and watched together with part 1, that this fault will be forgotten in what is otherwise the best rendition of Dune yet.",Dune
1049,martinjp-27642,I've now realized what the biggest problem with this movie is,1,1 November 2021,"I owe a huge apology to movie fans everywhere. Originally, I rated this 5/10 and even made positive remarks in my review (now deleted). I guess I was overwhelmed by watching it on the big screen, because at second viewing (streaming), I can't even finish it.This movie's literally empty. It tries so hard to be grandiose like LOTR, but what Villeneuve forgets, is that the plot has to be compelling and complex. This movie's biggest problem is that we see almost all scenes from Paul's POV. In LOTR, the characters are independent and complex. This is not the case in Dune. Key characters are hardly given any screen time, and they're certainly not given a (convincing) personality.This is the primary problem. The secondary problem is the amount of filler scenes. Like when the Emperor's messenger arrives to Caladan in the beginning. Grandiose music, grandiose cinematography, but completely pointless.Dune is such a money grab, biding its time just to set up a sequel.

Almost three hours passed and it doesn't even feel that long.As Chani said, ""It's only the beginning,"" and I'm looking forward to the sequel!Also, appreciation for the visual of Timothee and Zendaya.

After watching the earlier productions of Denis Villeneuve, you could expect something spectacular. He did not disappoint.You definitely have to watch it on the big screen. There is no other option.

1057,afero-24481,"Sci-fi fans, prepare to be amazed",8,1 November 2021,"Let me start by saying that I haven't read any of the books and I knew absolutely nothing about Dune before watching it, which made it a little bit hard for me to understand the story at the start because the way this universe is introduced in the movie relies mostly in the dialogues, meaning you must pay attention to them to grasp the little details. All in all watching this movie in the cinema was quite a remarkable experience, the visuals are some of the best I have seen in any movie and the music is without any doubt one of the best works Hans Zimmer has done so far, although sometimes I felt overwhelmed by it since the music seems to be running through most of the movie and at a really high volume even when it's not necessary to have background music in a scene at all. I had to give this movie a second watch and when I did the story became crystal-clear and I enjoyed the movie even more. I feel like the characters lacked development though, and it was probably because this movie had a lot of content to fit in with such a ""short"" runtime but it's still important to develop the characters to make the audience actually care about them in the vital scenes of the movie. Don't get me wrong, the performances from the actors are still memorable and it was a surprise seeing that the most well-known actors were actually the ones who played the smallest roles in the movie. For me this movie goes down as one of the best sci-fi movies out there and a must-watch to any fan of the genre. My rating is 8.4/10.",Dune

Dune brings to us visuals, sound design, costumes, cinematography and acting unseen in nearly a decade now. The last one that astounded on such a magnitude was Game of Thrones season 1.Where do i start? The plot.is slow but methodical, precise moments of ""shows"" and ""dont tell"". Characters do not dither about meaninglessly, they do what they have to do, all the important bits to carry the plot forward was shown to us. The movie is 2hrs+ long.Sure it struggles to fit in the books. But tell me viewer of this review, how many Dune size books do you know that fit in movie long form format perfectly? Even the legendary Lord of Rings had its kinks.Dune is almost perfect considering the weight of expectations set by the books and failure of the first film.Enjoy this, you wont see visual-story telling masterpiece like this with great not-pretentious soundtracks by Hans Zimmer like this ever again.People here will point at the book difference, or they did not like some of the cast.

1059,truthbrarian,A Top 5 Most Immersive Movie Experience of All Time,9,27 October 2021,"The Movie That Most Of All Made Me Feel Like I Existed In An Alien World since Avatar. But its so much classier and more tasty than Avatar.Dune has a level of immersion rivaling classics like Fitzcarraldo, Avatar, Aguirre The Wrath of God, Baraka, The Act of Killing and Apocalypse Now. I am tired of seeing lukewarm 4/10 comments like ...well its only part 1 of 2...or well you can see it free...well the story isn't that exciting. No no stop.Dune is a movie where if you have an open mind, allow yourself to transport yourself to a unique universe outside of previously established ones like DC/Marvel, withstand a film where nobody even dies in the first hour, (the action movie payoffs are HUGE don't worry) just absorbing all the information, patiently taking in all the resplendent visuals and sounds, worldbuilding moments that are brilliantly doled out by the Direction (seriously it is impossible for a director to do a better job explaining all this stuff), if you can just take your Adderall if needed, I promise that you will put it into your personal most epic favorite movie experiences.Dune literally rewards the most expensive theater in your area. It is the only movie that I have seen in years that actually infinitely expands, you see it on a 4D Dolby with 70 foot screen it will change your entire life forever, if you see it on a TV in a dark room you will be transfixed and wanting more, to level up to that next theater experience.I was just sitting down in complete wonder, never looking away from the screen, new languages washing over me, economics, traditions and cultures, completely alien but yet totally logical and interesting to witness, like seeing something that comes from Earth yet not of what we know. It is arguably more complete on the screen than Lord of the Rings but at least rivals it.Also, for minority viewers, I don't want to give spoilers BUT I want to extremely stress that this is NOT a White Savior narrative, in fact it is much the opposite if you think about it. (Why this is, its subtle and nicely done and not woke at all).Only reason I do not give the full 10/10 is that for people like my mom, they have short attention spans, they need emotional characters, this is not the best movie. Its not as dry as Blade Runner 2048 or Arrival though. If there was say a ""R2D2"" type of fun cute character it possibly could make the movie more light and easier to consume. My mom almost fell asleep twice.Anyway if this sounds good to you, I am begging you on hands and knees pay for this film, do not pirate this or do and watch it then watch again on IMAX, we deserve to have Part Two and Villaneuve is the best director working today.

1060,jldowsing,Flawed epic,8,21 October 2021,"For years movie makers grappled with how to translate Frank Herbert's cerebral sci fi tale to celluloid.David Lynch's metaphorical attempt to ride the giant desert worm failed on some levels - forced to cram at least two movies into one, being hamstrung by some dated effects (even by 1984 standards) and losing control of the final cut - yet on other levels, one could make a case it was a more entertaining experience than Denis Villeneuve's mega half-movie.Combining the best elements of each would realise a masterpiece, at the very top echelon of the greatest science fiction films of all time.Alas, the remake in my opinion feels overblown by Hans Zimmer's relentlessly overbearing score, is somewhat one paced and lacking in the charisma and imagination of the first incarnation.Lynch struggled to convey a complex plot entailing obtuse terminology and character names - here, viewers new to Dune are not aided by having to decipher often rushed, hushed dialogue. Alternatively, if you are familiar with the story but unaware this is supposed to be a part one of two, the ending is a galactic letdown.Despite all these criticisms, this is a movie you want to love. The originality and strength of story hold strong. The setups and effects are stunning and there's no qualms with the casting or acting performances per se.

Sicario was bracing, Arrival was awe-inspiring, and of course Blade Runner 2049 was a perfection companion to the original. And then there's Dune. The novel is a grind to get through if you have the grit, but I loved David Lynch's epic failure for many reasons. It had a stellar cast of veteran actors, incredible design, Toto's score, and David Lynch's magic dust. But most of all, it had heart. Kyle McLachlan's Paul was a likeable youth, we instantly connect to him through his whispering voice over's, a feature that was a signature of the overall tone. But this one is like an advert for an expensive perfume by Chanel. Thirty minutes in I'm bored. I look at my brother and his expression mirrors mine. He leans over and whispers, ""these characters are miserable, every one of them. I hate them all"". I had to agree. Like Ridley Scott, Denis recruited master abortionist John Spaihts into the mix (see Prometheus...) and the result is 2D characters speaking NOT like people who have known each other for years but only talk political rhetoric and prophecy. Scenes repeated from a previous movie irk me too. We've SEEN this! Tonally it was as dry as the desert, flat, achingly boring and really didn't make my heart thump...ever. I never felt that we were leading to a cliff edge at any point. No foreshadowing, exposition was wooden, and no real threat from anything. The conflict existed but only from a few invading ships now and again, but I remained unmoved by explosions. Bangs and people running to their death. Oh well. There were no near misses.

Hearing every 10' the ""aAAaaaaaaAaaaa"" screams on every single vision is plan stupid.2. Too much slow motion, too little story telling. For a 2.5h movie, it shows very few things in order to makes us understand who is who. The House Harkonnen is a bunch of bad dudes, so what? What guilds do and why, what is this universe we live in? You want me to see another movie to understand this? Why? Even if someone read the books, he wants to see a movie version of it, not a movie addition of it.2. I don't like anymore, movies that break a book or a storyline in 2 or more movies. You just can't narrate half of first book on a 2.5h movie. I want a freaking movie that has a beginning and an end, not a post credit notification saying ""you just watched part 1, just wait until 2022 for part 2.""Having said so, even with primitive effects, Dune (1984) is better to watch.

The visuals of this film will be examined for years. Timothee Chalamet delivers a believable Paul Atreides- a young man who can tell he is on the precipice of becoming something more than a God.I just wanted it to keep going and going. If number two fails to be funded, it will be one of the most colossus misses in Hollywood history.",Dune
1066,Schrodingermind,The one that we deserve and need right now,9,22 October 2021,"Dune will last longer like the great old movies. A perfect unravelling of the story lays a strong foundation for further parts. The screenplay, the acting and the music are all excellent. Denis' vision of this classic epic was somehow surprising to me because it proved to be awesome without catering to the current commercial requirements. However, I felt like the story progress got halted beyond the midpoint and then it was mostly exhibition of elements. I was left wanting more. This, to me, did not suit the movie structure but rather more of an episodic structure. But, overall, we need movies like Dune because it respects emotional arcs in a story, applies the right story telling methods and is mainly directed by someone who knows direction, remember Incendies.",Dune
1067,cornerofspace,A complete package to the start of a beloved series.,9,1 November 2021,"Having read the book as a young teen, and knowing the major players involved in this film, the expectation I had for this film is off the charts. And my goodness did it deliver!This film has it all. The quality of its direction, cinematography, and music is top notch. You really feel the scale of things and the importance of certain events. It's a film with a lot of characters and while the movie couldn't explore everyone's motivations, it balanced worldbuilding and character depth quite well.All the Atreides are brilliantly cast and added to the richness of the film. One of the most memorable scenes has to be Paul and the box. The acting, music, and cinematography blended perfectly to not only reveal the strength of its main character, but of the careful attention to detail in its direction.I think one of the best compliments to give is how the film didn't feel overloaded with exposition. The world of Dune is rich in its lore, and the film uses stunning visuals and music as another source to enhance its worldbuilding. The Voice is otherworldly, the Bene Gesserit is shrouded in mystery, the planet of Arrakis is harsh, and its inhabitants are tough but unyielding. The presentation as a whole is stunning and captivating.I think the only criticism, barring spoilers, is how the film ended. It is clear the film will require a sequel (which is pretty much confirmed in its IMDB title), but it didn't really end at a good spot. That said, very few films based on novel series can. I am cautiously hyped for the next entry of Dune but this was a very, very strong start to a beloved series.",Dune
1068,ronaldo_matrix,IF STAR WARS AND GOT HAD A CHILD!!,10,31 October 2021,"From Writer director Denis Villeneuve comes Dune which has been in making for so long now finally comes to fruition. It's the consistency of the director that impresses me the most as he had never made an average movie and this time also it's no exception. Based on Frank Herbert's novel of the same name that released in 1965 had already been adapted into a movie and a TV series before but nothing compares to this.If you all have watched Denis Villeneuve's previous work you might have noticed that the guy has a knack for artwork even when he is making big budget blockbuster movies (Arrival and Blade runner). He doesn't just make movies for the sake of making them, he breathes new life into it and that can be felt by us as viewers very evidently.This movie is simply an experience you'll have to experience yourself, don't just take my word for it but It's not for everyone ( especially those who don't appreciate the art of it all). The retelling of a classic novel that has already inspired big budget franchises like Star Wars and GOT has now got his due.From direction,sound design,Visual effects everything feels otherworldly as is the theme of the movie. Hans Zimmeronce again outdone himself as the score simply teleports you to the other world and long remains with you after leaving the theatre. The cinematography once again is eyegasmic and a sight to behold. The production design and the makeup is also astounding and only adds to the lore of the movie. It's a technical masterpiece to say the least.Now lets talk about the performances in the film. Timotheé Chalemet gives his best performances to date complementing him is the great Rebecca Ferguson who is just as charismatic as Timotheé himself. From Jason Momoa to Josh brolin to Oscar isaac himself everyone in on their top game in providing excellent support to the main story.No matter how good the visuals or Sound of the movie is unless you have a story to complement it, it remains soulless. Luckily that is not the case here, dune has some excellent story telling which makes it a standout.Some critics and fans alike have expressed their views as how the movie abruptly ends or is an incomplete movie. To that I'd say correct BUT the studio has already green lit it's sequel that will be coming in 2023 and it was only originally planned like this to divide it into two parts so rest assured guys.Watch it on a biggest screen available near you and please don't stream it on TV as It is not made for TV viewing. After watching this in the theatre you'll tell yourself ""this is why theatres were made"".PS: Do watch it theatres only.",Dune

It was always too long to fit in a single film which is why the trendy and visually stunning first film ultimately fails. The miniseries is fine although misses out on the big budget and star names.

1078,steven_kearns,Mehh,7,2 November 2021,"It's good, it's not great but it's slightly above average. Not enough background on the houses and exactly why the emperor was so threatened by house Atreides for him to relocate them then instantly attack. The plan in itself seemed very ott just to wipe out the family as surely they could have achieved the same with a lone assassin which is basically what happens anyway with the doctor single handedly giving them up to the Harkonnen's. My main gripe with this movie tho is Timothy Chalamet. He's a good actor and a good looking guy but every alpha male in the movie meets his end almost immediately whilst the skinny Beta Male is of course going to be the saviour of the universe. Standard liberal thinking of ""strong man bad, effeminate man good"". I'll watch the second one out of interest but it seems this entire movie was just serving as a basis for the next movie which left a lot of boring meandering scenes in which I started to lose interest.",Dune

I seem to be among the few who liked the Lynch version - at least back in the day, it's been a long time since I watched it. I also seem to be in a minority in finding the visuals pretty meh. Shots are all yellow or all red or all dark. Okay, I know it's a sun seared desert planet, but where is the subtle muted palette? Nor the art direction. Villeneuve seems to have a thing for spherical spaceships. Everything is blocky and geometric. Just not interesting. The other flaws have been well covered. Slow, yet no drama, no tension, little emotion, but lots of buzzy shield fighting. - Would anyone who has not read the book understand by watching the film that shields stop anything moving fast, hence the blade work??",Dune

The special effects are incredible as well as the sound and the score. The cast is a dream, but of course, the main performances (Chalamet and Ferguson) are the ones that carry the movie, but Jason Momoa and Stellan Skarsgard can steal some scenes as well.

The harkonan scenes are underwhelming and not very good.I miss the thoughts exposition from the original movie.The gom jabbar scene is underwhelming too. I find myself quoting the old script which just works better.The costumes are better in the old movie.Jessica is way better in the old movie, better cast and more royal and ladylike with the costume design. In fact the cast for the old movie was better. I like Duke Leto and Paul but a lot of the characters just feel like they have no soul.The soundtrack is so boring in places. When the attack happens against the attreides and there's a bit of action there's just a depressing droning soundtrack that doesn't add any excitement or adrenaline. Just sorrow.The whole movie has a subdued washed out feel to it. It's very slowly paced too. Nothing feels exciting or tense.Then letssss dooo the sanddd walk agaaaiin. Seriously that's just looks dumb. I hated it. LolAlso is it just me or did anyone else prefer the old sfx for the personal shields? I know lynch made up the weirding modules and weapons with sonic tech, but I miss them. ""Even my name is a killing word"" that was great.Anyways, nostalgia aside.

I never ever thought I would be this impressed. Excellent work sir excellent.Btw this review is 100% real. Don't let the haters fool you. And of course this is Part One for people who complain about the ending. Villanueva is spreading the story out as it should have been in the past.

It not only surpassed my expectations, it did so by such force that it absolutely obliterated them! This has to be the best book adaptation after Lord of the Rings, without a doubt. The cinematography, the performances, I can't think of anything that might improve them, they're perfect.As for how well it adapted the book, here it nailed it as well. It did skip some scenes, rearrange the order of others, but all in all it's the same story, just changed where it needed to be so it would work in film format. The only slight downside is that even though the film is ""slow"", it is still fast paced. This is not bad, but I'd have like to see a scene or two of Gurney playing his baliset,... Hope that there'll be an extended edition. Same with LotR, the film is perfect without it, but might still be good to have it.",Dune

There wasn't the world building or the touches to make the cultures come to life or the world feel truly lived in.Another major issue for me was the casting. I absolutely do not appreciate Paul Atriedes- I find his character is whinging and unconvincing as a 'prophet'. Also, we've now seen this before, done so much better in films like the Matrix.Another issue I had was that the Harkonnen family is all but absent with missing characters.

1099,zenmilos,"from ""iQ-filmovi"" at blogspot",3,18 October 2021,"It is a movie that would not deserve any comment, if it did not reflect all the vanity and downturn in which today's film industry has gone. From the director of the interesting ""Arrival"" (2016), through the failed ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), Denis Villeneuve, we came to an impersonal remake of a much better achievement from 1984.No need to spend too much words on the analysis of this work, because it seems that the story itself did not even interest the authors much. A simple recipe, copy everything that has already been filmed, stretch the already maximally compressed script to two or three potential sequels, pump in as large a budget as possible for CGI effects, insert a few actors (Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin), who would otherwise be ok, if they weren't here only just for decoration, in order to push up the ratings a little more, with the antipathetic and completely wrongly chosen main protagonists, who all together sadly failed.The individual reassignment of gender/ethnicity of the minor characters from the book is not too irritating, although such choices are, for some strange (or perhaps not) reason, somehow always at the expense of quality. So, they are still irritating, because they are imposed. By the way, if the so-called gender (and any other) equality in cinema has already become the manner of the new age, it is interesting that no one ever replaces any original female character for a male one, if only as an experiment. I guess that would require a certain amount of originality and courage, qualities that are no longer appreciated by modern directors.After watching this adaptation, it is only possible to love more the controversial 1984 Lynch's version, which, despite all the imperfections, still remains superior in every sense (I mean, of course, the shorter, original version, not the integral, which is much weaker).The only positive thing that can be said about this film is that, unlike e.g. The long-announced ""Foundation"" series, which is a much bigger disaster in itself, at least holds the original story. And in any case, at least it doesn't come down to purchase of the title of some famous work in order to push someone's other untalented generic script for a story that no one else would ever look at.All in all, a small consolation.",Dune

The sheer scale of the essence of the characters and the gritty environment really sunk it's viewers in. Denis Villeneuve directs this future classic in a sharp, pinpoint and amusing manner. Excellent performances were demonstrated by the cast all around. Especially Javier Bardem's character (Stilgar) who i cannot absolutely wait to see in Dune part two.The way Dune establishes it's story from a philosophical aspect is very fascinating. It heavily relies on Islam to build it's universe which was very stellar to see as a muslim.

Other than being insanely hopeful that this might just be the first sci fi film in years that meets my expectations.It turns out that Dune 2021 exceeded my expectations in every respect. The special affects feel organic without detracting from the story. The performances left me in awe, particularly Oscar Isaac and Timothee Chalamet, a young actor who I'd never encountered before. And of course, the awesomenss that is Jason Momoa, an actor I've loved since his Stargate Atlantis days. Kudos to Rebecca Ferguson, and it will be interesting to see what goes on with Zendaya's character. She didn't have much to do in Part One, but what she did have, I liked.I came out of the theatre positively delighted with this film. Despite being 2 1/2 hours long, I wanted more. That's the sign of a good movie. And the fact that not once did I roll my eyes or find my thoughts wandering is equally the sign of an excellent science fiction movie. No offense to Star Wars, but it wasn't as good as it could have been, and the same goes for the never-ending stream of Marvel movies. I have been desperate for something new in the genre, but with classic sci-fi appeal. Dune 2021 hit that mark for me and the last movie to manage it was Mad Max Fury Road.I am supremely impressed, can hardly wait to get back into the theatre to watch it a second time, and am now in eager anticipation for the announced sequel.

There is no humor anywhere to be found. Nor is there any joy. It's just a bunch of moppy characters doing boring stuff very, very, very slowly.I knew this movie was a failure from the moment Paul put his hand in the Box o' Pain. The only reason this scene worked at all is because we'd seen the '84 Dune, which actually explained what the heck was actually going on. This one had none of the intensity or drama of the first. It would be a muddled mess if Lynch's version wasn't seared into our brains.The soundtrack was a step down in many parts as well. Which is a bummer, since this movie reeeeally needed an amazing score to carry these slow establishing shots.I'm giving this movie SOME credit because they got over the insanely low bar of improving the Harkonnens, which were just unforgivably stupid in the '84 Dune. But this improvement was minimal. They were still too evil and sadistic to be believable characters.The big difference plot-wise between this movie and the '84 version is that right off the bat Paul is told he is ""the chosen one"" (barf). The Lynch movie didn't give us this reveal until late in the movie, and Paul was more likeable for it.Ultimately this movie fails because the dialog is terrible, and almost none of the characters are likeable or interesting.I really wonder why anyone thought THIS version of Dune had to be made. What a wasted opportunity.",Dune

1114,alibaba3317,Majestically gargantuan,9,17 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel is a technical display of modern wizardry, an enormous and often thundering spectacle. It's best described as a sort of mix between Game of Thrones and Star Wars with religious parallels, which isn't very surprising since Herbert's novel was George Lucas' inspiration many decades ago.Dune's story is full of rich and often bizarre mythology, political conflicts on a galactic scale, raging battles between opposing forces and fantastical prophecies.It's a meticulously crafted vehicle to fully immerse you into the world; the movie takes deep care to establish lore and characters, unfolding at a slow pace. It's brilliantly directed in a calm but constantly tense premonition.The acting is superb all around, with standouts from Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica and Stellan Skarsgård as the villainous Baron Harkonnen. The latter manages to give the story a menacing, borderline supernatural presence.Hans Zimmer's score invokes historical grandeur and a sort of legendary, Arthurian voice. Greg Fraiser's cinematography is vast and big, giving the story's magnitude the scope it deserves. This is a very unique looking production and it shows up on set and in costume, tremendous artwork and design.As far as criticism goes, the movie lacks a proper ending. Sure, it's not the first movie to end on a cliffhanger, but it could still warrant an understandably inconclusive feeling. Aside from that, the pacing is also a possible deterrent for some viewers.

He's certainly not the first director to express that opinion. However, I'd like to point out that us normal folks don't get to watch movies in a perfect environment like he and other Hollywood elites do.

In 2021 its Timothee Chalamet.There had to be an assumption amoung the producers and writers of this version, that viewers had actually read the Herbert novel. This slow moving first installment does nothing to encourage anyone to plunk down another $15 at the movie theater on characters with few redeeming qualities other than birthright, taking something that isn't theirs and pure savagry for the sake of savagry.If this were a western, the Fremen would be the native Americans, simply awaiting the desecration of their land(in this case their planet)by two warring factions the Harkonnens, the Emperor(played in 1984 by Jose Ferrer and by who knows who if a part two is even made of this 2021 version).Despite the novelty appearances of ex-wrestler Dave Bautista and supporting cast members Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, and Charlotte Rampling(if you can pick her out), This episode is a rather bland telling of a pretty good futuristic Sci-Fi novel that tinkers with who is the next Messiah for this interstellar realm.The 1984 Dune got it done with outstanding performances by Brad Dourif, Linda Hunt, Freddie Jones, Virginia Madsen and Kenneth McMillan with one of the most disgusting performances of his carrier as the evil Barron Harkonnen.

Normally everytime you see a familiar face in a movie it pulls you out of it - one of the reason why I'm not a fan of the ""star system"" - but since ""Dune"" is the absolute polar opposite of what one might call ""immersive"", this aspect of it doesn't really matter here I guess...All the characters speak in a ridiculous overdramatized way - it's filmed theatre - and often times one cannot even understand what is being said because of how it is said and the weird sound mixing (half the words being unfamiliar terms specific to the Dune universe doesn't help either).World building isn't randomly lumping together ""new"" concepts and terms, but actually having a cohesive vision of what you want to portray.Even Lynch's Dune was better than this.",Dune

Just... weirdThis movie captivated me from the moment it started playing. As you've heard, the effects and cinematography are unbelievable. Many Screensaver-worthy shots in the movie. The acting was outstanding ( well, it is an all star cast) and it followed the book fairly well.Here are my thoughts on the characters:Paul- just as I imagined him in the book. Doesn't show too much emotion and has that forward thinking. Chalamet did a great job.Jessica- a lot more emotional than the other versions. I enjoyed her and the care she has for paulLeto- Oscar Isaac was perfect. No weird cheesiness about his relationship with Jessica and Paul.Gurney- really wish I got to see more of him- josh Brolin played him well. I'm excited to see more of him.Duncan- one of the standouts of the movie. He brought a lot of heart to a movie that needed a little more.Baron- absolute scene stealer. Skarsgaard did an amazing job capturing the gross baron.Chani- I'm gonna be honest... zendaya has still yet to impress me. I prefer the 1984 chani.Kynes- someone explain to me why her gender was changed?

I saw it at home on HBO (in a home theater) and can imagine how overwhelming it would be to an audience in a theater but being overwhelmed and going ooh and ahh is not necessarily a great film.The dialogue is consistently overacted as if to emphasize the importance of a few words and the dialogue is very familiar from other versions because Herbert only gave us so much to say.That being said.

1141,boomroasted,"""This is only the beginning""",9,5 November 2021,"Dune (2021) is a feature adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with protecting the most vital element in the galaxy. Directed by Academy Award-nominee Denis Villeneuve.-
As of right now, I have consumed all 800 pages of the novel and watched Villeneuve's Dune twice. That is roughly 25 hours worth of stillsuits, spice, and gom jabbars... and I couldn't be happier. The undertaking of adapting Dune is truly astounding. For one, many fans considered Dune unadaptable. And for two, we're talking about the series that inspired Star Wars! The fact that Villeneuve even had the guts to do it deserves an award, but his execution deserves numerous. Dune is one of the biggest films of 2021 and will probably be one of the biggest films of the decade.-
If you're going to bring a story like Dune to life, the setting in which you film is of the utmost importance. Green screens and CGI cheapen such large productions like this, which is why Villeneuve decided to take his crew to the Middle East. These real, vast deserts inspired infinity and transported the audience to an entirely different world. But filming in a desert wouldn't have had the same impact if it weren't for the cinematography. The cameras not only made the deserts look infinite but made them feel infinite as well. If everything else about the movie was abysmal, the incomprehensibly immense and awe-inspiring environment/camera work made this a monumental film.-
Even when the cast was inside, the setting still felt massive due to the wildly impressive production design. Generally, the buildings were pretty barren, but the size is what really fazed me. The colossal compounds felt so much bigger than they probably were and had distinctive details like the gold carving of the sandworm on the wall. It's clear that production designers put a lot of detail and thought into the sets, and I appreciated that a lot.-
Throughout the entire film, there was a very particular and consistent color scheme used. Whether it was the lighting of the desert or the shading of the sietch, the difference between these locations was palpable. The lighting effects done within the compounds were also a big proponent of this, and the subtle glow added to the eerie feeling.-
Practical effects like vibrating platforms made the environment feel intense and authentic. Timothée stated in an interview that only two of his scenes were filmed using a green screen. The lack of special effects added so much integrity to the film, and that's one of my favorite things about Villeneuve as a director. Of course, special effects were still used sparingly. Thopters, sandworms, and spacecrafts the size of the Titanic all added to the massive scale of the movie and were just so cool to watch.-
To absolutely no one's surprise, Hans Zimmer's score was phenomenal. Zimmer turned down working with Christopher Nolan (Tenet) to work on Dune, and I'm so glad he did. I wouldn't say that it was my favorite work of his, but I did appreciate how the music made the scenes feel tense and grand at the same time, especially when overlooking the dunes.-
One of the complaints I had about the book was that the writing was dry. In the movie, I found that the acting was sometimes dry as well, but I wouldn't consider that a critique since that is the nature of the source text. Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and the entire cast couldn't have nailed their roles more, and I loved each and every one of the casting choices. Ferguson as Lady Jessica is somehow EXACTLY like I pictured her while reading the novel.-
If I had to choose one complaint, it would be that the fighting scenes felt stiff. Roger Yuan choreographed the different groups of characters based on different cultural fighting styles. While I love this approach, the battles often felt robotic and fake, as if I was watching a video game instead of people fighting for their lives. The only fight scene I particularly enjoyed was between Paul and Jamis toward the end.-
Overall, I'd say this was a stellar adaptation. All of the major milestones from the book were accounted for, and I don't think any important details were missing. After watching the movie for the first time, I thought it was odd how far into the book part one went (around 60 to 70%). That is a lot of ground to cover, which made me feel like the plot was a little rushed. BUT, after finishing the book and thinking about how I would do it, this was really the perfect place to end. The introduction of the Fremen is a pivotal moment, which we need since the rest of the movie is exposition. I assume in part two, Feyd-Rautha will be introduced as he has an imperative role in the story. I'm looking forward to seeing who they cast for Feyd and for the emperor.-
On almost every single front, Dune is a masterpiece. Villeneuve said this was his most ambitious film yet, and what a wild success. If you pause the movie at any given moment, you will be able to find something impressive, whether it be the costumes, lighting, set, effects, or beauty of the desert. But my favorite aspect is just how gigantic everything felt. Even watching on a TV screen at home doesn't invalidate the immeasurable space the film takes up. Part one perfectly laid down the groundwork for what will be an action-packed and paramount part two. This... is MF cinema. And the best part is, ""This is only the beginning.""

I sat, so I watched, it ended...I didn't care much about any of it. I'm a big fan of villeneuve but he missed this one.It has been said that it's a slow movie. I actually thought it was paced TOO quickly. Disjointed scenes one after another with no real emotion or drama.The cast is ok ( Momoa still thinks he's in a marvel movie. ) but there's no time spent on knowing these people.Compare to star wars or fellowship. It's not even close. No development. Just rushing through the story. (reminds me of the hitchhikers guide movie...hits all the beats of the book but there's no cohesion, it just doesn't work adapting a book into 2hours like that. At least old tv mini series took its time). And at least lynches dune was bright and weird and imaginative.Maybe this needed a long well produced miniseries like GoT. Not a movie.Big criticism: this was so dark and ugly looking! Dune should be bright hot searing sunshine. Instead it looks cool and windy. I didn't feel the heat. Big error in direction IMO.I really wanted to love this. I sort of liked it.Also no where in the promotions does it say ""part1"".

The only person really miscast is Duncan-Brewster as Liet-Kynes - it was an error to choose someone so young to play the mysterious ecologist who has grown to know the ways of the Fremen.

Visuals top class! Acting good but the story just wasn't there.

As a consequence, you end up with the bombastic familiar exhausted Hollywood hangover, where there is shallowness and emptiness behind the screen substance. There are also signs this was created during the global pandemic, which certainly hurt the movie here and there.Another aspect that is frankly lame - is the misleading of the audience - thinking this is an entire movie with whole, complete character story arks.

BUT, the writing misses so much. There was so much subtlety that was missed. The entire point about stillsuit discipline and the massive importance of water is given lip service, but then ignored repeatedly. The whole introduction of Paul into the freman society was poorly done (we didn't seem to care at all about killing Jamis- no ""giving water to the dead"").Dune is about layers and subtlety and intrigue and this movie bare scratched the surface. If it was for the amazing cinematography and awesome feel to the movie I would have given it a 5, which breaks my heart as I have been looking forward to this movie for 2 years.",Dune

Visual effects are fine, i saw a lot of 'marvel'-actors in this movie, which was fun in a way. But almost every scene had already been made in the 1984 movie by david lynch, which is logical because that was already a good adaptation of the book by frank herbert. And the 1984 movie had an incredibly good cast that can never be topped, certainly not by this new movie.

The story line is vague, hard to follow and too many scenes that are just a big question mark. I was pretty sure I had the story line figured out, then the movie ends. At this time, part 2 isn't confirmed so what if there isn't one? It looks like the story has promise but who knows if or when we'll see the end of it? It's like reading half a book then putting it away for a few years.The main character is supposed to be some gifted prophesized hero but the most he manages is a lot of emotionless blank stares. His mother is just weird, talks in vague sayings and rarely gets to the point and the chick with the blue eyes, who knows what she's all about? There's more to the story for sure but we're left hanging with more question marks than a solid, enjoyable story line. That's key to a good movie and this doesn't have it. It's vague, confusing and incomplete, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. It does have excellent visuals, that's about all the good I have to say about it.",Dune

1157,cramercaitlin,Decent movie but way too long,6,24 October 2021,"Let me start off with saying that I am someone who hasn't read the book or seen the original so my review is solely based off of the movie itself. Take it with a grain of salt. Overall, my favorite part of this movie has got to be the costume design! I really enjoyed every costume and thought everything fit the setting and scenes perfectly. However I am a little upset that the trailers made it seem like Zendaya would be a lot more of an involved character. Through the entire movie the MC Paul only has visions of her (exact same clips seen in the trailer) that really don't contribute to the story. I am struggling to see why this movie needed to be so long because I found myself asking at the end what actually happened. The only significant events were showing up, visions, and dad and duncan dying. I wished that the prophecy was better explained because as someone who has not read the book i found it confusing (especially towards the end) as to what exactly the prophet should or shouldn't be doing. AND THE WORST THING IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS A PART 1. I was so angry when the movie started playing and I realized that this movie was so long and that we would have no resolution at the end. (On to things I enjoyed) I thoroughly enjoyed the settings and the CGI. It was easy to feel like you were there living the action with everyone else. The villain scenes were super creepy and I hate them so job well done with that. The music was absolutely perfect the entire movie and I particularly loved the drums that played when Paul and his mom were walking down that long hallway to the spacecraft. In conclusion, you should go see this movie and it is worth the price of admission. While there are some things that I have issues with I am glad I saw it and am excited to see part 2 hopefully very soon.",Dune

The action is jaw dropping, inventive, and yet very real feeling. This movie does exactly what it's supposed to do, it engulfs you in this very deep world and the lore and makes you ask ""Is there really more""? And yet this is answered with the line""This is only the beginning""Only the beginning? We may be in store for the BEST space epic series ever made and I'm so ready for Part II!P. S.

I didn't have to read Lord of the Rings or Sin City either. I shouldn't have to read Dune to enjoy this, but reading the books wouldn't speed up this film.Visually striking. Acting is fine. I wouldn't expect acting Oscar nominations for anyone. It has some great action, but plenty of dead space. Could have been trimmed to under two hours and still functioned as a part 1.

Now that that's out of the way, I've admittedly never understood fans obsession with the original Dune story yet alone this remake. The old one while good it was always too much to digest in one sitting. No matter how long they made it. They broke this one up which is better to be honest. Too many allegories, too much lore, too many themes all set to a Shakespearean motif making it too muddled for my liking. Was it about colonization, tribalism, messiahs, oil, hero story, all of the above? While I liked the old one, a revamp was welcome since it really needed to be focused into an actual story. That is what I was hoping for in this one. Unfortunately it's not what we got. We got something while visually beautiful, ably acted and well directed, had the exact same issues. It was boring. It was all one color, it was all one tone, it was dry. It was like reading a reference guide to the actual story without getting that story. I'm sure that a lot of people probably love the depth but much like the originals and the book, it suffered from an identity crisis making it kinda average. Great ideas but it never feels like a fully fleshed out story. Just a bunch of ideas. It was basically the book meets Chronicles of Riddick. If you love both of those, you'll be in for a treat, but really it's overrated and way too ambitious.",Dune

Dune goes on par with ""Arrival"": but this time, instead of falling asleep and leaving theater probably 30 before the ending, I endured until the end credits.Cinematography and Score are the only components that deserve some credit. The rest is just forgettable over-hyped dialogue and soulless characters. Never again. Ps.

1170,Dorveille,It was OK...nothing more,6,24 October 2021,"I should say up front that I have never read the book, but have seen the David Lynch film several times.So what to make of this new adaptation.Visually it is very impressive, the alien vistas, architecture, costumes are all great. Performances were good, and it was great to see serious sci-fi getting this kind of treatment. Despite its long running time, and the fact this is only the first part of the story, it held my interest throughout.However, watching the film I kept getting flashbacks to similar scenes from the Lynch version. Villeneuve has taken a more sombre, serious and subdued approach, but I don't necessarily think this is better than what Lynch did. I was left feeling that this new version really needed more of the otherworldly weirdness that Lynch brought to it, the new version didn't go far enough and felt a bit flat at times, it didn't give me any surprises.The same can be said for the soundtrack, which was perfectly fine in the new film, but never stood out. There is nothing particularly memorable about it, even a few days after seeing it I can barely remember the music from the film.Villeneuve is a fine director, but after giving us a Blade Runner sequel that wasn't needed, and his version of Dune which doesn't really improve upon the previous version, I kind of wish he would put his talent behind something we haven't seen, something original.I really liked his films Arrival and Enemy, and I hope one day he will get back to something closer to those.

Not their fault, there was not much to work with.I understand that the first movie of the series has to build the world for the audience but the exposition was drawn out and extremely repetitive. In fact, the movie would have benefited from cutting out half of Paul's ""slomo"" visions. Additionally, I felt the desert planet received ""Peter Jackson's LotR doubles as New Zealand tourism ad"" treatment. A lot of those shots were unnecessary. Overall, the movie could have been shorter and perhaps better-paced.The action sequences were boring and had no bite to them, and were without support from the accompanying music. In fact, the score throughout was lacklustre- very sleepy, and felt mistimed.Otherwise, the CGI was great and the costume design was cool. So points for those.",Dune
1173,rossjackson2,Great but probably more for hardcore sci fi fans,9,4 November 2021,Firstly if you're going to see this then I'd definitely recommend you see it at the cinema. Visually it's mind blowing as you'd expect from the director but the soundtrack is awesome too - really adds to the experience. At just over 2 and a half hours long it's a slow burning story and if you're not a sci fi fan then I could see you getting a bit bored with it. But I am so really enjoyed it and can't wait for part 2. The star studded cast is excellent - Timothy Chalamet does a great job. As does the always reliable Rebecca Ferguson. Loved the attention to detail in set designs and things like the hand talking. Definitely recommended for sci fi fans.,Dune

Up there with Star Wars. Not even joking, I love Star Wars and I thought this was in the same league. The actors do a fantastic job, and I'm not usually the biggest fan of thimote chalamet (?)I really really hope there will be a part two, and I know this will be decided by watching how much money it makes at the movies so if you have the chance or opportunity to watch it at the cinema PLEASE DO. It's easily worth the money. I'm really glad I did, because it makes it good on a big screen with good sound. I have adhd and I was entertained throughout the entire movie (2h37m) and that's...an accomplishment. To say the least. I didn't even finish my popcorn. AND I SHARED IT WITH MY SISTER.

Also the slow pacing didn't help that part, because it made me even more uninterested in them and I just wanted the story to go on.Another issue was the names of the tribes and persons and planets, half the time I wasn't sure who they're talking about because there were so many names.

But its very risky (no sequel guarantee), not to mention unfulfilling for the audience, to not provide a proper ending. Risky because frankly its not a great film so it remains to be seen if the box office numbers are big enough to greenlight a 2nd film. It was all building up (you could tell early on) that he was going to eventually join the rebels (Fremen) and after that fight the good fight against the evil spice traders. But the moment he meets the Fremen, 5 minutes later the film's ended, oh dear. The middle act of this film isnt completed, and certainly there's no final act. And has this film wowed me sufficiently to leave me hanging on the edge of my seat for a sequel? Er no.Its all very well made and some of the visuals are nice but at no point does this film grab you, it just never springs into life. The hero is likeable, but not dynamic. Pleasant but a bit wet and lacks charisma. Jason Momoa is just the same typecast character doing what he does in every production he's in (ie warrior character, same script lines as he usually gets, and stabs a bunch of people). He's fine, but if you've seen Momoa in anything else its just standard sword play for him, you've seen it all before.A remarkably bland film, with some nice visuals, but a lack of pacing, charisma and zero ending means a low mark.",Dune

I haven't read the book(s), but I like the David Lynch version, granted it was a failure. So I'm merely judging the new version against the old.Audio-visually stimulating effects and settings combined with ample A-list actors make DUNC worth the experience. If you thought that the creators of The Phantom Menace drew inspiration from various human cultures and races, then you'll probably think the same about this one.

The fact that this thing exists is a testament to how far movies can go when you put the right talent (and money) at the helm. Following the rest of his catalogue, there should be no doubt Villeneuve will be remembered as one of the best to do it. Dune is clearly an unfinished story and many of its highlights are resting on what's to come next.

1187,Film_Fan_Raja,Brilliant remake!,8,9 November 2021,"To review this movie without giving background to its legacy would be a disservice. Here goes - Dune is a series of science fiction novels authored by Frank Herbert between 1965 to 1985. This was also made into the controversially critiqued adaptation by David Lynch in 1984 which included the iconic soundtrack by Toto. There are also some spin offs of this novel in TV and it is believed by some, to be the Star Wars for adults!Coming to the 2021 version, director Denis Villeneuve (I loved his movie - Incendies and also known for other big budget movies like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049) has shown us the ""Art of possible"" on how can you take a movie by someone like David Lynch and give it a complete make over and still stay brilliant - hats off!The new version has loads of stars that it almost looks like the cast of Avengers - Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Oscar Issac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgard, Javier Bardiem, Dave Baustista, Zendaya and the evergreen Charlotte Rampling as the reverend Mother.Timothee Chalamet as heir apparent of the Atreides was oozing appeal both in looks and performance - he had the right charm for a confused teenager being pushed into an intergalactic conspiracy. The choice of Rebecca Ferguson for Lady Jessica was so apt, she played the role of the powerful Bene Zessirit with inner conflicts and Oscar Issac did what he could with scope provided and stood out.Some interesting bits I loved were the fact that there were no artificial intelligence or robots given the story happens in distant future (year 10191 to be precise!), the sand worms looks much different / bigger, creative liberties were taken on how Baron looks and moves (the older movie had an over the top caricatured ugly spitting cartoon, new version is more understatedly ominous), the role of Duncan went without much fanfare in old movie but here since it is Jason Momoa - they gave a better fitting farewell, even the whole voice-over thing in 1984 version is replaced with narrative and visuals which were much more powerful. You see very little of Bautista but confident that we will see more of him in the next movie.Music by Hans Zimmer played a really important role (if you have seen old movie - it was one of the best things about the old movie as it really stood out and would have been sensible to re-mix that same iconic tune like they do in James Bond. No sir - Hans Zimmer would have to completely reinvent and still stay relevant). The mood and lighting was captivating and cinematography transforms you to the world which is mostly dark and it works. The set decorations and costumes were also extraordinary and I am positive this movie is going to get the Oscar nod on several technical areas.While it was a disappointment that they did not finish the story (I personally did not know they only did half a movie), you also suddenly empathize the fact that even with 155 mins of taut screenplay, they were barely able to tell only half of the movie. It is clear, the depth of the Dune story couldn't be decently told in 2 hours (heart goes out to David Lynch's version which choked to tell too many things and ended up not as fulfilling).The new movie is bigger, better and had more heart, in short - just brilliant, leaving me eagerly waiting for Dune 2 in 2023. Thumbs up!!",Dune

1191,oldz-18896,A MESS,1,23 October 2021,"Absolutely one of the WORSE 'blockbuster' type movies I have ever seen. Thankfully, I sat through it in the comfort of my home where slices of pizza could be fetched, texts could be read, news could be scrolled without bothering others. My daughter and I chatted through most of it, checking if I was as confused as her--we both have college degrees; myself a PhD. ABSOLUTELY the result of a poor script. Terrific acting; incredible CGI; an awful screenplay. Had no idea it was part one of a two part film. Learning that at the end of the film summed up my 155 minute experience: what a waste of time.",Dune

I saw it on an IMAX screen and believe me, the scale and the visuals were just stunning. Great work by the actors and the cinematography was fantastic. A wonderful adaptation by Villeneuve that lacks some parts I love from the books hence the 9/10 rating but still manages to deliver the feel and the essence of the story. It felt like the way I imagined the story was turned solid and that's the highest praise I can give this film.",Dune
1193,andrewiles-98239,A magnificent beginning to an epic story.,9,19 October 2021,"Wow!Dennis Villeneuve was the PERFECT person to direct this epic adaptation. Visually stunning, and the right amount of slow burn - I loved the pace which was speedier than his previous films.Every shot is a work of art - he's the master of clever sci-fi.The cast is on point and boy what a cast!Timothee Chalamet is PERFECTLY cast as Paul. Every role almost seemed custom fit to each actor, yet Jason Momoa was the surprise heart of this film.It's no surprise that this does feel like half a movie - which I'm happy with, and glad they didn't rush the second half of the story like the original adaptation by David Lynch. I just hope that Warner Bros. Green lights the sequel sooner rather than later, because with this director, this cast, and everyone that worked on the film 100% deserves it. At a 2 and a half hour run time, it flew by for me.Absolutely recommend.",Dune
1194,corozin,Dune Nerds will go nuts,8,6 November 2021,"They say you should never meet your idols... I'm now in a dilemma since I saw the Dune movie last night and whilst it *is* magnificent I am struggling to overlook what (to me) are massive flaws. I am also wobbling as this is a Denis Villeneuve movie and (to me) he is like the modern Stanley Kubrick/
I read Dune, Children of Dune and Chapter House Dune about 10 times over 15 years when I was younger.This film is visual and cinematic feast, no doubt about it. Not the leap forward from David Lynch's 1983 adaptation that critics would have you believe but stunning, and with more running time to work with the camera often lingers and feasts on the environment of Arrakis. The photography is beautiful.The cast is perfect, although some characters have more to do than others. Timothee Chalomet appears to struggle in the first frames but his encounter with Revered Mother Mohaim soon corrects that. Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Rebecca Ferguson are well cast and dependable, and Stellan Skarsgard brings a new level of Darkness to to Baron Harkkonen. All wonderful stuff.And yet... and yet the film nagged me gently throughout. Despite the time luxury, characters and plotlines are almost completely omitted. There is no mention at all in this 2½ hour run time of the weirding modules (so central to the later plot) and the two Mentats, Thufir Hawat and Piter DeVries barely get any screen time at all despite their central nature to both houses in the book. Indeed Piter's omission skews an important scene where he is actually killed in the book.And Jessica, I don't recall Jessica being quite the weak character she plays for most of the film. Most most of the film she is mostly a weak, cowering deferential creature and only really finds her strength (she is a Bene Gesserit witch FFS!) in the last 20 minutes.Perhaps I am being over critical as a fan, I don't know. But to me these are important details which the running time and the writing team should have attended to. I still desperately want to see the second half but a modern ""Lord of the Rings"" it is not. Shame, it was close to being perfect...",Dune
1195,phlexss,"5 stars for visuals, zero for story",5,12 October 2021,"I really, really wanted to like this movie. I have read all the Dune books and have seen the David Lynch version several times (all versions of it) I think the DL version is brilliant and receives not enough credit (apart from the ending which is truly awful).This version just feels off. Nothing feels right. A lot of the backstory is missing, important things are not explained or missing and what we do see feels forced somehow....and I actually got bored at some points....which was amazing because I so much love the books.I'm a big fan of sound/music in movies because it can really draw you into the film and set the correct feel for the scenes. For me the music doesn't do this at all and it really starts to bother you after a while.As many others have already stated, I also don't feel much for most of the characters, so anything that happens to them doesn't carry any weight.It's a real shame this long playing time wasn't used to better establish the personality and backstory of all the main characters. I think David Lynch did a much better job with his version and he actually told the whole story of the first book, not just half of it.Still, I really hope part-2 gets made because otherwise part-1 will have been a total waste and hopefully part-2 will be good enough to redeem everything that is wrong with part-1....",Dune

Villeneuve is more known for his very good thrillers and his dark multifaceted characters and their psychological study. Still, the spaceships, sets, costumes and soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are impressive, but again, costumes are not as original as Luc Besson in the 5th Element.Furthermore, I find that the main character does not really carry the film and that there are always breaks in the plot that are not exactly explained. Thus, during a chase in the desert, the villains suddenly appear, without knowing how they got on the hero's trail in the first place.",Dune

If you do decide to enjoy this movie, do it in a theatre with Imax, or something to that effect. It will put you in a place where you should be when watching it. It's a real good movie. It really is. Sure it's a long one so you will be in for a longer sit down. It's worth your while though. I hope that part 2 will go into production soon.",Dune
1198,morcego,Very little respect for the source material,4,17 October 2021,"Great actors, but terrible casting. Gurney Halleck should be ""an ugly lump of a man"" with an inkvine scar. Duncan Idaho should have a classic male beauty, someone that is always called to escort the ladies. Although Rebecca Ferguson is not an horrible choice for Lady Jessica, since the specifics of her looks are not so crucial to the story, she is supposed to have a regal look. Not a big problem there. Making Dr. Liet Kynes female doesn't really compromise the story, so that is ok for creative license.That really bothered me was the way they butchered the lore. Thee move opens with Femen using lasguns, something they sneer at (at least at this point in time). The ships don't have noses, so how can the noses be shot off. Caladan is not as bright as the books describe it but that's forgivable since it rains a lot there.I can see people who never read the book enjoying the movie. Or people who read it as a school assignment many years ago. By the dialogs, it is obvious the screenwriters know the source material. They make references to things that are only said in books way down the series, specifically the prequels. So why would they butcher so much?And, I mean. Anyone who read the books knows that two characters they couldn't mess up was Gurney and Duncan. Specially Duncan. Why, oh why? Don't they believe in the potential of the IP? This movie is ""part one"", so they must believe enough to think there will be sequels. Even if the Honored Mothers that show up in book 5 are nothing something that could be realistically adapted to the screen these days, shouldn't they think down the line enough to keep Duncan as pristine as possible?So many unnecessary inconsistencies. The Shield Wall is supposed to be a ""natural feature of the desert"", if my memory serves me right.I could go on and on.This is the 3rd attempt at adapting Frank Herbert's work. I have to confess I never had courage to watch the miniseries, but from what I've heard it was catastrophic.So, anything positive I can say about the movie? They paid a lot of attention to make sure everything looked epic. They make sure to put several details for fans to recognize, which I found both nice and insulting (if they know the source material that well, why not stick to it as much as possible?). Why make the Emperor's orders for the Atreides to take over Arakis into a requests? It makes no sense.Right, I should be saying positive things now Dave Bautista casting was perfect, and Stellan Skarsgård was inspired. I would never have thought of him, and he just works are the baron. Stephen McKinley Henderson was also a very good choice for Thufir.Omfg! What did they do with the Atreides hand signals! They are supposed to be almost undetectable for those who don't know it. On the movie it is almost like waving a flag, or ASL. Why?!?!?! It is supposed to be a secret that was never broken by their enemies.On the other hand, they did pay attention to some details. The date palms at not really date palms, but at least they are palms. And there are 20 of them.I could go on and on, but that's the gist of it: no respect for the source material, all visuals and, as so many others mentioned, ""no soul"".",Dune
1199,My2centsDave,A Redux for New Moviegoers,7,31 October 2021,"I write this review as an older (52) movie fanatic, who's seen the original Dune. Overall, it's a good remake, and the acting, production values, and writing are excellent. I offer a warning for those in my demographic though... There's nothing new here. Sure, the faces of the characters have changed, the spacecraft look slightly different, and i'll admit... The plot is easier to follow. (The original had so much internal narration, and telepathic communication, it was hard to know what the hell was going on.) However, when it was all over I felt the same way you do when you're bored, and rent a movie you've already seen 5 times. New audiences will enjoy this, however, and the studios will rake in the cash. That seems to be the business plan for the foreseeable future: Rehash/reuse and sell it as new... everybody's out of ideas.",Dune
1200,matthewlineham,Dune v Dune,7,18 October 2021,"I've read the books. I've seen the OLD movies and TV shows. Whilst my memory is a tad rusty I remember more than enough not comparison material to comment.The new Dune movie is thick on spectacle and excellent actors. Yet despite having those 2 key ingredients both are done mediocre.Frankly I think Dune best survives as a TV series. The info and backstory is just so THICK a movie cannot do it justice.I could say more but I won't. Suffice it to say I think they have done a respectable job building a ground floor of interest given the actors they employed and the visuals.Negative from me:
1) Chani should have come out WAY earlier in the movie. We were all waiting on the Chani/Paul storyline.2) Baron Harkonnen was atrociously under-utilised
3) Was Dave Bautista even in this movie bar a few seconds? Same enquiry goes for Josh Brolin and Duncan Idaho as well.Put simply it's like they couldn't decide if they were going to go with visuals and battle. Or character building and dialogue. And it ended up being a dogs breakfast Of both.Funny the original Dune movies do a far better job of establishing who is Emperor Shaddam and who is Baron H and who is Duke LA.In short it was an acceptable job wherein we HOPE the second movie pays off significantly on the promise. But I suspect it won't and both will be mediocre.Unfortunately it's the worse Denis V movie I've ever seen. It felt like he couldn't decide to be visual spectacle or character substance and ended up halfway in between and satisfying nobody.",Dune
1201,K1MCity,"NOT Dune, maybe should be called 'Paul's Dune'",3,27 October 2021,"The Sci-Fi mini-series is still the best, the 1980s Dune 2nd best & this Dune is a distant 3rd.It's what this movie is lacking that's the problem not what it is. This director doesn't have true love for this story. You can tell if your a fan of the 1980s Dune or the books. It should've been done by someone who really knew & loved the books. You get almost nothing about any of the houses, you won't understand why spice is so important yet the story revolves around it. They barely gave the Baron any screen time. Want to see the Baron? You can see every scene with him just about in the trailers. He is not in the rest of the film except that. & it's not the Baron from Dune. The throppters get more screentime than Duncan or any Harkonen or the Bene Gesserit. Paul doesn't even say his famous line, but he does in the trailers I've seen all year which is odd. That's what makes me think they completely changed the movie over the last year. Really lazily done.This director doing this movie I had high hopes for because I really loved Bladerunner 2049, but now I'm just angry. He's just artsy fartsy & this is not a story that can be told in that way. Shame on you Denís. The movie is OK, but he totally just dismissed everyone else's back story which is so important & part of the great story of Dune. Book 6 is all about Mentats & the Bene Gesserit yet he makes no mention of Mentats at all in this film. Navigators are mentioned once but you have no idea what or which 1s they are or anything. No house Corrino at all. Totally changed the Barron's character. He's supposed to be flamboyant & floating around & crazy evil awesome psycho but in this Dune he's basically Kutrz from Apocalypse Now. No really it's almost identical to the 1st time you see Kurtz.This was a huge disservice to the story of Dune. The animation & graphics were awesome, soundtrack OK, acting was OK actors were lil sub par & not exactly right for their individual roles. Not all but some ie Paul. The film was not horrible either. He got all the famous scenes in there but he changed or erased or ignored fundamental parts of the story. Things that really surprised & hit you in the story now won't because 1 example - Jessica has brown hair. That's one of my favorite revelations at the end of Dune but you won't get that here because he did away with all that.The woke gender & nationality swapping is getting tiring in movies & while it doesn't make a huge difference with the characters in the story here he still did it. Looking at YOU Foundation! I just think that's a sad desperate move. Make your own stories & if it was such a huge no no for Caucasian people to have done to other nationalities why are they OK with doing it now. It's OK NOW? That's just my feelings on the woke film industry currently.Like I said it wasn't terrible but it's not Dune. It's some artsy version with some famous scenes. What I mean is like an artist creates a painting & your to look at it & figure out the meaning & what the artist was trying to say. That's what this director tried to do but failed & you just can't do that with Dune. It's too complex to do that with. You can't just not put in crucial back stories or change the major characters personalities. The movie as it is was OK not bad, an extra 1/2 hr of content, back stories & information would've made this a flippin awesome movie. 1 of the best. It's all it doesn't have that's my problem. Plus they made us wait an entire extra year!? I honestly think that extra year they just cut & cut & edited & because they cut this scene then now they have to cut that scene too. You don't even know what the Spice is or does or why. Things like that. I think with that extra year they had too much time & messed with it too much & took out all the good stuff. I hope so at least. I would really hope that this wasn't done intentionally from the beginning. NOT Dune, Should be called 'Paul's Dune' or 'Paul's Story.'",Dune
1202,Son-of-WRA,I'm perplexed,7,26 October 2021,"Movies that I either like or dislike are easy to review. But once in a while, one'll come along to make me think much deeper for why I feel the way I do.First of all, I will say I liked ""Dune"", but I'm not bowled over by it. I think it suffers from me liking David Lynch's version, which was clearer and crisper, and this version's placing too much emphasis on grandeur.It is a visually stunning picture and the special effects are top notch. But I think it's my familiarity with the story that spoils this review and that's why I'm not a big fan of remakes.And the characters mumble too much. I sat in the fourth row at an AMC theater and the volume was so high that it literally distorts the dialogue. I don't know if the theaters play the volume so high BECAUSE people are deaf, or that theaters are TRYING to make people deaf. I'm an old rock and roll fan who likes the music loud, but movies need to tone it down a bit.This is a thinking man's film with a slight nod to buzzing spacecraft. But it's really a story focused on the substance (no pun intended) of the interwoven motives and choices made by the characters. I'm sorry to say that it failed to pull me in and feel like I saw a refreshing re-telling of Frank Herbert's classic.Except for violence and a little gore, this is a clean film for you to bring near-teens to. But they should read the novel first.Still, I gave it a 7 rating because they really did try to make a great film, even if it did come off as dry (again, no pun intended). I hope it does well enough at the gate to justify Part 2 - I'd really like to see it.",Dune

On the whole it sticks closely to the original novel and the few compromises it makes all seem fully justifiable and necessary. The screenplay is excellent too hope the same writers do the second film if it gets made.The casting is almost perfect (Timothy Chalamet probably a bit too weedy for the lead but still does a good job), Josh Brolin is great as Gurney as it Jason Mamoa as Duncan. Zendaya as usual is just great at everything but not a major figure in the first film.Hans Zimmer's score is better than some of his recent work but in truth he probably peaked some years ago and what music there is isn't terribly memorable. Would have been nice if this film had given us a great new piece of music but that definitely isn't the case here.Do really hope the second film is made and if it successful people don't get greedy and try and turn it into several.",Dune
1204,Crystxl_,Fear Is The Mind-Killer,9,16 September 2021,"Just watched one of the first screenings of 'Dune' at an IMAX cinema and damn, that were some of the best two and half hours of my life. I was hyped for this movie from the moment it was announced since I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve - but also because the story really spoke to me in a special sense. I haven't read the books, so this experience was very original and new for me.I was amazed when I heard about the amazing cast that was going to be in this film. When I saw them in action I was even more amazed, overwhelmed even. Every one of these top-tier actors brought their A-game to the set of 'Dune' and this makes the characters so much more interesting. The person the amazed me the most was Rebecca Ferguson. Her portrayal of Lady Jessica was absolutely outstanding.The visuals and cinematography in this movie were out of this world. You'd almost think that they actually filmed on different planets. You could pause the movie at any point in time and you would always be looking at a beautiful painting of its own. The sets were incredible, so were the special effects. You can really tell people worked hard on this.Hans Zimmer's score was pristine (as always). It really brought the universe of 'Dune' to life by creating a unique atmosphere of its own. The sound design was also incredible. I was a big fan of the loud, obscure sounds that were coming from many of the gigantic ships. It really gave you and idea of how large in scale this story is.As far as the story goes, I don't know if I can give a good opinion. I haven't read the books nor watched the previous adaptions, so I don't know if this adaption stayed true to the original. All I can say is that this story really pulled me in from the get go and didn't let go until a few hours after the movie ended. And I'm still not over it. I rate this movie 9/10 because I absolutely adore it, missing the one point because the ending didn't really feel like an ending. I truly hope part two gets made because this story deserves to be completed.",Dune

This movie will require multiple viewing to fully understand the universe if you're not familiar with the source material. The cast did phenomenal. Jason Mamoa as Duncan Idaho was my favorite. Hans Zimmer score can be overpowering at times, but for the most part, he further enriches the environment and scale of Arrakis. The cinematography is breathtaking. The biggest complaint I have is how Lady Jessica was written for a majority of the movie. She takes a back seat until the final twenty minutes which was disappointing.

As a fan of the novels by James Herbert and the 1984 film, I had high expectations to be met with this film. I'm happy to say I was very pleased with the film. I had no problems with the 'lack of emotion' some people complained about regarding the plot line. This is intrinsic to the characters and as you go deeper into the stories you discover how characters with intense emotions are set apart in the novels and how Paul's own emotions affect his decisions.However, if you are not familiar with any of the previous materials I can understand being a bit let down at the somewhat abrupt ending. I was immersed in the world; I wanted more and that's not really a bad thing with a film is it? I just don't like the fact that I'm going to have to wait and see if the studio green lights another film, then it has to be cast, then filmed, etc. It makes me nervous because the film would definitely feel unfinished if another film never appeared.I'd definitely recommend Dune. It's absolutely gorgeous. I was totally invested (although I found myself quoting dialogue from the 1984 film occasionally and voila, there it came or I was disappointed when it didnt). I do recommend either reading the first novel (there's also a new graphic novel of Dune out now, but not sure if it's the original book version or this movie version) or watching the earlier film for a bit more context. The whole book series was awesome and I'd love to see lots more movies (Paul's unborn sister is a real doozy when she's born!)",Dune

I was disappointed when I first saw it on release, yet now it's easily become one of my favourite Lynch films.It is very obviously David Lynchs' VISION of Dune, and is in no way a sell-out, as it has his signature visuals, soundtrack and symbolism all over it. The fact it has some problems is inevitable - the book is big and complex, and could never be fully envisioned in a few hours!In 2000 a tv series tried to adapt the first 3 books of the Dune Epic. Again, slated by many, it is also very good, though not without some problems inherent in the source material, and knotty incompatible adaption issues.Before either of these, there was a planned version by Alejandro Jodorowsky . Most of the designers and crew from that abandoned project ended up making ALIEN (1979) instead- there's a great documentary about all this as - Jodorowsky's Dune (2013)I read 4 of the books when I was a teenager, and another 2 later when released- they are brilliant, and more to do with Politics, Permaculture and Cultural diversity than any typical 'science fictional tropes.Now, Denis Villeneuve has made his film version. But why?It looks great with massive cgi ships, however the interiors and design is not nearly as good as Lynchs version...Most scenes are poorly paced, dragged out and lingering on mood , rather than substance.The music is AWFUL! Intrusive, overbearing, inappropriate... and sleep inducing.The acting is predominantly good, though there is some miscasting with Pauls mother.The biggest problems are the evasion of any actual Politician Connivances, the thing that makes the books so brilliant is entirely ignored among the gloss, dust and swooping cgi visuals... what was he thinking! I had to rewatch the film straight away as I could believe what I'd just seen. Or more accurately -not seen!And... after 2 and a half hours of déjà vu (FOR ALL OF US WHO KNOW THE STOTY,FILM,TV SERIES), Paul and his mother meet up with the fremen ..and the the film ends...!!! Lol... so, we get HALF of the first book ...How many decades will these films take to get through the SIX main books by Herbert? (My favourite was the Fourth one- God Emperor , that has never been transformed onto the big screen).Maybe , Villeneuve shouid have began with the 2nd and 3rd books and left Lynch's version as an official Pt1 in the series... or just waded in with the 4th book with a 30minute prologue as a separate pre-feature?Whatever, If you're unfamiliar with the story I suggest you ignore this film until the rest of the series is actually made. If ever... and start instead with the TV series then watch the Lynch version (not the TV cut by him as Alan Smithee, but the longest cut of 136 mins).",Dune
1221,jacobmounter,"Overrated, is IMDb broken?",5,21 October 2021,"Hanz Zimmer does the music, I was surprised because it's very dull and sounds like every other epic score.It's hard to understand.Constant telling rather than showing.Characters are extremely flat and you will have almost zero to relate to.Environment is boring. Just sand everywhere. Where are they supposed to get food?Overall the movie is boring and leaves you with absolutely nothing. The only saving graces are that it is beautifully shot, acting is fine but nothing great and the last 30 mins are somewhat entertaining.The first 1hr30 is extremely slow.If you don't watch it, you won't be missing a lot.",Dune
1222,tenseicoalition,Picking your poison.,7,23 October 2021,"When David Lynch unleashed his interpretation of Frank Herberts largely unfilmable political science fiction opus, many critics panned it as too condensed and disjointed.Fast forward to 2021 and another filmmaker takes a stab at Dune. There are many things Denis Villeneuve does well here, but again missing much of Herberts tone. In the end I feel Mr. Lynch had a better idea of what to cut out and what to leave in than Villeneuve did.You cannot have a adaptation of Dune without the politics, without the religion, without the internal monologues...even the crappy Syfy channel miniseries got that right.Now where this film does shine is in the visuals and costumes.departments as well as art direction. There is plenty to see and gawk over here.The casting is good. Timothy Chalamet is probably closer to the novel's description of Paul Atreides although Kyle MacLachlan captured the characters spirit and demeanor better. I'm a fan of Josh Brolin but I feel he is miscast here as Gurney. Patrick Stewart nailed it. The rest are good.I'm not too happy with the Baron's diminished role. And also the pronunciations of house names and titles are more like SyFy channel and less like Lynch. I prefer Lynch.It is definitely worth a watch or two. I look forward to seeing how it will be wrapped up in part two. But David Lynch's Dune will never be equaled, unless someday Jodorowsky gets to make his.",Dune
1223,RubenGomezRadioboy,Can pleople please stop cheeering bad cinematography?,1,28 September 2021,This is the Nolan nonsense of this decade.Boring is not good.Bland is not good.Do people really want a boring bland version of an exciting masterpiece that already exist?Are you going to make the same mistakes you did with Nolan?Admit this. You don't like the boring take of Batman anymore. It was all just a big mistake. It was you being dragged by a nonsensical trend.Blade Runner 2049 and now this. 😴Stop it now that you still can.,Dune
1224,Snabeldyhr,The emperors new stillsuit-clothes.,7,28 September 2021,"I watched it last night and it delivered precisely what I expected: top-notch production design, set design, costumes and amazing visuals ... and I guess some okay performances (I actually liked Timothée Chalamet here, after hating him since seeing him in another movie I can't even remember what was).However, I felt completely indifferent towards the story. I didn't care about the characters, their journey or the world they live in. Story-wise it just left me (mostly) completely dead inside. In all honesty, as much as I love science fiction, I've just never liked fantasy - and that's the category I think this fits in, more than sci-fi.If we get a part two I will still watch it in the cinema, to get the full effect of the visuals. And indeed the visuals are the reason I'm rating this movie 7, but cause it looks fantastic and I can tell is pretty good story telling, so it's definitely ""above average"" ... but if I rated from ""feelings"" instead of ""achivement"" I'd probably only score it 5.So, in short: I'm not falling over myself to sing praises about it, because this is just not for me. For me I'd take Blade Runner 2049 (or Sicario or Prisoners) over this and I can't imagine I'd ever want to watch it again.",Dune
1225,GalPalVal5050,Beautiful and boring,5,22 October 2021,"I refused to watch any previews, hear any critics' take, or read anything about this movie before watching it today. I wanted to come in as unbiased as possible. I know its a difficult adaptation, so much of the inner dialogue or thinking that goes on is hard to translate to screen. After sitting through this version, I still think the 1984 version is still superior with its voice overs of thought processes and freaky mannerisms of the evil, good and ambivalent. It seemed suitable for societies that had developed their own cultures and characteristics far in the future and it immersed you in that world, though confusing at times, and on rewatching you learn that that movie doesn't treat you like an idiot child and tries to overexplain everything to you, wasting time on boring exposition.This movie however, drudgingly tries to make sure you understand what's going on every step of the way. Unnecessary ""action"" scenes were added to make it more exciting (which it didn't). If you are going to use prophetic visions, don't replay them over and over again ad nauseum. One vision I'd like to erase from my head is the weakling picture of Timothy Chalamet's phsysique we were treated to in the beginning. It felt gross and slightly predatory as he has the body of a child not developed yet. Why did we need to see him shirtless exactly? I mean, if we want a topless man shot why not Jason Momoa? Not even a bicep flash from him. Oh well.Overall it is a mostly faithful adaptation for which I'm grateful being an avid fan of the book, but it leaves out certain critical lines from the novel and adds in gratuitous CGI which was very well done, except...it was you know...CGI (yawn). A lot of the cleverness, subterfuge, genius of the characters weren't played out, it left our protagonists look more floundering and stumbling then they should have. Maybe part 2 will pull it all together but I don't know if I'm that interested.",Dune
1226,Renatus77,Doomed to fail,3,22 October 2021,"I have seen all of Villenueves films except Dune. All of his films have huge potential BUT there's ALWAYS something lacking. In the beginning his films were smaller and somewhat more authentic. They seem to go somewhere and you get excited hoping that this movie will finally be a movie that will move you. They don't. It's extremely disappointing.As his career took off he got bigger actors and a bigger budget. None of it helps. It actually seems to make the quality of the films worse.I have not seen Dune but I can already predict it's not gonna be able to move me, as usual.Just look at the cast.None of them have the chops to make it happen except Bardem and Rampling but they're not in their element in these types of movies.Bardem is one of the greatest actors that has walked the earth (that has been recorded on film) but just look at his role as a villain in James Bond. None of his magic came across. Watch his Spanish movies and witness his ability. He's truly amazing.Dune 2021 is typical Hollywood trying to sell tickets (can't blame them, that's what they do mostly) by casting Chalomet who's definitely talented but is just not ready. Bautista, Zendaya, I barely know them but they're just there because of their popularity with teenagers.Most of you will not agree with me rating a movie without having seen it first and I would agree with you. It's just that I have seen thousand of movies and have been let down for many of them. At this point I can see a pattern and can make predictions based on the past work of the directors, writers, actors and dp's and of course the typical machine that is Big Budget Box Office Hollywood.The 3 stars is for the special effects. I predict they're going to be the highlight of the film. The acting is going to be worst though (I've seen the trailer) but the directing might take that prize.If I'm totally off I would be TRULY shocked and I will apologize and change the rating accordingly. I'll keep this original post, I won't delete it like a coward.",Dune

Changing characters moral Compas and how things unfold does not help anyone understand the whole idea of this book. Even though it is a science-fiction story, it is more of a political intrigue and how religion can shape not just a world but a universe. Dune by Frank Herbert is not only one of the greatest science fiction stories it is probably one of the top 10 American literature works. This should've been Presented as a high-end snow on HBO Max.

1- this is happening way into the future and people are fighting with swords?? This is ridiculous.2- their shields are just stupid, they just protect them from slash hits? Wouldn't they be better off with chainmail? Same level of protection!3- again all the technology and they don't have any kind of monitoring equipment in the rooms, corridors and hallways?4-again useless shields , this time the spaceship shields , what's their point if they can't even protect them from bombs?5- all the technology and the still suites uses sweat to replenish the water loss? Can't it just make water from o2 and H in the air ?6- they need still suits to walk in the desert yet they wear no glasses? If it's that hot, then eyes , the most vulnerable part of their head, don't need protection?7- all the technology, and the swords are made of alloy and worm's teeth? No laser Saber??8- inside of thopters look less advanced than black hawks made in 1972
9- the Chinese doctor easily disrupted the whole base , single handedly??10- all the technology and the king uses his ring as stamp?11- very long , boring dreams
12- insensitive face of this kid the duke's son is irritating
13- is he supposed to be warrior ? Yet his body and muscle are like he's never even lifted a sword! The guy us just too skinny for roles like this! A warrior and someone who trains a lot , should pack some muscle

But the original story is so grandiose and long, that telling it in one sitting would be too difficult. One could argue that two movies might not even do the story and works justice.Anyway, this is not the epic movie that people expected beforehand. Yes, it was visually stunning with fantastic sound design (including music) and great acting. But it was not the action packed movie that you might have expected from the trailer, the first movie adaptation, or even the book. Is that a bad thing though? Not in my opinion.It sets a great tone and much like the characters in the story, you feel trapped in the situation. Even before they leave their home planet, Paul and his family (especially his dad) seem to be aware of the fact that their hand is forced and that their house is in tremendous danger. That ""trapped"" feeling never leaves you and only becomes stronger as the movie progresses due to its scenes and tempo. But that means it ""lacks"" in the blockbuster action (though it is there).To sum it up:
Dune is like foreplay. You have to be able to enjoy the continuous tension and the lack of a climax.Those who love that, will love Dune. Those looking for a quick ""bang"", will not.",Dune

Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Jason Momoa deliver some terrific performances and in general this stellar ensemble cast is superb. The actors have truly brought the characters to life under Villeneuve's careful guidance.

Unlike the 1984 version by legendary director David Lynch, who has all by disowned the movie as he did not have the final cut. He's spoken at length that the movie which appeared on screen is not the movie he wanted to make and considers it to be a failure.Villeneuve appears to have been given more control here and best of all the story has been split into 2 parts instead of trying to cram so much material into a single film.And what a gorgeous film it is to witness. If you've seen any of Villeneuve's previous films like Arrival and Bladerunner 2049, you know he has a flair for the visual. Dune is more than 2 hours long but it sure as heck did not feel that long to me. I oftentimes check my phone during a film and find I didn't touch it even once here. I was glued to the visuals, to the calm performances from masters like Rebecca Ferguson (Mission Impossible films), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars, etc), Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Stellan Skarsgård (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Josh Brolin (Old Boy, Dead Pool 2) and Javier Bardem (No Country For Old Men).I watched this on television in 4K but a part of me wishes I had made it back to a theatre, which is really where I think it would be to appreciate this film. Hopefully, it won't take too long to get part 2 out and conclude this epic story.",Dune

Never thought I'd write this, but I prefer David Lynch's version.Something just seems off...perhaps studio tampering? Lacks the immediacy, and fantastically bizarre and perverse otherworldliness of Lynch's original.Gone are the exotic technologies, the dark witchcraft, and the nastiness of the Harkonnens that made earlier versions so memorable. Instead we get a well-made, but rather uninteresting TV movie. Denis is a visionary director...I expected more from him.",Dune

(Some actually played their parts well, but were hobbled by the weak script) Terrible film adaptation using nothing unique and bringing nothing new worth mentioning to the screen (except the over reliance on CGI). This is a terrible woke follow up to a better made movie. Since when are the ""natives"" all from Hawaii. Did I mention this is a terrible movie.

I'm a fan of the 84 movie.To be objective I must compare this to the original movie, but as movies are movies and books are books, I'll exclude the source from my thoughts. Where the original hits its median point, the latest ends. For the 2hrs17 of the original, knowing that we now had 2hrs35 for slower, more focused telling of very big story, I was very excited. But, somehow, this movie uses more time to tell us less. Not just in plot, but in character, in politicals, in world building.Unfortunately, what I hopped, just didn't happen.Much of the sub-plots, world creation and side character work has been purged, slimmed, and generally ignored. Again, this is not from the book, which is substantial, but from the 84 showing that was condensed enough already.The space this iteration had, frankly, was not used.The movie has many positives, if it hadn't I wouldn't have watched it twice already.But, in a nut shell, as a stand alone, it doesn't really do anything.The cast are fantastic, well suited, and full grasp their roles. The cinematography is highly appealing, some shots are really top notch, and the dialogue works cleverly. The sound scape could have done more, but it resonates enough to impress.Yet, the function of a film is to tell, or at least lead, a story.In this regard it somewhat fails.I've been dying for this movie since its first announcement. I was first in the door of my local cinema to watch it. But all I feel now is, well, mildly whelmed. It's soft hints don't do enough to sate my sci-fi fierce appetite.I've scored it 7, and I feel shameful as a fan, but it doesn't justify the 8.I've given it a 7 on the hope of part 2. Should the next fail to inspire this will get its pure, stand alone movie, rating of 6.But for the moment it is a 7.A top cast, fantastic sets, beautiful cinematography, none of these can ever replace the strength of a focused, angled, and honed story.And this movie just didn't show us enough story.",Dune

I know it's an adaptation but the missing parts from a book in a movie left the feeling something missing. Even if you didn't read a book. It wasn't bad, for someone who read the book will definitely miss things out of it - as well. For example, Jessica in the book is a strong woman, calm and perfectly trained Bene gesserite. She doesn't fall by itself. The director, seems in this film -and his other movies as well- that he always omits the essential things from his films, that's why his movies looks empty, only those who read the books can understand and see what I missed and so many others too. Either that was it or he got empty inside over the years, I don't know but he should pay attention to that. Not only the name matter but also the content too. I have read all the Dune universe books. I know who is who and what will happen. I also missed some elements. But total, it didn't get bad. I'll give a strong 6/10 or 7/10 - if I'm forgiving.

This movie has an intriguing story that will keep you guessing throughout if you are unfamiliar with the classic novel or David Lynch's version, which I was. I think that Dune Part 1 is an amazing setup for a couple of sequels, this is just the beginning, this is only part 1 of such a unique, captivating and beautiful story that's being told. This is not a Sci-Fi movie to joke around with, this is exactly how a Sci-Fi movie should be.I know that some people might say that this movie is slow, and is leaving so much stuff uncovered and unspoken about, and it has a lot of plot holes, but I think that it's necessary to leave breathing space for the characters and the audience, this is such a broad universe to cover, and it is so hard to fit all that into one movie.With all that said, I really think that you can see and tell what depth and passion that has been put on the movie screen by Denis Villeneuve, and I am excited to see how the story unfolds in the years to come.I definitely recommend it.",Dune

As someone who has never read the book I was very invested in this world. On a technical level this movie is a unbelievable achievement. The set design, cinematography, practical and visual effects are all amazing here. Denis Villeneuve's directing is on point as usual and the actors deliver this script in such an amazing way. My issues with this film are with some of the expository dialogue. There is a lot to explain to the audience and sometimes that can lead the movie feeling boring. While I enjoy hearing about this world I will admit that I got a bit impatient at a couple of moments. Another issue is that the movie doesn't really feel complete but this is part one of this story. Hopefully we get a sequel cause I can't wait to see what happens next. This is one of those movies that make me feel inspired after seeing it.

Unfortunately I can't say the same for Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides. He brings to the table the same undertones as Hayden Christensen did to Star Wars, his youth and weedy appearance does nothing to convey to the viewer the qualities that Paul possesses. He comes across as a spoilt child in his performance and not a seasoned enough actor to take on this role.Still, its a decent watch. But give me David Lynch Dune is a million times better.",Dune

1286,alexanderpetreski,As a standalone film a bit sluggish,7,11 October 2021,"As much as I liked the movie I felt like I wished to like it a little bit more. Although the movie is easily two and a half hours long not much happens in terms of story and at the same time it doesn't feel like a character-driven story either. We don't get too deep into the psyche of anyof the characters except Paul. Don't get me wrong, I love, slow movies that build up atmosphere with visceral images, but this felt a bit too indulgent at times.So it might be probably more enjoyable for audiences who like the immersive experience or for the Dune fans (which is fair). Although I am a sucker for slow burning movies this one felt a little bit off, but it might be an unfair judgement since it's literally half the story we're seeing.A thing that annoyed me a little bit, was that the film is unusually unsubtle for a Dennis Villeneuve film, there are certain metaphors like the bull or the dream sequences which are too overused and feel rather tacky.I liked the visuals and that some of the technology looks very alien and minimalistic, and it mixes it with some ancient elements like a wooden table or wax sigil to sign a treaty. It's details like this that make the world still relatable.Another gripe I had was with the actors, although none of them are bad, most of them did feel a little bit bland, and kept me at a distance from their fates. Some actors felt almost typecast like Jason Momoa playing a swashbuckling giant with the heart of gold, Stellan Skarsgard playing a ruthless villain, Rebecca Ferguson: cold but professional and Dave Bautista as a mindless brute. Timothée Chalamet did a solid job but nothing outstanding.Although the characters are solid, most of them feel a bit stale. And it seemed to me a missed opportunity to leave out so much business with the Harkonnen. They are supposed to be ruthless and scary, but we see so little of them in this film that they don't come off as a big threat except for their strength in numbers.Roger Deakins cinematography is dearly missed in this Villeneuve movie, I hope they have him back on Part II. Hans Zimmer's music was bordering on annoying, or maybe the cinema had a terrible sound system, I really hope it's the latter. I have to give it a re-listen once the film is available on bluray. Other than that I can recommend the film to people who like a more thought-provoking sci-fi films which are not filled with space shootouts. And of course to those who like politics in sci-films, the movie is definitely in it's own niché and I hope it will influence more sci-fi narratives to go more big in terms of scope rather than battles.Judged on it's own it's kind of flawed but at least a promising start for part two or maybe even part three, we'll see.",Dune

I sure wish I knew what a couple of the key characters were saying as they whispered whatever it was they were attempting to communicate.Considering the next part hasn't begun filming yet, I'm thinking we'll have a colony on Mars before this saga comes to a close. This first part ended somewhat abruptly, without much of a lead-in to part two, so if one isn't very familiar with the books, you're left with a head-scratcher.",Dune

Most of the cast performs well but I don't think they're a right fit for the characters. Stellan Skarsgard and Javier Bardem, however, weren't even performing well. The visual feast that was promised is absent too - not that it looks bad per se, but it's by no means uniquely stimulating or so beautiful that you'd want a frame of every shot. The score is one of the worst I've heard in recent memory and whenever the drowsy ambient isn't playing you get these laughably bad tribal chants that take one back to the abomination that was Justice League. It's actually incredible that they left them in there.All in all, pretty meh. It feels consumerist and has no heart compared to other Villeneuve movies like Enemy and Bladerunner.",Dune

1293,Couchkik20,If Star Wars was an avant-garde stage play,7,22 October 2021,"Being a massive fan of Denis Villeneuve and particularly Blade Runner 2049, I had high expectations for DUNE. Blade Runner was stunning, colorful, action packed and engaging, but I'm sad to say DUNE is the exact opposite.It has visual elements very reminiscent of Star Wars : the minimalist spaceship shots, the oversized battleships (hello Jawa's sandcrawler!), the ""fascist"" troopers groups, the creepy villain throne, even a ""lightsaber"" sounding device etc. But everything is so staged, so lifeless, and so static, you feel you're watching an avant-garde contemporary play rather than a sci-fi blockbuster.Villeneuve tried to push that theater approach with a lot (a lot!) of dialogues and intimate scenes but it ends up like constant exposition. Sometimes I felt I was watching an audiobook with so many characters saying what they are doing or what is happening on screen. And at the same time, there is very little character development apart from Paul. The lead soldiers (Brolin, Momoa), the king (Isaac) are all plot devices and all devoid of proper personalities. Sure they all look great, have beautiful costumes and armors but that's it.It's a very frustrating movie because it teases engines, planets, characters but never fully exploit them.Everything is very static, and slow.For all the beautiful visuals and inventive ideas, there are very clear pacing issues. Fights are weirdly staged and clunky, battles are anticlimactic with a very remote feel. There is a particular ""helicopter style"" engine that we see endlessly getting off the ground, being started, or just flying, it's ridiculously repetitive. Every single ""cool sci-fi"" device is shown slowly in action like you're watching a commercial. Then you get repeated Zendaya shots randomly played over and over again, very long and painful shots of characters moving in slomo, and ENDLESS closeups of Timothée Chalamet's face. I get that we're supposed to feel his emotions and dreams but this is just bad clunky editing.This is not helped by the desert background that blurs everything in a drab beige atmosphere especially when the director decides to shoot long bits of ""action"" in the dark! Even that cool trailer shot looks totally different in the finished movie, it was so dark I could barely tell what was going on (and that was on an IMAX screen!!!).I'm being very critical because there is a lot to like and a lot of missed opportunities here. Villeneuve can criticize MARVEL as much as he wants, he could learn a little from them about characters development, movie editing and pure action.",Dune

I was a little confused as to what was going on in the beginning, but eventually the movie took hold and drew me in. The special effects and cinematography were great, the acting was great, and the ending left me wanting Part 2 real bad. I wound up watching the 1984 version right after, and the original wound up filling in a TON of holes and really helped me understand what was going on sand what I was missing from the 2021 version. They definitely should have done that for the 2021 version, and they also left out quite a bit what the spice was actually used for and what its effects on people were.

The visuals were powerful, yet subtle as was the acting and the score. If the 1984 version of this film was the rough draft, then this was the finished product.Though Dune '21 contained a harvester full of acting talent, they all allowed themselves to be folded in the story and embraced Villeneuve's vision who in turn embraced Frank Herbert's.Timothee Chamalet did a masterful job of portraying the destiny-bound Paul Atriedes. I felt Paul's burden, his mystery, and his power. He was humble, thoughtful, and consumed with the welfare of those around him. Kyle MacLachlan's hamfisted performance doesn't hold a candle to Timothee's. I could say something just as positive about the entire cast. It was just so satisfying seeing their craft at work.Dune is an epic space fantasy, full of intrigue, exotic peoples, loss, and hope. If you want a mindless Michael Bay 'splosion-fest, this ain't it. However, if you want to get wrapped up in a tale about the universe on the brink, a mysterious people, and a young man trying to make sense of his destiny - then this is a must-see.",Dune

Couldn't make head or tail of the story and was annoyed by the voice overs (which by the way, I understand is in the book), however, very impressed by the style of the movie. And after spending a last half decade watching Disney do the expermient on how not to make a world building sci fi movie, world building sci fi movies needed a reboot.Villenueve is probably my most top director, especially impressed by 'Sicario', thought he did a 'Blade Runner' that surpassed Scott's but ironically, the much mentioned 'Arrival' was my least favourite. And after watching Villenueve recount Dune as one of his most inspirational books, and his passion for getting the story right for cinema, I have been in anticipation. Along with Timothee Charlemet, which I think is one of the strongest actors of his generation, and my favourites of my generation, Isaac and Brolin, I was in for a treat.And I wasn't dissapointment, barely noticed the two and half hours or so go past. I did do my background research by watching the Dune fandom channels since I can't remember what went on in 1984 version (apart from the sand worms), but sometimes I think, it may have been even even more enjoyable if I didn't do the research because I would be bombarded by a new sci fi world.",Dune

It is an awesome and fun feeling.I cannot say everyone in the limited seating theater was as satisfied, but I left feeling like I had been traveling in Pauls footsteps and I felt like I was in the Dune bubble walking to my car.For some, Dune: Part One (2021) may have seemed slow, not me: I am happy that it closely and correctly followed Pauls and the Atreides family story.

This is a HARD book to translate to film, right up there with LOTR. Villenueve has done a creditable job, hence my 8/10.There are inevitable flaws, but the flaws are forgiveable because they are neccessary to impart information that those who may not have read the book need. This is a hard book to film, because of the density of the universe it takes place in.

A powerfully impactful score from the legendary Hans Zimmer, a talented cast natural and subtle in its diversity, sets and locations from Villeneuve reminiscent of 2049's sweeping beauty and simplicity, seamless FX and a minimalist script that maximizes imagination all contribute to what could be the beginning of a new modern epic series. It was both a relief and a joy to see on a big screen. I will be looking forward to what comes next. And, I'm grateful that the in an age of soul crushing and simplistic creative misfires filled with predictable clap traps, expansive, immersive and transformative art with the power to surprise can still be made.

1303,maximumcool,As good as we're ever going to see,10,20 October 2021,"I enjoyed Dune. I'll say this: I think it's as good as you can do while following the novel. The novel has SOME elements that translate well into a movie, which is why people keep trying to make movie/tv series of it, and it's a great story, but it also has a LOT of stuff that doesn't make for a very interesting movie. So I think this version of it is as good as a movie could do of Dune without starting to make serious changes from the source material.Of course, it's not for everyone. What piece of art is? I'd like the movie critics who give it a bad score to explain what THEY would do that would make the movie better and I guarantee that whatever changes they make would disappoint more people than they would please. So... go see it if you want to see a good movie adaption of Dune. If that doesn't really interest, then don't go see it!",Dune

(it is not yet known what he is chosen for)The protagonist kills a member of the tribe to be accepted by them and the film ends.Super overrated first part, and reminiscent of Avatar but much less visually impacting, it is only a desert and very large spaceships.The movie takes 2 hours for the first act to set up everything, but ends just as the movie is about to take off to the second act, leaving you with the feeling that you have been cheated. As in ""that's it? Now i'm supposed to pay for another movie ticket?""I can't remember anyone's names, not even the protagonist, can't even remember the name of the planet. I was expecting to see Zendaya but when she only appears for 5 minutes at the end of the movie and some flashbacks (dreams of the protagonist).Overall i went with high expectations, because the reviews were high, the cast was solid, but ultimately feel let down. Feel like only fans of this book love this movie. I personally haven't read the book, but as a casual viewer i can tell you that i'm not really excited to see part 2.

1309,jadg1972-572-580264,Burdened by big budget,5,22 October 2021,"Any fan of the GoT HBO series would agree that what made the first 4 seasons work was that, due to the constraints of a lesser budget (than latter seasons), it was up to the characters development and the dialogue to carry itself up from a Lord of the Rings-style swords and sorcery knock-off, to the multi-layered political intrigue laden masterpiece it became (until the last 2 seasons 😒). By giving Villeneuve a blank check, I feel, he was crushed under the weight of the world he was building. I've never read Dune, but I have seen both the Lynch version and the 90's sci-fi channel mini series, and I was struck by how little it deviates from either, especially the Lynch version. I had hoped to be introduced to an entirely new take on Dune. Think - True Grit w/ Jeff Bridges vs. True Grit w/John Wayne. Yes they both tell the same story but how many single scenes were duplicated by the former from the latter? Few to none I say. This alas is not the case for Villeneuve's remake. Other than the very last act, after Paul & Jessica have escaped the Harkonan attack, it was all too familiar... but with less exposition and almost no context. Sure it looks amazing but at what cost?",Dune

1312,vicrknudsen,CINEMA IS BACK!!!!,10,18 September 2021,"It has been one year and eight months (approx.) since the world went into lockdown and cinemas closed, and studios postponed hundred of releases. During this pandemic, there have been ups and downs concerning the reopening of cinema, and with a little luck, some movies had a limited run in some theaters last year, moreover, some films going directly to streaming services. Now, the situation in Denmark has been very different compared to other nations, but luckily our theaters opened for good in May 2021, the films began coming back. Though I really liked movies such as ""The Green Knight"" which I saw in the cinema, there hasn't been one film in a long time when I have thought: this is a masterpiece; this is cinema. Until now.""Dune"" is a masterpiece. It is first-class movie making and one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had. Not only did Villeneuve manage to adapt a story into a film that is supposedly impossible to make, but he also did it with excellence. ""Dune"" is an epic in every way. Its grand production design and world-building take ones' breath away from the first glimpse of the desolated planet. The visual effects are jarring and completely emerge into the real set pieces to make a realistic depiction of a future world. Costumes and make-up are creatively put together and adapts an impossible atmosphere to the story. ""Dune"" is just a stunning-looking film.Villeneuve's masterful direction is one thing. Another this that is as good, and maybe probably is my favorite part of the film is Hans Zimmer's score. Though Zimmer's career, he has made iconic scores to numerous huge and influential films. Music that can stay in your mind for days, and you can listen to and feel you're in the world. What Zimmer did with his score for ""Dune"" is simply out of this world. It's instrumental with choir and big ass drums and horns that will blow you up from your seat. The atmosphere he creates is unbelievable and never gets boring or in the way of the story. Zimmer uses tricks to mix sounds into the score, so it feels supernatural to see the big actions scenes and not think ""Hmm that's a good score,"" because you don't notice it because it's so deep down part of this film. He will and surely deserves to win an Oscar for his work here. It's just been released on Spotify and other streaming services so if you can't wait, go listen to it.Villeneuve has before taken up almost impossible projects and made them work. His vision for ""Dune"" is so compact and tolerable that I couldn't see anyone else's creativity affect ""Dune."" Every aspect he put in play with the characters and the way he wants to move the camera is incredible. His direction is first-class movie making and quite possibly his best work next to ""Arrival."" It feels grand and epic in the same tone as ""The Lord of the Rings"" feels humongous in its character gallery and universe.The story is rich in characters, and all the actors do an equally great job embodying each person. Timotée Chalamet, as the lead, Paul, does an amazing job portraying this ambiguous hero. Though his character for some part of the film is mostly held back because of his father (Oscar Isaac), Paul learns much about leadership and why the planet of Arrakis feels familiar to him. Isaac is a scene-stealer every time he's on screen. He's such a likable character that easily could have been a clichétic menacing-king with his only desire to rule and gain power. His performance is beyond what I expected; he's terrific.Rebecca Ferguson also gets better and better in every single film she does. I loved her in ""Doctor Sleep,"" and in ""Dune"" she shows a more quiet and subtle yet powerful performance. The rest of the cast is bloody amazing. Everybody could be a stand-out alone, and reminds me a lot of the character depth there is in each of the fellowship members in ""The Lord of the Rings.""Was I excited for ""Dune?"" Absolutely! I can't wait to buy it on Blu-ray and dive into the story again. My girlfriend, who loves epic sci-fi/adventures told me that it has probably become one of her favorite films. Though it doesn't fall into my top 50, I can't do anything but give it a top score. What ""Dune"" manages to do cannot be seen through. And I have missed it. I have missed it so damn much to feel engaged and to be fed with a story with so much flesh on. To relive the old days of cinema and to look forward to a new and exciting adventure. I'll be seeing ""Dune"" again sometime next week. Hopefully, a second movie will come because this IS only part one. Don't expect to be fully satisfied. This is only the beginning.",Dune
1313,kgreene-955-929538,Not a noteworthy effort,4,27 October 2021,"A disappointment, I'm sure, for those who are devotees of Herbert's novel. The storyline and script left little for the actors to do except stare wistfully or transfixed into the distance. Well, then there was sword play, as if this were an Arthurian drama. Trope followed trope.The most disappointing thing, as I saw it, was the sense that this world and time was not all that different than ours today. With luck, they'll have Starbucks in their caves.I will pass on any Dune, Part II.",Dune
1314,alex-322029310,"Visually decent, but something is missing",8,27 September 2021,"I have long waited to see this new attempt at turning Herbert's book into a movie. The ingredients sounded promising (Villeneue, Zimmer, cast, ...) as well as the praise the movie has received so far.Trying to immerse myself into the universe the film constructs, or better, translates from the book, I need to say for me there is something missing. I've seen Lynch's adaptation, have read the book, and played the Dune games (esp. Dune 2) day and night in my teenage days. Maybe it is because of this background, that I felt empty during most of the runtime of the movie. The book is difficult to translate to the screen, depicting not only the political conflicts, but also the inner conflicts and motivations of its protagonists vividly.The movie tries not to deviate too much from the book's storyline, which I have to give Villeneuve credit for. But in contrast to Blade Runner 2049, the movie runs quite flat on the emotional side. But as said, maybe because I already know what happens next, and have already immersed myself into the imaginative Dune universe countless times, I felt like I was in a half-dreaming state phantasizing these visuals, but not actually watching a captivating story.There is little dialogue and another point of critique is Zimmer's work in this. Someone here wrote that he considers the Dune soundtrack Zimmer's magnum opus, but to me this was Interstellar (2014). The score in Blade Runner 2049 was already quite minimalistic, but I credit Zimmer for at least using the CS80 like Vangelis did, thereby finding the right sounds for the futuristic setting. But here, in Dune, there is even more absence of any theme/leitmotifs, it's just a combination of a few chords and drones which sometime do not match the film's flow, with some occasional ethnic vocals which are absolutely over the top. It feels like Zimmer tried hard to find the right music for this movie, but in the end, delivered something absolutely generic that a young aspiring composer would probably be ashamed of.Nevertheless I think I can recommend watching the movie, especially for people who have not read the book. I hope Villeneuve will be able to deliver the second (and third?) part, because probably it will turn out that the movie was deliberately filmed in the style of a two hour long prologue.Just do not expect too much; I think the praise that the movie has received on its own is a bit too much for the actual product, but in the end, let's see where this franchise goes, probably this Dune will be the perfect movie if seen as a part of a trilogy.",Dune

A lot of the acting was poor even by some of the well known actors I really like, but I have to acknowledge they only go off what they are given! There is just no emotion and feels like they are reading off script. The visuals are good, obviously using modern day technology the worms look realistic and more threatening. David Bautista character is very bland which is a shame as I like him in other roles.The reason for the 2 stars is we have come along way since the original (37 years..) and this is not an improvement. It seems to have gone backwards and is now bloated being split in to 2 parts.

This adaptation is less white-driven with improved visuals.The Dune follows the fall, rise and eventual assimilation of House Atreides with Bene Gesserit and enemies. Not that any movie has succeeded to get past the first three books. This movie covers the first book out of six originals, which are then followed by over twenty other books.This part follows the wonder boy messiah, where the good are very decent and the bad, well, they are physically ugly and violent just like orcs. This black and white chessboard maybe appeal to some.Villeneuve's version is strangely quiet that is almost sterile.

Cinematic yes, but not cinematic enough.The sound design and the music/score can be annoying and way too loud sometimes and even overlapping with the character's lines.Performances:Timothée chalamet is not a bad actor but these kinds of films are certainly not for him. He is not charismatic enough. His acting overall was below average here. He looked like he was about to fall asleep in every close shot.Rebecca ferguson was really good.

I like how this movie is divided into two parts since there is a lot to cover in Dune. Despite that, this is still a water-down version, such as the omission of Sting, who is an important character later on in the story. The pacing is off at times, and I thought it focused a little too heavily on Paul's dreams. It is for sure one of those movies that is best enjoyed on the big screen.

But that's where the positives end for me.Lynch's film is also flawed as using inner thought monologues was kind of a lazy way to adapt a book. But those monologues gave key context to the story whereas Villeneuve's film provides little context and would be incredibly infuriating to anyone going into this film blind. If you are really familiar with the lore of Dune this may have been the film you were looking for, but for me this was at best ""ok"". Nearly all of the characters were fully developed in the Lynch film, whereas this one only Paul and Jessica get any sort of character development. The Baron in particular is way less threatening in this new adaptation which was the most disappointing part for me. The extra length doesn't add anything you can't get out of the Lynch film and even comparing the portion of the story that both films cover, Lynch told more in significantly less time.This was not horrible and I didn't sit in the theatre being completely miserable but that's the best compliment I can give to it.",Dune

Enjoying the slow, blunt shots, we hear the extremely killmatic music of Hans Zimmer, which perfectly fits into the mysterious and dark world.The very story of Paul Atryda (Timothée Chalamet) causes great admiration. We observe a young man, heir to the throne of the Atreides family. He has to overcome his fear to become what he should be.Villeneuve perfectly shows the way of this character. In addition, it creates interesting supporting characters, thanks to which we understand the main protagonist's motivation even more. Actors impersonating villains deserve special attention. Stellan Skarsgãrd and Dave Bautista are impressive in terms of facial expressions and body language. The entire cast performs decently, but not outstandingly. This is the result of the director's choices, who focuses mainly on showing beautiful landscapes, so sometimes he does not let these talented actors show off.Another small problem is the screenplay. Especially the ending lacks a strong punch line of this amazing story.To sum up, Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"", despite its small problems, is not only one of the director's best films, but also one of the most important works of cinematography in the 21st century.",Dune

We got a movie shot in dark plain surroundings, good actors with no room to act and no reasonable dialogue to master. Add a lot of illogical flying machinery maneuvering in slow-motion to make them look bigger, or the most stupid substitute to a helicopter I've ever seen; and a plot that almost never make sense. Picture all this in a movie where the soundtrack consist of eight beats constantly repeating in an endless chase of emphasizing a crescendo that never came.",Dune

It is visually perfect, storytelling is exactly how I would expect it, music is breathtaking and it has solid acting ensemble. Everyone should realize how complex the original story is and we have been served just beginning of it. Remember, how it felt when Fellowship of The Ring happened. This is such a fresh feeling after that flood of never-ending comic story repeating cinematographic pollution which is probably the reason why everybody is complaining that this is slow story build up. People stop to be used to deep stories and stopped to be patient. I want more movies like this and I can't wait for other chapters. Dennis Villeneuve and his team did a great job!",Dune
1346,ANannyMoose02,Another Offensive Remake,1,24 October 2021,Hollywood hasn't had an original idea in over 30 years and here's even more proof of that. Dune 2021 should NOT be aloud to be aired or sold to the general public. It is yet another offensive remake that destroys the reputation of the original. All remakes are a complete and utter insult to the original. Dune is certainly one of the worst of the worst.,Dune

DUNE is an excellent movie which I highly enjoyed from beginning to end. The story is well written and makes sense. The acting is perfection.

This movie is really and truly a visual FEAST. Its like art in motion. Hans Zimmer is behind the soundtrack and this comes as no surprise. Well done. I loved the culture of this film. Im new to Dune and I have never seen the original because I have been a star wars fan for so long. This is probably the best movie I've seen for this year. My eyes stayed glued to the screen the entire time. I have to take off a point because as a new watcher, in some parts of the movie, I didnt understand some things like background points even though there were some attempts to explain them. And the superstar cast was pretty distracting too but it didnt stop the movie from being a must watch. I was surprised and impressed and ultimately in love with this movie.

1350,iuliaradu-86508,THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,3 November 2021,"I don't know how to say this, I don't know how to sart this review...I was in the theatre, I was looking at the screen, I was afraid to blink. I forgot about everything, I was completely emerst in this movie. And then it finished, and I got up and left the theatre, and on the car ride home my dad asked me if I thought it was a good adaptation, and I rememberd: yes, this was suposed to be an adaptation.This film managed to made me forget that it was suposwd to be an adaptation, it made me forget that I was suposed to be in the real world, it brought me to another place and time, it made me feel like few other movies have done before (in case your interested, those are : The Grand Budapest Hotel, Arrival, Nomadland, The Lotr series and the Harry Potter series); that feeling, I can not explain, but I can say this : I FELL IN LOVE !!!!This adaptation managed to go leegs beyond it's sourse material,was of such grandiose scale that it made the cultural phenomenon of a book that it was based on feel like a cheap nuvela you would buy at the newspaper stand (and I'm not just saying that). This IS the new Lord of the Rings, this IS the new Star Wars ( well technicly, Star Wars was the new Dune, but still) this movie IS the future of film-making and this movie IS one of the greatest movie OF ALL TIME !",Dune
1351,Mex5150,Not as bad as I feared it would be.,4,27 October 2021,"I'll open by saying I am not a fan of Villeneuve. In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OKIt got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.The wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.The casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.Anyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.The film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.The film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.The acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.I was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.Over all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though.",Dune
1352,rtsdynamite,Mind Blown... For the Wrong Reasons,5,7 November 2021,"Having not read any of the books and having not seen any of the previous films, my expectations were left to wander as i entered the Dune universe. To put it simply, i was not impressed.Im not quite sure what it is with Denis Villeneuve but the only other film of his that i have seen is Blade Runner 2049, which i stopped watching after an hour. I did the same thing with Dune but this time i came back to it as it is still a hot topic. Both films spend a full hour creating a setting that swallows the character, makes them appear and feel small but by doing this creates a partial disconnect between character and audience. Im not sure if this is a personal view but i just feel as if the characters lack development and size, they just feel as if they have little value compared to the environment. I struggle to enjoy the characters, especially the lead roles, they have no likeable aspects.The film struggled to hook me. The first hour had me bored beyond belief before the second half of the movie decided to draw a string of action sequences which had little to no effect on our main protagonists. And to be quite honest, my brain began to fry as i couldn't understand the direction in which the movie was heading. I seriously didnt know what the plot was. The plot's backbone is that our main protagonist has to find his 'destiny'. Seriously? C'mon. I didnt understand the visions and why we, the audience were allowed access to them. Some of the visions became reality, while others didnt. I dont know why some of the visions never became reality, whether our protagonist did something which metaphorically altered the future, i just do not understand. I also do not understand the protagonist's power what even is it? There is no explanation in the film, or atleast if there was it didnt make sense to me, probably because i havent read the books. Which in my defense, its not supposed fo be mandatory.So why do people rate Dune 2021? Was the stunning cinematic experience enough? Or was it because Zendaya was in it? To be fair the actors do a good enough job and i cannot fault any of them. Even the CGI team deserve a heap of credit as i cannot deny the sheer beauty that the movie has to offer. There is just no direction in the first hour of the movie and in the second half there arent even many pivotal plot points, the action sequences almost feel squeezed out of the movie. The characters for me arent likeable enough to be the backbone of the plot, Paul Atreided in Dune 2021 is no Luke Skywalker in A New Hope and the general direction of the movie is based off where he goes, rather than the opposite way around.I cannot rate this movie any higher than a 5 because what happens in the movie could have been done in 30 minutes, half of the scenes are not needed and made this a painful viewing for me.",Dune

The miniseries goes into great detail of the politics between the royal houses, which is my problem with the new film. The Harkonnen, the antagonists, have little screen time and Feyd is not introduced. They are described as an empire of evil, but not shown why. The Corrino family is again not introduced, but just that there is an Emperor who ordered the Atreides to take control of Arakis. Even Princess Irulan who Paul will have a platonic-political marriage is not introduced. The Spacing Guild, the critical reason why the spice must flow - again not shown nor is it mentioned that without Melange (spice) there is no guild, no space travel, and that the entire empire would collapse. So although it was a good introduction to Arakis and it looked marvelous, there was a lot of substance that was omitted.",Dune

1357,njdaymond89,Dune without the soul...,5,19 October 2021,"I've read the books, I've seen the '84 film and 2000/2003 mini-series.Problems with Dune 2021;
~ Bland colour palette, all grey, even the Atreides homeworld (which should be luscious green), all the ships friendly and enemy alike, all the uniforms and so on. Everything.~ Many scenes far, far too dark
~ Zendaya as Chani is a miscast
~ Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica reduced to near constant crying and whispering
~ Fight scenes are cut to heck, with inconsistencies in how the personal shields work and direct blows blocked from view by camera position/actor (keeping the film a lower age rating?)
~ We never meet the emperor, nor his daughter, who played HUGE rolls
~ Missing House Corrino, the third powerful House
~ We could have at least seen the main ship travel to Dune, if we're not to see the navigators yet
~ Design of the main settlement and palace is... odd
~ Character development very poor, struggle to connect to any one of them
~ Very long, with poor pacing in parts
~ No real backstory for any context - we know nothing of the political situation or history of the Houses, nor how spice has influenced the Galaxy
~ A major character shouldn't have survived toxic gas, he was too close and that's not how shields work
~ Far too many slow-motion shots
~ Almost every scene with Zandaya looked like her modelling poses for her fashion line/any generic perfume advert which was off putting
~ Score by Hans Zimmer was underwhelming to say the least, and didn't match on screen elements
~ WHERE ARE THE BLUE EYES? Muted blue, more grey. Digital filter apparently, the originals SHONE, in some ethereal type way
~ It feels like director Denis copied much of the original scene for scene, adding nothing but modern filming techniques and CGI whilst removing the heart and soul of the entire Dune saga.~ I don't **think** anybody said 'The Spice Must Flow'. If so, I missed it, and it was said but once. In a 2 1/2 hour movie about Dune. Really?~ An all star cast detracts from the film - you see each star in their hit films/franchises. Gurney and Duncan absolutely did not reflect their written characters.~ It ends at a terrible, terrible point in the story, barely through the first book. A prelude for Dune: Part 2, which will only be made if Part 1 is a commercial success. Silly.The old movie was flawed in so many ways, but was entirely memorable and well developed despite it's lore breaking ending. The TV mini-series did it as brilliantly as possible overall, especially Children of Dune with James McAvoy.If Part 2 is made, and I hope it will be out of curiosity, I'll be incredibly surprised if it improves upon itself but hope it does. I love Dune and want to see it succeed, including the planned TV series about the Bene Gesserit. But it needs to be more than 'watchable'. It needs a heart.Lastly, I think the movie-goer without Dune knowledge will be bewildered/confused/bored by Part 1. Case in point; when Jessica is talking about bloodlines and the response is about 'Men aren't as capable', half the screening gasped. They clearly didn't know the story and saw that one line as going against the woke ways of today. 'YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!' one person muttered. Others laughed. Others talked about it for the next minute. The world of today can't handle the raw Dune saga. Hell forbid they research how Baron Harkonnen ended up the way he is and the evil he does...",Dune
1358,erdprods,Still does not do the book justice,3,26 October 2021,"As a serious fan of the Dune Saga, I found this to be a wasteful, over-hyped extravaganza by a director trying to emulate C. B. DeMille's Ten Commandments with spectacle and hundreds of extras lining up for parade or battle, or trying to match Stanley Kubrick's grandeur with huge spaceships.If you've never read the book this is an okay desert movie. It's Lawrence of Arabia without Peter O'Toole. It's the Ten Commandments without Charlton Heston, Edward G. Robinson and Yul Brynner.How it differs from the book.While the book starts with the Reverend Mother coming into Paul's room and mentions to Jessica that he's awake and listening. When we finally get to see them, Paul is dragged to the Reverend Mother's feet by ""the voice"" but in the book he stands TOE TO TOE with her. There's the drama of the poison needle. This is in the first few pages of the book, but doesn't happen for minutes and minutes in the movie. When she finally asks him to sit at her feet like Paul's mother once did, Paul stands his ground and says that HE IS NOT HIS MOTHER.So, they give us, a wimpy Paul, not a strong Duke's son.The movie starts on Arrakis. With a voice over. One actor from the Lynch version once called starting with voice over as ""the kiss of death for a movie."" The book does not start this way. The book starts in Paul's bedroom. From there it goes to the Baron's homeworld where he talks of his plans to kill the Duke and make Lady Jessica look like the traitor with his Mentat and his nephew Feyd, WHO ISN'T IN THE MOVIE AT ALL. There is no Feyd in this part of Dune. Can you imagine taking a character OUT of the Lord of the Rings? How about taking a character out of A Christmas Carol? And Feyd is supposed to have a knife fight with Paul in Part Two (Sting played him rather nicely in the Lynch movie).What are we given instead? Paul having breakfast with his mother. Not in the book. Paul and his father get commands from the Emperor with huge space ship and spectacle. Not in the book.Paul's already watching film book stuff at the start of the film. In the book, Yueh doesn't give him that for quite some time. And no Orange Catholic Bible with Yueh's wife's favorite passage.Huge arrival on Arrakis. Not in the book. In the book the first time on Arrakis sees Lady Jessica talking with Gurney and the Shadout Mapes (house keeper)For filmmakers that claim they love the book, they don't seem to understand the book. And they leave so much of the real drama out in favor of pomp and circumstance, or having breakfast when they should have gotten into the meat of the book. The drama of the Reverend Mother's presence. The drama of the Baron's plans. The author of the book wanted us to know these things. This is the setup. Not done in the movie.The Bene Gesserit. The Baron and his plans. These things were at the start of the book and they are important for us to know, but were skimmed over well after breakfast, and meet & greet.There is little character development like in the book. Frank Herbert fleshes out everyone with great detail so we embrace all of them. In the movie they are matter of fact. And what we do learn is not in the book. Paul NEVER hugs. A Duke's son does NOT hug his teachers. Paul doesn't ask to go with Duncan to Arrakis in the book, like he asks TWICE in the movie.I'm not sure what book they were reading...I hated the Lynch version, although as a film it stands up better than this one with its Neo Steam Punk and Art Deco look. It was packed with a lot more stars who gave good performances. It was still far from the book.This one doesn't do any justice to the book and if they'd followed the plot of the book, they could have done this with a Roadshow film at three hours with an intermission instead of wasting time with breakfast chatter and meet and greets that aren't a part of the book's plot and drama.Writers are taught not to waste the readers time with filler, and there is so much filler in this movie instead of the actual plot, like the book, a Nebula and Huge winning novel, gave the reader.",Dune
1359,IanMWalker,Well done to all involved.,9,25 October 2021,"Excellent.As a friend said, they did miss out a few good things which were in the book but what they left in was very well done.The universe Frank Herbert crafted was vast and intricate. It must be difficult to condense this into a film. Perhaps a long series would have done it more justice. What we have, though, was close and very entertaining. I didn't think I would like my favourite character, Jessica as much as I did in the original film but Rebecca Ferguson did a terrific job. I look forward to seeing more of her.I read all of the books back when I was a teenager (16 of them) and they had a profound impact on me thanks to my love and fascination of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood (witches). The sixth book was all about them. It described that one of their main abilities was Minutiae Scrutinae. A training which allowed them to see every minute detail of their surroundings, a room or indeed of a person. They could see the slightest twitch or movement of a face and so became known as Truthsayers as they could see through lies. They observed everything.I used to read in the street whilst walking to and from work. I was in Brighton whilst reading this series. One day, nose firmly stuck in this book, I suddenly noticed, atop the door of a pub I had walked by hundreds of times, the statue of a knight. This large knight held a shield to its chest and a sword thrust over the door.My gast was well and truly flabbered. I had never noticed this statue. Here I was, reading about those who were trained to see all and I realised that, like most people, I was walking on auto pilot, with blinkers on.From that day on, I practiced and ensured that I would always be observant.So, Frank Herbert changed me.As a friend said, I too am now looking forward to the Director's Cut of this film (potentially six hours apparently) and very much to part two.Highly recommended.#Dune2021.",Dune

Yes I loved David Lynch's version, and could even found things I liked in the miniseries.

We have seen in the movie that guns, bombs and drones exist in this universe. Why swords then? Even Star Wars had laser swords. Half of this movie was just shots of the stupid helicopter. The technology that these people use is a confusing mix of analog and digital.And by the way, that stupid helicopter that they use produces a rhythmic noise that should summon the worms. Have you ever heard a helicopter in real life? They are much louder than a person making footsteps across the desert for sure.It seems the worms can rise out of the ground a couple of hundred meters and some of the helicopters were flying low. But alas, nothing very exciting will happen in this movie without the storyline jumping to one of the numerous other characters before anything meaningful happens.",Dune
1362,kikogod,Modern Sci-Fi Epic Masterpiece!,9,23 October 2021,"An absolute cinematic triumph. I don't have enough superlatives to describe Dune. I'm so glad I wasn't disappointed, but I even got more than I expected. I'm sorry if I doubted for a second that Villeneuve would not be able to complete this project! And as much as I'm happy, I hate it if the sequel (s) of the film fail to materialize, because it has the potential to become one of the greatest movie epics, alongside Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings.Visually, musically, sound - absolutely crushing. The incredible fantasy with which the world is built, with a mix of familiar and unknown, old and new, a kind of noir retro futurism that melt your brain. I don't even remember the last time I watched a sci-fi where I said to myself, ""wow, I really feel like I'm on another planet, in another world, in another time."" The mind-boggling architectures and scale of everything just take your breath away and you feel the cold breeze of every monument, every mountain of concrete and metal, radiating a kind of pervasive insecurity and awe. Which, in contrast, contrasts with the brutally scorching sands of the desert and the laws of nature and a spice before you are nobody and everyone is equal. And all this sealed with incredible cinematography and masterful directing. I can even go into the details of refining the world, how, for example, only through a different color scheme or architecture, or style, you immediately recognize where the action takes place, etc., but I don't think it makes sense.And despite its duration, and that it is full of slow and dramatic scenes, the film has a great pacing. I was only able to feel the length slightly towards the end. I know there is a hell of a lot of history and lore, but even for those unfamiliar with the book like me, the portions in which the story is served are very well distributed and you can follow them without straining. It is only a little difficult to remember all the crazy and strange names of the various peoples associated with their customs, gods, etc., but this is not a pain to die. The script is tight and mature, there is no unnecessary nonsense. It's just that the desire of Denny and everyone involved in the project to immerse us in this amazing world is evident in all aspects. Zimmer's music, though a little too bombastic, as it was in Tenet, was also a great mix of thunderous bass, oriental motifs, and heavy orchestration, building great tension at times.I don't think I have anything to say about the actors. Absolutely perfect. I especially want to distinguish Shalome, who was phenomenal. Just a real protagonist that you merge with, that you care about and is talented enough to carry almost the entire film on his back. My favorite Rebecca Ferguson, who to my surprise had a lot of screen time and who crushed the role of the mother. And Stellan Skarsgaard, in the role of one of the most horrible bad guys I've ever seen. Radiating both grotesque and awe and an absolute psychopath. In general, the design and atmosphere in the scenes with Harkonen were chilling. Both Oscar Isaac and Momoa were great also, Batista was funny and menacing too, although he had surprisingly little screen time. (edited)I don't think there is anything more to add. Even as negatives, I can only point out the fact that in reality the film is the first part of something whole and feels as such. It literally ends like a series. And maybe some slightly long scenes or ones that were weirdly dramatic, while nothing important, actually happens, but that's nothing compared to everything else. It's just that these people managed to immerse me in a world that, despite all the things I've seen, I managed to feel like new and unseen. I was glued to the screen and what was happening, and on several occasions I had to lift my jaw from the ground. I immersed myself completely and begged everyone to go and watch this movie at the cinema to justify making a second part. Let's show them that we care about similar, original and author films, which can also be made on a large budget.Rating: 9/10.",Dune
1363,kroolshooz,"A good adaptation, given the limitations of the medium.",8,27 October 2021,"I've been waiting for a good adaptation of Dune since I was about 13, and I have to say I'm mostly pleased with this one. Fans of the novel will notice how much is cut out, which is unavoidable. All the inner workings of the character's minds that form the backbone of the novel can only be hinted at in a movie. This is a shame, because no movie-goer will ever really appreciate things like the Bene Gesserit without the glorious opportunity to experience the detailed perceptions of minutiae going on inside Lady Jessica's head. However, given the limitations of the medium, the movie is largely faithful to canon and captures the feel of the setting, events, and characters enough to please this lifetime fan. I do have three quibbles however.First, there is a LOT of whispering. Even with the earth-shattering theater sound system there were times when all I could understand of the dialogue were the S's. This was especially the case with Lady Jessica, who for the most part was unintelligible to me throughout.Second, flash-forwards and flashbacks are a pet peeve of mine, and they are used WAY too often here. I understand the need to show Paul's ""abilities,"" but enough's enough. Every time it happens, the main narrative is interrupted. And I found this annoying after a while. And then VERY annoying after another while. Please rein it in for Chapter Two, Denis.Third, the compressed time frame creates a plot inconsistency. (Or possibly reveals one that was in the novel all along but less obvious thanks to all the intervening intrigue.) In the book, a lot happens before things start blowing up. In the movie, things go boom so soon after arrival on Arrakis that it leads me to a question I never thought to ask when reading the book: Why Arrakis? If the whole big plan all along was just to rain hell on the good guys, why go through this whole baroque plot of luring them to Arrakis? Seems like that could have been done anywhere, starting in Scene I, and saved everyone a lot of trouble and moving expense.Anyway, all that aside, the movie was immersive, the faithfulness to canon was appreciated, the action and spectacle were awesome...after waiting basically a lifetime, I can finally say that I'm happy with a Dune movie.",Dune

This movie is film, a true motion picture, the epitome of art on the screen, what your friend in the coffee shop refers to as ""Cinema"".For real though, I have no complaints for Dune. If you are a fan of the book, you will be very happy with the work Denis Villeneuve did. It's incredibly accurate to the source material for the most part, with a few scenes removed and lots of dialogue pulled straight from the book. I hope an extended edition comes out one day on Blu Ray to show some of the cut material from the book that was rumored to be removed.For those that haven't read the book, it's an immersive experience that is really only half the story. I wouldn't go in expecting tons of action and humor, but an epic world and the beginning of a hero's journey. With that being said, there is some action, but this movie is a slow burn as a setup for the second part that will come out with the true payoff. Think of it as the Fellowship of the Ring and how that left you feeling at the end for the first time.I suspect this movie to do really well come award season with some Oscar nomination locks for: Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, and Best Makeup. Also, it very well could get nominated for Best Directing, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Rebecca Ferguson as Best Supporting Actress.",Dune
1366,krs_is_cool,A masterpiece,10,23 October 2021,"The only flaw I found in this film was the shot of Paul (the same as in the trailer) as he opens his visor in the battle sequence. I felt it looked a little fake and for that second took me out of the film, as such maybe a score of 9.99999.However, for the rest of the film I was completely enthralled. Comparisons to LOTR are justified in that it's slow, and allows time for world building, and when there is action it's brilliant. From what I can tell, people who didn't enjoy this as much are those who expected something closer to Star Wars with more action.All I can say is, this isn't Star Wars, and it isn't LOTR. It's Dune. Roll on Part 2.",Dune
1367,raveon6969,Uneventful,6,8 November 2021,"Somewhat disappointed... (spoiler alert) it's so easy to forget and annoyingly they abruptly stop the story right smack in the middle. What the heck is that? Visually stunning but that was it for the outdoor panoramas. Frankly I think their choice for Paul and Chani was wrong . Way to young for the role but it seems that the studio is pandering to the younger generation, although I doubt the younger generation will remember this movie by December the way we remember the 1984 version years later. The score is boring however they did nod to the old score a couple of times...that was cool. One thing I really disliked was the adaptation of the book to script. They made the language extremely ""basic"" like watching a modern over the top action film. Perhaps they simplified the language for the modern audiences, it makes it rather boring.The sets are rather plain, lazily designed.Overall it's definitely a tv movie. Save your money.",Dune

I was worried it would feel too CGI or soundstage, but that wasn't a problem.This was such a cool story and the moments where Paul realizes his capabilities give me goosebumps every time. It's just so cool to watch the story unravel AS Paul is discovering and understanding things.My only problem was the sound. I first watched it in theaters and I think my theaters speakers may have had issues, but the music and sounds hugely drowned out a lot of the dialogue. Next I watched it on HBO and even then needed to put subtitles on to catch some of the scenes where they're whispering or talking quietly. A little refinement in that blend would be appreciated for the next one. Otherwise, I'm a very big fan of Denis adaption so far.",Dune

First is ""Book Bias"". For some reason everybody assumes that I already read the book, which I did not. Did the creators make a proper introduction? Nope. Actually best parts about the world of Dune, you can only get from the book. This film totally lost the ""gaining attention"" part. I am not interested. Some people go to some planet, who cares?Compared to David Lynch's, where we got much more cleaner vision of the world and characters, Villeneuve decided go with creating action-like arcade movie. But the book is not consisting entirely of ""ships go boom"" and gut-cutting experience. So basically, importand parts of book went out, and was replaced by ""flashy-crashy arcade"" view.Can I recommend it to fans of the book? Yes, if they like to see another arcade visualization. But if they look for accurate depiction, just go to Lynch's and Jodorowsky's Dune. As it often happens, the best choice is the old.",Dune

I have not seen this mentioned in any advertisements or other reviews. #2. The film does not flow. If I had not read the novel and seen the early movie version, I would find it difficult to understand the flow of the story. It hops, skips, and jumps, leaving out important sequencing. In all other ways this movie version is a vast improvement in storytelling. Better cast. Better CGI. Interesting music. Still, though, far from perfect.",Dune

1377,MateoMijo,Technically its a wonderful spectacle but the characters lack development,6,8 November 2021,"It has to be said that technically it does hits the beats which it needs to. I mean, the director of photography does a remarkable job at developing the film's authentic visual style as well as the visual iconography being super solid throughout the film.Dune 2021 is so commendable for even the fact that its commitment to the source material and establishing of the world is established incredibly well. In a grandeur viewing cinematic experience, I can imagine that the film is even more of a highlight and an incredibly immersive moment altogether.Hans Zimmer's contribution to this film goes without saying is one of its peak highlights, the score is incredibly immersive and enigmatic, it is truly impressionable and immersive from the beginning.On the contrary to its strong points, I do think that the characters lack grandeur, development and personally I wasn't enthralled by any of them or felt attached to them emotionally in any way. Oscar Isaac gave a great performance, whilst Jason Momoa felt like an unnecessary addition to the cast, whereby there was zero uniqueness to his character and role in the film.Altogether what it lacks in some latter departments, it makes up for technically in others as a strong suit. I also appreciate the social political subtexts of the narrative, when it explores themes of imperialism and opiums (similar to Star Wars), with these tyranny groups being obsessed with the idea of obtaining and taking over resources, ultimately leading to their demise.",Dune

Also, this movie has some of the most misguided casting I've ever witnessed in a film. I won't even try to compare this empty vessel to David Lynch's adaptation , why? Because there IS no comparison. Dune, released in 1984 is a visual extravaganza, both strange and beautiful, that from the very first moment has the audience on the edge of their seats, whose characters absolutely ooze gravitas. The audiences, as they left cinemas around the world, felt totally blown away, almost as though they had inhabited a wonderfully weird reality for a short time, one that left them with a true understanding of Frank Herbert's universe even if they had not read the novels.Seriously, where is the love for the material? Because I certainly don't see it here.In closing, I'm starting to have serious concerns about the state of Hollywood creativity and if we don't start pulling our socks up soon all we'll be left with is a mountain-high pile of grey, soulless rubbish not worth the cost of even one ticket.",Dune

Although, a person who has never even heard of this story needs to learn/read/research about at least the basic/main idea about it. Specifically about the characters and their backstories.

This is not a bad movie. You should watch it. Now the other side of the coin:
This is a Part 1 movie and it is 2 1/2 hours long. It ends basically at the time he is supposed to meet Chani, but with much less acting and much more needless plot.When making a movie called Dune from the same text as the 1984 version, comparisons are going to happen.There are only 3 compelling characters in this Part 1: Duke Leto, Duncan Idaho, and Paul in the second act. The 1984 version of Dune was a powerhouse of casting. Go watch it again.The storyline is pretty on point, but for only being a Part 1, it is ramrodded through. I found myself doing the thought voices from the 1984 version.The Special effect are pretty good, less science fiction and more practical dynamics.The soundtrack is good, but people don't go to a movie for the soundtrack on a 2 1/2 hour movie.This is a far better movie than the Sci-Fi attempts of the early 2000's. Those were trash even as I own them.In short (or long if you will), go watch the 1984 version, then the Sci-Fi versions, then this to clean your pallets from that garbage. Then buy the 1984 version and embrace it's awesomeness. I can only imagine that Part 2 is going to be 2 1/2 hours long as well.

The first mistake for me is the casting which seems to be based on who has starred in the most successful blockbusters. Lets take him from Guardians of the Galaxy, her from Mission Impossible, him from the Justice League, instead of picking the most suitable actor. Timothée Chalamet though sums up this best because he is just boring, weak and unimpressive. The story arc itself is almost identical to the original film which makes the comparison constant through out the film and does the remake no favours.

Really?Errmm, both are based on a book. Called Dune. Not written by Lynch.A book with a notoriously complex plotline, considered hard to film.Lynch tried to, in 2h17m.Villeneuve tells about half of it, in a longer run time.Guess which one makes sense ?CGI notwithstanding, Villeneuve's casting is better.Lynch was ridiculed for casting his muse, MacLachlan, in the role pf a boy.Sting popped up, inexplicably.To be fair, Lynch had an epic task, and isn't known for straightforward storytelling, which is what this sweeping saga needs.Most of what Villeneuve portrays works.Knocked off a couple of points for the soundtrack, which is just too bombastic.As a result, dramatic scenes have no greater impact, lost as they are in the cacophony. Zimmer is better understated form.Regardsless, enjoyed this adaptation of one of my favourite novels. I am sure the second part will be more of the same.",Dune

Also the intensity in the acting seems totally misplaced at times which is not the actors' fault but more the directions they were given. Finally, while it has the visual identity of Denis Villeneuve, it is a bit lack luster (especially knowing his work on Blade Runner 2049): the different Houses are not as defined as they could be, the Baron not as threatening as he should be, and the scifi-tech element lacks coherence at times.

1394,parksiet,A true cinematic experience; massive and epic in scale,10,24 October 2021,"Dune is a cinematic experience unlike anything I've ever seen. It's truly a perfect movie, and easily Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece. It's a stunning achievement, a modern art blockbuster, and left me stunned in silence and awe when it ended. I grinned the whole way through and wanted to give the movie a standing ovation after! It completely shattered all my expectations, and I was already very excited for this! I LOVED it, it's easily one of the coolest things I've ever seen, and one of my favourite experiences I've ever had watching a movie! It's a perfect translation of the book, and handles the complex lore so well! Villeneuve and his screenwriters clearly understand and adore the source material, they found a way to recreate scenes exactly how the book describes them! It was surprising how well scenes seemed to play exactly how I imagined they would! The movie handles the world building and exposition stunningly well, and I loved that the script didn't dumb down the story and maintains the intelligence of the novel, blending the themes of religion, politics, power, nobility, betrayal and ecology in such impressive ways. I'm so happy someone found a way to finally successfully translate this complex story to the screen after Hollywood's many failed attempts. I never thought it could be done with this much perfection and majesty. The story is very dense and has a lot of moving pieces, but I like that the film doesn't spoon feed it to the audience and lets us interpret many elements for ourselves. It trusts us to follow along with the story, although I do wonder how hard it would be to follow without a pre-existing understanding of the novel. The plot is gripping and moves really fast, especially once you let yourself just be absorbed into the atmosphere of the film. The characters are all so rich and unique, and the cast is freaking incredible. Everyone brings their A-game, especially the brooding Timothee Chalamet, who until now I haven't really been a fan of. He is perfect as Paul, he really becomes the character, and he delivers a masterful performance with such a range of emotions and subtleties. I also thought Rebecca Ferguson was the best she's been in years! But the true star of this movie is truly Denis Villeneuve. He masterfully directs this film, ensuring every element is crafted to its highest potential. The film is hypnotic, atmospheric and visceral, massive and epic in scale and has excellent world building and production design. What I also love is that while Villeneuve embraces such a massive scope, he never sacrifices character to do so, as this is a very character and relationship driven film. But wow, is it ever an incredibly cinematic film. It feels like an old-school Hollywood epic like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and much like that film it is an ode to the desert. Like that film, the cinematography in this movie is beyond beautiful. It's gorgeous to look at and frames scenes in such creative, perfect ways. It just jaw droopingly good, the movie is worth seeing for the visual experience alone, its a feast for the eyes. The lighting is also really well done, and helps to make the CGI look as good as it can! Villeneuve also cleverly grounds the CGI by shooting as much practically and in camera as he can. And it pays off, it just all looks excellent! The sets are intricately detailed and massive, the costuming is wonderfully intricate and it all comes together to create a world that really feels lived in. The action is sparse as this is more of a drama focused sci-fi, but when it happens its extremely well choreographed and shot to create intense, gritty fight/battle scenes. The attack on the Atreides is easily a highlight, or even Duncan's hallway fight too! Now, all these visual elements are excellently accentuated by the incredible sound design! The mix is one of the deepest and most complex I have ever heard, from Hans Zimmer's incredible score to sound effects such as the ""voice"" power. Zimmer also crafted one of his best, most unique and detailed scores that fits the movie perfectly. Its just such a unique auditory experience, and combined with the stunning visuals it just created such a sense of euphoria in my head as my senses were overwhelmed with the world of Dune. This is a movie that you would be doing a disservice to yourself by watching it at home, it must be seen on the biggest screen you can find (such as IMAX). Its just such an incredible experience that truly reminded me why I love cinema and going to the movies! It's feels like a mix of Star Wars and Game of Thrones, which I love, and yet this story predates and possibly inspired both. I cannot wait to see more from this world, and I really hope we get the 2nd part of the story made! Ultimately I have absolutely no issues with this perfect piece of cinema; on a technical level this movie is flawless and has so much attention to detail. And that is all because of the master himself, Denis Villeneuve, who crafted it with so much love, care, but most importantly, skill. Its a true cinematic treasure, and gave me the same feelings as the first time I saw Star Wars or Lord of the Rings (I smiled the whole way through)! Dune is a stunning, majestic achievement and easily the best film that has come out all year. I highly recommend seeing this in theatres, and experiencing this massive, epic cinematic masterpiece for yourself.",Dune

Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, in particular, stand out from the rest with their charming and powerful performances.Hans Zimmer really outdid himself, with an immersive soundtrack that proves, once again, that the right choice of music is essential to the overall sensoriale experience.The visual effects are some of the most impressive masterworks of digital art that I have seen in recent years. They are outstanding, incredible, phenomenal: that's because they allow you to immerse yourself deeply inside of the character-driven journey.Ultimately, this movie is an instant classic.

It immerses you into the world as soon as you start watching. You fall in love with the characters and the storyline makes sense. The way that this is set in the future and yet it feels so minimalistic and rich in history is crazy. I loved that it's a sci-fi movie that doesn't have crazy tech. The suits are so cool. My advice would be GO WATCH IN THEATER. Not at home... you gotta feel this one. The movie is a great setup for part 2, but that is not to say that this was ""just a boring setup"". Absolutely not. I was so thoroughly entertained the whole movie and I will watch again and again. Denise is the perfect director for this, you can tell how important this movie is to him.

The visuals are gorgeous and Frank Herbert's work is clearly understood and respected. But there is something slightly off, cant really put my finger on it. While the attempt David Lynch made (Dune, 1984) was a bit too out there and the filmmaker took too many liberties, Denis Villeneuve (Dune, 2021) was perhaps a bit too determined to not make the same mistake twice.Ive read the book a few months ago so I was still perfectly aware how the story develops. This made the film, dare I say it, a bit on the slow and dull side here and there. This was, like I said, more than made up by the gorgeous visuals and sounds, but I cant shake the thought that the story could have been told in a slightly more energetic way.All in all, a small complaint, and people who are new to the franchise, which I suspect will be many, perhaps do not feel that way. In the end I left the theatre more than satisfied, so still a 9/10 for me.",Dune

Well, some things happen but rather than let the acting and action speak for themselves, almost EVERY line of dialogue is exposition!!! Denis Villeneuve is capable of far better sci-fi than this (see ""Arrival"", ""Blade Runner: 2049"", or David Lynch's effort instead). That being said, I'm very much looking forward to Part 2!",Dune

1407,jbaird-64914,Really Cool,9,22 October 2021,I'll preface this with saying I haven't read the books but this movie was awesome overall and I'm confused with some of the low ratings. Whenever a movies as hyped as this I guess you always get some of that. The story and visuals are excellent. It's clear that this is the first part and more about world building and setting the stage for things to come. I do understand some of the criticism. Yes a lot of the movie is in slow motion and could maybe do without that as much but other than that I really enjoyed the movie and cannot wait to see what comes next. It's really cool to see a big budget movie that's not some super hero marvel or dc movie so.,Dune
1408,Dilldappe,Somewhat underwhelming,7,24 October 2021,"As much as I wanted to like this movie, it falls short of expectations. The most jarring issue of this movie is its failure to appeal to a general audience in terms of lore and background. While watching the movie, I never could shake the thought of how much the movie fails to explain the most important parts of the setting to anyone who has not read the book.Thats the main issue the movie fails on. If you read the book, the movie will improve; but if you don't it does not provide enough information to really get the viewer engaged into the universe of Dune. In that case its only a generic popcorn movie to be awed and marveled at by the audience for its visuals and special effects, but it cannot create the true insight into Frank Herbert's creation. And thats a shame. Maybe in another 20 years we will get an actual true adaptation of what Frank Herbert wanted to tell.As it stands, even David Lynch or the SciFi mini series was closer to the mark than this. What a sad state of affairs.",Dune

Honestly speaking this piece is by and large embodied by jaw-dropping CGIs and ethereal soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The plain storytelling makes me feel that the scenario is either culminating all the time or instead, paving the way for the stories afterwards all the time.

1413,evhkerr,Great adaption,10,27 October 2021,"I read the book. This is one of those rare book adaptations wherein the director doesn't think he's smarter than the author. There's no altering of characters and adding of storylines to make the material ""more interesting"". One gender-swap, but it's inconsequential and the actress is phenomenal.The film's plot lines are bit condensed from the original material, but that's necessary given the weight of the novel.Paul was a character I never had a definitive image of when I first read the book, but Chalamet fits what I remember well. But let me say this: Paul's mother and Isaacs as Duke Leto are exactly as I pictured them. Isaacs especially. He's identical to the personality I had imagined.Visually, this film is a masterpiece. But the soundtrack stole the show. That epic oral history quality that the book has that's hard to communicate via words to the screen is perfectly captured by the score. Awesome.

Obviously not an Imax , but now everyone more or less watches in HD/4K , so it was not good and surely Cinema's should catch up technically...As for the film; it was very flawed. Missing characters (Shadam IV/Feyd/Irulan) , under-developed characters across the board. Rabban and Gurney come to mind immediately.The pace was also bizarre , I felt I had entered a new dimension where time had stopped still. Was this really the 11000 Century , if so why did it feel like I was somewhere in Saudi Arabia? Palm trees , wandering Palestinians in keffiyeh's , spoken and written Arabic , would there be a beheading?As for Liet-Kynes; spare me. This woeful miscasting of a African/American woman (he was male) with dreadlocks who can't act and was pushed up to a superhero status , despite being a peripheral character. Other examples of inclusivity also raised it's ugly hydra head.Other notable issues was the CGI for the body shields , thropter's not being disabled , joke-like decontamination suits , the inept dialogue and the poor soundtrack.Timotheeeee --- get a freaking haircut!I won't be going back to Cinema unless I can be guaranteed a less PC world. It just breaks the story.Where has the script writing talent gone? Just a tick box exercise now to please the easily offended. I'll get my coat and won't be back.",Dune

1417,bhwm-16526,A Beautiful Meh?,5,29 October 2021,"The visuals are incredible. From the cinematography to the CG, for the most part, every shot is solid. And Hans Zimmer as always, kills it with the score. Where the film falls flat is it's characters. Mainly, there aren't many. Chalamet is unconvincing and at times inaudible, and Paul feels VERY mary-sue esque, making it hard to feel any tension around him. Momoa is just Momoa, as he tends to be, Brolin has some solid scenes but disappears for most of the movie, Isaac starts to have a character halfway through the movie and then dies, Ferguson overall gives the best effort with the most screen time, but overall, there's nothing gripping about this ensemble. Oh, and Skaarsgard shines as the Baron, and that cannot be understated. But the dialogue leaves one lacking. This is a very dialogue-light film, and it suffers for it. Very little is explained in favour of action or quiet wide shots. The shields don't make much sense in terms of world building, and the fights suffer from several choreography blunders. Zendaya is unremarkable and her persistent appearance in visions quickly becomes tiresome. As do the visions themselves. Their ex machina appearances feel cheap and unsatisfying, opting to hand Paul the tools he needs to progress rather than letting Paul strike out as his own character. All this contributes to a lackluster plot with frail characters in an otherwise gorgeous film.",Dune

However, for a 2+ hour film, the story really doesn't get far. When you say out loud what happens in the film, it really could of been done in 30 mins. Many scenes could have been trimmed or entirely removed. Instead of two separate movies to tell the story, it could of been an exciting, better paced epic in one film.

It has a distinctly 'New Star Wars' aesthetic, lacking the Future-Deco design and otherworldly feel of Lynch's version. Some important elements are glossed over (use of the Spice in space travel) while other scenes are drawn out to fill the enormous run-time. This film drags. The dialogue is dull, with none of the memorable lines of Lynch's version. Some strange anachronisms (at one point somebody says ""that was insane"" when they mean ""that was awe inspiring""). Villeneuve failed horribly with Bladerunner 2049 and has compounded this with Dune.Gets 3 stars because it just about keeps one engaged.",Dune

1424,saolivaresm,The impossible work,8,23 October 2021,"It's time to say we have the most impressive film of 2021, Denis Villeneuve's Dune, is an impressive auteur blockbuster that becomes one of the best films of 2021, one of the cinematic experiences of the year and one of the musical works of the anus.Denis Villeneuve, is once again consolidated as one of the best directors today. Frankly, I think that only this director could have adapted Frank Herbert's novel in such greatness. An adaptation practically faithful to the novel and that Villeneuve takes the trouble to make it in 2 parts.The first part that the director builds for us is an amazing introduction to the world of Dune. With the delicate work of representing the lands, the planets and the environment. Arrakis, is to feel that you are recording on a real planet. In the same way, the time that its director dedicates to the presentation of each character.Timothée Chalamet, is very well directed and manages to enter the skin of Paul Atreides with a performance that is pure feeling, the complexity of the character the young actor represents it correctly, we understand the journey and the beginning of the arc that must be carried out during the film, which is obviously unfinished and which can be developed in the second part. Rebecca Ferguson likewise provides an impeccable performance that increases her strength as the film progresses.The villain theme is perhaps the film's weakest point. In a way, they feel not entirely exploited and remain in sporadic appearances. Either way, The Baron of Stellan Skarsgård is an interpretive as well as creative madness.The work that Denis Villeneuve has achieved is a show in all its dimensions. The camera set by Villeneuve of wide shots, of geometry in each one of them, of details that he always knows how to highlight and of a staging as he wants it to be at all times. That is complemented by the immense photography of Greig Fraser who seems to understand the mind of his director to the maximum detail. Monstrous visual effects, from the environments to the worms you do not doubt that they are real. Artistically the film is also a pleasure where the lights are carried by the clothes, especially the one worn by Rebecca Ferguson.The icing on the cake is none other than Hans Zimmer and his marvelous musical creation. Wow, the creation of every chord, melody and note that he uses to accompany Denis Villeneuve's work is mind-boggling.The first part of Dune is a work that is simmered with the best possible ingredients to wait for the final tasting with all the highest possible expectations you can have.There is a possibility that you do not like what you are seeing in a certain way because it is a movie that takes all the time in the world to explain things from Paul's dream dreams to each kingdom that is part of the story, however, If you connect with it the first time, it is a trip to perhaps one of the most spectacular visual experiences of the year and of recent times.A film that deserves to be seen in theaters to measure its spectacular nature.",Dune

Greig Fraser's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score should easily win Oscars, nothing else this year has come close to either of them. Denis Villeneuve deserves a ton of credit for making a Dune adaptation that isn't just watchable, but one of the best films of the year. All the actors are terrific, as expected with the kind of cast they had. 157 minutes is a bit long for a movie, but the movie keeps you engaged throughout and there wasn't much the director could do to trim the runtime with the kind of source material he had. There's not really much else to say, but to sum it up, Dune is brilliant.",Dune

1432,senderik,Good movie but a missed opportunity,6,19 September 2021,"I've been a fan of everything Dune since the first movie came out in 1984. A lot of ""purists"" can't stand the David Lynch version or the novels that Brian Herbert brought out but I enjoy all of them in their own right. Unfortunately, Villeneuve's attempt is a missed opportunity. Lynch portrayed the Duniverse in a totally original way. Instead of copying the ""used"" look of Star Wars or ""brand new in the box"" look of Star Trek, he used the pompous militaristic style of early 19th century Germany/Austria-Hungary, which made the movie look very original. Villeneuve's Duniverse looks like a standard slight variation of the Marvel Universe, with a bit of the Mummy thrown in for good measure. This doesn't detract from the story however, which is a scene-for-scene copy of Lynch's Dune (who of course adapted it from the book). I've seen that version so many times that my son, who was sitting next to me, asked me to stop quoting the lines. This is supposed to be a remake, not a copy! Villleneuve had the opportunity to come up with a visually truly original version of Arrakis. Instead he only used a better model ornithopter but left everything else as it was, only stripped down to it's sandy basics. A lot of Herbert's story is about the internal conflict Paul has, becoming the Kwisatz Hadderach. In Lynch version it might have been confusing for people that hadn't read the book, but Villeneuve simplified a lot of the scenes, which in my opinion doesn't make much clearer what's going on. The intro by princess Irulan is missing and the epic Navigator scene is reduced to a ""Sparta"" style declaration with a lot of Star Wars style troopers standing around. This takes away so much of the mood of the Lynch movie. It's missing sentences as the arrogant ""The Bene Gesserith witch must leave"" and the almost banal but utterly memorable conversation between the Navigator and the puzzled emperor: ""I just folded space from Ix. Many machines on Ix"". In fact the whole court is mostly absent. The purist crowd complained a lot about the Harkonnens being cartoon villains. I loved the portrayal of a depraved clan, ruling their planet with an iron fist. The style of Giedi Prime was a masterful exercise in cult of personality design. Brad Dourif was an awesome Piter the Vries while I can't even remember any scenes with Piter in the new movie. The same goes for Feyd Rautha. I couldn't point him out in a line up while Sting's performance was incredible. The Baron is one of the best evil characters in any movie. Yes, I realize that these days you can't portray anyone as gay and evil at the same time, so the Baron just became a standard ""Game of Thrones"" evil character but he didn't have the true cruelty you see in GoT. They could have dialed it up a notch and made the movie R rated at least. Villeneuve did do a better job on showing what a combination of Islam and Buddhism can look like. Other scenes, like the Sardaukar on Salusa Secundus were much too short. What were those upside-down naked people in the back ground being drained?",Dune
1433,andrewtmallory,Beautiful and Boring,6,19 October 2021,"You can't knock the stunning production, costume and makeup for this joint. This will certainly stand out as a hard film to top for it's design and look. However, to call this the next ""Lord of the Rings"" in gravitas is being a bit generous. The story lagged in places and it seemed to lack some sprit. Outside of some accents there wasn't much separating the characters and their personalities. It all kind of felt the same across the board. It was still enjoyable enough but I wasn't raving about it.",Dune
1434,fmdead,A bizarrely unsatisfying experience,6,2 October 2021,"All the components are there to make this an epic, enthralling story - a fantastical future world, political intrigue, moral challenge, themes relatable to current culture and issues, and stunning visuals and details. However, strangely, despite it all, throughout this film I had a sense of ""waiting for something to happen."" It felt like a puzzle of disparate scenes that ended up disconnected rather than a satisfying whole. There is no through-line, no momentum towards a climax. The important secondary characters - the father, the mentor, the warrior - all bite the dust - and you don't care one bit because there has been so little screen time for them for to be developed in a meaningful way. (And it's very misleading to present the Zendaya character as having an active presence in this story.) There were many snippets of mysteries dropped in, but no payback, it all feels like a tease. It's really not possible to have an entire movie - especially coming in at 2.5 hours - perform as an introduction only and expect movie-goers to be satisfied. I've decided that Dune is just too dense to try to make it a two-parter. What a great story could be told in an episodic television format, similar to Game of Thrones. I hope one day someone figures that out in order to do real justice to a fabulous epic.",Dune

The transformation of the main character to the leader in the famous line father the seeker has awoken! I knew this movie was just laid out to be a hit as soon as I saw the initial training scene with knives where in the original movie the young man is schooled although good with a knife against Jean-Luc Picard as it were. It took the main character a long time to build up to being brave and being the man he was supposed to be.

1438,zinabaggins,Bad attempt from Villeneuve,4,2 October 2021,"I watched it last night in two parts, because it was incredibly long and sloooow. Not much happens in 2 and a half hours. Zendaya is clearly wrong for the part (which is really small anyway, she barely has any dialogue), especially because her looks don't 1) match with the book description and 2) they aren't enough to justify Paul seeing her in his dreams all the time. The Fremen got the woke treatment, when in the book they're based on the Berbers (Amazigh) who aren't black. Liet Kynes got gender bent and is now a black woman. Villeneuve shot beautiful scenes (they look like perfume ads, to be honest), but the script is devoid of any plot or emotion. You can't feel for anyone. Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica is the only character holding this movie together, she's excellent. The set pieces are grey and bland, even in Caladan. The costumes are not that amazing. The soundtrack is literally shouting at some parts and it's really annoying. A bright note were the bagpipes in the soundtrack (only a few seconds) which constitute the Atreides theme.

1444,Dinin70,Great movie but wrong cut imho,8,8 October 2021,"To start, I read the books (1&2, reading 3). Didn't see Lynch version.As most have stated the visuals are breathtaking. I disagree the acting isn't good. I believe it is, the only problem is that the great cast didn't have a lot screen presence.A lot of comments mention how the movie is emotionless, and how it's impossible to « pick a side ». I kind of agree with this statement but I dont on the reason.Dune isn't about good guys vs bad guys. There isn't a side to pick. And anyway, any person having read the books and having half of a brain cell wouldn't be really simping for Paul Atreides. Dune is more of an epic story about the Arrakis and it's relation with the Atreides family and how it plays in what is about to come.And here I believe Villeneuve did a great job about keeping the book philosophy.But then, is it normal that when watching you just see the unfolding of a story about two (or three) houses just fighting each other without understanding really what is going on? No it's not. And I believe that it's because the film cut is wrong. Villeneuve creamed a LOT out of the story. Too much.I understand that a lot needed to be taken out. Is it really useful and important to know yet about the Landsraad? About the CHOM, about the Merchants Guild? Probably not. Not yet.But Mentat? I think it's an important matter. They aren't even mentioned. But it the end it didn't prevent to make things go forward in a meaningful manner.The problem is that Villeneuve (or whoever) kept on creaming out. Too little is said about Harkonnen / Atreides feud. About The Emperor feud (one sentence about his jealousy, not more than that). The Bene Gesserit also. Only a couple of lines about their actions and involvements.It's ok for me as I read the book. But for someone who didn't? How can someone « care » about what is going on if almost nothing is mentioned about the powers at stake on Dune. « The spice »... that's it. But there's so much more than the Spice. The book takes the time to highlight them, so that you feel connected, making you wanting to read further.Villeneuve streamlined too much. And yet, over two hours and a half? There are too many dead moments, that bring non added value that could have been replaced with additional explanation to make things more clear, to emphasise them more.Villeneuve took so much out that even Liet Kynes seems absurd... Yet he (or she in the movie) had his own reason to behave like he did. In the movie. She just changes sides, for no reason.And that's why according to me, there is a wrong cut, too much focus on useless things, and yet too few on important matters.",Dune

1447,ydurgut,The best screen adoption of Dune,10,27 September 2021,"Maybe cine-tech advanced enough or adopters realized it would not be enough to have a 2-hr movie even from a single book, this one is definitely the best adoption for me.One crucial criticism would be if this movie will be comprehensible for the ones who haven't read the book(s). That the whole movie jumped into action as soon as it started will be something hard to catch up for the ones not familiar with the first book or the Dune saga.I would really recommend a read at least of a synopsis of Dune before watching, to understand the background, the Houses of Corrino, Attreides, Harkonnen, Bene Gesserit, Space Guild, and what spice melange is.",Dune
1448,diwest1126,Astounding,10,23 October 2021,"I watched Dune on HBO Max with my wife as soon as it released because neither of us could wait. Even on our home television, it was astounding. The acting is superb, the music is chilling, the visuals are simultaneously mind-bendingly beautiful and soul-crushingly brutal. The casting is A+. The worms, how they are used throughout and then the big worm reveal near the end, flawless. And yes, it's basically lifted straight from the book. Things that many reviews complain didn't happen in the movie DID NOT HAPPEN until the second part of the book, which is going to be in movie part 2. It's incredible, and this was clearly made by a director in Villanueva who loves the Dune books and wanted to make his movie a close a reflection to them as possible.Even though I've already watched it on HBO Max, my wife and I are still planning to see it in IMAX. It's that good.Go. See Dune. You don't want to miss this.",Dune

Probably it's just because I haven't read the book (lots of people said you'd enjoy it more when u've read the book). I think it's one of those movie that's made simply to introduce us to the universe. The plot is slow and lots of characters are being introduced then it ends. Definitely a one time watch because 3 hours is not a short time. Expect more to come (and really happen) on Dune 2.",Dune
1451,Fil-sorokins,Dune part I - Masterpiece,10,28 September 2021,"Just finished watching Dune part one. Just As Denis Villeneuve said , that this movie must be watched in IMax on the big screen.When I first heard about Villeneuves new project Dune I didn't know what it was . So I went to the Book store and bought first 3 books about Dune.I can say that I became a fan almost instantly.After realizing how good the 1965 Frank Herbert Dune really is , I hoped for Villeneuves movie to be as good visually and story wise as it was written in the books. And I was not disappointed.Every actor fitted their character. They felt real. Paul Atreides / Lady Jessica / Duke Leto Atreides / Baron Vladimir Harkonnen / Gurney Halleck / Duncan Idaho / Stilgar and Chani. Every actor was casted perfectly.Visually Dune was stunning. CGI was on the highest of levels. The experience of watching 2021 Dune in the cinema is beyond unreal.Still have the Hans Zimmer soundtrack playing in my head. The Theme is perfect. It completely take you and puts you in to the Arrakis where you fight for the survival every second.When the credits started rolling I understood that this movie was just too good to be called just movie.. Its an experience..
Really would have stayed and watched the part II right away)
And at the same time I was so happy that They divided the first book into two parts. That helps not to rush and gives all the necessary details to the audience. So we can understand every aspect of the story.The last thing I wanted to say.. Don't listen to the haters. We all remember what they said about Blade Runner 2049.. Films like this don't just come and go. Dune is here to stay.Go and see it yourself) it's worth it!Now We are waiting Mr Villeneuve for part II !Thank you for the Dune!",Dune
1452,pablo-98872,Sorry... no good,3,18 October 2021,"Terrible and expensive rubbish. 40 years waiting for a rameke and this is the best they could do? Soft characters, a poor cast, empty, a film without personality, directed with many gadjets and with all the available technology but without talent, without passion, but worst of all, without imagination. The film is slow, boring ... long ... no wonder that in more than two hours of film they barely reach a third of the story of the original film. The original book (or books) is packed with details that they could have studied, used, but have chosen to ignore. The original film was made with little money, it had to be shot in Mexico, without computers or CG, but with enthusiasm, with imagination, with passion. The new one is the opposite. The few good things about this movie are those that resemble or have been respected from the original. Nothing else. It's a sad, empty, disappointing, pretentious, and soulless remake. Gray, aseptic, empty characters. A drab and poorly directed movie. The only thing it has are huge explosions that the original didn't have. They have been more concerned with the aesthetics (nothing original) for the technique than for the spirit. A great disappointment that seems to have two more sequels ... that I will not see. And let's not talk about the desert worms. It seems incredible that 40 years ago they had better effects. The worms in the original movie are much better, a sign that neither money nor technology is a guarantee of anything.",Dune

But NO, they made all the same mistakes again. I like the story concept, but the delivery is just so bad. The soundtrack just drones on like some boring film noir. To much of the dialogue is unclear, and the storyline is fairly difficult to follow a lot of the time. Some of the action sequences are pretty good, but that's about all it's got going for it really. I'm quite disappointed if I'm honest, cause I'm craving a decent, new sci-fi franchise. Oh well, my wait continues.",Dune
1455,nkdiddy,An absolute masterpiece 10/10,10,22 October 2021,"I grew up reading the Dune books, exploring the lore, playing the PC CD ROM strategic game, watching and rewatching David Lynch's Dune then in 2000, watching the SyFy version countless times. Then relistening to the book when I found out Denis Villeneuve was taking the reigns of Shai Hulud and finding the cast to support it. So I will rate it without spoilers in my usual rating scheme.Cinematography: 10/10. Absolutely jarring and immersive. You are truly a part of the action. You see the characters and feel everything they feel. It's not just because of the IMAX experience, but you truly feel like you are in an Ornithopter riding into a sandstorm, or in the mix fighting a dreaded Sardukar, or being a part of Paul's dream. You are in the action. The Cinematographer did an amazing job, and made me feel like I was on Arrakis. Truly spectacular.Musical Score: 10/10: Hans Zimmer outdid himself. The music was in fact alien, and so unique to any other music theme in the history of cinema. His is a Dune fan himself and this was a project he had wanted to work on for years, and it showed in this film. The score was the DNA of this film, and it course through my veins and gave me the chills when moments of great suspense and action took a hold of me. Hans Zimmer made the movie a true feature to behold.CGI/Practical Effects: 10/10. The costume design, the CGI and practical effects were believable, exquisite, and was pure perfection. Without a doubt, Denis Villeneuve had the perfect vision with the crew in mind to make this marvel possible. As he said ""They did not film Jaws in a swimming pool. You truly felt like you were on Arrakis and in great peril. My God the battle scenes were unlike any other battle scenes in any science fiction movie I've ever seen. An incredible feat done by an incredible crew and visionaries to make this possible.Acting/Voice Acting 10/10: Every actor and actress played to their strengths. There was no weakness. Whether it was Timothee Chalamet or Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac, to Jason Momoa, and Stellan Skarsgard and Sharon Duncan Brewster, hell everyone was amazing. They were relatable and believable. Even some of the roles that were major in the book and cut down to be minor held their own in every epic way. They honed their craft and became the roles I expected them to be. Absolute perfection.Plot: 10/10. Did it follow the book to the letter? No. Is it the closest you'll get to the book. You better believe it. There were a lot of noticeable changes as a Dune fan that I picked up on, but they were appropriate changes in my view. Denis Villeneuve had a monumental task, and I believe he conquered it. It gave a lot of context that wasn't rushed. Some parts of the story was out of order or added for cinematic necessity which I totally understand. You can argue that it's not 100% accurate to the book, but I picked up so much more after listening to the book again, that has been missing from the other two versions. There is a metric ton of material to fit into two and a half hours to make it function, but again, this is something that Denis Villeneuve accomplished, because he is a fan like all of us. The source material was the book. He referenced the book to make it make sense and gave it the necessary spin to make it all make sense in a two and a half hour movie and he did it beautifully.Final verdict: 10/10. I have waited 2 years for this movie to come out. I have waited for over 20 for this version to be made. Each version is unique but this one is as true material as you can make it. I believe Frank Herbert would have been proud of this. Truly magnificent. I am going to watch this over and over and over again. It has become my #2 favorite film of all time. No easy feat. Stay tuned for a review on my YouTube page in the near future.Thank you Denis Villeneuve and to the cast and crew and to Frank Herbert, for this masterpiece of a story. Now, when does part II come out?",Dune
1456,germanosouzarj,Just terrible,1,18 September 2021,"Sincerely, I tried to find something good in this movie. It's just a terrible story. It's a fantastic waste of time and money. I gave the lowest grade possible.",Dune

1458,golgomes,Dennis makes a sci-fi masterpiece... for the 3rd time in a row.,9,2 November 2021,"I just finished watching this movie and what an experience, I don't even know where to begin. I will divide this into pros and cons, and as you can figure this movie has a whole lot more pros than cons.PROS:
-Sound / Soundtrack. 9/10. Hans Zimmer's work is brilliant as always, being a perfect fit for the setting and elevating every. Single. Scene. Notable examples: Saradukar and Dune Worm scenes. One could argue that his soundtrack is a bit TOO intense at times, but I didn't feel that.-Visuals: 10/10- They are so good one could compare the cinematography to Kubrick's (which is in my opinion the greatest director ever for various reasons). If you've watched Arrival, or even better, Blade Runner 2049, you know what to expect. Dennis knows how to make beautiful, sci-fi shots, and this movie isn't an exception. Not only are the shots well made, the visual effects are literally the best in film. Dennis doesn't use CGI mindlessly until his movies look like a videogame (marvel I'm looking at you), his world actually looks real and immersive, sound design also plays a part in this. This is as good as you can get from a visual standpoint, both effects and cinematography.-Story: 8/10: Without spoiling, I love the patience Dennis he shows in his storytelling, it's really something that is underrated nowadays. Most Directors today care about instant gratification, and big action scenes, without caring about characters or world building. I give Dennis credit for taking his sweet time with the story. He could've chosen to just jam-pack everything into 1 movie and lord knows what would come out. The story is obviously great as it comes from a world-renowned book, however there were some plot inconsistenties and decisions I found stupid, and I write them in the cons section. Nevertheless I can't wait to see what comes next, and I'll be reading the novel very soon, this world is very interesting.-Casting and Performances: 6/10 The performances were pretty good over the board except for Paul's mother which at times was not so great imo. Timothee really steals the show, he was a perfect cast for this role. He is gorgeous and has that ""prince"" aesthetic, really liked his performance here.CONS:-There were some story moments I thought were kinda stupid.**SPOLER ALERT**
That Jason Momoa sacrifice... I think they could literally just have ran at that point in the story, doesnt' make sense.Secondly, the thing with Paul's mother when he was with the old witch as well as other moments where she just cried for no apparent reason. I think she can sense his emotions beacause of her powers but that isn't really explained, and her performance is kinda bad.Third: The fat old baron just survived the deadly poison? I mean literally everyone in the room got killed by the poison except for the fat slob who magically survived.Some of these plot stuff might be resolved in the next movie so I'm not paying too much mind to it. The writing is pretty good however this world is so deep and expansive but we only got time to delve deep into the main character, the others felt a bit shallow. With the time constraints and considering that Dune Universe has like 5 novels around it, Dennis' work couldn't be better.Anyways, that's what I got. Overall this movie is close to a masterpiece, but some small pet peeves I have with the plot don't let it reach the 10/10 mark. It's a solid 9 for me.",Dune

It's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Not even a slight hint of poor/obvious cgi, it genuinely looks like the spaceships, technologies and vast landscapes are real.

Taking a deep dive at once might be a path fettered with hurdles, but once those names of who's who is set in stone in your mind within the first half an hour, the rest of the film is a pleasure ride for cinema lovers. It ticks all the right boxes in departments, such as set design, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, make-up, sound, and most importantly the music which is Hans Zimmer at his best. The story which is essentially to be concluded in the sequel throws light onto the protagonist's evolution from a prince to a Duke in exile, on the lookout for vengeance, justice, and reclamation of what's lost, to restore the order that his kingdom aspired to establish in the planet Arakis. It is a bildungsroman and Timothee evolves with every scene he is in. Frankly, he is revelation once again. Each and every scene of the film is elevated by the mastery of the man behind the scenes - Dennis Villeneuve, who already holds an enviable resumé in Hollywood and Dune only adds to that list of starry films.",Dune

Instead, they were able to really dive into the story by essentially cutting the narrative in half (a wrap-up sequel is forthcoming so I hear). As a result, it felt more real, more passionate, and more emotionally connected to audiences than the original.I'd also like to say that when I first saw the casting for this, I objected to Timothy Chalamet, who I did not think was right for the role. I am happy to say I was mistaken, because he was excellent. However, the REAL star of the show was Rebecca Ferguson, who played Jessica Atreides, and was PHENOMENAL. This will hopefully turn her into a household name, and get her cast in more things, because she's an exquisite actress.",Dune

1479,etihw_wons,An Overall Stunning Adaptation Of An Epic Novel,8,22 October 2021,"My perspective: After having read the book, and watched the 1984 movie adaptation, I was both intensely excited for this new version, AND terribly nervous that it would be horribly disappointing and fail miserably. But after seeing it, I was truly gobsmacked. Essentially, it was everything it needed to be. It was long and slow (but in a good way, it takes its time with many of the scenes, and pays attention to details, just like in the book), and strange and beautiful; it was thoroughly engaging, and at 2.5 hours for the first half of the story, I would gladly have sat through a full five hours to finish the whole story. For me, it struck the just right balance, and I enjoyed it so much it left me giddy as a school girl. There were scenes I had created pictures of in my head, and suddenly, those images were on the screen. And in other scenes, things were brought to life in ways I had not even imagined.The film is beautiful to look at. The actors are impeccable, in my opinion. The pace and editing are just right, for the most part. When I had finished it the first time, I just went back through and watched it again.I really, truly hope they are able to make the second half, and that they put into it what they did with this first half.My 3 main complaints:
Thufir Hawat was, perhaps, underutilized. But I understand that with so much depth given to each character in the book, and so much focus on Paul and his mother, a balance needed to be struck for the movie.Lady Jessica did a little too much crying, I thought. Not sure why. I still liked her very much, but she didn't quite have the strength she does in the novel. Perhaps it is with the purpose of showing a greater contrast to what she becomes later on, in part two? I'm not sure.And the lead up to one of the biggest scenes of the entire movie, (not really spoilery, but maybe a little) involving Duke Leto, a hallway, Yueh, and everything else that happens at that point, could have, I thought, used a little extra flushing out. There were some things in the book that really added depth to this part of things (and to Leto and Jessica's relationship), but in the movie, it just kind of comes a little bit out of the blue, and you don't get that emotional punch between Keto and Jessica.However, despite these few things, this adaptation keeps the integrity and spirit of the book in a truly fantastic and epic way. It is Dune.",Dune

Decent acting from most of the cast (Oscar Isaac and Jason Momoa were great), but horrible plot and execution. Also I didn't like the religious implications in the movie, with the arabic names, concepts of holy war and killing, especially with terrorism currently blossoming in the world.

I feel like more time was spent on visuals than story. I may have different expectations because I'm a big fan of the older dune/children of dune, 6 part series.

1499,bvgal-09799,SCIFI MASTERPIECE,10,24 October 2021,"10/10A complete sci-fi masterpiece. It is a political warfare and religious scifi but there is magic, depth, relationships struggles, romance and an hero-arc and coming into age story that comes into play.Yes the movie is not as colorful, vibrant, rainbow-like nor did we get enough backstory on the House of Atreides, Harkonnens and the Imperial, but movie is still beautiful, stunning, and serene. There are some shots that just leave you breathless.I think most of the cast is amazing, Timothy Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan were wonderfully cast but there were a few other that I think were not so well cast, but Timothy and Rebecca strong performance made up for it.That said, movie is absolutely moving. It is a serious scifi that questions and probes human existence, power, space colonism, bloodline, destiny, religion, love, young romance, loyalty, parental love, dreams and time/space and compassion, evil and good, and hero's call to lead.10/10 from me. Loved it, can't wait for the next two sequels. <3.",Dune
1500,YoungNightRider,If it were only a TV series...,3,30 October 2021,"If Dune was a binge TV show I would give it 8/10.Dune was enjoyable. I was hooked. There was no hateful activism written into the script and these days that's about all you can ask for.Dune wavers back and forth on a high peak of its own, high quality, tipping point. Unsure of being a masterpiece or not, it's easy to lean one way or the other. It sits on the top of a pyramid. For the viewer it's a challenge to decide if this was a success more than any movie released in a long time, just watch reviews on You2ube. Most critics on You2ube give it an 8 with MUCH hesitation. Angry Joe, at first gave Dune a 7 after processing for a long time but unfortunately changed his mind to an 8. Psychology shows us he should have gone with a 7. That was his SKILLED answer!! He caved from fear and peer pressure of sorts. That's my opinion. Sorry, Joe, love ya.When keeping a sequel in mind, after watching this, it's a safe bet to lean towards the positive. I just can't do that. A sequel almost didn't happen and these days it could be cancelled. I was annoyed constantly while watching but went home from the theater (rip) happy. Dune consisted of endless borderline flaws. I half cringed through the entire space opera. I was unsure until the end. The final scene was by far the worst part of the film and that's why I just can't give it an 8 (please rewatch this horrible final scene). The fighting scenes were not great. There are ways to make this count especially for a climax. I hate to say it because I love the idea of Dune, but lightsabers are more enjoyable and so are skilled martial artists. This was neither. It's the least that we could expect against such a slightly well executed, yet visually pretentious, masterpiece.Dissecting the beast;(-1*) The acting...almost convincing. It's not much better than Star Wars , which many compare this to. If you think about it this does seem like a more disturbing Star Wars film. For fresh actors over the course of the pandemic they did phenomenal work but still flaws.(-1*) The cinematography...almost perfect. Too dim at times (to be fair probably looks great in an LED, this was a wise move). I was confused by which is what, by who is who, during battles.(-1*) The script ... almost great but I WAS lost about what soldiers were which and I was constantly waiting for them to explain the interesting Dune universe etc.(-2*) Respect to source material... from what I've seen on You2ube and heard over the years this does not spend a single moment explaining anything that actually makes Dune, Dune yet it's there...(-1*) There is a scene that never happens!! You will wait and wait and wait for it and it never happens. Since this is spoiler free I won't mention. Disappointed in the end. Many other reviewers agree.(-2*) The music/mixing. Tiitilating in the ears but overwhelming overtime. The score has the Hanson effect combined with Phillip Glass. Were more than two melodies used over three hours? Everything is mixed poorly. Honestly I'm a musician and I like Hanz Zimmer BUT I wanted to run from the theater because I was so annoyed with the music!! Not making this up!",Dune

This was not helped by the picture being so dark that much of the detail was lost, and the over-loud sound made it difficult to concentrate on what was actually happening on screen, buit this might have been the fault of the particular theatre I happened to be in. However, I thought the final half-hour was pretty good so will very likely watch Part II when it appears, if only to find out what happens to Paul and his mom. 6/10 is my score.",Dune

doesn't run like hell through the storyreally builds the characters and sets the stagethe acting is goodthe effects are good (go watch it in your best cinema)Minuses:
music is just ""TA-DAAA"" most of the time, mostly for non-ta-daa scenes and VERY loud (I know many worship zimmer, but this is a mediocre score, I can't recall any melody after watching the film)an universe of the future could have been enhanced with more technology insights which Herbert didn't had when he wrote the book, and make it more realistic and not a combination of future with middle-ages (I know this is the fingerprint of Dune the book, but I think it could have been enhanced, anyway I can respect director decision to stay in the book)Jessica could have indeed be more confident and strong, although I think her emotional scenes were good (in the end her son's life was at stakes in those scenes)the movie could have cut a little more through some prolonging and little-to-say scenes and use those minutes to complete a bit the story, at least to enter a bit in the fremen world; I understand the film wanted to be by the book, those visions were coming and keep coming, but in a movie that could have been adjusted a bitPluses:
congratulations on picturing arrakis ambient: desert, wadi-like rocks, dust, caves, arab-like language, clothes and culture as depicted by Herbert, even the moves and voice accent of some indigenous reminded me of middle eastwell done in explaining everything, directly and indirectly, a person who didn't read the book is able to understand everything shown in the filmrealistic battlesgood picturing of the Voice, not sure how it could have been demonstrated better, I would have completely avoided that if I was a director just because of the riskgood picturing of the shieldsworms are satisfying, at least for now :)Looking forward to see in Part 2 the picturing of the fremen culture and ambient as opposite to the ""civilized world""",Dune
1505,ghostsm,The SyFi mini-series with eye-candy.,8,20 October 2021,"Unlike lot of others who has review this movie, I dislike Lynch's movie. I'm fan of Herbert's work and feel that Lynch changes too much for my liking. I don't like that made Paul into almost a God. I hate scene at the end of Lynch's movie where Paul makes it rain. Also, hate the fact that Lync changes of weirding way it some sort sonic weapon. I feel that was silly.This movie feels like the SyFy mini-series but with a ton the eye-candy. Like mini-series this version of Dune will be a two parter. Also, like with the mini-series there this version is pretty faithful to book. Unlike, mini-series their is no commitment to second part. If this movies does well they MAY start filming in 2020. IF this movie doesn't do well, we will never get part 2.One thing I didn't like about the SyFy version was the look. The clothing were outlandish and hideous. In Villeneuve's version the, clothing looked great and functional. Villeneuve nailed the look present in the oI expect get the movie will get a lot of complain of white savior complex. Lot of Herbert drew from the middle east culture. Villeneuve left a lot of that in, so expect hear complains about cultural appropriation. It seem like Villeneuve took step to satisfy the woke left. Like gender swapping Liet.

1508,abloodynova,"Brilliant, But Incomplete.",7,24 October 2021,"I've seen and read some reviews from other people, and apparently it's so much easier if you are already familiar with the source material, which I am not. And apparently, it's a theme that a lot of people who aren't familiar is a bit frightened by Dune. It's slow and confusing. It's a bit like a slow reading of a thesaurus of a language you don't know. It's full of terms that are alien, a lot of expositions, a lot of back and forth between present and Paul's vision and personally it can get pretty dizzying at times. It's really not something to watch on the side, Dune requires your full attention for it to make sense. It would probably take a rewatch or two before the pieces clicks together for me, but with that kind of runtime, I'm not doing it anytime soon.The movie is long. Two and a half hours surprisingly flies by - although when the end arrives, you know a lot of things happened yet at the same time, it felt like not a lot happened. There's really only one action bit, one big turnover - not quite a problem, it's that everything else feels like an establishing shot. And this is really my only objective problem with this movie, to be honest. It doesn't feel like a complete movie - it's like a long, epic, and expensive act 1 to a movie. The whole movie is meant to establish and introduce you to the universe. It's very good, very well-made - but I'm not a fan of how it ended a little abruptly and left me feeling ""that's it?"". There's an ever lingering sense of tension since the big turnover, but I didn't find it at all resolved. Not to mention we have to wait lord knows how long for the sequel (which is unconfirmed) where everything presumably kicks off at full throttle.And as everyone have probably said it, the production value of this movie is insane. Every single shot is beautiful, the tone and atmosphere combined with the ever brilliant Hans Zimmer at the helm is immaculate. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Timothee Chalamet here - he's done well enough but doesn't exactly stand out as the lead - though apparently Paul is supposed to be like that, so I'm out of my league here.Overall, it's a really well-made movie - but on it's own, it felt a little empty because it didn't feel like it actually ended. As a certain someone said, ""it is only the beginning"". I do wish it felt less literal, though.",Dune

1513,llydlester-16065,Dune (2021) Film Review,8,21 October 2021,"""Dune"" is an intense and fascinating science-fiction film that has the potential to be the best film of the year? A fantastic experience with stunning visuals, magnificent set pieces, and production designs, and a powerful Hans Zimmer score that transforms throughout the film and serves as an important character in its own right. With a run time of 2 hours 35 minutes, Villeneuve's film is highly entertaining and rarely time-consuming. With stunning visuals that aid in explaining the complex world and diplomacy of ""Dune"" and the planet Arrakis, which isn't a problem because ""Dune"" is so distinct and contains so many dynamic scenes that newcomers like myself will be returning for more viewings.This is one of the year's best book adaptations because everything is presented in a coherent and beautiful manner, and everything is neatly recapped, which will please fans of the book series. Additionally, there is no question that, without a doubt, the entire ensemble cast does as well by the script by selling the audience on the ""feudal interstellar society in which various noble dynasties control planetary fiefs,""
Is ""Dune"" a film that reminds us of what a Hollywood blockbuster can be? A gripping tale that is both action-packed and thought-provoking. Villeneuve's ""Dune"" is another masterpiece, and as science fiction enthusiasts, we should all be overjoyed that he will continue with Part 2. As good as ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" are, this film has a true sense of profundity that distinguishes it as a genuine sci-fi magnum opus.",Dune

I could not see what was going on at all.Besides those negative points I would still like to say that I did enjoy the movie in general and I think it will become a very good film series.

1522,MReed542,Why do they keep re-making this story?,5,1 November 2021,"Some stories are meant to be read. This is one such story. The characters and the stories are too cerebral and just don't translate to the screen. Why do they feel the need to remake this movie every couple of years? Look, I love sci-fi. I love epic stories. I love a good piece of cinematic eye candy. I do, but this failed to deliver on almost all those fronts and disappointed me almost to the point of boredom at times. The monochrome-colored everything alone was tough to take even when expected. The little piece of greenery we see at one point was literally like water in the desert. And while the costumers tried hard, the clothing blowing 12 feet out from the body in the the desert wind looked cool once but would that really be the style? Excess fabric flying dramatically? Not very practical. It was a cool visual, but too much when they used it in scene after scene after scene. The performances range from ok to pretty good. I liked Timothy Shalamat in the lead for the most part but everyone else felt like a walk-on cameo. I loved Rebecca Ferguson in the White Queen but she looked so out of place in this world. It was almost as if her character was too big for her and the actress was literally being swallowed up by one of the sand worms. She just seemed lost. So 5 stars because it had a few moments and I appreciate the effort put into the cinematography but overall takeaway is: stop trying to make this book into a movie and just encourage people to read it instead.",Dune
1523,sergeantmajorh,Fantastic!,8,23 October 2021,"Having read all of Frank Herbert's work more than once, watched the attempts to tell the story in previous movies, this really does add up to the best yet. While the movie hangs very closely to the book, it did end way to soon. That was, I am sure, an attempt to sell future productions which was one of the few let downs. The other was the character changes from male to female. I am sure it is a nod to the woke morons in the film industry. That in itself could be the movies downfall. I wanted to rate this a 10. But the two faults mentioned really stop me from doing so. Overall the movies was great. I would love to watch a new sci Fi or fantasy today that doesn't have to yield to the leftist belief system today. This is after all a fantasy science fiction. Movies are for entertainment not pushing weird political beliefs. Too bad but for that reason I won't be spending good money on the film.

I plan to watch it again (with the sound off) just to experience this masterwork again!However, the unparalleled beauty and cinematography can't hide its' glaring flaws. The script is inept and flat. The actors, with few exceptions, are tedious. And, the casting was so badly thought out, I have to wonder if the person in charge threw darts at a wall of photos of actors.

Too many iconic actors trying to cover iconic characters. The original had actors like Brad Dourif, Sting, Patrick Stewart, Linda Hunt, Everett McGill, Richard Jordan,and on and on. Interesting and quirky actors. Putting Aquaman and Drax in their roles made me removed from the film. None of the actors gave much life to their characters. The script suffered from not enough backstory given to each main character which makes you involved and care what happens to them. The special effects were not much more advanced from the original from so many years ago. Timothy Chalamet is a good young actor but just doesnt have the gravitas of Kyle MacLachlan in the original. I was pretty bored by the second half. Do yourself a favor and watch the life brought to the original by the actors playing the baron, fade, Shadout Mapes, Stilgar, and Guerney.",Dune

However after 2 hours of watching Chalamet have a lot of Zendaya visions (probably to be able to justify marketing her as female lead) I found myself getting a bit bored, the movie ending so utterly unresolved lefte leaving the theater somewhat annoyed.Don't get me wrong, the world building was stunning and visually the movie is exquisite, as is the acting of most main characters but as a non book reader I felt slightly out of the loop the entire time, nothing was explained as well as it should have been yet everything took forever. The villains felt somewhat stereotypical and underdeveloped and betrayal amongst the good guys made me feel nothing.I believe this would have served better as a series with more time in lower intervals, a la GOT or the WitcherAll in all, worth the watch, but manage your expectations.",Dune

The special effects are top notch and the characters were casted well. Plus the story itself is intriguing although I feel like I've heard it before.However, a lot, and I mean ALOT, of time was spent running the flash back scenes and slo motion pieces that made the movie feel dragged out when more of the world setting could be taking place. Feels like a lot of time was invested on one character when there was so much more going on around him.Even now I'm not sure who the big bad is. The empire? Harkonen? Bautista?! Those mercenaries that I can't remember the name of? A big issue I have with many films lately is not enough time is spent establishing who the evil is or the main antagonists and actually turning them into a compelling character. So far it's ""empire bad because he's jealous and scared"" , ""harkonen bad because they're just bad"", ""and worms bad? Maybe?

I don't think its a good movie but also don't think is bad either.It tries to be arty but ends up just dragged, its color pallet is way too bland, and it lacks creative visionary in set designs that are generic and forgettable for the most part. There is a lack of glamour in visuals that made the original stuck out over time. This looks and feels too much like a generic sci-fi movie.Music is too haunting all the time trying to make fake tension and going for just that one feeling (like Zach Snyder Superman music) beating you over the head with that one emotion (typical for Zimmer).The casting and acting in most part is unbelievable, not bad actors but bad choices for roles. Bardem is the only one really good and partially Paul and Baron. Problem with Baron is he has almost no lines to flesh out his character and motivations. I like Rebecca Ferguson as an actress but her and Paul as mother and son is not believable to me for some reason. Same goes for Leto as the father.Main problem I have with this movie is the script and bad take on artistic visionary. Its almost 3h long in telling less then half of the story from original movie. And that would not be a problem if it fills that time with tight meaningful content but it doesn't. Movie didn't feel long but it takes a long amount of time to tell very little. Some scenes are repetitive, others could be made differently to save time and nothing would be lost.Best part of the movie is take on Freemans as almost an Afghan people. Also take about manipulating people through myths that comes to bite you later are stuff that were missing in the original. Design of ornithopter is spot on.At the end i think that main problem in adapting Dune on screen (like in first movie) is going from Paul's perspective. This is too big of a story and focus should be on spirituality and politics and how characters are driven and conflicted about it. Personal story of Paul rises from this conflict but should not be a main focus. Villeneuve is not good enough director and is artistically way too limited for it, he bite more than he could chew.",Dune

1538,pwpj11,Stunning,8,24 October 2021,"I watched this at home on October 21 because I couldn't wait. Then I went to see it in Imax on the 23rd. I'm glad I did both and I think everyone should see this on the big screen.The sets and costumes were beyond my expectations. The feudal society didn't make Villeneuve use cliched Renaissance images like those in the 1984 film or Game of Thrones. This film does something new, a true vision of the year 10191. In particular, Villeneuve captured the Bedouin flavor of the book, my all-time favorite. Some of the technology in the book came alive for the first time: personal shields, the Baron's suspensor suit, and in particular the ornithopters, which I had previously imagined as helicopters shaped like birds.One of my issues with the 1984 film was always the Toto score. It was nice as a generic film score, but had nothing to do with Dune. The Hans Zimmer score in the new film did not have any themes you could hum, but supported the story and its setting so much better.Some quibbles: The biggest is that in a few places the acting was flat and unemotional. The one person whose acting truly showed her character's feelings was Rebecca Ferguson. Timothy Chalamet does not look like red-headed Paul Atreides from the book. The closest any film adaptation has come was the Alec Newman from the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries. The early part of the film was misleading about the importance of the spice melange. The film made the spice sound like a mere navigation aid, much different from giving Spacing Guild navigators the ability to fold the space between two planets, which is the equivalent of creating a wormhole. Finally, I had been hoping this first film would include Paul and Jessica being taken to Sietch Tabr and Paul getting his new name, Muad Dib. That would be a better demonstration of the death of Paul Atreides and the birth of the Kwisatz Haderach.I am now eagerly awaiting part 2.",Dune
1539,roverite1970-682-875506,Visually stunning but boring,6,31 October 2021,"After all the hype that surround Dune 21, I was really looking forward to this film. I am a huge fan of Denis Villenueve so expectations where high.From the very start, you could see where the budget went. The visuals are incredibly stunning, the cinematography is top drawer, the music haunting and melodic and what few set pieces we have are something to behold.Now the but. For me, the film was incredibly boring. The narrative jumps back and forth, dream to reality so many times. I don't like voiceovers, and although this film does it incredibly well, they still distract from what you are watching.Timothy Chalomet plays the youthful Oaul incredibly well. Rebecca Ferguson is solid as always, and gets probably the toughest role in the film, always conflicted between family and duty. Zendaya is abesnt though, although from the trailer you would expect to see her a lot more, but apart from a dream seuence or two, the same scene is replayed, and I can only hope she has a bigger roles to play in part 2.For me, the standout was Jason Mamoa. Playing Duncan, was always going to be a big role, as he is Paul's mentor, trainer and almost big brother type character. I won't give anything away, but this is a far removed role from his usual Aquaman type gigs.As I said, so many psoitives, but I found the film to be very slow and drawn out. Nothing is resolved, which was to be expected, but NOTHING was resolved. I don't know if I can be bothered to sit through this again before part 2 comes out, but seeing as though that film hasn't even started shooting yet, I don't know if I will bother again. Maybe if they filmed them back to back with maybe 6 months between, I might be more interested, but waiting 2 years for a resolution is too far for me.",Dune

It was good visually.Sound design was great.I really enjoyed the ""tone"" of the movie.It had some quite cool scenes.The setting is nice and the world seems quite interesting.A lot of seemingly interesting characters, casted by good actors.The bad:
The movie tries way way too hard to make every single scene so special and powerful, keeping you engaged at first but eventually just feels boring and gives you the feeling that the movie could have been 1,5 hours shorter.Looking back at the actual events in the movie, very few things happened.Having every scene be twice as long as they needed to be, combined with the quite large amount of characters, there is little to no time for ""character-building"" for anyone but the main character. Making you feel close to nothing when any side character is at risk of dying/dying.I don't really feel any ""closer"" to any of the characters after the movie compared to before.You're given the feeling that the movie is supposed to lead somewhere but it just doesn't.. Maybe in part 2?...Was a decent watch but a bit too overhyped, hopefully part 2 will be less ""deep"" and more ""do"".",Dune
1542,yoentjebbes,Impressive for both fans and non-fans,9,1 October 2021,"I saw it in 3D at the movies yesterday with my wife. I'm a huge fan, saw the David Lynch movie over and over, also the extended version (didn't like it much), the mini series from 2000 and of course the books (although only read until volume 4). My wife didn't know about Dune until she met me; she never saw any films or read any part of it.And we both were immensely impressed! What a movie!The images are really amazing, it really brings the atmosphere of a vast and dangerous hot sand planet and the harshness of politics and religious fanatics involved. My wife was overwhelmed, almost emotional. The movie follows the book perfectly (in contrast to David's Lynch's movie!) and only treats just the necessary information needed to follow the story so I can understand why some reviews say it is slow or not complete. But fans can recognize many details in it from the books which makes it really fun to watch!The story and characters are slowly evolving through images and not so much words or actions. The Fremen in the desert are really ferocious through their quietness and harsh looks and brutal decisions, really like you would expect from living on such a planet. And very different from the Fremen or other people living in the cities who are much more dependent on the rulers and living almost enslaved. A very short scene from Salusa Secundus depict the Sardaukar as fanatical soldiers but in an almost religious way. You can feel almost everyone in the story having a hidden agenda, although there is little explanation. Yes a lot of the story is left out but these all short but very impressive powerful scenes makes up for it. And made it great to watch for us both.The cutting in half of the story is well done, very distinct next chapter that will hopefully be filmed as soon as possible!",Dune

1550,mobblethewale,Distinctive look and feel,9,18 October 2021,"Imagining what Hollywood would consider a more bombastic filmization of Dune to be, I was afraid that it would be too close to Star Wars in look and feel. But I was pleasantly surprised. The graphic design of costumes, machines and environment is incredibly unique. You will not mistake this universe for anything else.The sound design is quite different from most mainstream films as well. Instead of upbeat, sad or sweeping music, most of the film ist filled with droning sounds or unrecognizable singing. Even though good music has often elevated films, I still think that this was the right decision. While your eyes are glued to the screen nothing in the movie will divert your attention away from the amazing visuals and convincing acting performances.The restraint the movie showed also positively surprised me. It paces the introduction well and does not dump all exposition at once. It takes its time with showing us a sandworm. Instead of expediting the slow start and starting in medias res it trusts its audience to have patience and rewards it with a well-paced plot and spread-out feasts for the eyes.As someone who read the books I also consider this an excellent filmization. Like the Lord of the Rings adaptions its main objective seems to be a retelling in spirit instead of letter of the story while never straying far from the plot which I consider entirely appropriate for such a story. One tiny detail that annoyed me is that while most of the Islamic inspirations of the books were translated to the film, it talked about a holy war instead of a Jihad, at least in the German synchronization. While it is a minor annoyance this deviation was entirely avoidable and not a result of understandable restrictions like budget or time.One thing to note is that this is a film that takes itself incredibly serious. I can only remember one funny moment and one scene with a cute animal. This is not a family movie and anyone not willing to put up with the slow pace of the plot or anyone not interested in the universe and visuals will probably be disappointed. The seriousness elevated the movie even further for me though.This is definitely a movie to watch in the cinema. My TV and sound system would not have been able to adequately convey the awesome achievements in picture and sound of this movie.",Dune

Of course it's Denis Villeneuve, so it can never be really bad. The cinematography was great as always, and the score was great (it reminded me somewhat of a sci-fi version of Morricone's score for Once Upon a Time in the West). But the dialogue and acting seemed surprisingly flat - it felt like every line of dialogue tried to be pompous and poetic, but without really saying anything. We never really got to know, why we should care about the characters.The 2 hours and 35 minutes run-time also suffers from the fact that it's the first of two (or even three) films - so much that the story can't really stand on its own. The heavy use of slow motion doesn't really help the case either, and the film ends up being a pretty but very slow (and it comes from a guy who enjoys Tarkovsky and Bergman quite a lot) and incredibly empty viewing experience.",Dune

You know the one, the sound used in every trailer for 10 years now. And the Hans Zimmer score was so predictably boring and tells you how to feel about every little interaction. For such a fresh looking movie I feel like a more contemporary composer would have brought something extra to this. The acting is so either over the top or way too understated and was oddly similar to the Lynch directed 1984 version.I am a fan of Chalamet but found his acting too un-natural for this role. I appreciated that he looked young and out of his depth but his emoting just didn't work. I couldn't care about this character and what happened to him. And then Jason Mamoa and his big goofy machismo was just clownishly over-played.

Timothee Chalamet is breathtaking and his performance will haunt you in the best way possible. My appreciation for his art grows deeper by the day. Oscar Isaac is the perfect match for Duke Leto.

1559,virginiatilley,Enthralling,9,27 October 2021,"I first read the novel shortly after it came out and several times after that, engrossed by its fascinating world building including a poetic indigenous desert culture, mystical philosophy, allusions to a deep and traumatic history of several millennia and galactic political scheming that today suggests Game of Thrones. I was therefore dreading this film, expecting it would fail, due partly to the trailers that suggested gargantuan bang-pow CGI and partly to the catastrophic earlier attempt by Lynch.What a joyful surprise to find this interpretation so faithful to the mood, characterizations and events described in the book. It's entrancing, absorbing, enthralling and a monumental success. Coupled to part two when that comes out - not making it is unimaginable - this is a near-revolutionary contribution to the sci fi film genre and a splendid monument to Herbert's workInevitably, much is cut out in this mostly expositional ""part one."" What suffers most are the conversations and meetings by which we come to appreciate the complex characters and relations among the Duke, Thufir Hawat, Gurney Halleck (no balliset here) and Yueh. Viewers who haven't read the book won't pick up here on the true identity and perspective of Liet Kynes or how the Bene Gesserit operate (e.g., they are certain to miss crucial moments such as Jessica's accidental discovery of the term ""maker"" while interviewing the Shadout Mapes). Characters other than Jessica and Paul are outlines to be filled in later. But the larger tone and mystique of events is beautifully conveyed, with generous help from Zimmerman's astonishing, mesmerizing score.This film also stands out as perhaps the best use of CGI I've ever seen. The giant ships, rather than providing eye-popping action, instead convey merely by their stark, gravity-defying grandeur that we are indeed eight millennia on the future (a history only suggested in the book by opaque lines such as the religious injunction that ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind""). The worms, thankfully, are depicted with a beauty that makes sense of their Fremen deification as Shai-hulud. If the CGI desert doesn't convey the magic of the desert cinematography in Lean's immortal Lawrence of Arabia, the loss isn't serious.I had just one quibble about something few are likely to notice, and that was Timothée Chalamet's spoken lines. No artificial British accents in this film, but the actors have a range of mostly non-American accents and all have the diction that these roles call for. The character of Paul, the ducal heir, is multi-lingual and hyper-educated by our standards. Yet Chalamet's accent is unvarnished US-high-school, a bit slurred, a bit nasal, and, crucially, not matching the accents of those playing Paul's family. I was pulled out of the illusion every time he opened his mouth. Hopefully someone will work with him to improve this in part two.",Dune

1562,mileseross,*HOT TAKE* A Visual Bore,5,21 September 2021,"Almost all the reviews I've read rave about the ""visual brilliance"" or ""stunning cinematography,"" while (occasionally) complaining about the slow pace of the plot or anticlimactic ending. My qualm, however, is the exact opposite.I have no problems with the plot, pacing, etc. Whatsoever. The story is complex and the movie needs to set up and explain a lot of components of Herbert's universe to make it understandable to viewers who haven't read the book.What I found to be unbearable was the visual dullness of Villeneuve's vision. Yes, there are some nice shots of sand and desert, but other than that we see a visual language that was completely contained to two colors: Orange (sand) and Gray (uniforms + ships). Even on Caladan, a supposedly lush world, grey dominates with only a few specks of green.I was hoping for a unique vision of Herbert's universe that would play on the variety of planets that the main factions arise from: Atreides - Caladan (Oceanic), Fremen - Arrakis (Desert), Harkonnen - Giedi Prime (Industrial), Sardaukar - Salusa Secundus (Prison). Yet despite all these different backgrounds and cultures, we get one color: Gray. Harkonnens are dark gray, Sardukar are light gray, Atreides are just gray gray, and Fremen are sandy gray.This monochrome palette, accompanied by uninspired costume and ship design (grey boxes), leads to a thoroughly uninteresting visual experience. I understand that Villeneuve is a very serious director and was trying to make a very ""serious"" adaptation of Dune, but serious doesn't necessarily have to be boring.Perhaps I was spoiled by Lynch's Dune, which while bizarre and deviated from the plot heavily, at least is more visually interesting. Not to mention the concept art for Jodorowsky's Dune.",Dune

1564,lenwenzellw,Sadly misses much of the character of Herberts Dune,7,17 October 2021,"From the beginning I found characterizations weak. The postures of the actors, and the energy of their bodies and voices were unable to sell the dialogue. It felt in general watered down. Like the production tried to get too far in the story without setting up the qualities, and backgrounds of the main characters.All characters in a legendary story need to be larger than life to immerse the audience in the mood of the story. Subtleties of character are communicated, and a story, at its deepest level is told without dialogue. That way the audience is immersed, and carried by the different levels of story.Jessica was weak, and mouse like, especially in front of her master in her order. Completely unlike her training which would have strengthened her character in paranormal, and martial strength. Those weakness's were seen in many places in movement, and bodies position.Paul had a slouching posture, completely unlike the quality he would have with martial arts, and philosophy.Gurney Halleck was without the qualities of a troubadour, which should have a more poetic bent of soul; instead he was brisk, without depth of character, or poetry of his soul.Thufir Hawett was more a squat fireplug shaped person without the presence of emotionless logic that being a living computer would have lent him. Being a master of assassins, and a living computer he would have needed to make swift judgments without emotion, yet having immense strength of personalty and character, but that is not what his character seems to portray.It seemed like not only were the characters colourless, but the background colours of the world, were entirely grey, or a light sand brown. Then there is the desert dunes, which if they were subject to high winds there were be no sharp edges, and the dunes would all be aligned in the similiar directions. Yet here the dunes had sharp edges, and dunes beside each other all were oriented in random directions. It was too random of an order to be part of nature. In a place of high winds, the wind itself would structure the order of the dunes.In general Dune tries to do too much, with short scenes, and colourless backgrounds. There were no lengthy dialogues that in a good story reveal who the characters really are, and make the audience want to be part of the story.After my personal experience of having been a huge fan of Herbert's Dune, and having read personal correspondence from Herbert regarding his world I think he would have supported the film while at the same time been disappointment.",Dune

I'm afraid that we won't get volume 2.One of the most amazing things about Dune, is how many other stories were inspired by it.It's also very frustrating because you're dropped (as a reader/viewer into a strange new world. The politics don't make sense yet. ) into new world.Bottom line: so far, great adaptation from book to film.",Dune
1566,djvelas,Newbies wouldn't understand,6,5 November 2021,I haven't read the book or know much about this book/film. So I was going into this fresh and new.I was sort of lost in the film. Nothing really was explained. What's the voice? Who is this priestess order? The emperor is afraid? The hand movements? Why is that guys eyes white?I can see why this book has a following. It makes me want to read it because I need to know what is actually happening.It's pretty much a two hour film with slow-mo shots.The desert was beautiful. The movie is shot beautifully. I just would like to understand what's happening.,Dune
1567,janichsan-1,"Visually impressive, yet weirdly insubstantial",7,16 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's Dune might be one of the visually most impressive movies in that genre I have seen so far.Every shot is masterly arranged and composed, the landscapes breathtaking, and the effect shots of gargantuan spaceships and architecture awe inspiring.The cast is excellent, but in part underused. Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson stand out, but Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, and Stellan Skarsgård all leave their mark. Dave Bautista and Javier Bardem unfortunately only have very little screentime.My biggest gripe with the cast was Zendaya's overtly American accent. While all other actors of Fremen characters speak with relatively indistinct ""foreign"" accents, Zendaya sounds as if the came straight from some Californian beach.The music is atmospheric and masterful, but too loud. Some crucial dialogue gets droned out - certainly not a problem unique to this movie.Unfortunately, it shows that Villeneuve struggled with adapting Frank Herbert's novel to a script. Hardly anyone would have expected that the source material, which is extremely dense on world-building details and internal monologue, could be brought to the screen without cutting some fat.But despite the runtime of two and a half hours and the split of the story in two (planned) parts, the movie sometimes feels rushed, glossing over important aspects and minimising the roles of important characters of the novel. Even worse, Villeneuve seems to rely a couple of times on the viewer's knowledge of the novel to fill in crucial information.The ending is literally anti-climactic. The split of the story occurs at roughly the half-way point of the novel after a not unimportant, but far less dramatic moment than several coming before. As a result, the movie weirdly peters out, without even something that could be called a cliffhanger.I do really hope the movie is successful enough to warrant the necessary sequel. As it stands, it would be a shame if the story had to remain unfinished.",Dune
1568,erikoksman,I haven't read the book Dune and it shows... maybe.,4,13 October 2021,"I haven't read the book Dune and it shows... maybe.For me, the film Dune didn't feel like a film. It felt more like a trailer to a film. Or a showcasing of a marvelous landscape with uninteresting characters occupying it. It's a film which didn't inspire me to read the book, because everything I enjoyed about it was purely cinematic.If I was asked to summarize some themes the film explores, it would prove to be a difficult task. Hints of environmentalism without really saying anything about it. And no, a film doesn't have to have obvious themes for it to work, but what else did this film offer other than beautiful visuals? As far as I know, Dune (novel) has been highly influential in sci-fi and in fiction as a whole since it's release. I would argue that this works against the film, since everything it seems to offer in terms of plot and characters have been seen plenty of times in other works already. How does Chalamet's Paul Atreides differ from, say, Harry Potter? None of the other characters stand out either, apart from the cool design of Vladimir Harkonnen. For me, Dune functioned as worldbuilding for the sake of worldbuilding and beautiful landscapes for the sake of beautiful landscapes. It doesn't work as a stand-alone piece, but I acknowledge my position in the minority when saying this.",Dune
1569,oliverricard,ASEPTIC. Beatiful but lacks the creativity that fantasy needs.,6,25 September 2021,"During years as a kid Dune was something apart, nor good or bad, but really something very different, almost mysteriuos, so the source material allows imagination to run wild. Lynch grasped this, but failed in some excess of freakism, even bad taste and obviosuly in the underdeveloped and soft storytelling from a huge and difficult novel. Now Villeneuve makes the contrary, makes Dune fit in his personal style (very questionable in itself), correctly solidifies and get serious in the storytelling, but in doing so Dune becomes monolithic aestheticly and builds a rather boring world or universe, too similar to common earth and people (the scotisch bagpipe scene is just totally ridiculous and infantile). Visuals and effects are very good and beatiful in form; but as said, they lack this vast creativity in content, that Lynch at least tried. Just compare the space or guild navigators from one and the other film, and it is clear that Lynch was far more attractive to fantasy or science fiction lovers, far more imaginative. I think that the Batman of Nolan has badly influenced some news fantasy or science-fiction projects; which now try to be basically realistic. And this, with Dune, is a complete error. On the other side, there is again the tendency of music to be ever present, also a Zimmer and/or Nolan usual trick, too loud and always in every scene triying to overcome the listener by any means, as if they do not trust in the story itself. The film has the climax in the attack and scape of Paul, very good made in all possible senses, and characthers are well developed in the limits of a movie with so many facets. Perhaps villians are a weak point too, not much presence and first appearences rather superficial ('kill them all', again the same topic villian phrase or ""I will free you'...and 'zas', also a repetition of other known scenes of cinema) And that's all from them. If there is a second part they will need to boost this side a lot. For me the movie leaves a sense of losing a great opportunity, special effects allow now to adapt very well the novel, public was prepared for a serious approach (as the mainly good critics received inidicate) but they have been too conservative. Dune should be a magic and ocult, grotesque, opulent, distant, terrorific and multicolored world. An immense wide panorama in constant contrast with the infinite sands of the harsch desert; but Villeneuve has reduced to a monochromatic and aseptic world, the desert has defeated him; perhaps fearing the Lynch big dreams and failure.",Dune

The only problem I have is now I have to wait at least a year if not more for the next one to come out.I think it was a big mistake for WB to release this on HBOMax as that will kill the revenue for this movie. Even I saw it on HBOMax because it's so convenient, though my wife looked at me after we were done watching it and said we had to see it again in the theater now :)But many will not and I honestly don't know how you can properly gauge revenue under this model.

Its fascinating how everything has an explanation. And even though they don't actually explain everything you just understand it by watching, like the use of hand wield weapons ( has a perfectly reasonable explanation).Plus the hand to hand combat makes the fights in the movie so much more personal and dramatic.I just loved every bit of this movie and I recommend everyone to go watch in imax.

What the fxxx happened here?Simple I talked to people without my knowledge of the books and as I entered the cinema a second time, I really like this movie, I was there with a friend without any knowledge of the books. This second time I tried to watch the movie from the view of my friend. What should I say. To be honest I wouldn't understand anything.While the David Lynch version tries to explain as lot as possible lack this version almost every explanation.David Lynch let us hear the thoughts of the people or explained with an guild report what is going on. This version explains nothing.Why is Hue a traitor and why is this so extraordinary?What is a mendat?What are the Sardaukar?What is the Quisatz Haderach?Who are those Bene Geserit?Why is spitting on a table a gesture of respect?Why don't they use those Laser (Lasguns) to shoot at their enemies?Etc..Conclusion: If you can answer all the questions above, and more, you know your stuff and can enjoy the movie.

1578,aakhgar,"""SPEED BUMPS ARE NEEDED AT THE THEATRE EXITS""",1,27 October 2021,"This was the worst 155 minutes in my over 50 years of watching films. An absolute waste of time and a real insult to my intelligence. The movie is based on a half baked futuristic original story by a nitwit writer that even extremely talented David Lynch couldn't turn into a watchable film [Dune, 1984]. The cinemas showing this new version need speed bumps at the exits. It takes real skill to turn the original story into an even worse movie but the director managed to achieve that. Not surprising though considering his history of ruining even good stories. It's mind bugling that making this worthless piece of insult cost over $160,000,000. More like the first project of a movie production student with a budget of $1,600. No one who knows something about movies would give this boring, drab and lifeless movie even half a star but in the climate of 'take the social media's word for it' this so-called director is being praised for his talent by some.As for the brutally untalented Timothée Chalamet, he must have a powerful uncle or someone in the business. I can't think of any other reason for anyone giving him a role in any movie.The movie ends with a hint that a sequel is to follow. Taking the Milking Tradition established during the last 44 years by the head of the milking industry, Mr. George Lucas, we are sure to see many Dunes to come.If the imposter director and the talentless actor are the future of the film industry ... bye bye, movies.",Dune
1579,olsenry-04499,"WAY too much expo. Show, don't tell.",3,25 October 2021,"First off: the good..... The costume design, set design and location scout all deserve super high praise. The film looks gorgeous and basically took all the amazing things from Miller's most recent Mad Max and copied the formula for set, location and memorable costumes (but in a really clever new way). There are some truly mesmerizing shots in this film.Now for the bad: the tempo of this movie is incredibly inconsistent. I complemented Dune for taking what Miller perfected in Mad Max. The sets, costumes and locations are top notch. But Dune could have learned more from a film genius like Miller about how to set up a plot, character development and pacing. The characters in Dune do nothing interesting until the movie is more than halfway over. I understand that the producers want to milk this franchise like the next Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter but this film falls miles short from either of those two success stories. The whole time watching this I was thinking, 'this would be so much better as a Game of Thrones style series'. You can't jam that much exposition and plot building in the first half of your movie. Go back and watch the Fellowship of the Ring and then watch Dune right after. You will immediately realize that Peter Jackson knows how to show you a story and guide you through a character building adventure. But in Dune, you spend agonizing minutes focusing on an important plot point that will be important to the future going forward but then bogs down the intro to all the characters and immediate plot. I felt like I was watching the longest episode of the most over achieving television series ever. Constantly, a scene would end and I would expect an episode ending theme song like in Vikings, The Mandalorean, or Game of Thrones.The most glaring example of over explanation that destroyed the pacing of the movie was during the scene where Paul's mother is selecting a new housemaid. Introducing the blade as an important plot point at that part of the film ruined the pacing because some unimportant character goes to great lengths to describe a future plot point as if the viewers are too dumb to figure it out.It would have been so much better if Paul had defeated the guy in the duel and then tried to take the blade but then realized that he wasn't ""worthy"" of the blade. If you want to add future development to the character of Paul, make the audience question why isn't he ""worthy"" yet. It then becomes a type of sword in the stone character build or Thor in Ragnarok when he realizes he doesn't need the hammer.This movie had so much potential but seemed to look ahead at the upcoming franchise and forgot to focus on the first step.",Dune

I tend to fall into the middle of these contradicting ideologies. I love Dune as a story and truly believe that Denis Villeneuve brought a very solid adaptation to the screen, but Frank Herbert's writing is not on the level that many other ""classic"" authors is.That being said, Villeneuve was able to piece together one of the best films I've seen all year. Some things from Dune that I never thought would have worked on screen looked amazing. The parts from the book that I thought were a little clunky were adapted slightly to give the story a more realistic feel.There were a couple of scenes that were meant to be very emotional, but I didn't feel the core of the emotion. (I felt that way throughout the novel, though, so it's not a jab at the film)Overall, I loved this movie.

1592,Mr_Yellow7,Not the Oasis You Would Expect.,7,22 October 2021,"(Scroll to the bottom for TL;DR)
Let me start by saying I've never read the books. However, the movie does well to set up the world that you are about to spend what feels like an eternity but also an hour, which in reality is 2h35m.My main complaint being the pacing. Which, it seems is the main complaint for most and for good reason. The movie feels like it's trying hard to be half art/indie and half blockbuster. I'm familiar with Denis' other films and the former would make sense to me.There are set pieces that are set up for the whole movie and then are ended in 30 seconds or less when you get to them. The whole scene with the barons ""death"" I thought was going to be more dramatic and intense but it was literally 15 seconds; meanwhile they spend so much time showing people flying around in those dragonfly ships that I still don't know the name of.Visually, the movie is very dark. It is hard to see what is going on at some points. And I saw every shade of beige ever. However that means that the small amount of plant life you do get to see makes it that much more worth it. Which I suppose the idea is but I'm being nitpicky.Also, do not go to this movie if you are hoping to see Javier, Bautista or Brolin for more than 5 minutes of screen time. I believe Bautista only had 2 or 3 lines and he's touted as a main character???Negatives aside the movie is genuinely great to look at (when you can see what's going on). The visuals are amazing if you can get past how bland the color palette can be. Seeing some of the concept art from the film being made into ""reality"" was great!Acting was great as well as you'd expect from the cast.The soundtrack was AMAZING! It set the tone for scenes perfectly and it felt like It actually belonged in that universe. There were even bagpipes at one point!Overall, I wouldn't say this is a defining sci fi modern classic by any means as some would suggest. It can be sluggish at points and too short at others. Beautiful but also bland. There is still another movie to see for the final verdict though and I will wait for it patiently.",Dune

1598,astridgelmini,The film of the year,10,2 November 2021,"I think Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a great gift to cinema in general, there haven't been films like this in a long time.To put it bluntly, this film is epic with an epic cast.The director outdid himself and impressed the audience in an incredible way: the drama, the emotions and the effects, he completed the sci-fi genre.This ambitious director, screenwriter and producer amazed me like few others.Villeneuve did not create a film where you have to follow the dialogues but rather one where you have to follow the images, he expresses himself and presents a film based on beautiful shots.When I came out of the cinema my thought was: OMG what have I seen!I felt excited and at the same time confused.Confused because the plot is not very clear, maybe because of the many characters and the fact that each of them has their own story, but in the end that is also why it is beautiful.There are two ways to understand it: read the book and pay attention when watching it. I say the same when I hear criticism about it or when I hear people thinking that there was absolutely a need for an opening scene to explain the setting of the film.In short, document yourselves!The events take place in the future in the year 10'191, most of the film,
on a planet called Arrakis. It's interesting how people are ahead of technology, but society not. They are inside a feudal society, similar to medieval Europe, I think this because the feelings of human beings are the same, the kind of conflicts and the family is above everything.I also find this modernity-antiquity conflict interesting.The author of the book, Frank Herbert, was a bomb of imagination and a genius, and Denis Villeneuve the same.Now let's talk about the music, it must be said, the composer, Hans Zimmer amazed again, every time you heard his fantastic melody, you got goosebumps. Luckily, I had the chance to see it at the cinema, and thanks to that the emotions I felt were impressive and almost indescribable.Music is POETRY, it's an important piece to complete the puzzle of the film and impressive.It's fascinating how music can make everything more complete, without it the film would have been completely different.Now, the special effects, they are impressive and fantastic.They are so realistic that the audience feels like they are on Arrakis. And, speaking of Arrakis,
the poetry of the desert is well placed and takes its necessary part.I also find the colour palette appropriate,
with tones ranging from grey-blue to yellow-orange, these colours are perfect to describe the surroundings, the buildings made by humans and the great expanse of desert that characterises the planet.When you are in the Harkonnen house the colours change to black-grey, so it is inevitable that the Harkonnen are associated with the colour black.Turning now to the acting which I think is excellent, at a high level, the kind of acting that makes the audience feel the emotions felt by the characters.Timothée Chalamet played Paul Atreides fantastically, making it clear that he is an admirable actor.Likewise Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto.Against that, I think Rebecca Ferguson's character could be less psychopathic and paranoid.In the book she's portrayed as thoughtful and cautious while in the film it's as if she's insane. At least that's my impression, maybe I played Lady Jessica differently than DV.I also think Zendaya could have done more in this movie, the scenes where she talks are very few, she could have integrated more, against my argument though, it has to be said that this is only the first movie and another one is to come out.Finally, I think this film is not just for sci-fi fans but for anyone who likes to get to the end and not have everything clear in their mind.I recommend it to those who like art within a film and those who like beautiful cinematography and epic shots in general, instead I don't recommend it to those who like ""simple"" films.Thanks for reading this far :)",Dune
1599,gjgmwr,"Villenueve's cinematographic greatness, but that's about it...",7,29 October 2021,"After some expensively long 2 hours and 30 minutes, I still don't know what this movie is about.A tone of characters and ideias are introduced in the first moments of the movie, but other than Paul Atreides and his parents, there is no real development of any other characters (maybe because everyone ends up dying).I also though the filmmakers played slightly confusing ideas. They tried to incorporate too many events (which I am guessing are in the book) on little detail and thereby failed to express their main points after constraining the movie to the entanglement of confusing developing ideas.Zendaya is terribly overhyped at the launch of this film. Obviously, there's going to be a second part, where everyone expects her presence to be more relevant, given that in this movie her role could be filmed in 2 or 3 days and I could have played it myself. Furthermore, when she does finally appear in the present action, her entry is insignificantly dry.By now, no one can deny how beautiful Villenueve's movies are. From arrival, to blade runner 2049, this is another worthy beauty, despite feeling a bit too overwhelming sometimes.Jason Momoa (Duncan) is underdeveloped. With the potential to become one of the films most appealing characters, his presence is always left in-between the light and the shadow until he becomes somewhat of the failed sacrifice. His death should have, dramatically and emotion wise, given a much bigger impact to the film, but it simply doesn't because of how under-explored and developed his character was throughout.Rebecca Ferguson, gives without a doubt, the best performance in the movie.",Dune

The movie is very detailed cinematically, the ships are portrayed to be huge and the details in the wardrobe and housing is amazing. The story itself is not very detailed or explained deeply, but it is not hard to follow. It reminds me of all my favorite movies mashed into one; star wars, harry potter, and alien. I will say this movie does feel like a part one and is ended in a way to ensure there will be more to the story. I loved this movie and I cannot wait for the others.

I was a child when I saw the movie for the first time (on t.v.) It made an ever lasting impression. The adventure, the deserts, the noblese, telepathy, everyting very classy and misterious. This time I went to see it in the cinema and I hoped they made a new knight-story of it. Sadly enough the new Dune came down to fighting, bombing and dying. These scenes didn't add anything to the storieline. These moments could better been used to give the main character some personality. Instead there was a weird scene in which he undresses himself in the presence of his mother, what made the movie feel very American instead sci-fy. The last scenes were allready anounced in the visions of the main character. The surprice was gone and there was nothing to be exciteted for. Finaly, the last half hour or so, it ended with people walking around in bikersuits in the Wadi Rum. Suddenly it felt more like a cheap roadmovie. That was exactly what I feared for.

Everything else, from the acting to the visuals to the unbearable, blaring music, is just tripe.I guess the director saw Prometheus, fell in love with it and decided to make the same film. By blind luck he chose the novel Dune as basis and thanks to that gains a few points.Plus of course they had to make it a series, that's just compulsory now.

The casting for each character is perfect and actors play their role to the finest. To summarize, everything needed to bring the world of dune on the big screen is done perfectly. Be it the crew, cast, direction, vfx etc.For someone who has read the novel, the movie might feel that it lacks in explaining a lot of details of Dune, which is necessary to understand the dynamics of this world.Dune is a complex story with lot of world building which takes time to explain and understand. So it is understandable that not all the things have been explained in the movie. For now Dune: Part One feels like a easy pill to swallow for the audience to generate a good fan following.Hope Dune: Part Two dwells more into the politics, technology and other dynamics of this world.",Dune
1621,kingsword,"Technically competent, emotionally stunted yet not eloborated story",7,4 November 2021,"Villeneuve once again delivers with his epic spaces and poetic cinematography which does a lot of depicting on the visuals for the book reader. What he does lack is the life in those characters except a couple maybe. A lot of screentime comes in the form of visions that aren't carrying the story forward yet blurring the very little that we are told. For a book reader that can still remember the story, not much is lost but I suspect a lot of confusion and misunderstanding for someone lacking the background knowledge of the setting. What's a mentat? Why are Sardaukars feared? What is the Landsraat? We are spared from critical info that would draw our interest in the story. So many characters having barely a couple of minutes or less, their lines compacted while there is no shortage of a myriad of visions with Zendaya. All together, there is a sense of sterility and disconnection that is hard to describe but permeates the movie. We go through the motions of the story but I found myself reminiscing the parts from the book at times instead.While this is a technically very well shot, impressive movie but I'm not able to say that it's the treatment Dune deserved. I can only hope that in my lifetime, there will be another adaptation by a director who can focus on the story and characters instead of just the visuals and sound.

The actual movie consists of 1 dimensional acting, confusing sentences that are meant to be deep philosophical sayings such as 'too shower you scrub your ass with sand' and way too many stereotypical sci-fi shots (space ships landing, walking off spaceships, less than impressive dramatic landscapes, and lens flares over people's faces).

1627,bogymel,A wonderful and complex story stripped bare,2,26 October 2021,"I seriously don't understand why people like this movie. I went to the cinema full of hope, listening to all the voices that praised it, to the long round of applause it received at first screening.Are people these days only impressed by pretty visuals and long scenes of nothing? Is that enough for a movie to be considered great? Just that? Dear lord...Yes, visuals are stunning and they manage to paint the Dune universe very well. Music is also on point, I mean, Hans Zimmer. Enough said.However, it's just an empty husk, and an hour too long. It's as soulless and pretentious as the most vain and superficial Instagram influencer, just a very nicely decorated box, but empty.Story is stripped to its barebones, although pretty faithful to the book. It rushes over every action scene in favour of presenting, long, pointless scenery and people staring into the abyss. The world is dead and only the main characters and some secondaries are moving around here and there. The dune world devoid of life. The main city looks deserted. Didn't they have enough money for extras, I wonder? Arrakis may be barren, but it's not a dead world!Characters are just as barren as their surroundings. Important characters from the book are missing entirely, some of the ones not missing are stripped bare, others are just plain wrong. Dialogue is also stripped to the bone, nothing memorable is being said here.It has nothing apart from the modern visuals over previous iterations, in fact, the Dune and Children of \dune miniseris made by SciFi, with a very low budget, and poorly acted for the most part has more to offer than this.This movie is like opening that delicious looking box of chocolates and finding that it's empty. I was extremely dissapointed and my day was ruined.",Dune
1628,marc-shellard,A near perfect beginning to what could be the next masterpiece saga,9,23 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is one of my all time favourite directors, responsible for modern sci-fi classics like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, underrated gems like Prisoners, Sicario and Enemy and one of my all-time favourite foreign language films Incendies. So naturally when I heard he was attached to direct Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic Dune, the project quickly became perhaps my most anticipated movie release of all time! He's the perfect choice to adapt this material, and has all the materials to make this series a modern day masterpiece saga the likes of which we haven't seen since Lord of the Rings.Needless to say my expectations were very high, and I'm so pleased to say it delivered in nearly every aspect. I was not expecting this to be what feels like an appetiser for a dense story yet to be told (was unaware this was called Dune: Part One), but the world and the characters are set up beautifully. The film is truly epic in scope but remains grounded with the characters. The cinematography is gorgeous complimented with a fantastic, fitting score. Sound design, world building, run down future technology, its just done superbly. The pacing is slow and deliberate but there's never a dull moment. Exposition is constant to get us to grips with this universe but it never feels forced or overbearing. I was nervous about Timothee Chalamet but he was great as the lead. All the supporting cast was fantastic but Rebecca Ferguson really stood out to me as being exceptional. It was a difficult job to balance between character development and world building but I think giving the preference to world building will pay off in the sequels. I honestly wish this film was even longer!Denis confirms his position as one of best working directors today with another modern sci-fi classic under his belt. Give this man more amazing material to bring to the screen! I hope that this becomes my next sci-fi obsession that increases with each instalment of this franchise, and I for one am excited to see where this story goes.Those that know me know I rarely give 10s, there's perhaps 20 films out of the 1,400 I've seen that have that honour and this might just be the first film in a year to earn a spot among the best of the best (last one The Holy Mountain watched Dec 2020).

1634,behinduall,Really good depiction of science fantasy or alternate science fiction,9,24 October 2021,"To elaborate more on the title, when I started reading Dune, it soon became apparent that there is no way there could be a reality without AI, and things like lasguns and shields existing, not to mention the feudal/aristocratic society. There can be discussions made in favor of feudal/aristocratic society existing as the best way to ensure stability and bring forth community wide concerted efforts to planet scale projects that we see in most science fiction stories today, but I digress.The movie's visuals are outstanding and literally out of this world. Unlike some of the other movies which have lackluster visual effects, this movie has probably the best CGI I have ever seen in a movie. The sand effects which meld in with the real world sand are second to none. It truly feels like you are watching it happen in real time.The discussion about the movie not being faithful to the book is unfounded. Denis has tried his best to bring artistic depth, action, world building and extravagance but at the cost of not making the film boring. And I understand that. There is no way a movie could have been made where all the conversations from the book were portrayed with even 50% accuracy. That amount of world building (not simply in terms of visuals) cannot happen in any other medium than that of a book. And anyone who has watched any respectable stories such as GoT and TLOTR etc. Will know that this is correct. Having said that, I believe when it comes to the visual aspects of world building, Denis does seem to have achieved it completely.There are two things which I don't like about this movie. The first is that each major actor other than Timothee and Rebecca have a 10 min max screen time. So even in a 2.5 hr movie it feels like there are only 2 people with others doing a cameo here and there. The second thing is that while I generally like Hans Zimmer's music in his movies made by Christopher Nolan, it seems to me that Hans has completely missed the mark on the tone of the film. In his other works such as Inception and Interstellar, which were much much harder to create music for, he seems to have nailed it, but in this one he is adding stark, harsh, rattly sound when there doesn't seem to be any need for it (when we see them flying over the desert over the sand wall). It was much easier for him to create music inspired by the desert and countries which have desert in them like most of middle east, Arabic countries, Egypt etc. And I think it would have fit perfectly with the theme of the gentle wind blowing in the desert, transporting sand across the planet.One last minor gripe about the movie is that, it is too short. I would have loved a 3.5-4 hr movie with a part 2 of course. I don't understand why hollywood hesitates to go anywhere close to the 3 hr mark. They probably think that people won't see the film because people won't have 3 hr contiguous time in their schedule or something. In any case, I would like to see a director's cut, extended cut or whatever that potentially brings the movie to the 3-3.5 hr mark. I have a feeling that it exists somewhere.And lastly, it would have been a better option to probably create the Dune saga as a TV series with a similar if not higher budget than GoT. I don't understand why this couldn't happen. Everybody would have loved to see those conversations and be as involved in the story as we all were with GoT. Warner Bros (or someone else) could have created a streaming platform just to stream the Dune series as a TV show and it would have netted them more money than the potential 3 parts of this movie (of the first book?). I don't know, super wasted potential there.",Dune
1635,roskvo,"Interesting, often beautiful, not entirely effective editing, music or dialogue",6,7 November 2021,"Pros:
-Much of the cinematography is naturalistic, CGI well disguised, lighting often mesmeric. Selection of close-ups and dream sequence images seperate it from previous adaptions aesthetically - only slight problem is that Villeneuve's characteristic neutral greyish tones are in every scene - some occasional colour accents might have been good to highlight key moments.-The vehicle design is fairly interesting, particularly the dragonfly copters.-Action sequences are well designed, particularly the attack on the mine and the sandstorm.-Actors generally performed well, although casting some Middle-Eastern or North-African actors might have helped lend it some more authenticity rather than just going with Villeneuve's favourite Hollywood a-team and Javier Bardem doing blackface - although he is a great actor.-Choice of location shoots was generally excellent e.g. The Wadi Rum for the populated rocky areas and Abu Dahbi's empty quarter for the dunes.-Generally has a dreamy, fluid but alien quality which probably compliments the source material while giving it a facelift - reminded me a little of Ridley Scott's 'Raised By Wolves' and his ad-campaign for Hennessey.-Costume designs are top-class and appropriate for conditions.-The giant sandworm is not fully unveiled until near the end of the film and is really beautifully designed - the sand dune effects compared very favourably with other desert based films from the last twenty years. Generally the film builds tension really well (but doesn't really do much with it).-Generally the world building is very good - for instance the capital city of Iraqis looks like a cross between Los Angeles from Blade Runner 1982 and a desert city in the ancient land of Sumer e.g. Uruk.-Weapons were nicely designed including the most convincing laser ray-gun I have ever seen in a sci-fi, with matching sound FX.Cons:
-Perhaps chose the wrong plot point to end on meaning that it does not sit well as a self-contained movie - not sure he will get the money to make another long film as a result of middling returns compared to spend - he's taken a big gamble there. On it's own, as a story, its a slightly forgettable rehash of the rather good first episode of the 3-part TV show version.-Sound design was patchy because of the often unnecessary imposition of booming, overbearing, hammy Hans Zimmer themes e.g. The battle scene - although, the strange Imperial language/music, voice over sections and atmospheric sounds were nicely executed.-Villeneuve's sci-fi seems to have an irritating obsession with things that inexplicably float, which removes us from being immersed in an otherwise convincing physical scene - make a choice: Is it bizarre Lynchesque fantasy or sci-fi realism? You can't really do both.-Villeneuve's interior sets seem to look very similar in his last three films - why? Does he have an obsession with a particular minimalist architect? The uniformity of it all is a bit distracting. Try something else Denis? Do all the planets use the same interior architect?-The elimination of most of the cultural research which Herbert used in the original text, to be replaced by a kind of bland American quasi-multicultural muddle i.e. They removed the controversial Arabic & Persian Sufi mysticism content for fear of offending some people.-The dialogue in the first forty minutes is clunky and exposition heavy, but does improve greatly thereafter, however there is a lot less of it. Consider that the main scriptwriter was the same guy who wrote Prometheus, which had terrible dialogue - he has improved a little, but with so much money spent on other things, why couldn't they afford a better writer?-As with Villeneuve's previous film, he introduces lots of characters as if they will play a key role, then they quickly disappear before any real developments unfold e.g. Fans of the books have pointed out that he glosses over characters that were very interesting in the book. If a film does not have the time to cover background characters properly, then make a clear choice to be more singular and stop drawing so much attention to them before hastely dropping them.-It feels like a three hour film that has had key scenes removed for fear of alienating an audience, but the character development suffers as a result.",Dune

Denis Villeneuve may have started a masterpiece that has been missing to the cinema world for along time now, with both an impossible adaptation of a reference book and a capacity to demonstrate that cinema is still an art that can reach masses with high quality and subtlety.I wish this Dune movie a great success that will open to the next parts of it and write a brilliant and needed page in cinema history.",Dune
1637,pa-stypinsky,A movie for the film enthusiast.,6,21 October 2021,"This is a beautiful movie, a technical masterpiece, stars all over, complex to the bone - and it has so little love for the characters.. I felt truly disappointed when I left the theater because this movie held so much potential but just wasn't able to get the characters going - possibly due to the nature of the books.Am I going to see the next one - yes. Am I dying to see it because I'm so involved - no.",Dune
1638,jorshansky,Slightly disappointed,6,23 October 2021,"First thing I should mention is that I read the book. I read all 6 of them, many, many times, and over the years I noticed a lot of small details that normally would be missed by someone who read the book once and then put it away.It was my obsession with the story that made this movie highly enjoyable, but also slightly disappointing.The cast was perfect. When you read a book you get a certain image of the character in your head. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that despite some discrepancies in physical characteristics I liked almost every character. CGI was great, which goes without saying. And that famously dreamy mood that runs through all Denis's movies was wonderful. But I also enjoyed some of the small details, like references to the bull , and Greek frescos on Caladan (Atreides descended from the Greek king Atreus), and glow globes, and some art from the original book covers, like large spaces and spacing guild heighliners.The script writers obviously paid very close attention to the book. But there was just one problem with this movie and I can't really say I can blame anyone for it.There was no coherent story here. Dune is such an epic that I think it is probably impossible to squeeze it into measly 3 hours. Or 5 hours. Or 20 hours. It's like trying to render War and Peace in 30 minute short film.The actors were wonderful but their characters were not well developed. Many important things were not explained. There is no back history for any of them. Gurney, Duncan, Thufir, Yueh, are just an entourage. There was no mention of such an unimaginable thing as breaking imperial conditioning of a Suk doctor. No explanation of Mentats. I was really disappointed with Piter DeVries having less screen time than Beast Rabban. And all those special names ""Lisan Al Gaib"" ""Kwisatz Haderach"" ""Mahdi"" (I can't believe I spelled them all correctly on the first try) are just words that create mood but don't really mean anything.It is too big of a story to tell, and though Dune fanatics like me understood what went on in this movie, for a regular viewer this story will probably be too vague, and I don't think Dune will make enough money at the box office to warrant a sequel. I hope I am wrong about that.",Dune
1639,slaintemhath,Should have embraced the oddness,6,23 September 2021,"I've read everything Dune related multiple times over the previous 40 years.There's no doubt this is a beautiful creation meticulously crafter, but I didn't care about the characters or feel any bond or relationship between them. Dune is set so far in the future that humanity should be almost unrecognisable and that's where Lynches Dune wins hands down. The elaborate production design, the oddness of everything marks it as unfamiliar. This version could almost be a 90's news report from the oil fields of Iraq. It's too solid, too real.The importance of Spice and that it's a hallucinogen never gains any traction. Pauls visions could be teenage daydreams about woman in a music video.I felt there was a major flaw as Duncans shielded ornithopter was chased by a laser, something which would have resulted in the destruction of the ship with the weapon. Why were these soldiers from the future running about with swords? Readers of the books know of course, a simple line of exposition explained why shields were useless in the desert. There were huge expansive scenes which existed only for a moment.Lynches Dune may be deeply flawed but I feel it did a lot more with a lot less. The voiceovers may have been a distraction but they helped fill in a lot of essential exposition.",Dune

Don't waste your time and money on regular digital in the theater... it's such a disservice to this spectacular masterpiece.

That set is empty, only a few cardboard cutouts walk about therein tediously slowly.

Apparently, he had no time to waste for such unimportant elements as a proper story or characters the viewer could invest in.",Dune
1643,Zelazek,Absolute Guff,3,30 October 2021,"The effects are good. I will say that much about it. Everything else is bad. Everything that is bad about sci-fi is here. Corny character names. Borrowed religious ideas. Gigantic versions of animals you find on Earth. Banal, lifeless and cringeworthy dialogue. Why do the armies of civilisations that have mastered space travel still fight with knives? I don't know.Overpowering music. The actors were often inaudible. Aren't they taught voice projection anymore? They were often invisible as well - half the film takes place in that semi-darkness that directors love. I wasn't grabbed by any of the cardboard cutout characters and I didn't care about the story. I won't be looking out for part two.",Dune
1644,eamonnkenny,"This is a proper movie, not a book",9,22 October 2021,"I was reading Dune when it wasn't very popular and if I had my wish I'd want the first four books to appear on the big screen.So lets start with the negatives. Feyd's early scene from Chapter 1 of the first book does not appear. This could be seen as a mistake because you don't have a context for ""the plan"" of the Harkkonens, but you can see why this was done if Part II is made. He is very promenient in part II.Also, another very disappointing scene is the ecological scene underground. In the book we are met with a big surprise. This again seems like a holdback for part II (the big reveal). You just get a teaser.Visually the film is amazing and I brought my 3 teenagers to see it with me. My son has read the book and loved the movie. He was shocked how close it matches the book. My girls have not read the book and thought it was very good. I was surprised because it is very slow moving and moody. But the reality is that if you don't know the books the movie has to be an enjoyable watch because there has been nothing like it on the big screen to date. Of course girls love Timothee also. :)If you liked Bladerunner 2049 you will love this. The old Bladerunner looks appallingly bad now compared to the new one, just because it has aged so badly. The new one is slow moving like this movie. But you just have to take it all in and not expect backflips and lightsaber scenes!The characters are great, however I didn't get to hear Gurney sing. I was really waiting for this. That would have been hilarious. Timothee Chalamet is perfect in the role as the wimpy kid that is coming of age.I went to a very good cinema with amazing 3D speakers and I have to say I'd give the whole sound experience 10/10. I've never heard anything like it before. It was just amazing to take in the whole thing.The reality is that Star Wars is a complete rip off of Dune, and the problem people will have with this movie is that its gritty and hasn't got over the top fight scenes. Its much more like real life (except for the shields of course).It is really setting itself up for an epic second installment and we know that there are a few quite freaky scenes in the first movie, but will be loads in the second. I would encourage everyone to see it on the big screen because of the experience. This is not a movie for TV. Probably the only one of its kind. By way of comparison, the special effects of Man of Steel in the first 5-10 minutes didn't hold up in the cinema because the size showed up issues, this movie however is the complete opposite of that. It holds up all the way through.Summing it up, its nothing near as good as the book. For me its a huge improvement on the original half of the 80s movie. In its own right it is a great movie (not book). It would be a shame to not see part II, because the most important message ultimately in part II is the ecology message which is the reason why Frank Herbert wrote the book in the first place. We need need such a poignant message in a few years time.",Dune
1645,lm-510-875081,Disappointed,5,19 October 2021,"Looks great, but with the running time, could have fleshed out the characters.

Stellan Skarsgard is a wonderful actor but his mannerisms were so alike Marlon Brando's portrayal of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now that he may have turned up at the wrong re-make. Timothy Chamalet's performance was a let down and he will need to step up for part 2. Yet hey, the imagery alone is enough to rate it 7/10.",Dune

Human, down to earth, and easy to relate to. A little scene of Paul doing a kid thing like playing a video game would have helped a lot.Still, all in all, I liked it.",Dune
1650,steve-case,Probably better to watch if you haven't read the books,8,24 October 2021,"The reason for my subject line? Well, I saw the movie and it's great, everything that other reviewers have covered in detail. But if you haven't read the books, then you could happily see this as a standalone movie.For those of us who know how the first book ends, I think Warner Bros. Is going to leave us twisting in the wind. Shortly before I saw the movie, I found out that it would be ""part one."" And it is terrific. But there is no promise that part two will be made. Just some vague statement that ""part two will be Green-lit if it does well on HBO Max."" Huh?Look at ""Lord Of the rings."" Peter Jackson insisted on making all three movies at once. I think he took that a little bit too far by splitting ""The Hobbit"" into three parts, but at least he still filmed all three parts at once. He knew because of the scope of those books, the filming locations and the caliber of actors required, that was the only way those books would make it to film.I think the same formula applies to Dune. However, Part 2 has yet to be approved and it took three years to make part 1. Bummer..",Dune

Gone were so many of the book and former David Lynch's details that made this film/book movie worthy. Slow to develop. Missing key interesting elements, I guess we are expected to wait for the sequel for things to get rolling? It's like they took the first 15 minutes of the Lynch film and stretched it out for over two hours. Little emotional attachment to the characters. We waited decades for a Blade Runner sequel and thankfully received a pleasurable update. Here we received a cliff note, a dog eared 5 pages of a slow paced, emotionally void snippet of things to come. Disappointed is the word. Glad I did not watch it on the ""big screen"" as continually mentioned in the promotion of the film. It was worth a peek at home, but sadly I'm not excited about the sequel, even though one would think all the action is yet to come. Not sure anyone will get this book right in cinamatoc fashion. In a word, bummer.",Dune

Did I like it, absolutely. The limited action sequences were incredible and very well done. The acting was mostly great with the exception of Jason Momoa who wasn't bad but not great either, IMO.

Naturally, some things have been distilled or adapted out, but they are rather minor and not (in my opinion) relevant to the plot or the characters. The story takes its time unfolding, and the viewers can immerse themselves in the world and the circumstances or our protagonists. Cinematography and score are amazing. I was absolutely floored by the magnitude of the visuals (some elements were, I think, borrowed from the 1984 adaptation) and the perfect soundtrack. The acting is great. The pacing is great. It's a complex story that needs room to breathe. I just hope that it's successful enough to get a ""Part 2"". I love the original novel and, despite the fact that I have a special place in my heart for the 1984 movie and the SciFi miniseries, this adaptation is by far the best, most faithful, and most visually dazzling.",Dune

1682,ajhamada,Stunning movie experience*,9,23 September 2021,"Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of the Duniverse. Read all the books and played every game for PC.This movie is like a slow cooked delicious meal served with amazing visual effects, great casting choices (a few exceptions of course) and general fidelity to the original dialogue and story (the changes are understandable when switching to a visual media).A few things, however, that lessened my movie experience
1) It suffers from what I call the ""Revenant/Interstellar"" malaise with too many slow ""scenic cinematographic porn"" scenes and protracted slow motion overlayed with an ""epic"" score. Could have easily shaved 20 mins of the movie and made it more easily consumable to the general audience2) Lack of exposition. Yes! For once we could have used more exposition. Why is the spice so important? There are a few mentions, but not to the degree that it deserves.3) Consequently, a few scenes showing the Emperor, the Landsraad, the Guild and the homeworlds (not just the oceans of Caladan, but their architecture, the pollution of Giedi Prime, the splendor of Caitain) to better immerse the viewer in the setting.4) I didn't expect GoT British dialects, but the overly Americanized parts of the dialogue stood out. Not in a good way.And finally
5) I freaking loved the movie, but I had a sense that my non-Dunie friends had a hard time following the many threads and slow plot of the movie.Conclusion:
9/10 for me, but probably 7/10 for the general audience.",Dune

1684,raven-11881,Dune is an audiovisual masterpiece,9,25 October 2021,"My review is absolutely free of spoilers!Actors / Dialogues / Plot and logic:The story around Dune is extremely interesting and exciting, which is partly due to the complex background history of mankind for thousands of years. There is an incredible amount of history here, and you can feel that in every second of the film. Themes such as mysticism, religion, politics, war, society and family are all here. Atmospherically incredibly dense! The film is like quicksand in the desert: it literally pulls me in deep!Of course, only half of the first book by Frank Herbert was filmed, so the plot remains completely open at the end. As a non-book connoisseur, I only know what I know from David Lynch's 1984 film, which, as we all know, sticks rather poorly to the first book and tells everything in a rather rushed manner. I always liked the movie, though. So I'm very excited for the sequel, which I hope will come. Basically, I love open endings and epic stories that span multiple movies and multiple years. It keeps the suspense high and invites speculation and discussion and lots of thought.In this first installment, much more attention is paid to world-building than to the emotions surrounding the characters. Only Paul (Timothy Chalamet) really gets a lot of attention here, everyone else is more of a supporting character who unfortunately hasn't really grown on me yet. But after the ending, I see a lot of potential there.Timothy Chalamet plays Paul Atreides really damn well and believably. I also really like Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother, because her character is still very mysterious, as is the Bene Gesserit group she belongs to. I wonder what their goals are. The rest of the actors play their roles very well, even if they are a bit cool and distant, which is probably due to the form of society in the future and of course because the world-building and Paul Atreides are in the foreground. We also see here more the society of the nobility and they behave as known mostly rather stiff and cool and here also very military.Unfortunately, the emotions fall a bit by the wayside as far as the characters aside from Paul and his mother are concerned. However, it bothers me a bit more that the film is a bit too cool, too distant and thus a bit too emotionless. In Blade Runner 2049, Arrival, Prisoners and Sicario, feelings and emotions were simply a stronger part of the films and I really felt for the characters and took them to my heart. With Dune, on the other hand, I couldn't really take the characters into my heart, because I simply didn't have the building connection to the characters that would make me learn to love them. Only Paul and his mother Jessica Atreides are a bit more emotionally tangible, but for my taste just too little.One more thing caught my eye: If it's so hot on Arrakis, why isn't anyone actually sweating? That underlines the coolness of the film once again, in my opinion.CGI animations / action scenes / fight choreographies:The computer animations in Dune are beyond reproach. Whether it's flying machines like the dragonfly or large spaceships, explosions, the body shields or even everything else, all of it looks extremely realistic and believable, as if it didn't come from a computer. The real locations make the universe or Arrakis really tangible and palpable. The sandworms are rarely seen, but then they are really scary and extremely well designed and animated.The action scenes in the film are rare, but extremely well done, as in Blade Runner 2049. They are clearly arranged and as a viewer you always have a good overview of the action. The creativity is also on a high level. I have never seen bombs and spaceships explode like in Dune. Simply grandiose!The close combat with the shields is also very well done and original. Ranged weapons can't be used because of the body shields, so there is more use of close combat, because slow objects can penetrate the body shields. Very well done!Camera / Scenery / Editing:The camera work and also the editing are really on the very highest level. Viewers get to see a lot of incredibly great shots of the settings. There are many wide shots that just perfectly capture the incredible aesthetic of the film. Slow camera flights over the city or the desert are just awesome! Even during the action scenes, the viewer always maintains a full view. The cuts are also wonderful and never hectic or annoying. Villeneuve and his camera team don't know anything like a shaky camera. Perfect! The film is tremendously visually powerful. The visual experience is simply breathtakingly brilliant and you MUST experience it like this on a big cinema screen or a huge 100-inch TV in your home theater.Costumes / Make-Up / Design / Setpieces:The clothing, costumes and setpieces are a real eye-catcher. Actually, everything in the film, whether it's rooms, cities, clothing or the desert, is very minimalist and simple, but it's done in a way that's just great. Minimalism has never been so great to look at. The setpieces are simply eye-catching, the buildings simple but fascinating. The deserts of Arakis are also grandiosely staged.Music:Although I am a big fan of Hans Zimmer and his film music (Gladiator, Blade Runner 2049, Interstellar, Batman v Superman, etc.), I didn't always like the music in Dune. Some of it is of course really good again and absolutely fits the film and the respective scenes, but in the quieter moments some pieces were just a bit too over the top for me, too intrusive and too loud and inappropriate. Since the film already comes across rather cool and rather restrained with the emotions, it would have been better if the music had been more emotional in quieter moments. Hans Zimmer and Denis Villeneuve could have shown a little more sensitivity.Nonetheless, the music is mostly excellent, though in my eyes not Zimmer's best work by a long shot.Sound:Sound-wise, Dune is on a very high level. The spatial soundscape and the mix is really great and you think during the war scene with the bombs and explosions that you would be right in the middle of it. Cool feeling!3D technology:I saw the film in 3D and can only say that the 3D effects blend in rather discreetly and never push themselves strongly into the foreground. So practically the absolute opposite of Avatar. So you might think that the 3D isn't actually necessary in Dune, which may certainly be true. Nevertheless, I really liked this discreet use of 3D in Dune, because it enhanced the feeling of being in the middle of the grandiose shots without overdoing it. Class!Conclusion:Emotionally Dune is unfortunately rather cool and distant and musically sometimes a bit too intrusive and inappropriate, but Dune easily makes up for these negative aspects with an incredible universe, an extremely exciting backstory and a great main story, sympathetic and interesting characters played by great actors, an extremely great design and an insane aesthetic, an incredibly good camera work, excellent editing, the great costumes, an outstanding soundscape and an extreme visual power and a perfect sci-fi atmosphere that doesn't exist a second time. The nearly 150 minutes of film flew by, despite the lesser action portion. The scenes are incredibly great and offer a lot of variety for the eye.Therefore, despite the minor flaws, I award the full score, which, however, only applies to a viewing in a well-equipped cinema with good image and sound technology and a large screen. At home, the whole thing certainly looks a bit more sparse and less impressive, unless you have an impressive home theater at home.Finally, there is only one thing left to say: Dune 2 MUST come! And gladly more movies after that for the further books!9/10 points (in a well-equipped cinema) - High rewatch value.",Dune
1685,throwtrashalloverthering,Star Wars: Beige & Swords edition,5,23 October 2021,"It's...fine. It almost feels like a Star Wars fanfic at times?The styling is somewhere between Star Wars & Game of Thrones, and the design is pretty good considering how bland all the colors are.I really dislike how in this mystical space land the only Asian character speaks Mandarin & when he does speak English he has a heavy accent. They also needlessly kill two of the only Black characters; Liet-Kynes is one of the very few enjoyable people and I was hoping she'd have more of a part but is killed for no reason 2/3 of the way through.Overall it's just boring.

1689,bromwichdavid,Style over substance...,5,22 October 2021,"First the good: This film has a great cast and is stunning to look at, the landscapes and worlds they have created are epic - especially in IMAX.But for me that's where it ran out of steam, it was confusing, cryptic and strange in places. I walked out of the cinema feeling like I'd watched a two and a half hour perfume advert... you know, the ones that leave you scratching your head and wondering what it was all about. It also ended at a very odd part of the overall story for me.I'll go and watch the second movie just to see it though, but it left me wanting (and not in a good way).",Dune
1690,gravybacon,A masterful adaptation.,10,22 October 2021,"A beautiful, cinematic, and extravagant adaptation of the classic book by Frank Herbert. Possibly the best book adaptation I have seen since The Lord of the Rings, with the ability to cut what needed to be cut for the story to flow and include and portray what needed to be shown for the heart of Dune to remain.This film is gorgeous, a visual experience like Blade Runner 2042 before it, this film screams for watching on a large screen at least once, and will be a beautiful watch for years to come.The casting was perfect, each actor portraying their respective characters wonderfully, and the humanization of the characters through their performances was very welcome. While we don't get as much character development as I would like, what we do get is more than enough to establish the relationships in place between these characters and the absolutely HUGE world they live in. Seeing the guild ship conquering the night sky was majestic.The sound design is punchy, and clean, and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is tonally perfect for what we as the audience are witnessing.I loved every second of this film, and did not want it to end. I look forward to watching it over and over and over again.",Dune

We've been subjected to too many years of pop corn sci-fi generic films, and many people are unable to appreciate a true classic picture with exactly the appropriate pace. If Space Odyssey 2001 were to be released this year, it would be labeled as having pacing issues by some of these reviewers too. It's a shame Hollywood has degraded itself and its audience so much.This is a fantastic science fiction film that is the polar opposite of the typical popcorn sci-fi, and for anyone who wants to be awed by the work of movie arts, this is the must see in a decade.",Dune
1694,awsafzidane,A treat to the eyes and ears,8,23 October 2021,"Visually stunning, audibly haunting. Dune is a testimony of Denis Villeneuve's expert craftsmanship. Watching Dune is an experience comparable to that of watching Star Wars or Lord of The Rings for the first time. It's an introduction to a vast universe and I'm really excited for what's to come in the upcoming movie(s). I wish Denis makes 2 more of these films and creates an iconic trilogy like the ones I mentioned.Hans Zimmer's goosebumps-inducing score was the best part of the film for me along with the gorgeous cinematography. Even with the somewhat slow storytelling, I didn't feel bored for a single moment due to what was playing in front of my eyes and inside my head. Watching it in the theatres might have been an amazing experience. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how honest an adaptation this is, but it's a cinematic marvel.All the actors did a fine job with Rebecca Ferguson being the highlight of the film, in my opinion. Zendaya is absent for most of the runtime, but something tells me that she will play the leading role in the next film.Since it's only the first film of the franchise, based on only half of the first book, its emphasis is more in world building than telling the story. So, some viewers maybe a bit disappointed as it seems to be leading to a 3rd act which never arrives. The ending is anti-climactic and thus the film only serves as an introduction to the universe.I have loved all Villeneuve films until now, and this is no exception.",Dune

It captures the emotion of every scene perfectly. The film itself feels so raw and real, which many si-fi/fantasy films lack. But this one does not lack that one bit. Rather it takes the budget spent on this movie and uses every penny to make you feel like you are watching a moving work of art.

1705,alexfolkesson,A hard movie to review,8,30 September 2021,"Dune is a hard movie to review. As an adaption, it's perfect. However if you're going to judge it by itself, as it would be an original story, the score would be different. Dune relies on its sequel as the book is > one book. This becomes very apparent in the phasing of the story as the structure does not fit in the one movie. But as an adaption, Dennis Villeneuve could not have done a better job.The visuals are good, not as amazing as Villeneuve's Blade Runner sequel, but good. The acting was good, the only issue is maybe Jason Momoa because of his big brother type character that feels forced, almost Disney-ish happy go lucky to make the movie more funny. This movie takes itself very serious, but when it tries to be funny the humor falls flat, however the movie tries to be funny in very few moments. The blame for Momoas force character is also not the actors fault, but the screenwriter.If you are a fan of the book, then this movie will be amazing. But if you have not, I think the feeling of boredom or the thought; ""when is this going to end"" is going to pop up in your head. It's a hard movie to review as it relies on its source material and it's sequel, but a good movie nonetheless.",Dune

My hype and expectations were unlimited, and I wasnt disappointed,
but....this isnt a movie for the mainstream population, I would not be a suprised if someone would call Dune ""boring, slow and unspectacular"".But I guess this works for a lot of masterpieces, show ""the godfather"" to the basic ""fast and furious"" fan...Denis Villeneuve is the second best director of our generation (sorry but Nolan is just a god in my opinion).

1710,JasonDrake8,Would have been a lot better as a tv series,5,22 October 2021,"While Denis' work is astounding with amazing production design, costumes, and visual effects, the story suffers from the 2.5 hour runtime. There were a lot of elements glossed over. Important characters who die who I didn't know well enough and wanted to know more of.It perplexes me with the failure of Game of Thrones WB / HBO decided to condense this ""Game of Thrones in space"" storyline into a limited runtime of a two part film instead of adapting it into a television series.It's understandable that franchises like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter were able to create trilogies and multiple films, but this was before streaming high quality content really took off. Game of Thrones itself was released in 2011. And even then it was limited to just premium cable until a few years later.Lord of the Rings movies were also 3 hours + long, with their extended editions over 4 hours long. But those were all shot back-to-back with YEARS worth of time and effort meticulously put in them. With DUNE, we have to wait 2-3 years just for a Part 2 of the first movie?You would think after the abysmal failure of the Game of Thrones final season and the imminent release of their new streaming platform, HBO would look at DUNE as an opportunity for redemption and to boost sales on its new platform. To create an expansive, high quality show that spans seasons where we really get to know these characters and understand the power struggle among the Houses.And unlike Game of Thrones, the Dune series has been completed for years. HBO doesn't have to rely upon a lazy writer who won't finish their series. They don't have to rely upon original material. They have it all there ready to use.I understand the spectacle of seeing this movie on an IMAX screen, but I can't help but wonder what could have been. Especially since this movie was being written in 2018 and filmed in 2019. A year before HBO MAX came out. Legendary bought the film AND tv rights. Why not take complete advantage of that?",Dune

For those with ties to the novel or past nostalgia, Dune will undoubtably be a triumphant viewing experience. For others, viewing Dune will still generate awe is it's layered storytelling, cinematography, sound mixing, a-list acting, and quick pacing.

At last, we have a great adaptation that captures the spirit of the novels without dumbing down the source material. Frank Herbert would have been proud. Everything from direction, to cinematography, to acting, to score -- and everything else under the hot desert sun -- adds to the depth of the setting.

1730,richard1974,A masterful accomplishment,9,17 September 2021,"This is the movie all of us Dune fans have been waiting for the past 55 years! Denis Villeneuve said this was the project which he had been dreaming of since he was a kid, and he finally accomplished it. Many people thought a movie adaptation could never capture the intricate details of the plot with all its political intrigues and the richness of the world Frank Herbert created, and earlier attempts haven't been this successful. This movie however, brings the world to the screen as I always imagined it.I loved the cinematography, the imagery is stunning. The contrast between the mist of Caladan and the dust storms on Arrakis is characteristic. Wide shots of desert and rock are so vivid you can almost taste the sand and the spice while watching.The opening with Chani narrating about Arrakis draws you into the story, but it might have had some more action in the beginning of the movie. The dreams of Paul are returning several times. Action scenes are alternated with contemplations and explanations, which makes the movie feel like a long exciting dream. All the main actors have done a great job, especially Timothée Chalamet. I don't know why the character Piter de Vries was left out, but all the other characters are portrayed very well.Of course this is only part one, so the movie has an open ending, but I can't imagine someone not wanting to wanting to see part two after watching this. I'm definitely looking forward to it!",Dune

Absolutly terrible!Dont' get me wrong: i like Ferguson in Mission Impossible but she doesn't fit here.Isaac is way too young, besides that i can't stand his face.Bardems acting is abysmal.The worst is Zendaya. Chani is potrayed as an angry high school kid.Why for the love of God is Momoa in there? I don't get
it.There are some actor how fit quite well: Skarsgard, Bautista and Stephen Henderson - he is the only one who fits his role perfectly. Chalamet is ok.Second problem is the visualisation: pompous, dull and bland. Dune is a really a chellange for your imagination but this film only offers mediocre Hollywood solutions.Third problem is the music. Well, which music? I don't remember a piece.The same goes for the sound effects. It's just nothing special.Forth problem is, that the story/context is barely explained. Who is the Imperator, what are the Great Houses, what is the Landsrat, who/what is a mentat?Fifth problem is the dragged out story and these strange ""inserted"" scences like at the beginning: Mom and son at the kitchen table...Or the Momoa hero death scene... Why would you include such nonsense?The conclusion is: It's watchable, it's not a total desaster. This adaptation is not clueless like the new Star Wars Movies. Some scenes are even well done. But it's a film for the average, ordinary audience.",Dune

Storyline, not great. Writing , not great. Actors are ok, zendaya and. Timothy overrated for sure. Overall the movie was not great. A 1 star is unfair but 3 is solid for this one.

Releasing this movie with a potential risk of never finishing the story or having to wait years for Part 2 is just not fair towards the fans.While I think it was a good decision to make more than one movie and show as much of the original story as possible, I also feel that it was not underlined enough that the movie would be released in parts.",Dune

I still enjoy watching the first one and although I think fans of the books will like this new Dune more, fans of the first movie may - like me - may feel like it was wanting. First of all, it's going to be a huge let down if the second part is never made. Not only did we not get to see the Emperor, there are whole other parts important to the Dune story that are missing. This felt like a beautiful long preview of the story.Denis Villanueva created something beautiful and fashionable for us to watch, but so far it is soulless and shallow. None of the characters had me invested. And as beautiful as some of the shots and fashion were, things like the interiors of the Atreides palace were like...WTF? Cave-chic? No no no...go back and watch that first Dune. It was fashionable too, but the set design was just as gorgeous. The set design on this was minimalist, pretentious garbage.Obviously some of the special effects were better because we're like 37 years more advanced. But this film's interpretation of ""the voice"" was just pathetic. I could go on about some of the woke references (oppressor vs oppressed narrative where there was none in the book or first Dune), as well as the laughable choice of Javier Bardem as the leader of the Fremen. Seriously, if they wanted to be so damn woke, why didn't they cast an Arab or North African as any of the main Fremen. At least that would make sense.All in all, it's watchable and any fan of Dune is going to watch it regardless. But they could've done a whole lot better and who knows if we'll ever see the rest of the story. If not, this will be just a huge disappointment.",Dune

Villenueves perfect shots and Zimmers unique soundtrack provide one of the most immersive experiences in film history. A lot of criticism seems to stem from the movies lack of story. I disagree, there is a story here, very similar to the first LOTR movie, and while there is no resolution, this movie sets the stage perfectly for whats to come.

1750,DJShittyMusic,Stays true to Dune,9,3 November 2021,"Read the book almost a decade ago, so it was nice to see Dune on the big screen after I had forgotten the details. I think Villeneuve does an excellent work here staying true to the original Dune. I would definitely recommend watching Dune in the theaters, preferably in the premium systems (IMAX, Dolby, etc.) to experience both the cinematics and audio to its fullest potential. That being said, dialogue was difficult to make out in some parts of the film which I imagine would throw off viewers who are not familiar with the original Dune due to some unfamiliar names and terminologies being thrown around. The pacing is quite slow and the movie itself being on the longer side of 2hr. 30mins., makes the film seem quite long overall and a bit exhausting to watch. Despite these minor issues, I believe fans will be pleased with how complete this sci-fi epic feels. The production value, cinematics, audio, CGI, acting, script, and screenplay all feels well polished. While I had some minor issues with the film, I can't really think of any major changes which could have made the film any better than it already is. As a sci-fi fan I was pleasantly satisfied with watching Dune on the big screens, and am excited to watch Dune: Part II when it also comes out in theaters.",Dune

1762,Movies_Games_Reviews,One of the Best Movies of 2021,10,9 October 2021,"I have to start with confessing that i haven't read the book. In fact, i wanted to know almost nothing, before watching it. Because i wanted to know how easy or difficult it is to understand and follow the movie without knowing anything about it. By the way, that how i watch most movies. I don't even watch trailers anymore. It took time to get the general idea of all the characters, but overall i had no trouble following the movie and understanding the characters. Of course i don't know eveything about them, but i don't think it's even important to know everything about them, while watching this first Part of Dune. To me it seems like it was almost meant to be the introuction of the world and characters. It was exactly the same with Lord of the Rings. Most people who watched LOTR had never read the books, they might have known basic story, but that's it and it's exactly the same with Dune. Everyone can read the books and learn about the world and character later, while waiting for Part 2, at least that's what i'm planning to do.Movie itself is incredible beautiful, stunning visuals. Spaceships look gigantic, everything does, compared to humans. What i would call it is mature, in-depth sci-fi epic. Characters are interesting, world is interesting. It makes you forget real life for these two and half hours and takes you onto journey, somewhere, where movies rarely go. It has very good script, dialogue and acting. It is slow paced movie, it takes it's time to develop characters, make you care. It's not action heavy movie, but when there is action, it is very well done. It has lots of well written philosophical ideas and meanings, that i believe, many people will find relatable. At least i did.Looking at some extremely low rating, I have a feeling that there's this group of people who doesn't want Dune to become next Lord of the Rings or Star wars. In fact, i think they don't want anything anymore, other than whining and complaining. But thankfully these kinds of people seem to be minority. Overall, easily one of the best movies of 2021. Can't wait for part 2.",Dune

1- the structure is not that good and it feels like someone trying to put everything that leads only to art directing nothing else actually.2- very bad choice of actors, i mean this movie supposed to be unique and each character has its own power, i really dont know what kind of these actors like duncan and batestota doing in this movie.3- i wanted to be connected with the characters with their backstory instead of showing them like saying the lines and go home.Overall i still hope to male this movie by jodorwsky or lynch and the movie could be a lot better if it was written good.",Dune

The pacing was super slow, were the movie was mostly about getting you familiar with the worlds the story is taking part at and the relationships between the leaders of these worlds, but despite that pace I found the motives of the events unclear at times, so the pace wasn't beneficial in that regard. The purpose of the main character and what other characters were expecting from him is still unclear to me. Besides, the story lacked a proper closure.The movie seems to be a victim of trying to squeeze as many sequels out of a story for revenue reasons, as they could've increased the pace and provided a better closure that would've left you wanting for more.Also I find it weird to complement a movie regarding its visuals considering its budget, like what were you expecting?

Just less voiceovers and slightly better acting. Still quite big hair! (I always imagined Paul with short hair, actually!). And despite the length, for only half a movie, it's still missing the dinner at Arrakeen that, to me anyway, is the key to the political subtext and Paul's maturation, and was also missing in 1984. Perhaps it can be a flashback opener for part two!!! Oh, and maybe a lingering, metaphysical contemplation and soliloquy from Jessica on spice coffee!

So nothing is a surprise even the sand worm at the end which was a let down anti climax because in the film you only see glimpses of it. But you know it's coming because it's in the trailer.Overall I found the film bit of a slog to get through. Boring, slow but beautiful to look at. I deduct a star from my ratings each time I check my watch to see how long the film has left until finish. So yup 7/10.Please stop using music-by-numbers Hans Zimmer. Boring boring boring.

1785,lelya_fantastka,The hour has come,10,19 September 2021,"What should I say? Today we watched Dune...and that was a deserving, profound, noteworthy movie since ""Dark Knight"" directed by Christopher Nolan.Denny Villeneuve made a great work, I didn't read the original novel of Frank Gerbert, I even didn't play a famous game. Today I just bought ticket and went to the cinema and felt the most thrilling feeling I have ever faced watching movie over the previous years. That was a feeling of something breathtaking, impressive, staggering - the movie is consistent, sustained, it is like a candy that you are removing from the wrapper. We can see very slow, unhurried narration, a little bit depressed and pathetic, where nothing impressive happened during the whole 50. Despite this the viewer is passionate about the storytelling, carefully observing events.I can't notice only the actor's work of Timothee Chalamet, he is very progressive, organic in a pair of Rebecca Ferguson or Oscar Isaac, but he fits in the role of nervous, asthentic young heir of Astreides House perfectly ideal. I am not afraid to say that this role is one of the most serious and dramatic in his acting career.I wanted to add my admiration to the music was written by Hans Zimmer. We listened his music in a ""Pirate of the Caribbean"", The ""Last Samurai"", ""Dark Knight"", ""Interstellar"" and others but his music in ""Dune"" is absolutely unusual, unrecognizable, with bright arabic notes, seasoned with ""spice"". He opened in front f his fans from a new side.I have missing for Jason Momoa and his role of brave, strong, honest and hearted warriors that is why I was keen on him in the role of Dunkan, and I regret about his character. No matter how he became a new Shaun Bean.In a conclusion I look forward to the second part. This movie is whole captured me by its black restraint, unhurried storytelling, profound described Universe, and the gifted hero which route is just at the beginning.",Dune

1797,mneidoni-477-33071,"A poor, lame excuse of a book adaptation",2,22 October 2021,"Except for several decent moments and some nicely shot screens, a HUGE disappointmentHEAVY spoilers!!!Jessica isn't a powerful Bene Gesserit here, she's a hysterical whiny woman, in the name of the Politically Correct woke garbage, a ton of details from the book were either changed or brutally removed.The banquet scene in the book, when the Atreides arrive and they want to contact the local high-power figures, is of course missing.The stillsuits look forced and the combat suits of Atreides make little to no sense, just as the Sardaukar's. Speaking of the Sardaukar: despite their ferocity, there are well defined Sardaukar ranks in the books. In the movie, every Sardaukar is a generic, bland character and the ranks aren't defined.Baron's homosexuality, of course, isn't described at all in this politically correct climate, Paul's killing of the guard during the kidnapping is, OF COURSE, replaced by his mother killing both of the Harkonnen. Although Dune is very progressive even for this time (women are very powerful, the Bene Gesserit, although officially ""meant to serve"", pull the political ropes and have their own agenda), the current adaptation drafted from Herbert's masterpiece and atmosphere and ruined it...Lady Jessica's kidnapping doesn't even appear in the movie, despite it being one of the important parts in the book, just as Yueh's actions to help them (fremkit in the 'thopter)Liet Kynes's interpretation is laughable at best by Sharon Duncan Brewster , compared to Max von Sydow's, his betrayal and the Baron's motivation isn't detailed when it comes to the planetologist; Pardot Kynes, Liet's father, is never mentioned, and I don't think that the fact that he's Chani's father is ever mentionedFeyd Rautha, Hasimir Fenring, Irulan, Shaddam and the Guild motivation and Navigators are missing. Of course, it's not like they had 2.5 hours to present the universe and its' issues and intrigue. Nope. The space had to be filled with over lengthy unnecessary takes on dreams, Chani, more Chani, forced diagolues and... a spider. WTF?!Not even enjoyable unless you read the books, and a huge disappointment have you read them, wasted more than two hours of my life watching this, poor, poor, poor quality acting and ""inspired by Dune"" would have been a better description for this mess. It's not an adaptation, or at least not a good one, in my humble opinion.Go watch the mini-series and Lynch's books instead.",Dune
1798,mneidoni-477-33071,Frank Herbert would lose his water over this,2,23 October 2021,"!!! HEAVY SPOILERS !!!Gone are Irulan, the dinner scene, the complicated political landscape and the depth of the social structure on Arrakis. Gone is the tension between Thufir Hawat and Jessica, gone is Hasimir Fenring and even Feyd Rautha.Gone are the witty dialogues of Jessica and Paul, Jessica seems a hysterical single mom right now, throughout the movie. She screams at Paul after he saves her life. LOL.And speaking of useless changes, the role of Liet Kynes was gender-swapped to a woman just because of the Twitter crazies. Liet's death has NOTHING to do with the original material, books are mesmerizing and profound; this movie is shallow and pretentious. Max von Sidow was spectacular comparing to the wooden acting and lack of depth. The death of Liet Kynes is cutting the rope between the foreigners and the natives and is a pivotal moment in the books. The symbolism is John the Baptist paving the way for Messiah.Mentats are underwhelming in the movie, despite them being essential to the Empire in the future because of the Butlerian Jihad, as living computers and their role in strategy is non-existant, Shaddam doesn't exist in the movie, the storytelling (of course!) is now done by Chani, which (why am I not surprised?) complains about ""her planet"" being invaded.Jamis vs Paul fight: there is NOTHING ceremonial about the fight anymore. The word ""JIhad"" is of course, REMOVED from the movie, as to not offend the moronic audiences. Paul isn't confident in his abilities despite being trained by the best of the best. Furthermore, the dialogue with Reverend Mother is cut at the point where Paul says ""are you insinuating a Duke's son is an animal"" - of course, we can't have highborn in this day and age. The Water of Life isn't even mentioned..The knives are RIDICULOUS in the new movie. The size is huge compared to what I was expecting. Speaking of, when Shadout Mapes offers the knife to Jessica, the knife is unsheathed only after killing who has seen it and is unworthy (or drawn blood), so Shadout Mapes is cut by Jessica to seal the pact of silence. The crysknife's poison isn't described. Nor the food and drink poisons used in the Empire. Nor the CHOAM....Rabban the Beast is well portrayed in the movie, I'll have to admit it. The Baron is just...a generic villain. His intelligence, the dialogue with Piter de Vries - they're gone.Of course, in the light of the woke moronic politically correct climate, it's impossible to have a man capture a woman. So the scene when the Baron captures Jessica is gone. Entirely. Also, when Jessica and Paul kill the two guards from the topther, instead of Paul having kill one of them with a kick to the diaphragm, his mother kills them. No mention of Jihad, just ""holy crusade"". Of course.The Sardaukar are generic and bland, we don't' see a Bashar general, a TON of dialogue is cut in the movie so that there's plenty of time for long useless frames and visions of Chani (of course, she'll get to be the badass in the nextmovie, right)?!Good atmosphere, lousy script, abysmal armors and generic villains.May thy movie chip and shatter, Villeneuve!",Dune

1806,kameeleoned_out,PG-13 Harkonnens,9,23 October 2021,"I've been expecting this movie like the Second Coming. Although I left slight room for disappointment, I did honestly believe it could end up being something like the greatest movie ever to be made. The original story affords it and the pieces were lining up just right (the crew, the cast). But you can't do that with imposed limits such as the one I mentioned in my title.I think Dune might just be impossible to port to the big screen. You could go the Lynch way (who had terrifying Harkonnens, by the way) and imprint your own vision on the material, or go the Villeneuve way and try to follow it closely and amplify it whenever you get the chance (like Paul's first steps on Arrakis sand, for example, which was exceptional). The trouble with this latter approach became apparent as the movie advanced, and I started noticing that it sometimes seemed to just be hitting checkpoints in the story which ended up feeling surprisingly empty. I won't delve any deeper than that.Please note that I'm saying all of this while giving it a 9. This is an excellent movie. But the story (the novel) is undoubtedly the best SciFi story ever told, and even one of the best stories ever created by man in any genre. So the movie should also be judged in a different league than normal. For what it is, it's a 'great time at the movies' sort of experience. But, unfortunately, it simply isn't.. eternal.",Dune
1807,philipdustson,This is the 'Dune' we've been looking for,8,28 October 2021,"Dune 2021:TL;DR Pros:
Awe inspiring! (mostly)TL;DR Cons:
Some curiously languid (almost inert) parts-Over all:
A monumental, singular achievement in popular filmmaking.Longer Review:See 'Dune' in a movie theatre (if it's safe to do so); it's a movie that practically demands to be seen on a giant screen.Reminiscent of Peter Jackson's 'Fellowship of the Ring', in that I remember when I first saw that movie, I was ok with it being slowly paced, at times, because I knew it was setting up HUGE payoffs (and it did: not only in the Orc battle scene etc., but overall, the third LOTR film, 'Return of the King', was the best in that series imo).Although I am a defender of '84/Lynch-Dune', 'Dune 2021' was made for a post-'Game of Thrones' audience.For a lot of pic's running time, 'D21' really is the best of both worlds (almost a beat for beat remake of 'Lynch-Dune' at certain points; & at others, it quite stunningly fits as much of the Novel's mythos, as is possible in a mainstream pic of this scope).However 'Dune 21' is more akin in tone to EPIC fantasy like 'Thrones' or LOTR, than it is 'hard' sci fi; it def has a lot more ponderous, somber moments than, say, Star Wars; yet, punctuated with some jaw dropping action set pieces! This approach - deliberate, ponderous pacing; punctuated with grand payoffs -is the style that the film's director, Denis Villeneuve ('Prisoners', 'Blade Runner 2049') does exceptionally well.To Villeneuve's credit, he seems to honor all past 'Dune' iterations; including the Sy-Fy miniseries (which I also defend as being better than it's given credit for).Yet 'D21' is more operatic than any of the previous incarnations; it's trying to sweep you up into the world of Arrakis (more than David Lynch was capable of doing; as interesting and as beautifully weird as his 'Dune 84' is).The strength of 'Lynch-Dune' was that it got the psychedelic tone more correct ('D21' could stand to be a little bit more weird) -- but Villeneuve, I think, (and I'm just speculating because I've never made it all the way through the novel) seems to better understand the epic scope necessary to convey a Galaxy full of dynastic rivalries, class warfare & political conspiracy.And BOY! Is this movie EPIC; in fact, 'Dune 21' is more reminiscent of Ridley Scott than even Villeneuve's own 'Blade Runner: 2049' was, ironically. Yet think more 'Gladiator' than 'Alien' etc.For me, that's what Villeneuve brings to the table and is what totally justifies his take on the material: His approach to 'D21's' scope is just so theatrical and grand!I really think this is the next 'LOTR' (for Gen-Y) - A populist movie series that will eventually sweep the Oscars and get non-sci-fi fans into the books/novels & the larger Dune-Mythos.It's the anti-marvel movie btw. And that's a good thing. It's doing something really different than all the pulpy comic book stuff. It is a thinking person's sci-fi approach.",Dune
1808,wickednemesisenoch,Near Perfect,10,26 October 2021,"This is the near perfect movie. Take out the fact that it's science fiction, and quite possibly the greatest science fiction movie ever made, still a great great movie. And the ending was exactly where it should have ended.",Dune
1809,zephyrdaz,Overrated and boring,2,17 October 2021,"Overrated and boring, tries to make it exciting with some load dramatic music and cgi.Acting is aweful and it's the same first half of the script almost as the rubbish David Lynch version, where they are probably going to drag it out to 3 films instead of just the one bad one. The characters you won't care about and the script is even worse than the 1984 version.It you just like loud dramatic music, some computer graphics, no substance, no logic and bad acting, this is perfect for you.Waste of time, money, resources and 2 hours of my life I won't get back.Not worth your time or money.",Dune

1816,PalmerEldritch666,Visually disappointing point by point drag,4,18 September 2021,"....it could have been good-but it ain't.Dune the book is quite a long drag, not big on the humor. It's kind of Hamlet-full of characters crossed with Lawrence of Arabia and some Jesus Christ LSD thrown in for spice.And David Lean wins - on every front. Screenplay, desert visuals, how to tell an epic story, realism (of course no digital effects eh...), actign/ characters and most of all - music. Kyle MacLachlanCasting looks good on paper but.....Chalamet just looks like he's wearing trendy scarfs for most of the film - and looked like he was flown in from a fashion Paris terrace. Despite being a weak David Lynch film, Kyle macLachlan could do the alien messianic vibe.... Chalamet ...eh, no.His mother looks too young to be a good bad witch. Everybody else comes up empty handed, characters/actors are introduced and despite looking like a stock character they just die a couple (longish scenes later) without any dramatic impact. One character gets introduced so badly, i couldn't even see who or what she was in her first scene. Blink twice and you missed Shadout Mapes and really why is she in this movie again ? Couldn't they just have left a dagger in the bedroom ?So no humor, but also ndrama, no epic FEEL, emotions. The visions are totally lacking in inspiration (again Lynch does this better on half the budget). The story limps - yes they do all the beats.....but none of it registers emotionally - to a halfway point. Every Star wars/ Lor/Hobbit movies found better halfway endings to their stories (includ the bad ones). Arakis looks a lot like Syria includ the war, dustdustdust. The worms, yeah nice digital, but hey didn't George Lucas do the sarlac pit and we had Tremors....and despite old spfx and all, and being Herbert ripoffs to start with....well they did it better.Now for the worst offender : Hans Zimmer. All i remember from the non existent 3D imax is arabic wailing and LOUD, VERY TOO LOUD drams - like YAAAWN.... Never knew ENO/Toto were such geniuses.",Dune

How long are we going to have to wait for Part 2? Their ships with the 4 wings look like the bug ship from LEX of the flying pets from Man of Steel on Krypton flown by Russell Crowe while running from Zod's troops. And as with all good movies made today it was made in Canada not Hollywood. I'm hoping after Part 2 they remake the Children of Dune story too. You can never get enough Sci-Fi out of Hollywood but Canada is a different story, they always come through for the fans. Jason Momoa is quickly becoming the Number 1 actor in everything he appears in and hopefully will keep bringing the best out in every role he brings to the screen. While remakes are getting better as time goes by I'm still waiting for someone to bring the EON books and the Rama books to the screen.",Dune

The eeriness & slow set up really takes hold because of the beautiful scenes & unique take on this epic sci-fy. Once this film takes hold you run with it & it's beautiful yet powerful expression of who we are & where we're going is something I wasn't expecting. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is great & the score is masterful. I was awe struck! I will admit the dialogue is tough to follow, but from what I remember the book was too. I believe this adds a unique layer to the legend of this story. This isn't a film for casual movie goers, most may believe it's boring, not weird enough or even can't understand, to that I say I get it, but it's much deeper than that.

I hated that he thinks blaring blasts of noise sets an effect that makes one need to check your britches for a mistaken breach.

No hate against the actor or portrayal but the casting. Huh? (I actually do know, we all do. $¥£)I watched it twice because my buddies were taking up this scene and that. I felt bad.

The rhythm, perfect for the first part, we cannot forget the wonderful image of the film that makes us enchanted by the special effects and photography, I hope that despite the pandemic affecting the box office, the second part will be filmed and with the same crew, very thanks for the movie show. There will always be those who will criticize for not being one hundred percent faithful to the book and that the director distorted the story, but I would like to remind you that it is not always possible to be completely faithful and so, sometimes we have a little vision of the director. Which in this case does not disturb anything, once again my congratulations. If you haven't watched an announcement yet, go to the cinema rather than an IMAX session, it will be a sensational experience and guaranteed fun. Streaming is here to stay, as well as some movies have to be watched on the big screen, until each one if we have a ""cinema"" at home and don't be scared, that day will come, it's just a matter of time.",Dune

The dialogue is flat and boring, the tone made me feel like I was waking up in the middle of the arctic. Hans Zimmer's music feels like a copy of the Blade Runner 2046 soundtrack. The sets also feel very similar. Rebecca Ferguson looked and acted like a half-dead zombie. No Emperor, no Feyd, no Space Guild Octopus, no Princess Irulan and no heart plugs.

1835,saintandrew-80348,Excellent Science Fiction Movie,8,24 October 2021,Dune has the look and feel of the new Star Wars movies such as The Force Awakens and it's sequels but with less humor and camp. The world is epic and the space ships are grand. I can't stop thinking about this movie which is a sign that it's great. If you enjoy the new Star Wars films then you should check out Dune.

The scale is massive and immerses you in itself.Most Acting's were also top notch I specially loved Rebecca Ferguson in this film she was great. Chalamet was also quiet good but not at his best. Stellan skarsgard was also very good.Production design and suit design was on another level and i thought it was so practical and functional.NegativesI deduct two points because i felt the film was draggy to some extent and in some scenes the world and visual effects overtook the important factor that is the story.",Dune

It was like watching the first Dune with different characters. We went to this movie expecting the full movie and were extremely disappointed when it ended at about the half way mark of the original. It had no surprises as expected, no detail left out of the first movie was explained, as it turns out this ""1st"" movie is just a teaser so they can add sequels, IE all about making money.

Dune (2021) ticks all the boxes of greatness. Everything was just what they were supposed to be. The casts and set design felt perfectly natural, the visuals outstanding. Couldn't differentiate between CGI and practical effects with ""real things"". And kudos to the director for making a perfectly paced movie that doesn't feel too rushed (like the '84 one) or too slow (Blade Runner 2049). I don't have any idea how two and a half hours passed after the beginning of the first scene.Can't wait for Part 2 to witness the great conclusion... and believe me, it's going to be on the level of LOTR in term of epicness and enjoyment.",Dune

The director was amazing in his use of exposition to lay the background for a huge amount of detail Frank Herbert used in the book. It was intelligent, very well cast, and suspenseful. I eagerly await the sequel. (I remember the ""Dune Trilogy"" when I first read the books, can we hope for a series of 3 movies?Just have to say-- it was the first movie I've watched in while that I wasn't checking my watch every 30 minutes.

Went to the advanced screening at Odeon in Oldham.I struggled with the very dark light levels and constant bleak landscape. I know it's filmed on a barren planet, but I found it hard work to watch at times (maybe it's just me).The sound was also poor at times and difficult to hear some characters speaking.Some good action scenes and great fights.Overall, I'd give it a 6/10 and glad I didn't pay extra to upgrade to IMAX for this one.I thought they could have squeezed more storyline in a 2h35m film. There must be about 30 minutes given to Paul's dreams/visions.Most parts of the story were dragged out at every chance I felt.Not sure I'll be counting the days or years until the sequel.",Dune

At least the Lynch version was trying to add flare and creativity into the universe, this version didn't even try.The epic music score is good but at the same time is extremely overused af if that is supposed to add depth to ultimately shallow characters and conflicts.

However this is a mixed bag .Though the acting is not bad , it is also not very engaging neither is there one single scene that will be fixed into my memory as remarkable.Javier Bardem was for me even below average and not convincing at all.Sure , the visuals, photography , grandness , epic is there , but that is not enough to make a good picture.David Lynch his version was also visually grand for it's time despite special effects that were not in line as f.i. Star Wars or Blade Runner. In fact some effects were rather poor . And still that movie , moved me more than this one . Ok, it is Lynch , but I liked that weirdness.The bummer came at the end with that cheesy sentence : "" this is only the beginning"" .I wonder who wrote that and approved it , as if the audience is stupid not to know that there will be a part 2.",Dune

I was excited to see it play out visually but I also didn't have high expectations due to the state of movie making right now. Something that I enjoyed about the book was the way Herbert was able to world build through mostly dialogue. There was literally none of that in this movie. Everything interesting about the book - every pivotal story point - was filmed to be like 30 seconds and glossed over, while omitting all the juicy dialogue and ""palace intrigue"" drama and relationships within House Atreides. For this movie to have such a rich bases to build from, it was a complete failure. While visually beautiful, it was pointless and lacked all soul. I was hoping for an arc like that of the hay day of Game of Thrones. No suspense, no character development, boring and hollow. The parts that should have been long were short and the parts that should have been short are long - a complete encapsulation of Hollywood at this current moment in time. Visually beautiful soulless garbage.",Dune
1853,koolrobot,Dune Part One,9,17 September 2021,This movie is a set up for part two I dont get why it is hidden in the marketing for the movie. I think it would help prepare people's expectations for the movie that it wouldn't have a satisfying ending.But knowing that the movie on it's own is great it is more of a experience rather than a regural film as are most villeneuve's movies. The look of the world the people's clothes have such other worldliness to them but yet looking familiar it is very good production design.It can feel a bit long the pace is slow perhaps even to slow in the middle part and that is my only real critcism of the film.,Dune

I was in 10 minutes and I stopped the movie and said to myself i should go to the theatre but I couldn't give in to temptation and continue to watch it at home.This movie is superb with a stunning visuals and a powerful score by Hans Zimmer.I hate that they released this on HBO because piracy will dominate this film since there's a 4k version on the torrent sites already. I would've went to the theatre had it not been on HBO. I missed out on a great movie experience.

1857,nira_c,Stunning,9,27 October 2021,Dune is a Masterpiece. It's visually stunning. It's got great acting. Granted it's a more faithful adaptation of the movie than the books (as other reviewers have mentioned). It does a great job of capturing life on that fictional planet.Reviewers complaining about the story leading to no where seem to forget that it's not about the ending but the journey.

'21 version I absolutely love. The fact that the characters had more depth to them is probably what did it for me. I enjoyed it immensely - if I had to pick something about which to complain, it'd be That I had NO idea that there were two parts. About 30 minutes into it, I figured it out for myself - given the depth in which the characters are portrayed. I'll be watching this one a few dozen times before part 2 debuts.

I've read the book over 20 times - and the fact that they gave the most important line to Duncan Idahol (Jason Mamoa) instead of Paul Atreides (""I accept your gift of water"") was just wrong. Duncan Idaho is a strong character in his own right, but most importantly, Paul had to establish himself with the Fremen. Great special effects - but how could ""Paul"" fight with all that hair. Wrong, wrong, wrong! I didn't need another brooding young man. So once again, I've been disappointed - although the ornithopthers really were cool!

1865,LSUK,A newcomer's perspective,4,22 October 2021,"I never read the books but seeing the hype for this and the trailers made it look pretty awesome. Unfortunately I really struggled to follow the storyline and make sense of what was going on. The visuals were amazing and the music was epic (as to be expected from Hans Zimmer), but I really tried to piece together what was happening but it just felt random at points. Too many unnecessary 'visions' in my opinion which just pulled you out of the situation. It just felt muddled and confusing.I can see the potential with this. The theme and environments are excellent and I don't fault any of the acting or visuals etc. It just felt like the storyboard was all over the place.Also worth noting, there was nothing telling us that it was going to be a ""Part 1 of X"" in the trailer or promotion material. Kinda felt a bit cheated as I expected to be watching a full story.Bit disappointed with this - didn't want to be but I just couldn't follow it as it was too muddled and confusing. Felt like they tried to introduce too much too quickly.",Dune

It is really long, the 2.35 hours sounds like 5 endless hours, one guy left the cinema and went away, i was wat hing my watch several times to see when this nightmare movie will come to an end, there was no dialog no story no good action, only CGI pictures were very good.but all of thoes dull seance, irritating sound track makes this movie the most overrated movie all of the time...",Dune

1870,rafael.clark,Very dull - but beautiful pictures and banging audio,5,3 November 2021,"I saw this is IMAX and didn't really care for it. The movie is just too cold and detattached, none of the actors ever change their facial expressions (with the exception of Jason Momoa, who feels like he should be in another movie).I just don't think any of the characters are engaging or particularly interesting, so in the end we just see beautiful pictures and get our ears ringing from all the noise and don't even remember what the movie was about.I'm starting to get suspicious when someone says that a movie HAS TO BE SEEN in IMAX, or in 3D, or in Dolby, or whatever. If a movie needs all these gimmicks to work, then it is not a movie, it's a theme park ride.I mean, I first saw ""Alien"" on a 14-inch TV set and I was amazed. The movie scared the hell out of me, I just loved it. I've also seen ""The Sound of Music"" countless times on TV, on DVD and on Blu-ray and it always warms my heart and makes me fall in love with Julie Andrews. I saw this in a movie theater once, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the movie. It didn't change my feelings towards the songs, the characters or the plot. Actually, I prefer watching this at home, in my home theater, with full control over the audio volume and being able to pause for restroom breaks.In short, if a movie is really good, it can engage you and make you fall in love with the characters even on a small screen TV with no pumped up audio. Watching a movie in IMAX is fun, of course, but if a movie NEEDS TO BE SEEN in IMAX to be appreciated, then it's likely the movie is all flair and no content... much like this ""Dune"".",Dune

A lot of well-known and certainly good actors play in it which definitely says something about the quality of the movie.

1878,s-81911,Best adaptation of dune I could ask for but..,10,23 October 2021,This film is a masterpiece. I have been a fan of dune since my childhood and this film captures everything I love about dune perfectly but the problem with is film is not the movie itself but its incompleteness. You know the problem with books like dune is that if we made this into a TV series it will probably cost around 300 million which will be a bad investment but if we make movie we need to make 2 parts of it. So only the first part seems hallow and empty as if nothing spectacular happened and since it doesn't technically have a end many people will see this and go wtf. So people have to understand this is the best we can get for the adaptation of dune and I'm sure after part 2 (if it happens) it will be held as one of the greatest piece of art in cinema.,Dune
1879,hefestow,Did this idiot read the book?!?,4,25 October 2021,What a mess. The characters are not true at all to their representations in the book. What they chose to show and not show from the book was also very questionable. 2 minute shots of spaceships flying around? Sure. Showing the dinning scene on Arakis? Nah! Most of my problems come from the portrayal of the characters and the modernization of the language they speak.,Dune
1880,lelopissetti,"Good movie, though...",9,19 October 2021,"It's a good movie, although I have to agree that the characters lack on development and the Harkoneen invasion is quite ""dark"" - as I expected to clearly see more of the ships and battles, one gets lost into darkness and a few highlights on the main characters, also with poor development.I feel that if you don't know Dune (from the books or previous movie or tv serie), you might not quite understand what is going on (at least, not on its full extent).",Dune
1881,haydenfletcher,Fine,4,10 October 2021,"The first half of this movie is pretty amazing, with the world building, mysteries, and visuals and everything. But the second half is kind of directionless and slow. Nothing is really made clear about the plot, and none of the characters have any emotional involvement in what's going on. The climax is kind of boring and comes out of nowhere. The music was great at times, at other times almost annoying with how loud and constant it was. The stuff with the Barons was pretty cool, but again not enough time was spent with any character to really know them. Visuals were great though.",Dune
1882,johnduggey,Good not great,7,28 October 2021,"If youve seen the original youre probably going to be disappointed, the plot is almost just as random and unexplained. No real war scene in the movie, really reminds me of the terribly awful Star wars reboot. Dont get me wrong though, THIS movie doesnt RUIN the entire franchise like they did...",Dune
1883,gbeleven,Why Bother?,5,21 October 2021,"Does it look great? Sure.Does it break new ground? Nope.Is it exactly the same story as the earlier movie? Except for a few cosmetic changes, yes.So why bother? I'm not sure.If you haven't read the book this will make very little sense. There's only a superficial explanation as to what's happening and why. All of the words that make the story come to life, and build a strange, alien world aren't explained and sure aren't self-explanatory. What's a bene gesserit? The movie won't clue you in. Kwisatz haderach? They say it a bunch of times, but zero exposition on what it is. What's a Mentat, and why are they important? You won't find out in this movie.Dune has an amazing universe to explore, but this just didn't explore.I know many people had a huge problem with the first movie, they complained about too much exposition, but you can't deny that you could at least understand the character's motivation!The Duke (not to mention Oscar Isaac) was introduced to be brushed aside. The Harkonnens aren't portrayed as evil. Greedy maybe, but other than Rabban killing prisoners the evil just isn't shown. Doctor Yueh? Stripped down to almost nothing. Why bother having the diamond on his head when you have no idea what it's about?Short version. If you read the book or understood the original you might like it. If you didn't do either, you will most likely be lost and pretty disappointed.",Dune
1884,mikearima,Blue Eyes,5,25 October 2021,"I have watched the original Dune in the year 2000 miniseries with Ian Mcneice as the main villain and comparing it to this 2021 version, it was more exciting, had better acting and better visuals. The only redeeming factor was Rebecca Ferguson, shes a bombshell. I saw her in Reminiscence with Hugh Jackman and I just think shes attractive although others might beg to differ.The original Dune had unique characters, just the way they looked was more interesting and the secret ingredient to get the blue eyes, no spoilers here, had a much darker and vibrant hue than the newer 2021 version. The acting by Jason Momoa was not really that exciting as his usual movies tend to be with the exception of Aquaman. The main character was a good actor although I have not seen him in other films. The duke father in the film was pretty good at acting as I seen his work in the movie, Annihilation with Natalie Portman. Dave Bautista just doesn't seem to fit the part in this act either. His acting is lackluster as well.The story is what really made me wonder how this movie achieved an 8/10. I do not agree, it was long and drawn out. Most of the time I was about ready to fall asleep. People say the visuals are amazing but I have seen way more visually enticing films such as Avatar and Lovely Bones. The movie is kind of like a really boring version of Star Wars. There was barely any action and although alot of Hall of Famer actors are in this film, I just thought it was incredibly boring. The most slow-burn film I have witnessed to date and I seen some boring films.The story line and plot were pretty good which kept the score from tanking further for me. Im not a fan of these type of films but nobody left the theater which surprised me. I was expecting half way through people would just walk away. Almost 70% of the film is just sand, talking and more sand. Oh and dreams sequences as well that just explains more boring parts to come. Hopefully part 2 and 3 will not bore me, but man, my suggestion to you is either watch on Redbox or just skip altogether. Very disappointed and I watched this on the IMAX, Dolby format. Ugh!",Dune
1885,jobayda,I want to re-watch. Desperately.,8,21 October 2021,"I honestly don't know what to say except that it was an astonishment. I really did not want to keep my expectations high. But with the cast being what it is, tremendously brilliant, I just couldn't expect a 'whatever' movie. So, I had high expectations. Now? I don't know. When I finished watching it, I just remember feeling a sort of hard-to-describe, completely new emotion. That was the first ever time I felt that sort after watching any movie. I felt eager for the next part, sure. Because one thing was sure, without a second part? This one does not matter at all. And from all the people who read Dune, it is really hard to make a movie out of it. And maybe precisely that's why I sometimes felt so lost, as if I did not know where it was going or what was the point, the soul of the movie. But maybe, the soul was the uncertainty. Or maybe I'm a naive girl trying to describe something greater than me.Whatever I might've felt afterwards, my fascination only grew with time. Now, almost a day after watching it, writing this review while controlling myself from going and watching it again (I want to experience it again in a theatre, not in a small screen). Maybe that fact alone speaks volumes. Thank you Denis Villeneuve for your phoneomonal, stupendous point of view and direction. This was, in hard facts, a ground breaking and somewhat perplexing (in a great way) watch for me.",Dune
1886,uwasattheclub,One of the Best Sci-fi Films of the Century,9,25 October 2021,"As a fan not only of the Frank Herbert novel but of Denis Villeneuve and his work, I was immensely excited for this new adaptation. Dune is a complex, intricate story with many characters and more of an emphasis on the world-building and internal political conflicts between houses than constant action.Addressing this film, the visuals mixed with special effects are staggering. With Blade Runner 2049 and now Dune, Denis Villeneuve has proven himself to be a modern-day master at building a science fiction world and crafting it with nuance and detail. The set designs, costumes and general aesthetic are breathtaking, with certain scenes being so huge in scale and scope that it can be quite awe-inspiring. The score by Hans Zimmer is one of his absolute best, often giving a chilling and otherworldly tone to the scenes. This is also easily the best adaptation of its source material. If you have read the book, you will certainly smile seeing your favourite characters on screen here, portrayed by an incredible ensemble cast (Rebecca Ferguson and Stellan Skarsgård's formidable take on the Baron are highlights). While some dialogue and scenes were cut out with new ones added in, I feel it was mostly done to the film's benefit. You are really given time to understand these characters unlike previous adaptations, with backstory and exposition being tastefully incorporated into dialogue and certain scenes without feeling too forced.However, if you are new to the franchise, I can imagine the pacing potentially turning some people off. This is not casual viewing, rather it requires your full attention to get the most out of it. This is a lengthy film with a lot of dialogue and quiet scenes, and while there is jaw-dropping spectacle and combat it is NOT the main focus of the film. Also as this is a Part One, certain seemingly important characters aren't on screen for long and without spoilers the film does end on a cliffhanger with the story only being halfway through. While it could've ended more definitively I don't really see this as a flaw. It's like criticising The Fellowship of The Ring for feeling like 1/3 of a plot, as that's what it clearly is.If you want to see an intelligent and brooding sci-fi that respects its audience's intelligence akin to the older days of Blade Runner with the sense of epic scale and world-building as The Lord of the Rings, this is the perfect pick. A masterful introduction to a franchise you will be dying to see more of, and a reminder of what Hollywood used to give audiences. Well done Villeneuve.",Dune
1887,nora-almneea,Messy,5,2 October 2021,The movie's execution is a bit messy. It was confusing most of the movie and nothing was explained even briefly. Acting was good though.,Dune
1888,jamilmderreg,One of the best movies ever!,10,18 September 2021,No other book was so incredibly adapted to the big screen as Dune! Denis Villeneuve fully understand the books and make all these characters and worlds to life! Masterful original score and cinematography. Moving emotions all the way. We can only regret the that we need to wait for years to see Dune part II. Highly recommend to see it on IMAX big screen to enjoy the movie and have the best experience!,Dune
1889,connorpearl-72679,The seeds are planted for what could be truly great.,9,23 October 2021,"I'm going to break down this film by certain areas. As you can tell by my score, I loved the film. I recommend everyone go see it. If you have the time to read my elucidations of that sentiment, cheers.~Cinematography/CG-10/10This film was, simply put, awesome. Immaculate cinematography and possibly the best CG I've ever seen. There were moments where my brain knew that what I was looking at wasn't real, because those things don't exist, but couldn't accept that what I was looking at could be anything but real-the CG was that good. The world was completely immersive, awe inspiring, and creatively shot. Something Villeneuve often did when showing massive, gargantuan objects/creatures was put something familiar in the shot with it to accentuate the scale. There would be a person, or a tree, or something else to help the viewer understand exactly how large whatever we are looking at, truly is. A fantastic and effective trick to really sell the environment and world.~Sound Design/Score-9/10This film has stellar sound design. They used volume to their advantage quite a bit, and I think seeing this film with a top notch sound system (or at the cinema) is a must. It was also scored by Hans Zimmer. Enough said.~Story-9/10The story was unique, interesting, esoteric-but not so much so that someone like me who has never read the books or seen anything else Dune-related, couldn't follow every step of the way-and exciting. It actually reminded me of another film that similarly took an old, esoteric, fanatically beloved book series and gave it a high level, Oscar-worthy rendition on the big screen to try to start a franchise. That film is-bear with me-The Fellowship of the Ring.I know it sounds lazy and preposterous, but I felt the same way seeing Fellowship in theaters 20 years ago as I did this. It's a film that is impeccably put together, takes itself seriously without being corny, and has the potential to be giant and turn a large fraction of the country, and possibly world, into sudden Dune fanatics, just as Fellowship did for the LOTR (soon to be) franchise back then.~Acting/Screenplay-8/10The acting was solid throughout. I wouldn't say anybody particularly steals the show, perhaps Chalamet, as he is in nearly every shot of this film. It was actually a bit surprising to see the story so rarely diverge from him. I thought Rebecca Ferguson did a good job as his mother, as well. This film is much less about the acting and more about everything else, however, it seemed to me.If I had to make any critiques, I would say the dialogue and some of the line delivery was stale, and inconsistent at times. It seemed to fluctuate between old school, proper ""I mustn't go, for father forbids it"" type dialogue to modern ""eyyyy what's up bud?! Long time no see, good to see ya, killer!"" Which can be somewhat off-putting. It's possible that those are just different ways different planets speak, as in earth different countries speak differently, even if they speak the same language.I will say that the length wasn't an issue to me at all, although I could see that being an issue for some. I'm a fan of epics. If you're the kind of person who would be prone to binging 3 episodes of some epic HBO show anyway, or enjoy the aforementioned LOTR films, then this won't bother you. The story moves at enough of a pace that you never feel like you're dragging.~Overall-9/10This will get comparisons to Star Wars, surely, and rightfully so; but think Star Wars through the lens of Game of Thrones. It's adult Star Wars, gritty Star Wars, artsy Star Wars. There are no pure comic relief characters, no goofy names, or even bright colors in this film. It's a serious political, mystical, sci-fi drama epic. And it's amazing.If I can be utterly personal, I sincerely hope this film does well at the box office, because it absolutely deserves and requires a sequel (or two). It only sounds crazy if you haven't seen it, but this film truly has the chance to be the Fellowship of its era, and the potential Dune franchise the Lord of the Rings of its era. A film/franchise that crosses the bridge between mainstream blockbuster and Oscar darling, something only LOTR has done before it. The rare film that satisfies mainstream movie goers, cinephiles, and hardcore nerds alike.I'll admit I had my doubts, despite loving everything Denis Villeneuve has done prior, I happen to think he's in the top tier or directors working today, and have for many years now. I felt this film might be too large a task to take on, too non commercial to be appealing to a non fan, to drab to be mainstream, among other things. But this film very quickly swept any doubts away. It's just that good.",Dune
1890,siddharthpotti-007,Is Dune great? It depends....,9,23 October 2021,"""Dune Part 1"", is an incredible showing. The first half of the movie is better than any sci fi film I have ever watched. But while, ""Dune Part 1"" lives up the hype, there is still a question left to be answered. Can it stand on its own? The answer is No. While this movie is brilliant, it cannot stand on its own because it is an expository tale. It is meant to set up the Dune universe. It's effectiveness depends on the future of the franchise. That being said, if there is a ""Dune Part 2"", this is an excellent film to start the story. If there happens to be no sequel, all of the cinematic details and pain staking choreography would have been for no point, as this film ends open. And without no takeaway or end product, it simple cannot deliver by itself. In summary, this movie is both great and mediocre. It all depends on what comes next.",Dune

1900,lake-48639,""" Dune Jumpstarts the Movie Theater Industry back to Life""",9,21 October 2021,I work at a upscale restaurant next to a very good theater with IMAX and all the premium sound capabilities. Unfortunately as most people are aware of by now COVID-19 has destroyed the movie theater industry making people less likely to get out for a dinner and a movie date. Good News! Lately there has been a shift in the amount of people coming into my restaurant to have dinner and a movie. It all started with 007. Sadly sitting at home watching Netflix or downloading movies has become the norm. I believe this is because there hasn't been alot of amazing movies coming out of Hollywood. Dune definitely changes that. Everyone around the world is starving for a movie to actually get excited about. 007 in IMAX may have broken the excitement seal but Dune is primed and ready to Blow the lid off! I went and saw the movie today......and all I can say is Wow!!! The visuals and sound are Oscar winning and the movie is a great value for a long format movie. Dune will definitely shatter all Box Office records of post Covid-19 in the coming weeks as people are starving for a good movie to go out and see in IMAX.,Dune

The scope and pacing of this movie pull you in, while the well written historical plotting and character development create a strong emotional resonance that keep you invested all the way to the end.

All of the director's strengths are put on display here: beautiful long sweeping shots, slow pace but always with intrigue and momentum, and he seemed to bring out some solid performers from the actors. Hanz Zimmer's score is excellent, great to see he can still crank out great music.What I realized during the viewing is that Dune is too much for a simple film adaptation, even with it's 2.5 hr runtime and only covering half of book one, the film left out so much that was included in the novel. I think Dune would work great as a mini-series, where we can better understand Paul's relationship with characters like Gurney and Duncan Idaho, and where his powers can be explored and explained more thoroughly. Villenueve I think does better with smaller and simpler worlds where he can capture all he needs through his great directing skills, Dunes is simply to vast and deep a world for him, that being said I don't know who could have done it better.

Most critically the trope of a young-ish adult as the long prophesized 'chosen one', their coming of age etc has been done to death since Matrix, Harry Potter, Hunger Games etc. Granted the novel on which Dune is based pre-dates the above movies, as a movie-goer there are too many familiar notes being played.Additionally, still not convinced by Timothee C.

The remake of Dune, another great Sci Fi story on the other hand is an abject lesson to those talentless Hollywood hacks at Disney on how to go about making a great story come to life. I have read a lot of science fiction over the years and in my humble opinion, if you want your movie production of any great story to stand up and be applauded, stay faithful to the book. Well done to the makers of this movie, full marks and I look forward to the next instalment,, oh and please, don't drop the ball now that you have thrown it so high.",Dune

Visually stunning, Action was good, well directed. Acting was very believable.I haven't read the book and i really liked the movie. Made me curious to learn more about characters and world, but it was very solid first chapter in my opinion. I'm pretty sure others who haven't read the book can get hooked as well, because even if you don't know anything about it, who doesn't like epic looking spaceships and giant sandworms?To elaborate even further, i think this movie will win over lots of Star Wars fans, who have been disappointed in Star Wars in recent years.

Less caricature-like? Also yes. However, there's no sign of pugs... Where's the darn pug?! Denis Villeneuve is one of the most talented directors of the last two decades. With the likes of Greig Fraser behind the camera, I can see how enticing an adaptation of one of the hardest to understand books ever made can be. However, was this movie necessary? Absolutely not. Is it a waste of 2h and 35m of your life? For an average viewer who isn't into this kind of stuff... Probably yes. There's no need for Villeneuve to continue making remakes of adaptations with such a crazy fandom and legacy. A bold move on the producers to assume that Lynch fans would not be suspicious about how similar yet different the two movies are. I recommend watching the 80's version and coming up with your own opinion. I can't wait for Villeneuve to own the Scifi/Thriller genre one day.

1946,Snidgy,Set up for disappointment but boy was I wrong...,10,20 September 2021,"Let me start off by saying I am not the biggest connoisseur nor fan of the original Dune book and/or earlier movie and series adaptations.And, contrary to some of the remarks made on this forum I am also not related to the director or hired to write this review. I can also understand that this movie may not be to the liking of quite a few moviegoers and some may even feel somewhat cheated after seeing the movie versus the trailer. It may not be the 'Frozen'-type of deceit (both my sons expected something completely different that time around, LOL) but still Dune is set up quite differently in the trailers (primarily more action-focused) than the movie itself turns out to be; at least this first part.I myself so much wanted to enjoy this movie which in my case usually can only lead to disappointment in the end....Having said all of this I personally can only conclude that I truly, whole-heartedly LOVE this movie. It is immersive beyond anything I have seen in cinema over the past decade, and maybe even during my lifetime. The feel of the worlds in which the story place (Caladan but obviously primarily Arrakis) is so brilliantly portrayed that I immediately felt drawn into the story and stayed that way throughout the full length of the movie.The mythological aspects of the story and analogy with Western civilization versus 'the rest' of our own world managed to make the movie really recognizable despite of the obviously completely fictious setting. The acting, dialogue, directing, art direction, cinematography, special effects, color pallet, pretty much every aspect of this movie was top-notch.Just a last quick warning of what Dune is NOT: It is NOT a modern Star Wars-like adventure with laser guns. It is NOT an action-packed Marvel-type movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 35 minutes straight (and don't get me wrong, I personally really enjoy those type of movies as well).Dune may take a bit of an investment by some to understand what it's not and to appreciate what Dune actually is; a truly marvelous piece of filmmaking, enriched by a true love of cinema of the filmmakers and where the story itself is the most important of all (not the thrills or special effects).Watch it on the biggest possible screen you can find and enjoy.I sincerely cannot wait to see part two and to marvel at the conclusion of this epic piece of cinema.What a time to be alive and witness this.P. S. If Warner Bros' decision to simultaneously launch Dune in the US on HBO Max and in cinemas, will result in disappointing box-office results and, as a consequence, limit the production budget or even worse, possibly the making of Dune part two, I will seriously contemplate boycotting WB for the foreseeable future.",Dune
1947,gesaugen,Made for fans of the Dune universe,9,25 October 2021,"The movie succeeds in showing the viewer how the Dune universe and story is described in the book, in such way that it's almost a documentary about the story from the book.There's no typical try-hard explaining to the viewers what's going on by making actors or particular scenes stand out, like in Lynch version (which I also like). Here the viewer is put in the role of the witness of events as they are and let to him/herself to decide what they are seeing. For example there is a lot of violence but there's no that unnecessary focus on the act of violence itself: you see people get stabbed or neck cut but the scene doesn't focus on the made wound and blood and gore of it. Result is that violence is almost PG13 and still looks brutal. Other example is depiction of Sardukars for whom you get the feeling that they aren't just well trained man that have free will and have lives of their own, but that they are almost mindless human beings who's only purpose it to kill by the order of the emperor, like warrior ants who only serve to fight and die in battle. Similar is with other soldiers from other houses whom you get feeling that they truly serve their master and house, depiction of true hierarchy as was meant in the book.If you love the Dune universe and the books, you'll love the movie. If you think you will be served amusement but know nothing about Dune universe, you'll probably be disappointed.",Dune

1950,public2-627-810893,Maybe a good preamble for a second part,7,4 November 2021,"The cinematics are spectacular and I like how Villeneuve takes time to develop this epic journey. However, the character development itself, usually Villeneuve's strength and sort of what makes the book a good story, never comes to live. Some scenes are almost comically clumsy, such as when Paul and his mother hide in a tent from a sandstorm. This moment is supposed to show the core conflict in Paul's character, but instead of letting it emerge it is battered into the viewer with such obviousness and force so as that not a single viewer shall miss it. As a result, the story feels static and the viewer disconnected from the people in it. This affects almost all characters in the film. In particular Jason Momoa's Duncan Idaho always feels too cartoonish to be real.Either way, the stakes are clear at the end of this first part and one may hope that the second part delivers more of what Villeneuve and Dune are known for: characters.7 for graphics, 6 for story.",Dune
1951,rulbike,A disappointment for the book fans.,6,25 October 2021,"As a fan of the books and after having read the complete Dune novel a couple months ago, i can honestly say that i was significantly disapointed by the film, despite its spectacular visuals, cgi, costumes and acting of course.To begin with, the one major fault i had with this film was the pacing which i though was way of and made no sense. I felt like the first hour and a half of the film dragged a lot, it basically showed what is contained in the first 200 pages (from my estimation); while the last 15 minutes of the film, rushed through what i must have been like a good portion of the book. For example take the Reverend Mother scene with Paul. The scene appeared at almost the half an hour mark, while being something mentioned in the first three chapters or so, and same with the battle in Arrakis, which appeared at the hour and half mark. Those aspects come a lot sooner in the book, while the latter part with Paul facing Jamis, ocurred more towards the middle.On a related note, the dream sequences were very long and booring. Yes, Paul has premonitions and has visions and all, but c'mon we dont have to see 10 minutes of Zendaya staring at the camera and walking, each time Paul goes to sleep. I felt they could have placed flashes or make them more amenable and not go on long expositions of every vision and dream.All in all, the movie dragged a lot and in parts which are kinda unnecesarry and on the other hand, it rushed through parts that were necesarry.Another aspect that was at fault was the background story and environment, it could have been explained a whole lot better. It could even have done with a couple of texts, not like SW of course, but something similar with a couple of lines to explain the setting, the political system at place, the year, and the importance of spice. There was close to nothing in mentioning this and I had to explain a lot to my girlfriend, who went along with me and obviously did not understand a thing. And i honestly dont blame her, because it was missing a lot of background information. Which leads me to another fatal flaw in my opinion...The film omits and changes some mayor aspects of the book, which completely left me baffled. For starters, no FEYD RAUTHA?! Like really? Imagine seeing LOTR and Saruman was left out from the first movie. It is that big of flaw. Also there is no mention of the emperor, her daughter, the navigators, and of course ""the Spacing Guild"" part of the political tripod of the whole Dune universe, also not mentioned or referenced. The CHOAM was also not mentioned. So yeah, there were some significant parts that were left out. In addition to some characters being somewhat off in their protrayals. One of them is Vladimir Harkonnen, who in the book is an evil mastermind and a complete villian. He is like Palpatine on steroids. Sadly in here he is portrayed as a dumb, fatass, who is mostly stuffing his face and rarely scheming. Same with De Vryes, who is the book is a genius and a great sidekick to the count; in the movie he had few scenes and is quickly killed. We do not get to see many of the scheming involving the Harkonnens, which is a big aspect of the book, in that the chapters usually switch from the Atreides perspective to the Harkonnen.On other aspects of the film, i believe they did a really good job. Like the Omnithopters and all, they were just as i had imagined them from reading the book. And also the suits, shields, and the Arrakis environment looked incredible. I was at amazed at the way Villenueve interpreted the Dune environment, i believe they did a really good job. The music and sound is also superb, the score by Zimmer was really good and it bleneded quite well in the movie. Similar to BR 2049, i liked the use of sound, it was a great auditive experience to see it at the theatre. To resume, the film is very well made and you will be impressed, but as a fan of the book, you will be disappointed.",Dune

1957,fredrikgunerius,You don't need to see this film,4,20 September 2021,"An hour of loitering and talkative power struggles and politics kicks off this adaptation of the first half of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"". Interspersed are wonderfully expressive shots of the landscapes and structures of the worlds of the renowned novel. But while these help set the stage for a story of epic proportions, director Denis Villeneuve's sluggish pacing and overelaborate storytelling make this film a rather unengaging, detached experience. Despite a whopping (and soporific) groundwork taking up half the film's running time, the characters remain stuck to the page, and Timothée Chalamet's beautiful face stays just a beautiful face, except in a couple of scenes of real emotional and narrative intensity. Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, the heir to the House Atreides, who may or may not be ""the one"". Yes, it's the familiar Messiah concept. And yes, it has potential in Herbert's vision, especially the aspects which connects his powers to his mother's lineage. Unfortunately, Villeneuve and his production company don't really want to tell you the story as much as they want to give you a CGI overdose and transport you safely to their faux cliffhanger so that you'll become hooked and come back to watch the sequel. ""This is only the beginning"", says Zendaya at the very end. Take her word for it. You don't need to see this film, you can safely wait for the next one.

Sci FI Channel actually managed to add to Frank Herbert's phenomenal book when they adapted it. All this does is try to emulate the 1984 disaster of an adaptaion, just with current special effects.I really dont know where to start with this movie. Visually its different to all the adaptations that have gone before, keeping the extremely basic plot markers however leaving out and not adapting key information. This leaves the audience in limbo in so many places.This isn't a tale for the low intellect, stop trying to make it that.

Horrible characters, and actors (Bautista, Momoa, Isaac, Zendaya, Bardem) i mean what's next? The Rock and Vin Diesel? Or Rihanna and Keanu Reeves?. The only decent actors were Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson (wich i love). I was so dissapointed, because i was really expecting to watch this movie for so long, but when i saw the featuring actors i thought: ""Damn, i better watch this for free"". And i was right! I'll keep sticking to the books. Oh! Almost forgot, now i prefer David Lynch's Dune, wich everyone think it sucks, well... not anymore for me. Also i can see some Giger's work. True genius.",Dune

When finally it was time to see, I prepared myself for an amazing show. HOWEVER, this movie was such a waste of 3 hours straight from beginning to the end. It is trying to depict a story, instead just doing something else. Slow motions, scenery, empty conversations, lack of action, great cast but no use of anyone's skill except 1 minute of GOT star. To be honest, there's no any single ""great visual effect"". DISAPPOINTMENT. The director just wanted to adorn the movie by cast, not even visual effect, ""to sell the sequel"". That's all it is about. Because nothing happens in this movie. You wait for something to happen. It doesn't happen. Because they are waiting to sell the second or third movie.",Dune

1969,tonygood777,Excellent Adaption,9,26 October 2021,I've seen all DUNE movies with and without narration including the SyFy versions. This one is the best by far. It's a 9 and they were 6 & 7's. This one takes time to tell the story. It ended right where it made sense!Excellent adaption especially with the right flow and pace of the story. Excellent SyFy special effects that followed the first one. Looking forward to the next 4 or 5 movies.FOUNDATION was a disappointment but this was better than expected.,Dune

I give this version only 3 stars. I didn't like it.",Dune
1974,bestvivek-agarwal,Refreshing Experience,9,24 October 2021,"This review is written with me just fresh out of the theatre.This is a treat. In every aspect.Spectacular picturization. The graphics were so good. It made everything seem so real. It was a treat to watch such good visuals after such a long time.Captivating storyline. Even having not read the novels before, the story kept me hooked on. It's simple yet powerful. You are lost in a fantasy world which seems refreshing. Also the pace at which is proceeds is a treat for people who likes to slowly get absorbed by a story.Perfect engaging cast. Each character were cast perfectly. It seemed the actors were born to play the role. They each had their own idiosyncrasies which suited them.Background score. This is the icing on the cake which blended perfectly with all the other aspects of the movie to set the wheels in motion.This is a complete package experience which I'd recommend you to watch on the silver screen.",Dune

It's mainly set on a desert planet, so most of the scenery is stark and super dusty. It uses terms like Gom Jabbar, Kwisatz Haderach, Shai halud
& Bene Gesserit. Hard enough to remember when you read the books and loved them, almost impossible to catch in this movie which when all is said and done... is really just one long setup for sequels. Almost no character development with only two standout actors in it - neither of which plays Paul Atriedes.",Dune
1976,ebduncan,Absolutely perfect,10,24 October 2021,"The casting, visuals, directing, little details, and the sounds was fantastic. I've needed to watch a movie like this for a long while now. Please don't pull a ""Hobbit"" with the next parts.",Dune
1977,oma888,A disappointing experience,2,16 September 2021,"Long winding. Messy. Lousy actor performance.I was thoroughly disappointed after two and a half hour in the theater.Why divide the movie into two parts, spending that much time on the first part and leaving out major plots?Why change another major plot for something that leave a hole in the telling.It's no better than David Lynch's version.The TV miniserie is somewhat better!",Dune
1978,yulskliff,Great start,9,25 October 2021,"I really enjoyed the movie especially the second time around and hope the next part takes it up a notch. The 2 and half hours flew by which is a good thing imo, and was left wanting more all in all great start.",Dune
1979,jwdaffeduck1,DRY (Pun intended),4,23 October 2021,"Wow, this was a dry movie. I kept waiting for it to pick up, but it never did. Many of the stars you see in the trailer, like Jason Mamosa, was barely in the movie. Many times it was hard to understand what the actors were saying because they would run their words together. All the action that was in the trailer is about all the action there is. After this, I have no interest in seeing the second part. This should have been one movie. I guess they are trying to be like Disney with their Star Wars movies. I am glad I did not pay to see this movie.",Dune

I've read all of Frank Herbert's Dune series but the original Dune has always been my favorite. Such a great job bringing the story, the WORLD of Dune to the big screen. If you can please go watch it there first & then HBOMax. Timothée Chalamet did a superb job of bringing Paul aka Muad'Dib to life. Took me 10-20 minutes into the film to BELIEVE he was Paul. He makes a believer out of the viewer. I can't say enough about this movie. I was able to quote quite a bit of the dialogue.....if follows the book THAT closely. Came out of the theater to find online that they have greenlit Part 2! GREAT NEWS!",Dune
1981,tommydangerouss,perfect adaptation for general audience,10,25 October 2021,"Movie does a great job of capturing the essence and the story without overwhelming audiences with details. The book is amazing but a movie cannot do what a book can. But that is okay, as a movie based off the book, it does a perfect job.",Dune
1982,Plastic_Giraffe,Pretty but hollow,6,5 October 2021,"First of all: I did enjoy the movie. It looks great and is a very immersive experience with excellent CGI and very detailed world-building.But it feels so very bureaucratic, with a lack of passion or artistic vision beyond the surface. It´s a sightseeing tour across the book, featuring all the memorable scenes.Sadly, -for me- it misses the mark when it comes to character development or even reflecting the general ""atmosphere"" of the original story.The director´s sense for focus and pacing is just slightly off, but that is enough to make this adaption feel hollow.We see the desert, but no drop of sweat (yes, yes stillsuits, but c´mon).The Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Spacing Guild. All paraded in a bureaucratic manner with no emphasis or much finesse in storytelling. Stunning visuals and a veeery slow pace cannot gloss over that lack of coherence.The Harkonnen are just a bunch of insecure space weirdos that happen to wear black and do bad stuff (bar the baron, I liked the acting / character here actually).As the first part, this feels like a very long intro. And that, it just doesn´t do well enough.Dune 2021 is an above-average / OK movie. Mostly because it could have been great.",Dune
1983,rhelmers_14,Quite Entertaining,7,23 October 2021,"Well done movie and very entertaining. However, when I dedicate >2.5 hours to a movie I typically expect resolution. The movie was quite good, so they have me hook, line, and sinker for Part 2.",Dune
1984,XAimerGamerX,Gorgeous Retelling,8,19 October 2021,"Denis villeneuve's version of Dune is visually stunning and has to be seen on the big screen to catch all the glory. All performances are solid with Timothée Chalamet getting better every movie. A bit of a typical Villeneuve slow burner with the third act picking up pace. And Hans Zimmer brings his usual brilliance atmospheric and melodic score. A solid 8/10 for me, can't wait for part 2...if it happens.",Dune
1985,exiton3,It is too slow and boring,4,22 October 2021,"Half of the movie one hour and half nothing is happening before first action scene! Even action scenes are slow and boring!

Too much detail, there is no way to preserve that detail in a movie format. But Denis man, you've done it. This is an absolute masterpiece.From the incredible performances, to the writing, soundtrack, locations and cinematography, attention to details, costumes, this movie is a spectacle and the story is shown in incredible fashion.You NEED to see this in the cinema, it is not just a movie, but an experience. I haven't had a movie in the back of my mind for days after seeing it in so many years. It is mature, it respects you and doesn't explain things to you like you're stupid. It throws you into this gigantic, future world, full of intrigue, darkness and sheer epicness.For me, the best sci-fi movie I've seen.",Dune
1987,Edwin-ghysebrechts-1,Beautiful but flawed,8,21 September 2021,"I'm one of those few people who read the books first and consequently liked the lynch-adaptation. Somehow it really envisioned most characters how I portrayed them before in my head. Even the guild-members which have yet to appear in the new films. Beautiful cinematography like always with Villeneuve. Some great ideas, like the way they portrayed the 'voice' used by the bene geserit or the fighting with the personal shields. Not wild about the dragonfly choppers. But all in all found myself at times distracted near the end of this part. The visions paul had became anoying very quickly. Ok, he can see fragments of the future, move on.So a small comparison as to the choice of characters: duke leto was great in both films, paul's mother jessica was much better portrayed in the new version, excellent choice of actress and one to watch I presume, the baron also slightly better in the new one as was beast rabban, didn't see feyd rautha yet? Will be hard to beat a young Sting. Although i like jason momoa, i've had a hard time envisioning him as duncan (which was my favourite figure in the books) : too brawly, not at all calculated. Gurney halleck was an improvement really over 'captain picard' . With piter devries (who plays a bigger roll in the book and was portrayed excellent by brad dourif) they missed out completely in my opinion, unremarkable. I liked both tufir hawat's, missed the eyebrows maybe. Timothee chalamet definitely a big upgrade to the twin peaks guy. Chani was greatDefinitely looking forward too part two.",Dune

Just love dune...
The books were the next level.. Even better.. 😁Then I heard about this new movie...
After watching blade runner 2049 (I'm a huge blade runner fan also), damn I was blown away...
Story, visuals, sound, music all blew me away..
Then started to watch more from this amazing director..
He is now my in my top 3..With Nolan, and Tim burton..When I saw this movie last night, I kept an open mind, as I had Lynch version imbedded in my mind.And......Damn...i loved it... Absolutely loved it...The pace was awesome, and needed. Visuals are crazy good, and sound, well, the sound was insane 😁😁When the movie ended, I wanted and NEEED more... I was so hooked... It was beautifully done..I love this version and lynch equally... They are different but in ways the same..I REALY want a part 2..and Hope he makes some of the other books he talked aboutEveryone go see this amazing film.. Support the cast, director, and everyone involved..Lets get a part 2 and more movies made ..It was so refreshing to see Dune, instead of another super hero flick...

1992,mpotran,Style over substance,6,23 October 2021,"Nice scenery, nice music, nice photography, good casting but no story, no dialogue. The old movie was much better - more emotions, more drama, less illogical things and less plot holes. It could be rated better for what it is if they would cut it down to about an hour and a half. I unknowingly compared it to Blade Runner 2 as it felt the same - turned out it was the same director but in Blade Runner all the lack of dialogue and the sense of loneliness in the movie made sense as the lead role was mainly alone and isolated for the most part of the movie. To avoid spoilers i will just say that such advanced civilizations don't engage in combat as here - in one part you show how advanced their weapons are and at the other hand all of the battles fought they go down to using something else. Contradictory! Well maybe i spoiled it, just a little bit.",Dune
1993,Cimeriies,"Epic, just Epic in every way.",10,21 September 2021,"Saw this in cinema at the premier, and it beat all my expectations. It ended perfectly as you felt the next chapter was about to begin. The quality, the acting, dialog and suspense keeps even the politics interesting and the flow was great. It takes its time, and its just as it should be. Great adaptation to the big screen. Both the characters/politics and action/scifi gets its fair share. Loved it!",Dune
1994,rkursawe,I finally get Dune!,10,20 September 2021,"Thank you Denis Villeneuve for this thoughtful, cinematic, intelligent, complex but not overcomplicated film adaptation. I have never been able to get to grips with the Dune universe because the previous adaptations simply could not make me understand what this world is all about.That has now changed and I haven't had so much desire for a second part since Lord of the Rings.And the best thing about it is: no comic relief, no overplayed characters. The film is very adult and therefore refreshingly different from the other current Star Wars like Movie rubbish.And I don't understand the people who complain about the ending. I think the film stops at exactly the right place and makes you want more. And I thank the director for taking the time to calmly introduce us viewers to the world.I really hope there will be a second part, I can't wait.",Dune

My only regret was that Bautista's and Skaragard's characters were nowhere near as vile, repulsive and disgusting as the original characters.....but then again, you're NEVER gonna top the performance of Kenneth McMillan in the 1984 release!Now, how long to we have to wait for part 2??",Dune
1998,evanwijk,Ok,6,2 October 2021,"My main problem with Villeneuve's Dune is it all looks so plain and, well.... A bit boring? Hardly any colors (black & brown), and everything's so normalized. Baron Harkonnen for example, is just a fat dude. No interesting clothes, not even outrageously fat, and not as repulsive (facial warts, eating habits) as Lynch's Baron of the TV series version.The only cool thing about the visuals is that it's all on a huge scale, but the space ships are just dark, hardly any other interesting features (with the exception of the balloon powered ship). Costumes too are black & brown. Boring, middle of the road, unimaginative Sci-Fi.Casting on the other had is very good, absolutely loved all casting (except for the baron). As said, characters would've been more interesting with richer costumes. Also, the aren't that many differences between Houses or cultures, this is really a big fail, since Herbert's source material is such a rich source of cultural differences.I miss the funeral scene of Jamis, unlikely to come back in part II.",Dune
1999,fffrrr-16096,Wow!!!,10,28 September 2021,"After making an unsuccessful movie and series from the same novel, Dennis entered a difficult bet and a great challenge, but he succeededa completely different experience and advanced in a new way, at least it was new to me. The first half of the film focused on the characters and the world, and at the same time, the second half was epic and full of events that did not Make you feel this was only a first part.There is nothing I can add to the cinematography and soundtrack. Each one of them was greater than the other. Timothee performance was wonderful and in general the actor, year after year, impresses me more.",Dune
2000,kellygfullmer,Not Perfect but awfully good,9,27 October 2021,"As a high school English teacher, I have taught Frank Herbert's Dune for many years to seniors. I have read the book at least 10 times and watched the two previous film versions of this book at least as many times. Lynch's 1984 attempt is grand, fantastic, and memorable but ultimately leaves those who have read the book feeling unsatisfied. SciFi's Channel's 2000 rendition did the book more justice but suffered from all the limitations a made-for-tv budget imposes on a production.This latest effort from Villeneuve has all the cinematic elements that made Lynch's film such a grand spectacle but without the off-putting strangeness, convolution, and complexity that repelled 80's viewers not familiar with the story. My wife watched Dune with me last night on HBOmax and was able to follow the movie with minimal explanation from me. Villeneuve does a great job condensing a big and complex novel, half of it anyway, into a package the Dune neophyte can enjoy.I found myself wishing he had included the scenes that lovers of the novel would have appreciated, like the banquet scene, but I understand that scenes like that one would not translate well to the screen from the page and only confuse and bore viewers. Instead, the director emphasized and doubled down on the action scenes-almost without sacrificing the nuanced layers of the book's plot.The casting is simply excellent, and the art direction is, in a word, superb. This is the Dune film I have waited 30 years to see, emphasis on see. The book remains topical and relevant, and the newest film of it does too. Politics, feminism, economics, environmentalism, religion, and more permeate the novel or at least adorn the film when they don't play a more central role.I have not taught the novel in several years, but I plan to finish this semester with it thanks to Villeneuve's passion for the story and excellence in bringing it to life, once again, on the big screen.Rarely do good books get made into good movies. Usually one of the two is lacking, but when they do, fans are treated to a rare gift. I put Dune, and hopefully its sequel, in the company of Harry Potter and the subsequent films and Lord of the Rings with Peter Jackson's creations.",Dune
2001,prisecaru_florin,Disappointing,7,19 October 2021,"This film wasn't so good as I expected. Too bad! The book was totally ignored. For now the still the best is old Dune by David Lynch. I don't know what was the director objectives but the movie is very superficial, do not touch you. I didn't have any emotion on entire movie.",Dune
2002,jovicajovcic,Pretty boring...,1,24 October 2021,"I've seen a lot of hype about this movie over multiple social media platforms, and i was eager to watch it myself. When i finally sat down to see it, i barely finished it. The movie is not interesting at all... I found myself searching for my phone multiple times and i hate when somebody has their phone while watching a movie... I also forgot everything i watched as soon as the movie finished. It wasn't memorable to me at all.The music also bothered me too much to the point i couldn't focus on the movie. And that one really struck me because of the music artis who's behind it. I don't know. I don't want to sound like a hate when every one around me loves it, but i couldn't recommend this to anyone.",Dune
2003,garfarkle-83769,I heard about 20% of the dialog,5,28 October 2021,"Saw Dune yesterday at an IMAX theater and the movie was visually stunning. However, the background music and lines spoken in whispers left me watching a film with virtually no dialog. I had no idea of what was going on. If you're over 60, this film is very difficult to understand.",Dune
2004,chuckwalker-27755,Just as bad as the 1980's version,2,22 October 2021,"I wanted to like this, but was almost a full hour into the ""story"" and nothing has grabbed my interest. Extremely boring story for film. Plus, the sound design for at least the first 40 minutes was way over the top with low tonal droning sounded like budhist monks playing a dungchen. Annoying. I kept waiting for some kind of interesting action to happen. Nothing.Plus, the color tones were overly sullen and looked like everyone was going to a funeral. Boooooring.Also, why do all these ""sci-fi"" movies have these fully advanced aircraft technologies and still do hand-to-hand fighting with swords? Lame.Sorry, didn't like anything about this movie.",Dune
2005,AdamantiumLive,A science-fiction epic that takes its time setting the stage and rewards you with a rare visual spectacle that needs to be seen on a big screen!,9,20 September 2021,"I got out of the film about an hour ago, so the impressions are still relatively fresh. However, I don't think that anything can shake my almost entirely positive view in the near future. The biggest compliment I can give right now is how new and original it feels. Right from the first minute it sucked me into the world of Dune. It was like witnessing the birth of a vast new film universe that wants to reach out to its audience and be discovered.You can tell that this is only the first half of the book. Everything is set up at a slower pace and you get to know the different parties and characters first. As someone who has neither seen the book nor the film from 1984, I say: If they only spend half the time, shortened or sped it up, the events in the last third would not have had the same effect. The key moments carried a lot more weight and I noticed how I was able to empathize more with Paul as a person, especially towards the end.On a visual level, this film is outstanding, and I've rarely seen one where the full experience was so closely connected to the big screen. The camera shots are just gorgeous and I almost got tears in my eyes finally seeing such beautiful science fiction since a long time. Everything felt so grand and the cinematography is on point. Especially the sequence in which House Atreides travels to Arrakis is absolutely epic. There is also the sound design that completely utilises the capabilities of the Dolby Atmos system in my cinema. I'd say it was perfect for my taste.Explosions, the sandworms and spaceships were appropriately loud, but small nuances are never lost, everything is properly mixed and dialogues are always understandable. Meanwhile, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack thunders from all speakers at the right moments and emphasizes the visual spectacle. You can tell that this is one of his most ambitious projects, it's also one of the most experimental soundtracks of the year. There are beautiful, melancholy sounds, in other places female singers sing in their highest voice and sometimes hissing voices whisper ominous texts.The only real flaw is that the film ends. It is an ending that is untypical for a blockbuster these days and asks the viewer to think about the development of the characters over the course of the story again. If you don't know that this is only the first half of the story, I can understand if you end up a bit let down in the credits. ""Part Two"" will therefore have a huge impact on how ""Part One"" will be viewed in the future. There is currently no movie that needs a sequel more than Dune. It would be a crime against cinema if it gets never made due to potentially lower audience numbers.",Dune
2006,metricsnider,Idk what I'm watching,3,30 October 2021,"This movie is rather strange it's confusing and random as well, throughout the movie it's not clear what the movie is even about there's no real purpose to what is happening characters don't have any substance half of them either have no name or you can't care to remember it because they're entire storyline is trivial and they're just a servant or slave or something. Like Jason mamoas character for instance he has no personality he's literally just a guard with no explanation to his life is he a family member is he just a highly skilled warrior? Or zendayas character she literally doesn't exist in the movie just a dozen flashback type scenes she doesn't even have a name, or the random black lady that helped them when they're base was destroyed who even is she why is she important? There's no explanation of the people or culture they don't show anything besides the royal family and a few others that have one liners no shots of the city-base or people walking and talking or people at bars or just doing stuff to make the world they live in feel believable...what is the future like how do people act? It's the future but there's more witches and Magic characters then scientists is this all some magic future or technological future it makes no sense there witch's and time seers and people that can tell other what to do but it's not explained and makes no sense. They literally have no electrical technology it's all just magical hologram shields and a moth helicopter not much Else is futuristic the furniture looks the same or worse almost looks like they make everything out of rock...Tf is this the flintsones? They don't seem to have any internet or media technology or simple communication phones it's Unrealistic there's at least a half dozen times calling someone could have helped but no they have to get lucky enough to run into whomever they're hoping to save like when the base is attacked and nobody knew until it was far to late is there no alarms, phones, radar I mean they could detect meteors in the 1970's but these people can't detect a flying moon sized ship in the atmosphere?And don't even get me started on the ambush scene you mean to tell me everyone goes to sleep at once with no alarms or patrols and the shield system keeping everyone's life intact can be disabled? And also midway through the mom and sun are stuck in a tent it would be really nice and easy to pick up a phone and call someone but no they don't have one because they apparently don't exist and when they're on the enemy ship before it's shut off someone is talking through a old looking radio thing like the ones is semi-trucks they're already so outdated idek what they're called why are people in the yr 10000 using a old truck communicator? So that's a lot of bad an not a lot of good. Weak no name characters, corny technology, half-assed world building, no clear plot. I'll have to give it a low score idc what critical acclaim studio or actor they hired the movie is foolish and stupid anyone could have acted in it and anyone could have wrote it, it boggles my mind people get paid millions of dollars to make some random nonsense when dreams make Nonsense for free every night. Honestly that's what this movie feels like a random dream that you don't even understand.",Dune
2007,etbockjr-96729,Another ATTEMPT to put Dune on the big screen.,5,23 October 2021,"For anyone who has read and reread the novel, once again you will be disappointed. For anyone who hasn't read the book, you might like it. This film leaves out too much of the main storyline, alters characters motives and what they do get from the book makes no sense due to the reasons at the beginning of this overly long sentence. Dune should have been made into a series like Game of Thrones, at least like the first few seasons, rather than a movie or movies. Anyone who has read the Dune books would know what I mean. I gave it a 5 because it is visually stunning and I like the flying machines ( inspired by dragonflies). Oh, even with everything they left out, some how the managed a long two and a half hours which with the slow pace of the film made me sleepy.",Dune

2010,jeromhartmann,Villeneuve's most dissapointing film to date,6,22 September 2021,"On the screen you will see beautiful images. Many frames resemble abstract paintings with colossal objects moving in space. The little people in obscure costumes stepping out of even more obscure vehicles are fascinating to watch. Occasionally, the influences of classics like 2001 and Stalker can be seen. The CGI is provided by the best VFX teams and the music of Hans Zimmer is formidable and impact heavy as is often the case. In addition, this film has a star cast. Chamalet plays well and is perhaps the only bit of soul this film has.Dune is perhaps a story that should not be made into a movie. This film cannot possibly depict the story of Dune. For people who come purely for the film, and havent read the books, there is little to grasp the story, other than a vague class struggle and a plot similar to James Cameron's Avatar. At no point is the viewer motivated to care about the characters (except Chamalet perhaps), the beautiful images are beautiful to look at, but exhausting in the long run, like lingering for too long in a modern art museum. Villeneuve has failed to do for Dune what he has done for Blade Runner. In a weird way, the atmosphere reminded me of his earlier film Incendies, but minus the emotion. After the movie, you feel like you've swallowed the sand from the dunes you've seen on the screen. It is a bone-dry film that leaves you bone-dry.",Dune

2013,jagesara,"Dune , masterpiece of modern movie making",9,19 September 2021,"Review of ""DUNE"". Part One. Newest blockbuster of director Denis Villeneuve (from ""Bladerunner 2049, Sicario, Arrival, Incendies""etc). And what a successful attempt to bring the book alive on screen. It's magical, mystical and mysterious throughout every scene. The music is an important participant in creating the right atmosphere for the viewer to understand the time and the circumstances. And music director Hans Zimmer has delivered plenty. The year is 10191, people are living on all kinds of planets. However, human greed has not changed after so many centuries, still no healthy evolution there. The hunger for power, colonialism and superstition is still part of the world. Daily life has blessings and challenges. The struggle to hold on to good values in ethics is real. As always the game between good and bad is started with planning, with a little seed and a lot of hope. There are several stories, all part of the big one, intertwined in brutal action, philosophical conversations and fearful experiences. Some have to die, to save others, for the greater good. Some have to be born to lead the way, for who? Are they fanatics, are they truthful or is this just some insane human interaction of trying to become Gods/Godesses? Villeneuve has thrown quite some questions and it's not easy to find answers. What/who is really good, can we question someone's motivation, cause good and bad are never crystle clear. Can prophecies be manufactured by careful planning ? And is the obvious mistake overlooked, the things we can't control. If we take a look at the scenery, the desert itself is an absolute entity that can control, break and devour humans. At the same time it provides ""the spice"", making humans addictive, dependent and always ready for war ! Whoever possesses the spice, will rule the world. It's the major asset in the galaxy that can determine life or death. And still, humans can't find a way to work together and have the best of all that is provided by Nature. This is to me the main plot of the story. Those who join hands , in trust and friendship, can go a long way. They can enlighten others, be a role model and maintain (world)peace. When this doesn't work out it's for a simple reason, ""the level of perception"". Not everyone understands what has to be done or what has to be not done for the greater good. Only a simple reason and explanation: the big ego. That's why Paul Atreides, who is to be the great saviour/hero, is tormented by all the visions and actions. He can foresee the outcome but is never sure that it will really happen this way, because he's still learning about his powers. He's such a good child and student, tries his very best, but understands only half of what is happening in the world. So sometimes he gets devastated with every setback. At such a young age he already has to fight powerful enemies. Will he live up to the prophecy, become the great protector, or will he change the course of his fate and fight his way through all the battles he dreamed of ? Will he find the love of his life, will Love be part of the blessing? When one has so many burdens in life, it's mighty hard to bring back peace and understanding in the world. We'll find out in Part Two ! Villeneuve has really stretched his talents this time, in adaptation, in a high-level storyline, in music, in the amazing casting of the characters (Ferguson, Momoa, Isaac, Brolin, Zendaya, Bardem etc) and in making us feel what Paul feels (despair and hope). Entertainment, multi action-scenes and excellent performances. Must See !!",Dune
2014,pmdiesinger,Inferior remake of 1984 movie adaption,3,31 October 2021,"A lot has been said about this movie already, so I will focus on key points:
1) This movie is NOT an original adaption of the Frank Herbert books. It is a remake of the 1984 cinematic adaption by David Lynch.2) Both - books and the 1084 version - are superior to the 2021 version
3) The movie is dominated by a) a lack of original ideas anb b) visually over-dominated by close-ups. Where the book and 1984 adaption do very well at world-building the 2021 adaption almost entirely moves this into the background at best.Sound/music: Serves the purpose; not worthy of the name Hans Zimmer and not even matching the 1984 OST by Toto
cast/performance: Mediocre at best
visuals: Cheap tricks and fillers; way too many close with some CGI mixed in.Edit: could be shortened by 20 min easily without taking anything away.",Dune
2015,h-20587,"Almost perfect, great sci-fi cinema",9,19 September 2021,"This is a fantastic realization of Frank Herbert's DUNE. It was a wise step to only cover half of the story of the novel, given how dense and rich it is. This movie also is dense and rich but the 2.5hrs fly pass you like that. Never was I bored with anything, being fully immersed in the rich visuals and sounds. Actually, the 2.5hrs were not enough to give every character the same focus and narrative development but this might've been impossible with Villeneuve's distinct style of giving everything enough time to breathe. The beating heart (and the narrative focus) of this movie are Paul and Lady Jessica, a fantastic mother-son relation with truly outstanding performances by Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. The movie is almost perfect, it however begs for a Part Two in order to see the rest of the story and themes brought to their conclusion. What it does though is tell one specific part of the novel in full, and that is the resolve of Paul's inner struggle - and it's heartbreaking beautiful. With DUNE Part One we have a great achievement in sci-fi cinema and if you're able to, and feel safe as regards Covid, go and definitely see it in a movie theater.",Dune
2016,amadio-31555,I think only people who read the book should review.,10,2 November 2021,"I read some of the reviews here and it drives me crazy when someone comments on the story instead of the way the movie executes it. If you read the books you would see that they are deeply rooted in religion. Both Islam and Catholicism are represented in the book. So to be surprised or disappointed by this in the movie is mind numbing. I loved this adaptation, though the baron in the 1980's version is way more disturbing. Love the casting, if you feel an actor didn't have a large enough part you should realize that the part will be more in-depth in part two. I really think more people should just pick up a book now and then.",Dune
2017,spencermcook,A movie made for IMAX,9,22 October 2021,"If one film has been talked about most over the past two years, I'd argue that Dune is the name that comes to mind (and rightfully so). An original concept created by author Frank Herbert in 1965 as a science-fiction novel has gone through 3 previous screen adaptations (two TV mini-series, and one film) which never resonated with viewers. Fortunately, Writer and Director, Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Prisoners) took this extremely complex story and brought it to life unlike any previous adaptation.Synopsis:""Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence, only those who can conquer their own fear will survive.""What You See, Feel, and HearThere's a difficulty in presenting a story as complex and creative as Dune and allowing the viewer to feel a sense of realism, yet Dune has done just that. This is a testament to Villeneuve's directing style as shown in movies such as Blade Runner 2049 or Arrival, where regardless of the scale of a science-fiction plot he allows you to feel as if these worlds are around you and possible to experience. Visually, you get a glimpse into a future that very few imagine, yet many predict, and that is one of scarce resources; a very dry, desert-filled story with a neutral color balance, yet nothing short of cinematic with the introduction of many worlds on screen.Though, the visual aspect is what initially caught my attention, the one aspect I walked away thinking about was the score by Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar). Each sound and vocal were tailored so tight for this film specifically, that it's difficult to imagine someone listening to this soundtrack without the film being present. With a ""tribal awakening"" direction to the music that was created, the score added depth and understanding to a story that may have been more confusing without it. The score also brought out the emotions that were difficult to feel at times.The film left me in a state of curiosity; not due to a lack of storytelling, but rather a lack of full understanding, and that's OKAY. The story was new to me, and very complex with intricate details throughout the 2h 35m runtime. However, because of the quality of visual effects, storytelling, score, and acting, I'm eager to go watch this film again and that's a trait that every movie should seek to allow viewers to feel; a desire watch the movie again!My TakeOverall, I enjoyed Dune. I had high expectations coming into this film and needed a couple days to process what I experienced. I enjoyed the film because of the original story. Yes, this story has been shown three previous times on screen. However, this is the first time we experience a collaboration of storytelling, directing, acting, composing, and film work quite like this within the franchise. My main critique for this film is capturing the right emotions. The actors portrayed their emotions authentically yet I believe Villeneuve and the Director of Photography could have used alternative lenses in order to enhance the emotions in specific scenes where the opportunity was available.Last, but not least, this film was created to be seen in IMAX and I highly recommend doing so. At the very least, I recommend watching this film in theaters.Grade: 8.7/10.",Dune
2018,phippysma,Read the book,3,18 October 2021,"If you haven't read the book then don't bother. The original story weaves a broad tapestry of characters and gives a background that forms the foundation of a great tale. This film barely scratches the surface, and the bit of the story that it tells could have been told in half the time. The 1980s version (with Sting) was marginally better.",Dune
2019,itsmehowie-95131,Is Dune a good or great movie?,6,22 October 2021,"Having read the novel and watched the 1984 film, I can offer this opinion of its quality and appreciation. This 2021 version follows the story as Frank Herbert intended. The acting and excellent cast by far exceeds the original. However, the early portion of this version drags and to the unfamiliar movie viewer, it may be unclear exactly what the intricacies of the story is about. The original film using the narrative thoughts of Paul Atriedes explains a lot of the gaps that this film lacks. For these reasons, I will not give a high rating and view this as a 6 stars (out of ten).",Dune
2020,christianaabyorellana,Actually a 8...,10,28 September 2021,"I put down a 10 to counter the stupidity that is reviewers that put down a 1 or 2 on this movie. Those same reviewer surely gave The Lobster and Dogtooth a 10, talk about snoozefest. Just because something is slow and complex, doesn't mean it's good. I would say, go watch it and make up you own mind.With that said, Dune would've done better with some more complexity.Dune had its best moments with Rebecca Ferguson when it came to acting. She didn't really fit in with the rest of the characters, but her character had me intrigued and interested the most.I will give Talamet a pass, since his character must have been heavyly directioned by the script and director. And he is a good actor, to say the least, but his character didn't really have me as hooked as the Lady Atreides character. He was missing something and I suspect that something had to do with the screenplay and dialogue. It needed more philosophy.What I would say added to the runtine must've been the overly excessive flashes of the future or possible future. And at times I found myself feeling like I was watching a raw cut. Alot of time went in to showing us some amazing landscapes and great views, but even that became overly excessive at times.The story overall was great and would've needed 2 more hours to capture the entirety of Frank Herbert's sandworld in this Part 1. But seeing how movies work, that would've been impossible. Maybe making a mini-series would've been better for the stories sake, but then we wouldn't have been able to watch it in the cinemas.All in all Dune delivered a great experience and has to be watched in a cinema at least ones.And like I said before, don't listen to all these hipsters that enjoy 3 hour dramas in the cinema, but miss to enjoy a intriguing and beautiful movie which didn't miss by much at all. So go to the cinema and make up your own mind.",Dune
2021,hacienda-00520,Falls Short,4,27 October 2021,"Dune 2021 is an example of a remake that fails to tell a story that the first film does well. Darkness and resounding musical scores dwarf the dialogue leaving one wondering why captions are not used. Given to-day's technology, one has to appreciate the efforts that went into David Lean's earlier film. Yes, many scenes are impressive, but really too much is left to imagination rather than presented from the mind of the director. Lean's film is a well-developed understandable story, but this new version can only be comprehended by a Dune reader. Character development and styles are also weak. Though the role of Paul is well cast and well acted, the other major characters fall far short of good casting and character development.

2024,ameliethomson,Thank you Denis for offering us another great cinematographic experience,10,20 September 2021,"I've always been a fan of Denis Villeneuve since I watched Incendies. He reminds me of Nolan's ability to combine the beauty and intelligence of independent cinema, with the intensity and thrill of blockbusters.Dune is no exception : I was completely transported, I wasn't on planet Earth, I was on Arrakis. Visually, it's totally out of this world - no pun intended - it's pure perfection.The charisma of its main actors (mostly Timothée, Zendaya, Oscar, and Jason) bursts the screen. I don't understand some people say « nothing happens » it's packed with action, and I literally didn't feel it was 2hours and a half long. It's a sci-fi masterpiece, Denis has done it again, can't wait to see the next episodes!",Dune
2025,jstevendempsey,0/12 fanboys found this review helpful,6,29 October 2021,"Somewhere between Hans Zimmer's ""Ave Maria"" and another Tremors scene I realized I knew nothing about Paul. This movie - as I cannot speak for the books or any other visual version - featured exceptionally shallow characters and a cringe-worthily trope-y, boring protagonist. How so little story found its way into this two-and-a-half hour long Pilot Episode is beyond me.Effects are great, it's big and atmospheric and sweeping. Which makes it the PERFECT movie to have on in the background at your next get-together. Set up your 4k TV, check out the pretty shots of the sunny Sahara or the cliffs of Scotland, but only in passing, and then go back to doing something worthwhile.",Dune
2026,jgmarinho-83269,Dennis has now started a morally and politically ambitious saga,9,30 October 2021,"This is probably the first work I see being adapted for the screen, with such ambition and determination, although the result is not always what was expected. Dune by Dennis Villeneuve is a very interesting and striking adaptation of the work of Frank Herbert. It presents a beautiful cinematography, with various visual spectacles, while it sometimes lacks a more in-depth script that connects us with the main characters. There are scenes that I would have liked to see being passed from the book to the screen, but unfortunately they didn't make it to the final cut. The end of the film is a little anti-climactic, but the relationship between story and time available is understandable. Aside from these small aspects, Dennis has now started a morally and politically ambitious saga. Can't wait to catch up on upcoming movies.",Dune

People saying it is to slow expect from every movie to be full of action and jokes every few minutes. This movie is more about the art deep in it.

It was slow but I wasn't bored. What I was though ... was confused. Not having read the book or even a synopsis I was grasping to understand what was 'going on'. It took me about an hour to get to the point were I was comfortable watching it. I must admit I think I was being very tolerant... I usually give a movie 20-30mins to grab/impress me. After that its in my 'bad books'. I sometimes feel that movie makers forget they are primarily there to entertain not to provide the most perfect piece of art which bewilders the audience.

2033,quicksilverdm,only one complaint,9,29 September 2021,"I have about this masterpiece: it was too short. It could have went on and on. So addictive by visuals and score. The story follows no huge arc or climax but it´s going like a sinus curve with ups and downs in a very natural manner and pace. There were moments that burned into my mind. They felt either so sad or threatening. By all it´s epic scale it´s the cast with peak performances throughout who carry the / their story with dignity and heart. Timothée Chalamet surprised me in ""Call Me By Your Name"" but here he carries landscapes of emotions with the tiniest of facial movements in an even more sophisticated way. Rebecca Ferguson as his mother ist very good as well. This mother-son thing is something very special and not seen very often in movies. Mostly one can find mother-daughter or father-son stories. Highly recommanded. I am German btw. Dune was released here 16th September.",Dune
2034,aeneaskokkelmans,One of the most interesting films i have ever seen,10,18 September 2021,"I saw Dune last night with a friend and altough we both havent read the book, we were blown away. I loved every single second of this movie, i have never seen visuals this good ever in a movie, the acting was amazing, especially Timothee Chalemet, that boy is going places, Hans Zimmer's score is beautiful (as always) and a perfect match to this movie.The thing i loved the most about this movie is the worldbuilding, everything is so interesting and georgeous to look at. The machines and equipment they use, the clothes they wear and so on. The concept of everything is just so interesting and different than every sci-fi movie i have ever seen, simply amazing.However, I think not everyone is going to enjoy this movie, it is a slow moving story that takes its time to unfold so you can see more of this world and i love that. All i can say is that it was very different than i expected it to be, but i loved every frame of it.Like I said i havent read the book so i cant really judge the story to much but from someone who went into this movie blind i can tell you the story is amazing and a perfect first chapter to this story, and i am left wanting more so i cant wait untill the second part comes out! Untill then, i am definitly going to read the book so i can know how this interesting sci-fi masterpiece will end.Make sure to watch it in the cinema if you have the chance, you will be blown away!",Dune
2035,bonas123,Are you kidding me?,6,26 October 2021,"Let me start by saying that there are many positives about this film. The visuals are fantastic, the acting is top notch, and the story - what we get of it - is intriguing.My problem is that this is incomplete - and there are no firm plans to finish. I feel a huge sense of false advertising. I understand that the source material may be too difficult to condense into one movie - but I recall no marketing that sold this as ""Part 1"", and as of now, ""Part 2"" is not even approved. There is no guarantee that a sequel will happen, nor is the cast guaranteed to be the same if does. It feels as though we only have the first act in a play and then are sent home at intermission. See you in 3 years.... maybe. Imagine Star Wars ending with Empire Strikes Back. If this had been sold to be as a 2 part series with an expectation of when the next installment was due, this rating would be more like an 8. If left like this, there are too many unanswered questions, too many confusing motivations, that I walk away profoundly unsatisfied.Looking at this movie stand alone, my chief complaint is that the action sequences - particularly the battle scenes - are pretty weak and confusing. The soldiers of House Atreides are supposed to be quite formidable, but they are dispatched rather easily and the fights fail to carry any weight other than Paul's fight with Jamis, which was well done, if brief.Also - it seems preposterous that the invasion went down as it did. How does House Atreides, knowing they are being set up and knowing the dangers - have all their ships on the ground and everyone tucked into bed at night? They're a great house but they're that stupid? And some how the family doctor is able to access military comms? Perhaps thats the source material - but that's pretty weak.",Dune
2036,karthickthankyou,Extraordinary world setting,8,5 November 2021,I did not read the book. I think It is such a rich story to be made at this time.Im a big fan of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 and I found Dune to be fast paced for some reason. Even it covers only half the book.Paul joining with fremen (leading them) is a pretty good place for ending the first part but the execution did not leave me feeling pumped up to see their adventure together. Maybe fremen were not given a strong introduction. Maybe their union does not happen in a grandway.The ending left me feeling underwhelmed.Also the flashes of visions are overused showing Zendaya almost throughout the movie.,Dune

Because it is a scene after a scene without proper connection, most boring visuals ( I suppose it is a desert planet ), hastily thrown dream sequences, no character development ( You don't even understand the changes they are going through ). I have never seen such a high budget boring movie. Not even a single thing to be excited for. Actors performances are ( maybe according to the script ) as dull as it can be.

2038,danimita,A beautiful adaptation of an aged story,7,7 October 2021,"The first Dune book came out in the 60s. It's said to have inspired classics like the Star Wars franchise and indeed this film does tell the first half of an epic, imaginative story that has been beautifully brought to the screen by Denis Villeneuve.But adapting such an inspiring piece of fiction has its issues when there's been half a century of media since the publication of the original book, and Dune's story may not have aged as well as, for example, the Lord of the Rings. Stories about chosen ones and prophetic dreams are now clichéd and frowned upon. Game of Thrones set a high bar for political warfare in fantasy worlds and in the 2020s it is hard to root for the aristocratic white family struggling to take sci-fi oil from the sci-fi middle east. It feels especially tone deaf to have a crowd of desert-people cheering at the sight of Timothée Chalamet coming to take over their planet while an arabic-inspired soundtrack blasts from the speakers. I get that that's probably what happens in the book, but the way the film pushes the arabic inspirations of the planet's culture feels like an odd choice.The fact that this very long film is only the first half of the story doesn't help. The ending is pretty anticlimactic, even though the loud, epic soundtrack would like to convince you otherwise. Perhaps this story would've best been told as a TV series, where you'd only have to wait another week to see how the story continues. But Dune: Part Two hasn't even been greenlight as of right now, so we'll likely have to wait at least a few years to see how this story ends.That being said, the photography, visual effects and cast were all fantastic in this film.

2040,shantial,Sound quality mess,5,24 October 2021,The music quality was a mess. The SFX and music was overly loud while the actual character voices were low. It weren't level at all. That aside the so called few action scenes were so dull and uneventful. The actual story it self was told in the most boring drawn out way to where i dosed off twice during the 2 hrs and 30 mins adaptation. All to lead up to an ending that was predictable and ofcourse incomplete because of the set up for part 2. Do not recommend this movie unless you a die hard fan. Nothing was done well in this film.,Dune

This movie has no space to breathe. This would have been an incredible mini-series that could have had a great slow burn and politically intriguing feel that might have challenged the quality of early Game of Thrones, but they tried to do so much in a relatively short period meaning that the whole movie felt a little rushed.

Zimmer comes in strong with one of his most inspired and bold soundtracks ever that goes along with the incredible sound design. The cast is amazing and Chalamet as Paul is just perfect and he delivers a great performance. Villeneveue's directing is super tight and has such an incredible style. My only real complaint is that some of the emotional beats could have hit a bit harder.If you have the opportunity to see this movie in IMAX it is a must. This is the kind of films those theatres are made for and you will not be disappointed.This is the start of something fantastic.9.5/10.",Dune

It was bold in a lot of ways, but over all a good adaption of the story.However, I do feel that movie left out so many important details and a lot of information, which made the plot feel rushed. What makes the book and the following book sequels amazing is the attention to detail, and the depth in which everything is described, be it culture, history or characters. This leaves you with a very watered-down story, as truly important parts of the book, taking several chapters, is boiled down to a few minutes of screen time.It's clear that the studio wanted to attract a more general audience than just those who've read the book, which I ultimately feel takes so much away from the story.",Dune

2058,arandonnelly-02,The Much-Needed Bridge Between Auteur and Blockbuster Cinema,10,26 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune: Part One"" is a towering cinematic masterpiece and completely worthy adaptation of the first half of Frank Herbert's legendary 1965 sci-fi novel. It serves as the much needed bridge between artistically driven auteur cinema and big-budget blockbusters which is heavily dividing filmgoers everywhere today. The film relies far less on action, and plays out more like a political thriller in a sci-fi setting.The film follows two powerful families in a feudal interstellar society; House Atreides and House Harkonnen. House Atreides and their efforts to liberate the Fremen people and bring peace to the desert planet of Arrakis, serve as a more compassionate and heroic counterpart to the brutally sadistic and imperialist House Harkonnen, who have built a brutal colonialist empire off the slavery, genocide and exploitation of the Fremen people and their lands. The film is told from the perspective of the main protagonist Paul Atreides (played excellently by up-and-coming star Timothée Chalamet), who finds him and his family thrust into a full-scale intergalactic war between the Fremen and the Harkonnens.The film is an absolutely visually stunning spectacle, with gorgeous cinematography and luscious special effects transporting the viewer into a breathtaking and otherworldly experience. Viewing the film on a TV or streaming service simply does not do it justice. It is a film that must be seen on the big screen. Watching it in the cinema was simply a transcendent and otherworldly experience that I can only imagine people must have similarly felt back in 1968 with the release of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It is easily one of the most visually stunning and breathtaking films in recent years, if not of all time. All of this is aided by fantastic performances from its three leads, Timothèe Chalamet as Paul Atreides, Oscar Isaac as his noble father Duke Leto Atreides, and Rebecca Ferguson as his protective mother Lady Jessica. The three leads help to bring the immensely sympathetic characters from Frank Herbert's original novel to life on celluloid, making their struggle against the vicious Harkonnen family all the more powerful to watch.""Dune"" is also a highly ambitious commentary on political power, and the systemic abuse and exploitation of indigenous people and their land. The Harkonnen's imperialism and cruelty towards the Fremen people and their land could very easily parallel real-world historical colonialism such as Christopher Columbus' genocide against Native Americans which America was built on, or the British Empire's imperial genocide and exploitation of countless countries, namely Africa, India and Ireland. Frank Herbert himself, partially based his original 1965 novel on imperial exploitation of the Middle East for its oil and resources, something that has only grown in chilling relevance with the US invasions of Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan throughout the 21st century. ""Dune"" also shows the ruthless intricacies of political power, and the eternal dirty game/cutthroat world of politics, with constant deceit, betrayal and lust for power overcoming the Atreides' goals for positive intergalactic change in liberating the Fremen people and bringing peace to Arrakis, mirroring establishment politics' constant efforts to sabotage those who pursue positive change in real-world politics.Overall, ""Dune"" is a masterful science-fiction spectacle and one of the best commercial films released in years, with its thought-provoking insights on political power and indigenous exploitation, it's excellent performances from its three leads, and it's absolutely stunning and gorgeous visuals creating a modern big screen experience unlike any other. Go see this movie on the biggest screen possible. Can't wait for Part Two!",Dune
2059,sergexx,I want my 2.5 hours back! Please.,6,22 October 2021,"The cinematography was very good. Dave Bautista Was the best actor - that says everything right there.

2064,allismile,I Wanted To Love This!,5,24 October 2021,"I've never read the Dune books, but had a neighbor in my early 20's that was a fanatic about them, and gave me a new appreciation of the David Lynch version. This was before people were making fan versions online; all the same he explained how the version released in 1984 was not the intended version David Lynch had in mind. I've wondered what he would have thought of the 3 hour version on YouTube.Anyway, I watched the new version as soon as I could, but as I watched it I slowly lost interest in it. The otherworldly feeling I got from the 1984 Dune had been streamlined into something rather dull. It was a beautiful film to watch, and knowing the story based on my friend's recount and watching the Lynch version I was able to fill the holes- but something quite important was missing.One aspect that I haven't seen mentioned in criticism of this version is the inner dialog that worked so well in the Lynch version, that was such a vital part of the books, is no where to be found. It was ingenious at the time, and added so much to the film.When it comes down to it, I can ultimately only review this as a fan of film and the 1984 Dune film. To put that in perspective I also did not like the Lord Of The Ring movies outside of the spectacle because a great deal of the time I didn't understand the context. I think that is the problem with this new Dune film, especially without the inner monologue, so much of the context is missing that connects the uninitiated to the otherworldliness of Dune.",Dune
2065,ashlydutton,Could showed this film in 10 minutes not 2.5 hrs,3,24 October 2021,"To sum up, there's probably 10 minutes worth watching in this film.

2066,ada_singh,Great,8,26 September 2021,"That was great! First, I doubted should I watch this movie or not. I had watched most of the Denis Villeneuve's films before that and some of them had been rather good, but the others had been completely awful. Also I was a big fan of David Lynch's ""Dune"" and thought that no one would be able to do better, than Lynch. So I didn't have any expectations on this new ""Dune"", but then it exceeded all my expectations. This ""Dune"" is much better than all the previous versions, very precise in detail and visually stunning. ""Dune"" differs a lot from some other sci-fi movies, because it has a good balance between action scenes and dramatic moments. Speaking about actors, I am very impressed by Oscar Isaac, Stellan Scarsgard and Javier Bardem acting. I am not a fan of Timothée Chalamet, but he was also surprisingly good and organic in the role of Paul. Zendaya was not bad, but I think that the role of Chani is not for her. Maybe the only thing that I didn't like, that the movie was too long and some moments wasn't very important and could be easily cut out. Also it feels like Denis Villeneuve wanted to make a film exactly according to the book and there's one problem that he didn't have enough courage to create something new and original. But nevertheless I am quite satisfied with ""Dune"" (2021) and it is definitely a must-watch movie.",Dune
2067,AndresK23,Bored me to sleep,5,25 October 2021,"I stopped watching around hour and a half into the movie. The movie is very slow, yet that doesn't contribute to building any tension, creating connection with the characters or for better understanding of the story. It's just unnecessary drama, crying and dramatic dialogues every 10 minutes that lead to nothing. After watching more then half of the movie, I couldn't care less for any of the characters or if the bad guys win. I came to read the reviews here and saw that most good ratings are because of the nice scenery and visual effects. Its 2021 though, this shouldn't be excuse for lame movies to get good ratings. I also saw that this is just a first part of the story, at which point i gave up and went to sleep without finishing the movie.",Dune

2070,megboeff,"Eye-wateringly, almost painfully, beautiful",10,23 October 2021,"You owe it to yourself to see this one on as big a screen as you can. The cinematography is stunning. The soundtrack sets up the scenes in a phenomenal way. The vehicles and ships alone will please even the hardest sci-fi and world-building fans. But it's the way Denis Villeneuve allows the camera to rest that really sets this movie apart. This is clearly the passion project of a man who has just elevated himself to a master.Fans of his prior film, Arrival, will find that Villeneuve uses a similar style of cinematography here which uses epic landscape shots to translate scale and weight interspersed with facial close ups to translate emotion visually with great affect. The movie is the very definition of the word ""epic"", and although some small details of the novel have been sacrificed to the expedience necessary for film, the trade-offs are minor and do not miss the important story beats that the novel laid out.Denis Villeneuve aimed high in attempting an adaptation of Dune in an era when moviegoers seem both unforgiving about the film making and adaptation process as well as unwilling to go to theaters. But he did not miss his mark.",Dune

The dune series is just too big to fit in one movie and it's perfect for it aswell.Some stories work better than others in films and they can be easier aswell, Dune is fairly easy to translate and can sometimes even express scenes in the movie than the book. One of those things are the scale of the creatures and the movement in the sand which is a subtle hint that something is moving in the sand without telling the viewer.Some other short stuff that could be mentioned is that acting was for the most part good, but sometimes it gets a bit too forced in some scenes.",Dune

He refuses to comply with the standard Hollywood narratives. His movies are original and unique. Like his masterpiece Sicario. He takes you on a ride, where you never know what's coming.

You are voices in the wilderness clearly evidenced by the ratings and pro reviews. Revel in unending swill of superhero nonsense and just stop going to independent films and rare cinematic masterpiece. You will never be pleased by auteurs, so stop shouting in the wind about that, which you know not. As a devotee of Dune, operatic sci-fi and high fantasy, I was certainly ready to be disappointed, particularly after Bladerunner 2049, but I was wholly immersed by Villeneuve's triumph.

The visual effects, cinematography, music, production design, costume design, art direction all comes together to make of the best looking and sounding films of all time, in my opinion. The acting all around is spectacular(Timothée Chalamet's best performance in my opinion). Jason Momoa is very likable and has a great relationship with Paul. Josh Brolin is great as the stern, militant right-hand man. Oscar Issac is very resigned, but he communicates so much with just his eyes and line delivery. Rebecca Ferguson is, once again, incredible as always. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself with his musical score for this film, it is otherworldly. So many incredible set-pieces and scenes that you just have to see it. The only flaw I could find with this film is that it's incomplete, it's half a movie.

2088,jantheone,It felt... familiar!,7,29 September 2021,"First of all: this movie was good! Don't misunderstand me here. Denis Villeneuve created another visually stunning movie with a great cast and a beautiful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.But I had a ""problem"" with this movie. It felt all so familiar. During the entire movie I had this feeling, that everything I saw was nothing entire new. Sure, the book this movie is based on is literally decades old, but even though Villeneuves adaption didn't feel original.The general vibe was constantly a mix of Star Wars, Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones and Avengers. I'm not saying that this movie copied them in any way, but it wasn't something original either.For me personally there was no moment, that completely catched or flashed me as other Sci-Fi movies (e.g. Arrival, Blade Runner, Star Wars etc.) did. The kind of story was told a thousand times - bad against good, the bad want something the good people have, the main character loses everything and ends up in a group of oppressed kind of underground group. Also, the visuals were very stunning and beautiful for sure, but that's just the standard by now (and what you'd expect from Denis Villeneuve). Dune just lacked of moments that kept you at the edge of your seats and made you think, that there was something created that you've never seen before. Thereby this movie was, simply said, ""just another Sci-Fi movie"".Maybe, all this was also slightly caused by all the hype around the movie. In my opinion, this movie was overhyped waaaaay too much. Through this it couldn't catch up to the hype and kind of exceeded the expectations I had when going into the cinema.In spite of all I am very curious, how this universe will be build up in the future. There's still a huge potential I'm sure Villeneuve will use. Let's see how the second part is going to be! Maybe, it will build up a more and more unique identity, who knows...",Dune

2094,rithinna,"Not just a film, but an experience 💫",9,31 October 2021,"When Dune was announced, and I heard Dennis Villeneuve was directing it, I was excited and on cloud nine. I even travelled a long way to watch the movie as it wasn't screened in theatres that were near me. I was hyped and thrilled to such an extent that wanted to see the movie that bad. The novel (which I haven't read, but am about to) is supposed to be super-rich and immersive (the work of Frank Herbert), the characteristics that the movie too inherits. The first thing that will amaze you is the sheer scale and grandeur that the movie presents right from the first shot. Everything from the costumes to the location and the props are really well thought out and kudos to the Set Production team for giving us this kind of an experience. If I could say that the production is a strong pillar of the movie, then the Background Score and Cinematography add to the encounter. Hans Zimmer delivers his best score after Interstellar, hands down. Greig Fraser proves once and again thay he is one of the ELITE cameramen out there and he definitely deserves more praise and fame. Coming to the leader of the pack, Dennis Villeneuve, once again proves us that he has nailed down the perfect method to treat the audience to a Science Fiction adventure. The cast, played by Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Issac, Rebecca Fergusson and many others. Oscar Issac and Chalamet were the standout performers for me as they spoke to the audience with just their emotions and were in complete sync with their characters. Rebecca Fergusson also did really well and Dennis has once again nailed it with the casting, as well. The story is and screenplay is definitely slow and sluggish and is a let down to audiences that came in looking for a complete movie. But, the movies spends a considerable amount of time in World Building and this makes the movie feel as though we the audience, are travelling with the characters as well as they explore and react. The story is left in a cliffhanger kind of situation with the main twists and turns about to come out in the second installment of the movie. To complete, the movie just nails the technical parts and is a little disappointing in the storyline. It sure makes up for the let down by its magnificence and splendidness. My point at last is *DUNE IS NOT JUST A FILM, IT'S AN EXPERIENCE*",Dune

This movie is definetely one of the best opening movie to an upcoming franchise. It's difficult to say in words what this movie is and what it made me feel. People will talk about this movie for a long time thanks to its cinematography, VFX, cast and the team behind everything.Should you watch it? Definitely
Should you see it in theaters? Absolutely! Watch it in IMAX and you will probably have the best experience of your entire life.This movie is for everyone: I enjoyed it even though I read the book before and I'm pretty sure those of you who didn't read the book will love it. I'm really looking forward to seeing the sequel, Dune: Part Two since the first part only covers 2/3 of the movie and trust me, the sequel will be amazing.Everyone should watch this movie on the biggest IMAX screen possible.",Dune
2100,lizlarousse,Those helicopter wings...,9,27 October 2021,"I'm gonna say this staright : Watching this movie in 3D was a great choice I've made. This is by far the best 3D experience I've ever had. Dune is stunning. Never will I see better visuals in a movie. Just the helicopter wings are by themselves unforgettable. So yes, this is a masterpiece.But, the only reason I'm not giving a perfect grade is that Dune doesn't have a climax. It lacks tension. The movie is very slow, as any of Villeneuve's, but not boring. It's certainly more driving than Blade Runner 2049. However, any movie needs a climax and that's what the final duel should have been. It's the ending, it's a duel and it's when Paul truly choses his destiny. Everything should and must have led to this moment. But it's not what happened. The scene didn't last for long and wasn't a highpoint in any way. That's probably why many won't enjoy it that much. You could have the best cinematography possible, but a story needs to make you feel something. That's it's most important quality.Still, it's an amazing film. Just not made for everyone. And I have the impression part 2 will be more intense and epic. Dune is a very though novel to adapt and things seem to lead to something grandiose and again, more climaxing.",Dune

2104,pinkyster-34468,Makes 8000 years to the future feel like 500 years ago,4,22 October 2021,"This movie is actually about interstellar feudalism,
It just cares about looking good (which it does) and nothing more, making you feel like something epic is going on with all the grandiose music and swords and visuals, but actually its just the middle ages with futuristic tech.This movie includes lots of lines like ""i will be honored if you die with my knife"" and ""there is no honor in dying like that"" and honor this honor that, that's supposed to feel chivalrous but only made me feel as if all of the characters are mister candie from ""Django unchained"". Lots of ""The one"" ""The voice"" ""The way"" which is supposed to feel epic but only feels lazy, redundant and cliché.Another thing that bothered me with this movie is the fact that the only three women in it, were basically useless to the plot, the mothers only characteristics were endangering her son and crying when men yelled at her. The scientifist woman only helped them run away and die to kill three bad guys. And the greatest build up, Zendaya, was just to hand a knife to the protagonist, and for no real reason at that, only for ""honor"".To conclude, this is basically a patriarchal, medieval fiction with nice visuals and future tech. No real interesting plot, just the redundant ""The chosen one"" vibes from this movie. Must say that they even made the sword fighting boring.I really hope the book is better than this movie.EDIT: Sorry, there were 4 female characters in Dune, I forgot to talk about the witch that tested paul with the box and the needle. In my opinion she was also a very minor character, she only played a creepy witch and when she told the villain not to kill Paul and his mother, he basically ignored her.",Dune

2109,H_Lunch,Enjoyable if not exactly necessary,7,23 October 2021,"This third attempt at bringing Dune onto the screen proves perhaps the most accurate rendering of what might be translatable from literature to film. But what makes Dune one of the greatest sci-fi books written is perhaps the same thing that makes turning it into a great movie such a seemingly unachievable task. Being a long time fan of Frank Herbert's work made this fun to watch while at the same time making evident the same editorial pitfalls that every other attempt has fallen into, basically, what to exclude while still telling a coherent story. It is enough to prompt the question though, why not make it a series? Why leave out so much even in just the first half of the first book when such an obviously better long-form format exists? Anyway, there are certainly many worse things to watch right now so I wouldn't exactly call it a waste of time but don't expect it to bring any sort of new insights to Herbert's masterpiece.

The soundtrack is great as well.But contrast this version looks very drab and dull, way too dark filming style, and forced MCU style quips at a few points. The dialogue is also on the nose at a few points, should have kept more subtlety.Overall the cast of the 1984 Lynch is better as well , this newest is just ""current actors that are popular even if they don't fit the role"", this new Jessica, for example, really pales compared to one in Lynch.One positive I can say for this new movie is that they are getting more time to tell the whole story, I suppose.",Dune

This most recent adaptation of Dune is quite inspiring. Not because it leaves you feeling euphoric like the latest Marvel movie, but because it tries something new.I feel like it has been ages since a big budget film has thrown away the three part, formulaic screenplay and just told a good story. It appears that this different approach was likely forced as the sequel wasn't greenlit at the time of premiere, so the movie had to be both a part one, and, potentially, a stand-alone movie.The end results is a great story paired with amazing cinematography, acting, and likely the best composition we will see this year, all demonstrated at a pace rarely seen in theaters. It is neither too slow nor too fast. You don't feel like they are rushing to tell the story, but rather letting the story tell itself.Highly recommended.",Dune

The plot jumps from one character to another, without really explaining anything. The actions of the main characters are incomprehensible, their motivations are incomprehensible.

The acting from every one is phenomenal ,but Rebecca Ferguson takes the trophy for best performance. The makeup, cinematography, and sound design really stick out in this film and helps elevate it to prestigious heights.

The thing is, I don't know why I got none of the ""feels"" in key scenes of the movie like I had with the books, and the thing that confuses me here is that if I had not read the books and my only point of reference was this movie, I feel like I would have no reason to care for any of these characters at all.I think this might be due to a combination of miss-casting (Jessica seemed weak and Yueh seemed off and barely got any screen time) and runtime (the daunting challenge of building up both the world and the characters in only 2.5 hours runtime).Overall, I keep thinking it's missing something one might call a ""soul"", and that it was a valiant, yet failed, effort at bringing the Dune universe to the screen.Maybe if some day they decide to make a tv-show off it it might work out.",Dune

I'm so glad to have seen it on the big screen.The story is not complicated but the universe is rich and well developped. It has a Game of Thrones feeling when it comes to political mysteries and tricks.The main down point is the apparant lack of reactions of the protagonist . He was too stoic, nearly surhuman. It reminds me of the protagonist of Tenet, just following a course of events without really questionning it.I would say that this film is entertaining but nothing more, It lacks maybe a more dynamic pace and a more pro-active protagonist.",Dune

2134,matthewgolbourn,DUNE - THE BEGINING OF SOME THING SO MUCH BIGGER,9,23 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve, has managed to deliver the first part of what is going to be an epic series of events. Dune needs to be viewed with the full intention of knowing this film is not just a stand alone movie, but a building block to lay the foundations, for what could be either biggest or one of the biggest movie experiences to date.Dune is not going to be an easy watch for a lot of people, in fact it is understandable to see some of the harsh reviews left here, the movie has a staggering run time of nearly 3 hours. With in this time please do not expect hours of actions, although the action we do get is mind boggling, Dune is PT 1, of what I suspect will be a 3 part series, so most of the movie is laying ground work for what is to come, and this is good thing. Dune is like nothing we have scene before, the sheer scope of the story in the first part is a lot to take in, but this is all made a lot easier to take in with the amazing performances of a stellar cast.Character development is at its finest in Dune and the story development, that we see unfold is at such a scale it will leave craving for more and more of Dunes story. The settings, the aesthetics and the special effects of Dune are to such an eye watering degree, you will be left breathless at neigh on every scene, it was actually to a point where I was in complete disbelief of what I was actually looking at. Even with todays technology, this film managed to surpass any CGI, you have seen so far. The over all design of Dune is something that will now inspire movies to come for generations.Over all, considering this just part one of Dune, we have a movie on our hands that has set a tone and lined up an epic story that is not to be missed. The scale of Dune is something that will be under estimated, even with its upcoming parts. I do strongly advice this is viewed at the cinema, and I also advice you go into this movie, knowing its intentions of just laying the foundations for something so much bigger then what you witness at this viewing. Dune is a cinematic great and a experience for every one.",Dune
2135,ciro-42644,Battlefield earth II - train wreck on many levels,2,18 October 2021,"Let's start with positive.Excellent production design - cool space ships
Great cinematography - beautifully shot
Actors - super castThe badUnintended comedy - straight-faced delivery of corny lines creates a Monty Python Life Of Brian vibe in many scenes. Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary would have a field day. The scene were fat uncle baldy head honcho senior emerges from the oil bath to utter his lines could be straight from a SNL skit.Plot confusing - good luck figuring out what is going on unless you have read the novel with all the long weird goofy names and complex setup. Most people will lose interest pretty quick.Superficial characters - there is little character development so the viewer never gets to know the main characters and hence the movie is quite fluffy overall.Slow paced - get ready for slow-mo shots of people walking in the desert that add nothing to move the story forward. Some people will fall asleep watching this movie.Extreme lighting - most scenes are either pitch black of blindingly overlit so you see nothing until you need to get your shades out when the light is cranked up to 100%.Overbearing score - Hans Zimmer lays it on thick and heavy with a music that overpowers most scenes. This ain't a German 90s rave in the woods, pal, as Beetlejuice would say.David Lynch's 1984 version is superior to this train wreck. For some reason many critics love this movie but do not be fooled. Unless you are prepared to spend 2 hrs+ for slow-paced unintended comedy, you will regret it.To do the novel justice why not make 10 episode series and explain everything properly to the viewer and do the complex novel justice.

I think someone who didn't know the Dune universe would.be confused.I wish they could have gone further into the politics and CHOAM, the navigators, the spice etc, especially the rivalry (to put it lightly) between the Atreides and the Harkonnen.I'd really love to see more background on the mentats and Bene Gesserits, but that just gives the ""it was slow and boring"" people more to complain about.I actually appreciated the gender swap for Liet Kynes, but it didn't seem as important as some people think - often the same people on here complaining about ""misandry"" because the Bene Gesserits were dismissive of the men and looked down on them. Dude, that is one of their big things. Like, that isn't misandry, it's a plot line.I wish Jessica would have been a little more stoic, or even dangerous. Her training makes her a serious threat, and like, I understand being freaked out, but there was a bit much emotion for my taste. Her reaction to Paul and the pain test was extremely undisciplined.A lot of people were unsure about Paul, but I thought he did a great job of playing a confused 15 year old flipping between scared and cocky. He's mourning his father and the life he imagined, and he feels betrayed by those he trusted.

I can only say that Dune must experience DUNE IMAX2D GT, with special painting, which I will never forget.Visual effects director Paul lambert and his team and art direction, patrice d mei special audiences create worm, aerospace guild craft modelling and so on the huge building design geometry appearance, including Jacqueline west of each character's clothing design, the film shows the real sand dunes in the imagination, The opening scene, with Greg Fraser's cinematography of sand and spices, is so mesmerized by the film's portrayal of Hucknan that I'm not going to say more about it than it sounds.First of all, Dune is a very large world outlook system, which is not only literary, but also scientific, so that it is difficult to understand the lines that flash by. Currently, we only plan to trilogy and shoot the second book. The reason I give five stars is that it will be a classic in the future, and we are witnessing history in the long run.Dennis to disrupt the order of the original part of the plot of the audience saw part of the future from the Paul's prediction dream fight shoulder to shoulder with Freman, burning a lot of Mr Card army soldiers, and even the final fate of Paul, but the role is to break the prophecy, don't want to be a monster to cultivate, when he saw the prophecy made different choice, Rather than be identified as Lisa Al Gaib or Kwisatz Haderach, I simply used a long line from the film to illustrate the complex growth that the character will undergo next.""The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve... but a reality to experience.""
""A process that cannot be understood by stopping it.""
""We must move with the flow of the process.We must join it. We must flow with it.Let go.""There are a few characters in the movie that we're sorry we won't see again, like Piter De Vries, Dr. Liet Kynes, and a few who will be back in the next one, like Officer Koni Halek, Thufir, Laban the Beast, And baron Harknan, who is about to be avenged. Dr. Kynes revises the plot a lot in the film, and as for identity, much is revealed through Paul's abilities.Chow is also important to the plot, not just because of his wife, with cory paddy sand the emperor's family to urban tweedy family in charge of so good, in Carla Dan planet power gradually expand worry about using associated lenzi radmanovic federation to overthrow him, in Mr Card in the film star and huck south family conversation also have mentioned Mr Card legion, is destined to be destroyed, Duncan Idahou's mentoring relationship with Paul will prove useful later on.As for the original creatures that many people find disgusting, they actually fit the Terraeans. As Terraeans, the Harknan family are monsters to the rest of the world, constantly cloning and reproducing through newt box technology, including genetic modification.A shocked me most is the film to ray when the duke dies, from the official media streaming (I only used to dig the details), only about 97 minutes long, letto duke and many don't have time to describe the plot, if some more, the film may to this end, the film adaptation have to make trade-offs, later also can supplement when adapted third line, By the way, the overall picture looks like marla's death, and the film is still very artistic.Mrs Jessica as the heroine, as benitez jie in the sisterhood of relationship in the film also has introduced, after described in sand dunes and sisters will show detailed, Jessica for giving birth to Paul, and he made many sacrifices, teach him multiple.",Dune

Firstly the visuals were mostly flat, there was no explanation why in this time there were virtually no characters, one scene only with about thirty extras, it is too dark and grey. More importantly you had a very thin plot that could have been told in less than an hour. Nothing happens for most of the film. It is as if all concerned were on valium. The music was just farts. Talk about an anti-climatic ending, the film just whimpers out. None of the very little plot made any sense. So here we have yet again critics raving about nothing.

2153,sjhunt-50458,A great dive into half a story,8,6 November 2021,"I am a viewer who; like many, has never read any of the books or watched Lynch's movie from the 80s, and was very unfamiliar with the Dune universe until hearing about the film when it was first announced. I was not overly won over by the first trailer when it was released, and felt quite isolated from most other frequent movie watchers like myself when I heard how excited people were getting about the movie. It wasn't until I saw the official final trailer for the movie where my attention was raised; and by raised I mean HIGHLY raised.I will say before I dive deep into my thoughts that if you haven't read the books or seen the Lynch movie, you may struggle with following this film. A solution I would recommend is to find a YouTube video or page on the internet that gives context to the world of Dune and a deeper understanding which really helped with my experience of watching the film, as I'm certain I would've struggled without the context.Anyways, the main standout of the film for me is every technical aspect that went into it, expect to see at least some nominations in the oscars, though I'm convinced that Dune will win a majority of the categories. The effects and sound design are some of the best I've ever seen. I was truly blown away: you MUST see this movie on the big screen. The cast is also one of the best I've ever seen; with talents like Timothy Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista and MORE present. They all perform incredibly but standouts include Oscar Isaac as Leto Atreides and Timothy Chalamet as Paul Atreides. Josh Brolin also gives one of the best performances I've seen him do. The action, is brilliant. However, if you're expecting the next Star Wars or Lord of the Rings in terms of huge scale and frequent battles, don't get your hopes up. The action is infrequent, but used appropriately and necessarily. When the action does happen, it is magnificent. The battle which takes place in the 2nd act of the film was without a doubt my favourite scene of the movie, and I believe that a lot of the shots of that battle shown in the trailers contributed in persuading me to watch it for myself. And in some sequences, tension is built up very nicely too. The sequence leading up to the iconic sandworm scene (shown in the trailers) was really well done, the lack of music and the stakes being high made it one of the best scenes in the film. And of course, it would be a crime not to mention Hans Zimmer's score, which was simply mesmerising. I'd say it's one of my favourite scores from him, although I think that his Man of Steel score is superior and honestly, it will be very hard to beat.But, as my 8/10 rating suggests, it's not perfect in my eyes at least. And my main problem isn't necessarily to do with the film itself, but more with the story created by Frank Herbert. I'm not a fan of projects that are made to be deliberately over-complicated, which is why I've never been a huge fan of Inception, and Tenet too for that matter. And I'm not sure if the movie puts in much effort to summarise what I had to find out through the internet, which may be a problem for some people, so I'd once again recommend finding some context online. But I think that's my main complaint with the film, and I can't think of much else to include.Overall, Dune is a technical masterpiece which will do incredibly at the oscars for certain, with some gorgeous effects and a memorable score. I'd recommend watching for anyone who is a fan of sci-fi content and to those who enjoy the books and the Lynch movie. But I would've enjoyed it more if it was simplified down a bit for the audience and those who are new to the universe. This is, as publicly announced, the first half of the first book. It is an incomplete story, but in all honestly I prefer that over cramming one big story into a 2 hr 30 minute movie, and it also provides another movie for me to look forward to seeing in the coming years.",Dune

2156,james-gaggardi,Franchise bait,2,16 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what Chinese studio wanted him to, to write and direct a remake yet again that makes money and has potential for cash-ins. I'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it. It sucks and will attract lowbrow franchise remake lovers everywhere.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so I decided to read the book. And to this day, it Is one of the best stories I HAve ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale and filled with details making it really hard to adapt for the big screen even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after I read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and I did nOt enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel and feels shallow and unfocused. Yet, it is better than this remake. Well, there you go. It is a remake.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel because the studio told him we need SEQUELS, PREQUELS, TV SPIN OFF and a 2025 REMAKE (Hollywood cycle of commercialism accelerating). And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to put us to sleep for at least 3 rounds of good REM slumber. But on the flip side, this also means that we need earplugs because the flatulence (a.k.a. Music) is loud and obnoxious.From reading the book, I know what comes next, I know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something boring, which means this is a boring prologue to a boring film. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the Chinese production company (Legendary), so the studio has a special sponsorship deal with this site for shills, fake reviews, ratings and the like because this can only work if part 2 is released to make more dough. It's kind of how they did it with every other movie that Hollywood ships inferior sequels and remakes of.But, still, without a conclusion or story or action or acting or meaning, what a massive blast of revenue this could be for Legendary. I've seen it in IMAX three times already and I am caught up on my sleep on a grand scale. I have had epic dreams in every session because I have great earplugs. And all of this without losing anything because the film is stupid and boring. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend stupidity with commercialism.The actors are near perfectly cast, they are useless and in for commercial hackery like a fat wrestler and so on..This movie does follow the book quite slowly (remember the six sequels), but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, iAny content, morality, philosophy or politics have been removed to make it as bland as possible.But that being said, I have really high hopes for this film as I have bought studio shares through my broker i was one of those people who bought stock hoping for capital gains. I've been waiting to buy a new car and hopefully the stock will go up so go watch this darn boring thing and get some sleep!What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, He has satisfied commercial festivals, this site's marketing quota and given people good rest.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion or meaning or acting, but hey that is Hollywood. Why start now? It's two and a half hours of build-up to something hopefully profitable, but it's still a huge marketing effort to get the hype going
It's most definitively made for the big Quarterly Revenue announcement, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's an accounting force to be reckoned with, a brilliant bean counter, and one of the best GPs of his generation, even one of the best of all time in helping people visit Mr Sandman.I give this movie a 2 out of 10. We shareholders need part 2, we need it badly so people go watch already. This revenue capitalization deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of my shiny new car with this movie as the template.",Dune

2162,zgriffith-33852,A True Dune Movie,10,1 November 2021,"I'll start off with the elephant in the room. The 1984 Dune movie is quirky and enjoyable, but it simply isn't up to the quality of the book, which remains one of my all time favorite sci-fi novels, up with the Foundation series in my opinion. However, it was limited by the short (for a book of this size) runtime, limited special effects opportunities, and frankly some poor detail choices.This movie has none of those problems. Not only do they take the time to tell the first half of the book with depth and respect for the novel, but it feels almost as if the movie producers were inside of my head as I read the book, capturing my own imagination and putting it on screen. The ships, the planets, the Worms, all spectacularly portrayed. The acting was superb, with Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides, Oscar Isaac as Duke Atreides, Charlotte Rampling as Gaius Helen Mohiam, Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho, Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides, I don't believe there were better casting choices to be made. Zendaya also plays a perfect Chani in the few scenes she appears in throughout the movie.The score is beautiful without being overpowering or underdone. It compliments the rising moments and tragedies with a perfect amount of punch that makes each one that much more powerful.The fight scenes are phenomenally choreographed, feeling like fights which real people, augmented with only the limited advanced technology that personal shields, and in some cases Milange, can provide. There are no jedi flips and impossible twirling laser blades here. The only thing which even approaches magic is the voice, which is more about intensely powerful hypnosis than magic. This is, of course, all found in the book, and I encourage anyone who loves this movie to read the book, which will not only give you a look into the sequel (and I fully expect there to be a sequel), but also just to have the chance to read one of the great American Sci-fi novels.Dune is an American classic in literature, and I believe this movie will earn a similar place in film.",Dune

2170,dyosergey,Do not Drag your children to the theater!,7,29 October 2021,"The movie Dune (2021) is telling a story of a young prince or son of Duke, Paul Attreides who in the middle of the conflict and war with other noble families tries to survive and find the way to win it.The main source of pleasure in this movie is a hypnotic and persuading visual representation of the desert and the gut feel of mystery behind it and behind its resources that had become the reason to this war begin (and some scenes of Sci-fi space content in the begining for giving the science fiction content also work well in 3D too).You can see the scale and importance of the conflict and the sides of participants who are located in different planets, which makes this movie potentially a good adaptation of an RTS kind of game such as Warcraft or Starcraft where we do not know who we want to fight with but we know the importance of the struggle between sides. Harkonnens, Attreides, Emperor and the Freemen are in the game.But despite the massive presentation, the movie setting and graphical backgounds are very poor in details of architecture and the color (yellow, black and white). All seems dead and empty. Which is compensated (maybe on purpose) with a strange sound design that (for the meditating effect) can work for people who came to relax in the seats or sleep, but not for people who came to see Lord of the Rings kind of epic scenery.Characters also seem out of place and non-memorable compared to the book, which was caused by the trials to make plot as undersndable and flawless as possible for a new audience non-familiar with the source material. The problem is that even if we understand the plot, we do not see its power or purpose in contrast to the source material as the drama or chemistry between people on the screen is weak. They are individuals who react enotionally on the plot, but not on each other appearance (the most emotional moment was in trailer). Which could be ok for a video game adaptation or a war movie with insignificant soldiers who will die soon, which this movie was not supposed to be.Compared to this, despite trials to change the story and turn it into a space fairy tale 1984 version managed to give us a decent chemistry between characters and their short memorable scenes that could point out their importance for the future events.The emotional power of the war sequence is also downrated because of PG-13 rating - no blood, no violence or even suspenseful tensions for making this movie at least mature.Overall,1) The Dune of 2021 is still an experience worth watching in the theatres especially in IMAX, depending on how the visual representaion can be persuasive enough for you to transit a story and means of the books.2) But do not expect a traditional Great movie with charismatic Jack Sparrow or Tony Stark kind of heroes doing comedy or stunning choreography. In this sense as it tries to be a grand epic war movie (even in more percentage than The Game of Thrones can be) the film is very boring.3) WARNING!!! Do not bring children below 13 years in the theater, if they are not familiar or not into Sci-fi and Dune Universe. They will be bored to the edge of their seats and will make noises and interrupt the audience which totally ruined my own experience of watching it in the theater.",Dune

It's kind of how they did it with every other movie that Hollywood ships inferior sequels and remakes of.But, still, without a conclusion or story or action or acting or meaning, what a massive blast of revenue this could be for Legendary. I've seen it in IMAX three times already and I am caught up on my sleep on a grand scale. I have had epic dreams in every session because I have great earplugs. And all of this without losing anything because the film is stupid and boring. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend stupidity with commercialism.The actors are near perfectly cast, they are useless and in for commercial hackery like a fat wrestler and so on..This movie does follow the book quite slowly (remember the six sequels), but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, any content, morality, philosophy or politics have been removed to make it as bland as possible.But that being said, I have really high hopes for this film as I have bought studio shares through my broker i was one of those people who bought stock hoping for capital gains. I've been waiting to buy a new car and hopefully the stock will go up so go watch this darn boring thing and get some sleep!What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, He has satisfied commercial festivals, this site's marketing quota and given people good rest.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion or meaning or acting, but hey that is Hollywood. Why start now? It's two and a half hours of build-up to something hopefully profitable, but it's still a huge marketing effort to get the hype going
It's most definitively made for the big Quarterly Revenue announcement, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's an accounting force to be reckoned with, a brilliant bean counter, and one of the best GPs of his generation, even one of the best of all time in helping people visit Mr Sandman.I give this movie a 2 out of 10. We shareholders need part 2, we need it badly so people go watch already. This revenue capitalization deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of my shiny new car with this movie as the template.",Dune

Too much time spent looking at landings, take off and various machines instead of time spent with the characters. For me, this film is more about visualization of the book than emotions. I doubt any actor will win an Oscar for their performance. Some panoramas are spectacular but often scenes lack depth of field. The music and sounds are overwhelming and often you can't understand the dialogue. The play is rather cold and you cannot really feel emotional about any situation. The war is a quick thing rather unexceptional. Although the film is a hefty 2.5 hours, there's no time it seems to really bond with the characters. The guild and the interstellar travel is downplayed and we never see the emperor, an important character in the story. I do not know if the iMax theatre i went had old lamps but i felt the image was quite dim most of the time. Not impressed and will see the part two on my 65 inch flat tv.",Dune

2181,ldd-7,Dune still hasn't been filmed.,1,24 October 2021,"This was a supremely disappointing movie. The images were nice but nice images do not make a feature film.Let me give you some background.The movie adaptation of Blade Runner is nothing like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. However, I think the movie is better than the book. This is not a Villeneuve movie, but I'm holding that as an example that movie adaptations for me do not necessarily need to be exact adaptations of the source.Denis Villeneuve did a good job with Arrival. Yes, I read the short story from which it was adapted. I may not have agreed with everything but the movie was good.Denis Villeneuve then produce Blade Runner 2049. I saw it and asked ""why?"" In my world that movie was not necessary. It wasn't awful. I just did not see a point.Here Denis Villeneuve does the same thing with Dune, except that in the process he gives us a story very loosely based on the work of Frank Herbert. I don't think Herbert work is without flaws, but Villeneuve manages to transform a complex work of art into a summary of a summary of a summary of that work. It is in light of the source material that I judge the movie.I was already disappointed by the movie but couldn't quite put my finger on what bothered me. I had read Dune when I was a teenager but that was a looooong time ago. So I decided to pick up a copy again, and boy my appreciation of the film took a serious tumble.You have someone at some point state how important spice is. And that it! Do the mentats have blue eyes due to their use of the spice? No. Do you see the Space Guild make use of the spice for travel? No. The spice is important, in theory. In practice you don't see it.The move of the Emperor and the Harkonnens against the Atreides in the book is absolutely obvious to the reader. You even have a chapter on Geidi Prime where Baron Harkonnen explains to Piter and Feyd Rautha what is about to go down. (Feyd Rautha, BTW is not in the movie! Why???) Paul complains to one of his advisors and the reply is that everyone has warned Duke Leto of the danger. At the point I am at in the story, we can only assume that the Duke is just too proud to say ""no"" and think he can still outmaneuver the Harkonnens. (By the way, and this is explained in the book, saying ""no"" means going rogue, and for a House that means leaving the Landsraad.) There's a poignancy to the fact that the Duke is walking into the trap willingly, that is mostly missing from the movie.The books also explains most of the world in which Dune operates and the concepts that are involved much much better than the movie. What's a Kwisatz Haderach?? The movie never says anything about that. On page 31 of my edition of the book, they explain what that person can do. Why did the Bene Gesserit not intervene to prevent the eradication of the Atreides house? The film does not tell. The book does.The film is essentially as succession of beautiful scenes, joined by the flimsiest of plot. Dune still hasn't been filmed.",Dune

2184,hurleybird-2,Bland and forgettable.,6,18 October 2021,"The new Dune movie has no real memorable visual identity. Sets are sparse, starships are generic souless CGI blobs, comstumes pale behind every other adaptation (including the Westwood games), and anything that might have once been visually arrested is color-graded into a cold, desaturated oblivion.The portrayal of Arrakis is a total failure. We're told many times that the desert is punishingly hot, but no scenes communicate this. A lack of sweating, panting, and the weird color grading combine to paint a picture of a cool Arrakis.The acting is hit-and-miss. Chalamet does a good job with what he has to work with. Skarsgard , Brolin, and Bautista are also standouts. Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Leto as father isn't bad, but he does nothing to convey that the emperor fears this man. He looks the part, but doesn't convey appropriate gravitas. Momoa straddles the line between good and bad. Most everyone else is a shade of wooden.However, this isn't a terrible film. Just a painfully average one. In aggregate, the writing and acting is nothing to write home about, but it's serviceable. Unlike the 1984 adaptation, which nailed its visual style but nothing else, this one doesn't fall on its face.",Dune
2185,joe-2792,Watching this made me appreciate parts of Dune (1984) more.,6,28 October 2021,"I am a huge Dune nerd. Read the books alot. Saw Dune 1984 in the theater and multiple times since then. Saw the mini-series.I didn't really like it. I am giving it a 6 for the overall feel of the movie but as an adaptation of the book (which is my primary criteria), it was more of a 4.Don't get me wrong. It is very hard to adapt internal asides to a movie. That being said, they mostly didn't even try. So much of the story is lost when you entirely ignore all of the subplots and the internal commentary. I don't know how anyone who hadn't read the books even knew what the heck was going on. I have 1 friend who pays very good attention to movies and thinks she knew what was going on (she doesn't) and another who says that there were a lot of characters who died who didn't seem to matter and they could have saved 40 minutes never mentioning them.On a plus note, watching this movie has made me better appreciate Dune 1984 which I have been mocking for over 35 years. If Dune 1984 had changed the following, it would be the superior adaptation of the book:
Get rid of goofy sonic weapons.Recast Patrick Stewart / Gurney Halleck (I love PS but the guy from the mini-series was soo much better).Make Baron Harkonen a serious character and not a parody.Cut the last 3 minutes of the movie, put it in a box, nuke the box, collect the ashes and then nuke them again then fly those ashes into the sun and travel to another solar system.",Dune

How many times have I watch that version has to be in the twenties. I don't think I would watch this one again because there were little action and I already know the book and the much better one in the 80's.The only thing is much better is the special effects, that's about it because we're 40 yrs in the future. And Timothee Chalemet is not believable and Rebecca Ferguson is a weak Bene Gesserit. The 1984 has it beat in every other category.Maybe part 2 will blow us away but this first half was a snoozer and I rate it a 6 for effort and special effects only.I really wanted to give it a lower ratings but I know it cost a lot to make, lol.",Dune

As I said, the special effects were beautiful and grand and you can tell they took their time working on this. The cinematography is also very elegant. The only thing I have disparaging to say is there wasn't much backstory told to put things together and there definitely wasn't much of a detailed plot. Yes, it did have a story to it, but I'd like to know more about the five Ws, (who, what, when, where and why). Also, I would've like to known more about his mom's backstory and even his father's because it would've given me more insight to why the son was having visions and why he can use a weird voice to bend other people's will. !

It's funny how someone who is not a sci-fi aficionado feels the need to comment on a movie based on one of the greatest sci-fi sagas ever written, a saga which he/she never laid eyes on. It's like me giving stars to a baseball game...Now, back to the adaptation. I had no expectation to be like the book is based on, that's the biggest mistake to do when watching an adaptation. Movies/series can never encompass everything a book shows us in our mind's eye. And, yet, I was blown away when I watched scene after scene which actually transported me to passages I read in the book years ago. Half way into the movie I found myself afraid that Villeneuve would do what most directors do, speed up the pace to get to the pew-pew part. I was extremely happy when I saw I was wrong.One thing actually disappointed me, the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica... I can understand the need for PC correctness, inclusion, bla bla bla...as long as it does not damage the already established character. In the books, Jessica is a renowned beauty across the Imperium and a fierce woman. Rebecca is neither of those and that hurts the character she's playing.",Dune
2189,stansmith122,Set and vehicles : Good. Story things that were left out : >:(,7,25 October 2021,"The second half of this review is me ranting about how Denis left out my favourite parts. You have been warned.I like what Denis Villeneuve did with laying out the scene of Dune, like the castle and ornithopters, and just the set and props altogether I felt was really accurate and just brought Dune to life. He left out some bits of the story, but it wasn't anything major. I did have a problem with Liet-Kynes, specifically her being called Liet-Kynes from the beginning.Btw spoilers start here.Not just for the movie, but hopefully for part two when it comes.To the Atreides, Liet was the focus of an upstart religion in the Fremen, and didn't have much consequence on them. Kynes, however, was the lead planetologist and very involved with the Fremen and Arrakis becoming a better world. If Leto knew that Kynes was Liet he would've convinced him that he would like that too, and then when Paul and Jessica went to Liet they would've gotten out of there faster which would've saved both Liet and Duncan Idaho. But he didn't know, he didn't work with Liet, and only Gurney survived out of the people that served Leto. Also I don't think that there is any of the ""Leto acts like he thinks that Jessica is the one in the inner circle that betrayed him to everyone except Paul but he really loves her"" in the movie, which bothers me a lot because I really liked the part of the book where Paul reveals to Jessica that Leto loved her to the end because it really hammers home to her how much Jessica loved, loves her Duke and what him dying means to her. It also cements her resolve to take revenge upon the Harkonnens.",Dune

I had zero idea about the plot, never even saw a trailer (intentionally).The pacing is great, somehow you get emotionally invested in the characters almost immediately. Is it the atmosphere combined with incredible art (costume, props, scenery), I don't know. There isn't a single word spoken that is redundant. There's no explanations beyond what you need to understand the plot, yet you have a ton of questions about how the world/universe functions. Some scenes leave you wondering, but you know it will probably be explained in the sequels. You feel rewarded when you find links between some scenes/sentences on your own, there's no hand holding by the director.And the sounds, they're a world of their own, I never would've guessed Hans Zimmer has anything to do with this, it's all attuned to the space/futuristic/tribal themes, effects are visceral and almost never heard before (they remind me maybe of Arrival/Man of Steel, you know the sound those machines make when they come to ruin the Earth by mining).Some things are so scary/disgusting/sad and you never see them coming, some horrors you see coming but they either don't happen or they don't happen the way you expected them to. It's a thrilling ride in your mind, not before your eyes.Combat scenes aren't dragged out, you 'get' that this person or that one is very good at it without having them make triple flips in the air; when they ride aircraft they don't go on a wild chase that makes you forget the plot.

We don't even get to bond with the ONE to root for him.Second of all which was more distracting to me was the set up. I am so surprised so many reviews were praising the movie for setting up a good scene. The story was supposedly set in about 10000 years later, but if you miss that on screen information in the beginning, there is no way you would think it is that far in the future. Outfits, guns, transportation all look a lot similar to today's technology and it really lack of imagination. All planets are looking like earth, all extraterrestrials looking like humans. No imagination here to impress.

2203,navien833,"Hollywood names over talent, artsy fartsy over story",6,23 October 2021,"As a whole this movie wasn't that bad of an adaptation. I personally think the Sci-Fi mini-series is the best adaptation and much better than this one as well. This movie is filled with costume design and cgi scenes depicting long segments of ships landing and taking off. Seems the casting director was focused more on big Hollywood names rather than the actual talent needed to play these roles. Even though it was over the first half of the book there is still a ton missing. Multiple important pieces from the book are missing or have been slightly changed for the worse. Seemed like the director chose to have more artsy scenes than having scenes from from actual book that would have given more story. The graphics were amazing and the scenery was fantastic. Now I'll go over pros and cons:Pros:
-Great scenery and cgi were pretty good
-Stellan did a great job as Harkonnen
-the fremen technology was nicely depicted
-the score was greatCons:
-Ton of missed story. Perhaps if the spaceships landing and taken off were cut dramatically there would have been more time for actual story
-Multiple actors/actresses not suitable for the roles: Oscar Issac is a poor actor. Leto commands presence not being laughed at. Jason Momoa was not Duncan Idaho, did he even research the character? Zendaya is overrated and did a poor acting job on what little screen time she got. Who keeps giving Dave Bautista work? Fire them immediately. Timothee was ok, but I don't see him as Paul. Hopefully will do much better when he becomes Muad'Dib.Overall worth a watch I guess. If you really want Dune, read the book. If you can't handle the book listen to the audiobook. If the book just isn't your thing go watch the mini-series from Sci-Fi. Much better than this movie.",Dune

But I can't really express the faults of this movie(and, by association, many modern movies) without comparing this to the 1984 David Lynch movie that has been nothing but trashed for over three decades.As flawed Lynch's Dune is, it offers so much more, despite being less faithful to the source material. His movie takes considerably more chances on every level. Visually it's more dynamic with varied and creative designs. Look at random screenshots of Villeneuve's movie, and you'll notice there are only a few color tones. You'll barely be able to tell them apart. Dull. And injecting scenes with fog, haze or sand for a thick atmosphere may be his style, but that's the most superficial attempt at art. He doesn't offer much more than that. He's a one trick pony in that regard. Other scenes of people talking, or fighting are actually rather conventional.Lynch's characters, while certainly more over the top, are more memorable and impactful. They range from crazy to taciturn. There are spectacular scenes in the original that people remembered for years, but here they blend into each other more. It's amazing how many scenes are actually from the '84 version here, but are so tame, and conservative artistically, the difference is night and day. The sheer amount of creativity, dynamism and risk taking in the '84 version is almost entirely missing in this movie. Really, this one almost seems rated G. Lynch's production had an edge. It was weird, creepy, bizarre, fantastic. This is .....pleasant to look at, I guess.To be fair, this is only part one. But I don't expect much to change in part 2. Why would it? The problem with Dune 2021 is that everyone was so desperate to run in the opposite direction of Lynch, they ran too far and ended up somewhere between ok and mundane.",Dune

The vision and grand scale of Dune was beautifull. But honestly I thought it was a bit boring. If you are looking for adventure, suspense, exitement, humor, action, do not go to this movie.The movie, from a certain viewpoint, does awesome for 'it's type of movie', but it will not keep you on the edge of your seet, it's not like Avatar or such.",Dune
2210,SpawnDDR,"Not bad, but it's not a movie",8,16 September 2021,"Not bad, really, but it is only half of everything, that we know about Dune after original movie from 1984... Many dialogs, not bad graphics, but after final shot you think, that will be series, but not movie. If he (director) will try to create movies about all Herbert's books, we can see Dune 10... After 30 years.",Dune
2211,newemka,Great movie! but should be shorter...,7,19 September 2021,"I never understood what was wrong with Lynch's version, now with Villneuve's I get it, the story goes beyond what is happening on Dune. I can't wait to see the what will happen next.The movie is too long and ends in the middle of a chapter, it should have ended with the escape of Paul and his mother. Then we would wonder if they will manage to survive.I still compare it to Lynch's, the costumes and characters looks are too slick.It will be a great movie once the second opus will be released. To watch with a video projector at home so you can take some breaks.",Dune
2212,Rick1717,"This 2021 Dune is visuall stunning, the good guys are true heros, the bad guys are ugly and brutal",10,23 October 2021,"Nearly perfect movie. 100%Denis did a wonderful job capturing the essence of Dune. His deviations from the book are his improvements on Herbert's work. Yes, he out-Herbert-ed, Frank Herbert.My only criticism is that the Zimmer sound track sounds too much like the sound track from The Lion King.The movie felt like it only lasted 10 minutes.Never seen Dune? Watch it to see how much George Lucas ""borrowed"" from Frank Herbert: Desert Planet, Galactic Empire, sward/knife fights, etc.",Dune
2213,alecic92,Film leaks - the low IQ reviews will flow like the spice.,10,17 October 2021,"I feel sorry for these people, you refuse to pay, you have the attention span of a toddler and you willingingly watch a film you never had any interest in. It's gonna be a race between supposed book fans and illegal downloaders to see who wins the war on cringe. Big oof. Cope and seeth. Part 1, 10/10.",Dune
2214,mongosgram,Excellent ... other than Paul,8,22 October 2021,"The story line was amazing and the acting, outside of Paul's, was amazing as well. Paul seems to have a range of disinterested to bored. I would really like to give this a 9 of 10 for the rest of the cast, the wardrobe, the sets and the feeling that they tried to stay as close to Frank Herbert's story as possible. My only fear isn't that part 2 will recast the same Paul, it's that his acting prowess may be a damper to shooting a part 2. I can forgive his limits because everything else excelled.",Dune
2215,deniseemmens,Amazing,9,22 October 2021,"Tip: Watch this film in a cinema, you will be blown away by the landscapes, music and effects. I am not a very big fan of 3D, but this was perfect.I love love Timothee and the rest of the cast is great as well. 9/10 can't wait for part two.",Dune
2216,bats915-455-219560,Looks like a lot of money on sand,7,28 October 2021,"Yeah it's good. There is not a bad performance in this movie. Timmy was grim, Oscar Issacs looked amazing. Jason Mamoa was Jason Mamoa. If you saw the original you pretty much seen this.",Dune
2217,essam-abulfatth,Wasting of time,3,17 October 2021,"After credits rolled i realized that I've wasted 2.5 hours from my life.I didn't like story, the parties heros and villans especially emperor, as an Arabian I didn't like using religious signs, I didn't like chanting in Arabic for the invaders which reminds me of years of colonolization. I didn't get the purpose of this movie .. the three stars are for thopter IMHO.",Dune
2218,lpucci,All I hoped for and more,10,15 October 2021,I have been a Dune fanatic for 40 years. Was fortunate enough to see a premiere today in SF with a Q&A afterward with Denis.I like the Lynch version but am very aware that there are some major problems. The mini-series was passable but I was always wanting for something better. And this was it. The Harkonnens and Sardaukar were brutal unlike the other two versions. The Fremen were perfect. The cinematography was incredible. The sound engineer will win the Academy Award. Hans Zimmer should win as well.I always thought IMAX was where it was at but Dolby was absolutely incredible. I felt like I was on Arrakis. The sound just thundered underneath my seat.Anyways back to the movie. The acting was fantastic across the board. I was worried about Oscar Isaac but shouldn't have been. Everyone else was perfect.I just want to thank Denis Villanueve from the bottom of my heart for the experience I just had. I've read the book at least 3 times and felt like I just lived it.Bring on Part 2.,Dune
2219,vhoang-le,Low budget and boring movie,1,21 October 2021,"I fell asleep during the second half of the movie.It was so boring and low budget.I'm really disappointed because I'm a big d
Fan of the book series as well as the games.I watched the first movie when I was a kid, it was just as bad as this one.",Dune
2220,mladenius,"Great visuals, subpar acting with no characterization",6,30 October 2021,"I read most of Herbert novels long time ago up to Heretics Of Dune and this film portray of books is pretty decent
Sardaukars and Space Guild look even better than in books, visual are great but charaters are pretty bleak, almost no characterization
I wasn't bored with a movie, It's interesting enough to watch
Not that bad but not that good either so I give it a 6.",Dune
2221,kurtashostap2,Half story without a sequel being even planned,10,21 October 2021,"The movie itself is good but the lack of any meaningful conclusion is why I give it a low score. As a standalone movie it is half backed. Where is the rest of the movie? Are we supposed to be begging for a sequel to have a decent conclusion? I guess not!I really liked the directing, scenery, solid acting, special effects and the choreography/combat was excellent. But you need to have a decent conclusion to the movie otherwise it's less than a showoff, especially if you don't even have a sequel in the working!Edit: Dune part 2 is confirmed, score changed from 2 to 10. What an amazing movie!",Dune
2222,ReviewsByAnya,Breathtaking masterpiece.,10,23 October 2021,"I have been to Arrakis and back!Throughout my journey I was spellbound and ecstatic and couldn't wait to share it with you.Where do I begin?First things first:
This is my favourite novel of all times so it will be a long and tender review.I promise no spoilers.I cannot promise to be monotone about it.Before you watch it:Please treat some reviews with a pinch of salt. Some of these people have not read the books and compare Dune to Star Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan!If you haven't read the books, take it as it is with an open mind. Don't compare it to anything, especially Star Wars.As a matter of fact Frank Herbert wrote Dune in 1965. Way before George Lucas made the first episode in 1977.Few of you may know that Dune was the inspiration for Lucas and Herbert actually accused him of stealing his ideas!If you read the books, it will be easy for you as it will all come back no matter how long ago you read it and how much of it you have forgotten.The plot:This is where for your pleasure I will be succinct.At 412 pages and just the tip of the iceberg which is the whole saga of 6 books this is a huge material to condense.And so the movie is wisely divided depicting Dune ( 1 book) in 2 movies.It may not have given too much screening time to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, but it has divided the time equally between:
drawing up the arcs of the characters (rivalling families of the Atrides and Harconnens, the notion of the Emperor, Spice, the elusive Fremen and not so elusive sandworms)showing the planets with their varied weather. (Dune is a book with ecology at heart)gripping action that made the movie feel as if was mere 30 minutes despite just under 2.5 hours of running time.The Script:
Is loyal to the pearls of wisdom in the book. I will definitely re-watch it and make a list of my favourite quotes.The vision:Having been written in mid 60s, when people didn't have mobiles and computers, the technological ideas of the Dune worlds are a visionary accomplishment and now that you will have seen Dune 2021 you will understand the difficulties of the makers of Dune 1984.I hope David Lynch will be able to enjoy it and not worry about his own creation.This time, it is portrayed as I have imagined and gives Herbert full justice.The cast:
Having seen the acting, the make up and the special characterisations I think they hit the jackpot with every single actor.The photography:
Was amazing. Every scene was a masterpiece. Coupled with a perfect soundtrack, costumes and props, it was a true spectacle.The camera work, the slow motion especially in the scene with the Fremen towards the end of the movie was showing how every detail was thought through.The story:
Is an actor of it's own right. The use of the Voice, different languages and sign language were additional treats.The novel is considered to be the best selling sci fi novel of all times.I hope that Dune 2021 will become the top best selling sci fi movie of all times.Enjoy the journey and if you haven't read Dune, please do. Not everything is in the movie.For me it is 15/10.(I went sparingly with it. )May the spice be with you!",Dune
2223,kathybertrand1304,Underwhelmed,6,23 October 2021,"I was ready for my new obsession but nope, not even interested in watching the second part. It's just long shots of people's faces, sand, and cgi and i was not wowed at all. It was boring, it was like the actors were told to act with minimal expression and tone. I didn't see the original so i was excited to discover a new story but what story??? If you haven't read the books you are going to be lost like i was.",Dune
2224,dmitrii-moscatelli,Good but not enough,7,3 October 2021,"1984 Dune is way superior to this one cause the 2021 Dune is shallow and amateurish.I really dont know who did the cut, but 2021 Dune is Epic but very amateursh. Some things are really throw to the audience that it is really hard to follow the script. The battle of Arrakis is very badly done, the epic scenes of the Harkonnen and the Atreides leaving or landing on to Dune are epic but also shallow. There is not connection with the main cast. Duke Leto seeems dumb, Gurney seemms lost, Paul is the oly one looking right. I really dont know whay this movie got so may praises. It is epic yes but 1984 Dune is far, far better experience given all the flaws. Kudos to the director, that brought this difficult to make saga to the modern audience, but the ""class"" and the ""crude"" beauty of 1984 Dune is hard to emultate, yet to make ""new"".",Dune
2225,michele-casamassa,all good just a shame we have to wait for part 2,8,26 October 2021,It misses alot of info that you need to understand things and instead drags out scenes with music and dramatic facial expressions or scenic shots. Unlike the original. Although the original was outdated and weird and technically a bad film feel like it explained more things better than this one and used its time better. But overall solid 8/10 must see on imax.,Dune
2226,Kokyelagroudy,Dune Review (30/9/2021),10,1 October 2021,"First, I've got to say that Dune was a very great, and magnificent experience in IMAX. This is the first time to feel hyped for a book based movie since Harry Potter and honestly, WB made a big campaign for the movie that I like and respect. Lets talk about positives and negatives.Positives:
The visuals are greatThe acting was superb (Especially Chalamet and Ferguson)The score suited the movie in a good wayThe film itself isn't boring although it's longThe story is greatVillenuve handled the visions sequences in a good wayAction scenes were enormous.Villeneuve takes his time to build the world and characters (an advantage to those who never read the book and disadvantage to those who read).Although they had little screen time, Momoa, Brolin, Bautista, Duncan-Brewester nailed their roles (I honestly can't imagine any one playing these roles but them).The Fremen are presented as powerful, religious , yet dangerous.I like how Villeneuve showed how hot, sandy, and dangerous Arrakis is.Worms are perfectNegatives:
Although I've written that the story was good but it missed many aspects that could've made it quite better and that's a many based on a novel movies problem.A lot of story is left out from the movie but you won't get lost in the movieBut honestly these negative points doesn't affect the movie that muchOverall, comparing to the OG Dune, Villenuve's Dune is quite spectacular and it deserves a 9.5/10. I recommend everyone to see it in IMAX because believe me, it's liks nothing you've seen before.",Dune
2227,gregerp,Woke Hollywood garbage,2,23 October 2021,This is just woke Hollywood garbage. Dune turned into a mindless action movie and the soul of the whole Dune concept is lost. Poor character depiction and a lot of the story building is lost. My immediate respose was a sense of loss and betrayal. I had expected so much more. Put this one in the garbage bin and watch the original movie from 1984 or the mini series from 2000 instead.,Dune
2228,ocifferdewdroyle,One for the ages,10,22 October 2021,"If you don't like it, you need to live more life before you watch it again. If you like it, keep living brother. I'll admit I was taken by surprise when I saw the bagpipes, but the dope drumline took the melody to another level. Heed my advice from the beginning of the review, you won't regret it.",Dune
2229,danythebest89,Two hours and half of REAL CINEMA.,8,21 September 2021,"I was lucky because I went at the screening in original language (O. V) in a Dolby Atmos room teathre. Two hours and half of CINEMA in every way, Villeneuve is one of the best contemporary authors and directors and the Hans Zimmer's original scores are totally immersive. Every character has the own part in the plot, I have particularly appreciate the deep tie between Paul Atredis and his mother Lady Jessica (Timothèe Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson are perfect and they ricreated the right sintony in their roles) while Chani,portrayed by Zendaya, isn't bad, but she looks a ""teenager"" , including her behaviour, I hope in a growing up of this character in the next chapter. I have found in the screenplay a message with a kind of autocriticsm and similitudes against the current international political situation, in relation with the real conflict between ""West culture"" (especially with the American one) and the Middle East.The scenography is truly amazing and it is a proof that the traditional way to make films, still can conexist in this period where the digital effects dominate the management of the productions. This approach, in some ways, it reminds me what happened 20 years ago with : ""The Lord of the Rings trilogy"", especially with : ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I have the same enthusiasm about the costumes, props making and makeup.In my humble opinion : ""Dune - Part One"" could be considered a hybrid between an independent and an entertainment film, certainly is not a film for all. The runtime long need to understand very well the story and the characters, because this it is just a ""hors d'oeuvre"" (an appetizer). At the end of the film there was a deserved standing ovation.Now? Crossed the fingers for the sequel.",Dune
2230,pantelis-tsiolas,Unfortunately no FF button at the cinema,3,4 November 2021,Slowww...not much really happening for most part of the film. Wish there was a fast forward button. Visually good but nothing that impressive but the pace of the movie made it unbearable.,Dune
2231,pstaehlin,Epic Masterpiece on many levels...,10,29 October 2021,"This movie Dune was done very well. I love the scale of the environment in this movie is just massive. The ships are huge. The cities and palaces are huge. The ""sand worms"" are huge. The sense of mystery keeps you engaged. The cinematography is fantastic. The soundtrack and literally out of this world. There is a bizarreness to this film that is so intriguing. Loved it!",Dune
2232,markchanmusic,Loved it till I didn't love it,7,6 November 2021,"I grew up enamoured with Frank Herbert's 6 Dune novels, re-reading them a couple of times in my younger days, oh so long ago...
and, unlike some, I loved the 1984 David Lynch film a great deal, enjoying its disorder, ugliness, inexplicable Shakespearean tone, its fashion and pop magic and faux pas... major love...
I have also grown to like, no, *Love* Denis Villeneuve's still, zen-esque adagio, that cool majestic grey grandeur in his film making. His Blade Runner 2049 brought me to tears it was paced so beautifully I fell in love with the android (and human) predicament all over again.His Dune does not disappoint until it does...
It is a most unexpected thing: an Art blockbuster both dazzling, majestic and slightly dull at the end of it all...
It is totally engrossing from the start, the beauty of its vision, trademark Villeneuve (magnificent and subtle all at the same time) grips you more and more inexorably as the stage is set for House Atreides to take the reins of planet Arrakis and Spice production. Then the rapidly accelerating chordwork, the cadenced build-up to grand open betrayal of Atreides, their destruction and downfall at the Emperor's hands...
Young Paul Atreides and his mother, the concubine Jessica flee in desperation into the desert and search desperately for the Fremen, the desert people...
Unexpectedly, the remaining part of the film drags after all the high drama like a heavy backpack on a long day ...
In the Frank Herbert novels there is mythology and mystery intertwined with science fiction and then ecology pulsing at deeper levels right from the get go.. the Bene Gesserit, the Space Guild Navigators (more spice worm than human), the overarching importance of how Spice bends space and time and therefore supremely vital to the whole universe's functioning, not just its economy. Marvellous metaphor for oil and our own world .. relevant then and now!All this would have 'spiced' up the film on so many different levels. Grand, wonderful and worth watching again. But they were unfortunately trimmed away, leaned out in this Villeneuve vision.It definitely left me feeling that it was a great movie that was missing something.What exactly was missing? Heart? Mystery? Passion? Grit? More intellect? I'm not sure...
I loved it, until I didn't.Don't worry though, if you're younger, not a Dune aficionado, you won't feel the lack.What we've got is impressive and dazzling, technically brilliant artistic film making.Two and a half hours later we're only half way through the main story and then it ends.We were warned, it's Part 1...

2233,aprelle,Part 1 is a dynamite start,10,26 October 2021,"The books are a intricate dive into politics, power, coming of age and religion. To capture them for screen is difficult. The film does a wonderful job in its portrayal. The earlier movie and mini series each had gheir strengths and weaknesses. This film takes its own novel approach and confidently portrays the worlds and story as best as the writer, director and producer can. It is an interesting and gripping portrayal of a book that should be read.",Dune

It makes a desert interesting.The performance of Paul is great. No jaw clenching Anikin here, but a rapid adaptation as Paul is overcome by events.I simply wish we could build depth in the characters and nuance in the politics. I will happily sit through more movies crafted to this standard.",Dune

That so many people, far from this direction of cinematography and literature, have come and continue to come to watch Dune.It's the same as people would throw down crowds on Angelic conversations. Villeneuve somehow deceived everyone and made them watch pure poetry for two and a half hours.I really liked the movie. It completely coincided with my feelings from this universe, in which I practically lived in my thirteen years. The books from the dune cycle were my bible, many quotes I still remember by heart.

No words can describe it . It gives the movie very beautiful feeling when you watching it. After the movie ended I asked myself who is the artist that made the music and wooooo it was Hanz Zimmer.I thought it is one and half hour movie, but after I watched it an discovered it is two and half hours l was shocked .The time has passed without i noticed.I don't want the movie to end.All the actors were professional they gave us the best of what they can.Without any doubt this is an Oscar winner movie.",Dune
2241,andreirostov71,A NEW ERA OF THE SCIENCE FICTION GENRE,10,20 September 2021,"Forget about everything that has been seen and written in science fiction cinema, Denis Villeneuve's film is a sun of fresh air, a new concept if not to say that it is a new vision of the genre, the new version of Dune is great , spectacular, huge and epic, the great mistake of Warner Bros is not to have put more money for a second part, but it also made me short to see the complexity of its visual innovation, many say it is long, boring and pretentious, to the latter deaf ears, if you want quality science fiction Dune is your movie, the music of Hans Zimmer is inspiring and the final shots of the film are epic, the future of science fiction cinema is in the sands of the deserts of the planet Arrakis, in a nutshell Dune is the future of cinema, more than Star Wars or Game of Thrones as it has been wanted to compare Dune is beyond imagination, and hence my impatience to see the rest of Frank Herbert's work, I recommend it.",Dune

It would be more fitting to do a 9x 1h television series imho, but well.I think it's the kind of movie that gets too much credit on imdb.It's a book adaptation with a big following and it's done visually nice.

2247,pmc77,Why is everything gray?,5,24 October 2021,"I am not a fan of the David Lynch version and I've not seen the TV series. I am a big fan of the books.I've always felt that the best treatment to turn the books into a film would be to tell the story as a heroic epic and hope that the script could also convey the mythic/symbolic/hidden context contained in the books. That the key elements, would be revealed bit by bit, small hints here and there, as they are in the books coming together as a whole at the end. The Lynch version failed miserably and just fell back on over the top visuals. This version is trying harder to tell the story but the characters are not fully developed and it's difficult to tell who is who or where the characters are - other than the dessert-if you are not familiar with the books because everything looks the same. It's all gray, stark, and monolithic.Too much is revealed early on to make sure we all get it- probably because the producers weren't sure they would be able to make a part 2. Also the stopping point is logical but very unsatisfying.Also, I want to know what the Fremen stillsuits are made of? They appear to be rubber or some plastic material. This is a planet with no vegetation and minimal animal life. Where did they get rubber or the means to make plastic?Wanna be filmamkers-If it's your dream to make a better version of Dune, you still have a chance.",Dune

Often, the story will be changed to reflect current social or political goals. I was happy to find that none of that was present here. The film was able to walk the fine line and bridge the differences between the movies and the books while adding new perspectives.My only disappointment is it will be a long time before part 2 comes out. I watched this on HBO, but I'm strongly considering watching it again at the theater. Many of the scenes may be enhanced on the big screen.Please, more films like this.

But Lynch didn't have the kind of filmmaking tools Denis does now, who gets to use the whole kit in a mostly faithful 2/3 of book adaption labelled PART ONE. I'm pretty upset about that because I haven't heard anything about PART TWO, now perhaps 3 years away, if ever. Anyway, I finally got the correct pronunciation of the name Harkonnen, properly awesome ornithopters, & more scenes than Lynch with my top fave Dune character, Duncan Idaho, the legendary swordsman & confidente who deserves a standalone origin movie (yes there is a book).

The slow intense pace of this movie lets the story unfold, while keeping most viewers in the know on the important parts.

I believe the 1984 version was given a harsh time by critics, and although of its time, I still believe it to be a classic Sci-fi of its day. Denis Villeneuve's adaptation, I found to be rich, along with the enormous visuals, great CGI and dramatic film score. The cast was for me perfect, with standout performances by Rebecca Ferguson and Timothée Chalamet (a true up and coming star to my mind (see The King)). Villeneuve clearly stated that the book cannot be justified by one single film, so one hopes that Legendary Films payroll the sequel (or second part) quickly. A sweeping, labyrinth of political intrigue and feudal posturing, means that I would gladly watch this film again and again. Roll on part 2.",Dune

(B) There's already way too much Star Wars/Tatooine vibe going on here to cast Leto with the guy who played Poe. Just saying.8.) I'm in a new house and I SERIOUSLY need to get a Spice Rack!9.)

Never ever have these images been so wonderfully captured and visualized by this movie. All the actors, the graphics, storyline and music portrayed Dune as the world I was absorbed in. The slow pace is exactly what is needed - plots within plots within plots. The heavy action is outstanding. And everything explained crystal clear without impeding the mysterious atmosphere. This DUNE movie is the one and only true ode to this story. A must see for everyone who wants to be drawn into this epic story.",Dune

Villeneuve truly is the master of pacing, as proved by his previous films, and Dune is no exception. As expected, all the actors deliver stellar performances, especially Chalamet and Ferguson.

Saw the two trailers and thought this could be great.I watched it last week in the cinema - it is just great. I loved the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, the actors that were cast for their roles are superb, Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho kicks ass, the whole implentation is well done. I didn't even recognize Javier Bardem! Maybe it was the blue eyes, I don't know haha.I wasn't in the cinema since Tenet from C. Nolan, but I'd definitely say that this movie is worth it. It was made for the big screen.

2273,elnexusben,From a reader of all the books... THIS IS FLAWLESS,10,24 October 2021,"Having waited a year beyond the years of previous waiting for this... the most anticipated movie in my life probably since Lord of The Rings, let me say, expectations were high.My excitement was tempered knowing that all other attempts to put this, the greatest sci-fi novel of all time, into film, had failed, either critically, or to get off the ground at all.I was a bundle of nerves going into the cinema, and that mood... did not cease throughout the entire film. I cannot recall a time where I was emotionally so involved in a movie. I, of course, knew every plot move, and have replayed each in my mind for years, having read this and all the other books of the DUNE series. But yet, to see these moves executed with aesthetic and dramatic perfection by Villeneuve and his crew made me feel like I was there, again, being dragged through the unending torture that is the rite of passage of Paul Atreides.The performances, the direction, the cinematography, special effects, casting... I could not find a single flaw in this perfect diamond of a film.The brooding menace that came from so many angles, the Harkonnens, the Emperor, the Bene Gesserit, traitors in the midst of the Atreides, the savage Fremen, and the planet itself... and its unique ""fauna""... I can't think of a film that captured this threat more than this.And the depiction of a future mankind, thrust 8000 years into the future, was as chilling and ""realistic"" as any I've witnessed. It captured Herbert's tone beautifully, and were Frank alive today, then I know he would be satisfied.I have only just recovered enough to write this review. I was left literally speechless at the end, as my friends looked at me, wanting me to say something. I could only muster one word.""Flawless""",Dune
2274,jman_jesusfreak,"Finally, a Faithful Adaptation of the Book",10,23 October 2021,"Ignore all of the negative reviews being left by fans of the 1984 film. This is Dune as it was written by Frank Herbert.This film was exactly what I was hoping for when it was first announced. Being a big fan of the book, I kept hoping that someone would actually adapt the book as it was written. The 1984 film is many things, but it is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Dune: Part One is an adaptation of which I think the author would have been proud. The first time an ornithopter is fired up and flown was worth the price of admission alone for me.This is not a Star Wars film. It is not a campy movie. There is no rock music, outlandishly loud 1980's style costumes, speedo wearing Sting, unnecessary things added that were not in the book, or overbearing amount of exposition. It is not another big, loud, dumb Hollywood blockbuster filled with funny quips, nonstop action, plot-holes and huge explosions (though there is action and huge explosions at points).It is a very serious, dark, epic, well written, well acted, well scored, and visually gorgeous film. As a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings, I do not say lightly that it is the science fiction equivalent of the Lord of the Rings, and one must understand that they are watching a movie like the Lord of the Rings going into it. It is paced the same way as the book, so like the Lord of the Rings there are many scenes of talking, plotting/planning and traveling. Like the Lord of the Rings it expects you to understand terms that are being used based on context and the limited amount of exposition given, and both are sufficient to the task if you pay attention and don't mentally check out during the film. It is purposefully an incomplete story because it is an adaptation of the first half of the book (the book is quite long) with Part Two waiting to be greenlit if Part One is a hit.If you want a simple, dumb, fast-paced action-fest in which you can turn off your brain for two and a half hours (not that there's anything wrong with that), this film is not for you. If you want/are expecting an adaptation/remake of the 1984 version, this film is not for you.If you want to see a Lord of the Rings kind of epic sci-fi film, this is the film for you. If you are a fan of the books, this film is for you. If you want to experience the kind of epic landmark film event that only comes along every 20 or 30 years, this is the film for you.",Dune

2276,kringelan312,Slow yet spectacular futuristic Game of Thrones,9,15 September 2021,"Dune has every component a movie needs to have in order to become a blockbuster. Taking elements from grand franchises in series and cinema, the ingeniously bringing together of a memorable soundtrack and slow-paced storyline creates something unique. A slight downside might however be the confusion of different clans and families. Nevertheless, I think such a thing will sort out eventually. Dune resembles tv-series such as The Mandalorian or Game of Thrones and that is not bad at all, since this saga will be split into several parts as well. Denis Villeneuve has brought forth yet another intriguing masterpiece in his collection of movies and he should eventually, if not already, be considered among the greatest directors in Hollywood.",Dune

Haven't read the novel. Didn't understand the whole point of the movie. After 2.5 hrs i felt like i just watched the first half. The conclusion and climax were so underwhelming.

2282,stevensino,An Empty Masterpiece,8,29 September 2021,"Denis has filmed the unfilmable, he achieved a monumental task yet at the same time it feels like an empty achievement. Bear in mind that I'm writing from the perspective of one who has read the books quite a few times, I know the events and characters and I'm just observing the way its adapted. The film's highest points are when there is action and spectacle, it's grandiose bigger than life and in a cinema it feels realistic. That feeling of realism is present in the books and it was treated well. The sets are all believable we could almost touch them, the most important set is of course the desert and its presence is surely felt. Costume design also follows the same principle of groundedness, it is one of the strongest points of the film, the sight of the Bene Gesserit is simply haunting, the dresses of Jessica are all memorable, and the star of the show is the Fremen stillsuit they nailed it.With such a strong cast we expect very powerful performances and the actors surely deliver, my favourite was definitely Duke Leto interpreted by Oscar Isaac, he plays well both the charismatic leader and the caring loving father and husband. Personally, I did not enjoy the soundtrack, although the sound design is very very effective especially in a cinema. The soundtrack is huge, maybe too huge for my taste I found it quite distracting and it overstayed its welcome. There are different themes for each character or trait (Honour, Atreides, Bene Gesserit, Shai-Hulud) but they were too obvious and very preachy.And so when all these cinematic elements combine they do create an unforgettable experience, but unforgettable for the wrong reasons or more precisely the wrong aspects. I did not see any of the ideas of the book manifested with image and sound, I only saw the images described in the book. The action and even the climax all happen in the background in the book because that's not the pint of the story, while here it's the opposite. Key scenes of character introductions and interactions are taken out in favour of more dreamy sequences and action. This shift of focus made many characters feel insignificant and I never cared for any of them, it's like everyone is a side character.I really appreciated the attention to small details, like the bull painting, desert mouse, glowglobes...
This the best Dune we're ever going to get, it's an audio-visual masterpiece, but it never felt nearly as thought provoking as the book or even as a standalone film.",Dune

I found the pace, action and plot to quicken in the middle and turned out to be way better than I expected especially after rewatching again. There is alot of emotion and alot of intrigue from the movie, which has caused me to quickly dive right into the Dune lore to try and understand more about the movie. The cast and acting is amazing, really elevated and makes you feel for the characters. Amazed that so much was done using practical effects.

I did not, but I did some research about the characters, plot etc without it being spoiled for me too much. I've never seen the original movie so I don't know how well it compares to this one, but I got to say and I quote: ""This is the best sci-fi that I've ever seen in the cinema"" WOW what a movie! From the details to the way shots are being filmed to the cast to the acting to the story and even the music, Everything is spot on! I've never seen anything like it.

In the first 5 minutes, every A list actor they got was shown as if the director wanted to be like LOOK WHO WE GOT!I know there are a lot of Timothy fans but I found his acting boring and unbelievable. He had the same tone and expression through 99% of the film. I joked that even Thanos can act circles around him when the scene with Josh Brolin and Timothy happened.I had no idea what was happening in this film and whenever I thought I did, something would happen and I would be just as confused. It felt like this weird combination of Star Wars and game of thrones (normally content I highly enjoy) that didn't mesh well together.I wanted to like it, I really did but maybe it would of been better if they weren't planning to make a trilogy of films.

2297,Super_happy,The Rebirth of Space Opera,9,24 October 2021,"I used to not accept Hans Zimmer and various living composers until I saw Dune.In 1968, 2001 Space Odyssey came out, and Kubrick jokingly joined the Blue Danube of the Strauss family and Also sprach Zarathustra of Richard Strauss. In 1977, the first Star Wars was released, which brought the entire film industry into commercialization, and created a new theme of space opera together with John Williams. It is obvious that there exists theme music for every important person and event, especially Darth Vader, which corresponds to the dominant motive in the opera. The dominant motive is the repetitive melody of one to two bars corresponding to each character. The band harmony and chants corresponding to the characters all indicate a certain character image.Objectively speaking, as a mixer, he does lack the talent of conductor and composer to control the delicate emotions, making it difficult to create gorgeous or poignant themes such as Darth Vader themes and Hedwig themes. His creations on the Dune alone make people think about whether these sentences are merely functional or repetitive. However, Paul's theme is brought by the playing of tubular instruments in the movie and the shouting of vocals, as if it were Zimmer's attempt at the emotional part of mixing and synthesizing. An example of this part is Leaving Caladan in the original soundtrack. This style of music also appeared many times in subsequent key plots of Paul.The accompaniment from the synthesizer began to have a certain emotional core, and its achievement and shock was no less than that of the movie's entry into the rare space opera movies since Star Wars. The emergence of religious colors in the movie, such as the soundtrack Premonition, on the other hand, also returns to the religious form of the early stage of classical music, I have to say that it is a clever way of soundtracking.Every film critic will not be parsimonious for
beautiful words. On the whole, I feel that it is on the same level as Star Wars. Compared with Space Odyssey, although there is a similar movie-watching experience, it still lacks a bit of detached imagination.",Dune

Instantly you get sucked in by the sounds, beautiful scenery and the mystery. It's a ""slow"" action movie WITH a deep story and you feel for the characters.The performance of Stellan is amazing.

2300,sbenj-11554,Whispering hard to hear,8,31 October 2021,The movie was great. The only complaint I have is the whispering parts were hard to understand because the music over powered. I hate when the music overtakes the story line.,Dune
2301,cmatzenauer,"Disappointing and, frankly, boring.",5,23 October 2021,"Wanted to love, or even enjoy. But I found myself bored scene after scene. Take away the CG and you have nothing left but weak directing and acting that brought no life or depth to the film.I don't know why it is rated so high except for possibly lovers of the book and story who are judging the film based on its CG.To me, it can't be unbelievable scenery or stunning cinematography when is essentially all CG.In the end..I was just happy, or sad I suppose, that I 'made it through'.",Dune

They let you know it's only part one right away so that's not anything I'd hold against them.This movie is visually stunning. The acting is fantastic. They do a great job building the world. They give you just enough info to understand it, but not enough to confuse you. Those that say this movie is boring maybe thought this was going to be nonstop action or something. It's not that kind of sci-fi. There's plenty of suspense and action in this movie as well though. It's 2 and a half hours long, but it didn't feel like it at all.I actually watched this first on tv and then went to the theater to see it again. It is absolutely amazing in theater. I highly recommend you see it that way if at all possible. This is a masterpiece. I can hardly wait for part two.",Dune

This movie looks absolutely stunning, the soundtrack is perfect and the actors do a very fine job. But what can i say, i almost fell asleep which is something that never happens to me. There is so little dialogue and the scenes are dragged out to a point where i was just not enjoying myself. There were some glimpses of what could've been a truly epic movie, and looking at the reviews most people seem to find it just that. Just don't expect a movie that moves at a high pace, because it really isn't.",Dune
2308,rosssicherman,Phenomenal - See it in IMAX while you can,9,24 October 2021,"I first watched the movie when it came out on HBO Max on Thursday night and I actually didn't love it on first viewing. However, today I saw it in IMAX and was blown away. I think it was a combination of the picture/sound quality of IMAX and being able to focus on the details more on second viewing.It's not without its flaws though...-Could have used a bit more levity. Tone was a bit too somber/serious. Is there no humor in the Duneiverse?-Another 30 minutes for more character/lore building would have been good.-Paul's Jamis vision and how it ultimately contradicts with their confrontation at the end of the movie wasn't well explained/presented. Could be a bit confusing for those who haven't read the book and know Paul can see multiple futures.-Zendaya has as much acting ability/charisma as a piece of wood. I don't think she did well as Chani. To be fair though, she didn't have many scenes. I hope she does well in part 2, as she will very much be a main character.These are all minor gripes though. Some of the best sci-fi I've ever seen. One of the best movies I've ever seen. I really hope part 2 gets made.",Dune
2309,duncanwright-94439,Meh,5,18 October 2021,"Visually stunning, though the bland beige colour palette became a bit monotonous. The story is, as we know, an epic, but the movie has far too many missed opportunities which fail to exploit this. It doesn't capture the feel and gravity of Herbert's Dune but for a few scenes.The music score is totally unsuited to the drama, often building with suspense only for nothing to happen. I honestly feel this would be a better watch without any music at all.I have been looking forward to this movie for such a long time only to feel very deflated by its poor execution.Lynch's Dune has its faults, but I'd watch that over this any day, sorry.",Dune

I never saw the 1984 film or read the book, so I cannot comment on it in relation to such. What I did view included the following:1. Incredible special effects. I haven't been this wowed since I saw Avatar.2. Excellent performance by the lead actor
3. Superb score (sometimes a little intrusive, but effective) by Hans Zimmer
4. Very interesting story, reminding me of some aspects of Game of Thrones (betrayal, duty, etc.)I will admit that I would have preferred if this movie moved at a slightly quicker pace and maybe cut out 20 minutes of its run time. However, I really enjoyed it. A true sci-fi classic that I believe will have some longevity. Can't wait for part 2. Go see it!!",Dune

I see it as an hommage to Lynch's masterpiece. Fanfiction on steroids, it felt empty and soulless, though.Retconning is bad, m'kay?The ornitopters are the secret stars of the show, besides Jason Momoa.What else? I can't remember the score, yet when I try to - the score of the 1984 version comes to mind.I had zero expectations and therefore was not disappointed.",Dune

2315,ozzy-04659,A Pleasant Surprise and Feast for the Eyes.,8,22 October 2021,"Movie adaptations of books are often poor and so I was prepared not to be impressed by Denis Villeneuve's attempt at putting right David Lynch's effort from 1984. Once sitting in the cinema and suddenly realising that the movie was only going to cover the first part of the story didn't improve my expectations. However, it didn't take long to realise that this movie was going to be a huge improvement on the 1984 version.This movie is epic in scale with beautiful cinematography and the IMAX sound makes for a great movie experience. I thought the acting was first rate and the CGI was as good as I've seen. Although there are spectacular action sequences, this is not a ""park your brain at the door"" action movie - you need to be switched on to follow the main narrative and other scenes such as the precognitive dreams of the main character.Despite the movie having ""slower"" sections the movie totally held my attention and made the two and a half hours run time fly by, and by the end I was thirsty for more - which is always a sign that I've enjoyed the movie. I hope ""Part One"" does well enough for the second part to be made - it would be tragic if such a good movie wasn't finished.",Dune
2316,adhdawesome,A great start that's charm hasn't come out yet.,6,25 October 2021,"Loving the books and original movie, I had a lot already in my mind when I went to see this movie. David Lynch is one of my favorite directors, and while I don't dislike Villeneuve, none of his films have resonated with me. Nonetheless I spent half this film on the edge of my seat. The action and storytelling with amazing accuracy to the book kept me wrapped in, while the effects and costume design made this movie a dream to look at, despite a minor cavoite; I felt distracted.There are three major issues of this movie, that kept dragging me out of the movie:
The cinematography was boring and flat for most of the dialogue, though the effects often made up for this shortcoming.The acting felt underwhelming from an all-star cast. I have enjoyed the work of every actor on this cast, but couldn't help but be disappointed in how little emotion talented actors gave.Scenes that I felt held heavy weight in the book were lacking the weight I thought they deserved. I loved the performance from Baron Harkonnen, but he got so little screen time, his death didn't feel deserved yet.The costume design, effects, and sound was all incredible. I was deeply immersed for over half of the film. I believe that the value of this story will increase given sequels, and we'll look back at it as a better movie. For now, though, I wasn't blown away.",Dune
2317,mtimsit,Star wars meets game of thrones,7,25 September 2021,Initially I wanted to give it a 6 but that felt harsh given that visually this movie really is a treat and should be watched on the big screen make no mistake. The movie was rather slow but nevertheless an elegant introduction and I hope we are being set up for bigger and better things in the sequel/sequels. It does have a certain appeal but I belive it's slightly overrated at the moment. Solid watch nonetheless and interested to see what is to come.,Dune
2318,CaptainCommode,Visually Amazing,9,25 October 2021,Looked fantastic. Great movie. Really would have preferred a series but I'll take it. Not sure how well first timers to Dune will understand it but all the cuts made sense.,Dune
2319,jeffladda,Only half a movie - very disappointing,1,1 November 2021,"I was looking forward to the climax with the great battle and fall of Barron Harkkonen, but it was all missing! Instead a lot of long slow parts which left the movie in a slump for much of the middle portion. I had to fight the urge to take nap!Compared to the 1984 version, this one doesn't deliver the goods for me. Seems Hollywood is hoping to make an extra buck by chopping it and saving the climax for a sequel. To summarize this movie, it is dull, slow and incomplete!",Dune
2320,ivan-208,Absolute Borefest,1,21 October 2021,"Was so looking forward to this updated interpretaion of the book, but oh dear!!! Slow tedious storyline and cardboard acting. Should have been no more than a 1 hour TV show, how they pent so much money making it is ridiculous.",Dune

2322,webacerob,2.5 hours yet very little was established,5,20 October 2021,Watched the original Dune and the fact this was the best they could do with 40 years is disappointing. There's no way this is a 8.3 rating...it'll dive once it's out of theaters. Very concerned with Hollywoods fixation of remaking or adding prequels to iconic films and doing them a disservice. I was really looking forward to this and wanted to love it but it just never happened.,Dune
2323,draganbsmilevski,Dune but only in title...,6,23 October 2021,First apart being obviously better visually considering large time span between two movies the new Dune doesn't really bring anything interesting nor it actually makes me invested in the movie. Lots of bits and pieces tried to be put together in more then 2h but failed at that. Also lots of things left out in the open but should really have been addressed in the Part One. I guess studio wanted to attract younger generations with this remake but sometimes it's better not to make anything unless you really know what the books are about. Totally misinterpreted cast in my opinion. And some characters (rather important ones) get done out pretty quickly without any real feel to them. Overall I give it a 5 only because of being shot well.,Dune
2324,djnishu,I should directly start the movie from second part!!,4,20 October 2021,Only one word BORING!!The movie is actually started after 2 hours and left for part 2 which was very bad experience.It had good visuals but bad intense and action.,Dune
2325,sabyasachits,Beautiful,9,23 October 2021,"The cinematography is top notch, it is certainly made for the cinemas and not for your phone or tv screen. Every single scene was just beautiful. CGI was clean. Though, Lord Baron's was well unique.With this star-studded cast I thought the movie would become slightly biased and give more screen time to one and forget the rest, but everything is very well balanced.Since I've come to know that this is the 1st movie in the series the ending just piqued my interest towards the story.It has familial politics like Game of thrones and yet feels fresh. The super commanding power""Bene Gesserit"" (NOT SPOILERS :: WAS IN TRAILER)is a new concept but I'd like to see it's flaws/weaknesses. The lore was easy to get into but less explored so I was left with more questions.Alas the emperor isn't revealed which is both a good and bad thing, though I'd have liked a Thanos-like reveal in the MCU.Thanks for reading. Eagerly waiting for the next one.",Dune
2326,joewhelan,A nice surprise,9,30 October 2021,"I may lack credibility seeing as how I have never read the book, or ever watched the Lynch version. I wasn't remotely excited about this film, only watching it bc I am a huge fan of Denis and the cast he assembled. Boy was it an incredible surprise, and I have not stopped thinking about this film since I viewed it. People will complain about the slow pace, though I didn't feel like it was slow at all. Dune purists will complain it doesn't cover every minute detail the book contains, but that would be impossible. Just enjoy the glimpse of this universe you get to see. It is just visually mind blowing, with tons of heart surrounding the characters so you feel for each of them. The menacing villains and opposing forces are mind blowing as well. Honestly, Denis just took this to the next level. At the end of the day, it is worth a watch.",Dune
2327,Mik0rist,DUNE - dead serious Sci-Fi,9,26 September 2021,"Denis Villeneuve's DUNE has Campbell's monomythical framework storytelling structure. In fact, George Lucas used this model to build the stories. It has been redesigned to have the simplicity of the Story Circle. That's why almost everyone has the impression that they watched ""DUNE: A Star Wars Story"". For this reason, Greig Fraser as Cinematographer was deliberately chosen. If I had never read the book and I new nothing of Dune I could miss the opening credits and watch this film thinking it was a new Star Wars movie and I would be completely none the wiser.The story is so adapted and simplified visually that a wide range of people can follow it, and further spreads the impression by words of mouth and camp in the front of the cinema.This is a global phenomenon. It's incredibly viral. It affects.The result is not to impress us who know the book by heart. Than to become a very viral film for a wide audience. It was made with the intention in advance of breaking the Box Office. But they didn't count on a pandemic and a be shown on HBO. This is the visual bible of Dune's book. And let's say the first 300 pages literally. Denis explains more with pictures than with words. This is the experimental exercise of cinematography. There are many parallels with George Lucas' way of expression, but Ridley Scott influence on ""world-building"" is also clear.The film can literally be watched on MUTE and get to know the plot. Like a silent film literally. A similar feeling as with Odyssey in the Kubrick universe. The film is dead serious in the same way. Too serious for my taste. There are no jokes in it at all. There is no slang and bad language either. It's not a movie to watch with popcorn. You don't have to blink here to be able to absorb all the visual information. The disadvantage is that those who are not concentrated and rested can fall asleep in the cinema because they cannot process all the densely compressed information they receive.",Dune
2328,trooperben,Boring,1,1 November 2021,This is a terrible movie with good cast. The acting is horrible. If you like brown and black movies this is for you. Very hard to follow.

It's visually stunning, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is majestic, the acting is spot on! The pacing might seem a little slow by todays standards, but it never gets boring. And I actually find it really refreshing to see serious SciFi for adults, without bangs or a ""comic relief"" every other second.I've read the book about four or five times more than 20 years ago. And from my memory (I will refresh it soon) the movie stays true to the story of the book and, more importantly, its general feeling.Opposed to many other people, I also quite liked David Lynchs interpretation, despite all of its shortcomings. Because one thing that Lynch got right, was the ""psychedelic"" nature of the book.And that's my only gripe with Denis Villeneuves adaptation, and the reason why I don't give it 10 stars: While he hints at the mindaltering properties of spice, he never explores the psychedelic aspects of the book as deep as I'd like them to be explored.Here's my hope for part two. If he creates a second part, and manages to keep up the quality while at the same time not shying away from the psychedelic underpinnings of the source material. He will have created a two part masterpiece.",Dune
2331,jacobkloevekorn,"A beautiful movie, setting an awesome course for future movies of this universe",9,3 November 2021,"A movie this hyped and often spoken about made me curious about whether its really such a masterpiece or overhyped like others in its genre. But in the end i have to say, this movie comes up to all expectations you could have.The movie has an amazing setting, starting on an earth like planet which makes the difference even more visually stunning when they reach. Arrakis. The long shots of scenery and the different elements they used to show the Fremen are just beautiful. I think this is one of the main reasons where a fantasy world like this outshines Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. You get to know right away how the characters feel just by having simple shots of them without anything said.Probably even more amazing in my eyes is the music by Hans Zimmer. You wouldnt need to know what the movie is about but some of the tracks instantly give you this orientalic, dessert like feeling which is wonderful. The track at the beginning when signing the contract is amazingly well done. Also at some points of the music you just have complete silence which underlines those specific moments even better instead of putting in some filler music.The story itself is quite good. I havent read the books myself so i dont know how much they stick to that story but i havent heared anything bad towards that yet so it seems good. I love how they pictured the different factions, from cold blooded killers to fanatic believers to loyal servants to wildered tribes. It all fits really well.The whole movie seems like a big setup for this enormous universe so we have a lot of explaining and exposition which probably is nessecary, sometimes a bit too much. We get a lot of visions of events that in this movie never happen, leaving open a big space for future events in the upcoming movies with this forshadowing.The only reason why im not giving this 10 stars is the pacing. To me it felt a bit out of place. While after only 5 minutes we already leave the main planet, the last 30 minutes of the movie are quite slow which i would have loved to see a bit more shorter where the beginning wasnt that rushed and gave you more time to understand the different relations between the factions.I am really exited for the new movie to show even more of this amazing movie. Go watch it!",Dune

Accually a 6.5 i make it short good cast good actors but not enough character from all actors noting rly dramatic happen i know its the first from maybe 7 movie where coming but i rly dont like the pacing and the cold acting from some characters for me the only character i rly like in this film was rebecca and jason momoa and the no country for old men actor but he got legit only 3 m screentime in this movie .Ofc it is a visual masterpiece but how it can not be ? The movie cost over 150 million dollar ive the visual would not be sunning this film would be a 4 or a 5 - 10 stars the whole film makes a big build up and accualy nothiing rly cool or interestiung happen where i can build on to or are in my mind many days after this film acting and pace felt so bad i dont know what to say everyone says its a banger masterpiece bla bla but its accualy not true and to say its only the beginning cool why dont make the beginning unforgetable make mor story telling more character building why talk 30 m about the same thing then make 1 long action scene then nothing accualy happens after it was a huge dissapointment for me and my friend where was going to cinema and paid money for it . Thenbest thing on this movie was the music from Hans zimmer also knowed for music for inception and many others .Ive the second part doesnt be better i better watch riders of justice or inception a thrid time makes more sense .,Dune

2336,MesDeCupy,I'm still figuring out if it's a masterpiece...,9,25 September 2021,"Where are the bad reviews?? I can't find them, everybody seems to love this movie. Me as well, I think it might be the best in the last two years, and it will probably stay that way for some time.Dune is an epic sci-fi fantasy art work, and Denis Villeneuve proves again that he knows how to craft an enormous picture around an actual simple story. For me, 'Dune' talks about the difficult responsibilities a young heir apparent must face when his family, or his House, House Atreidies, gets involved in a huge political game between other houses concerning the distribution of territory and spice, a special resource, on Arrakis. Most characters are portrayed very subtle and without any excessive actions. For me, that way of creating character and depth works, some people may find it a bit difficult to connect with. Rebecca Ferguson stood out the most for me, I think her performance is worthy of an Oscar nomination.It feels very slow at times, and at times a little too slow. I like Denis' style, and it's not as slow as Blade Runner 2049, but because of the general pacing in this film, there were some moments when I would have liked it a little shorter.Technically this film is outstanding.... The production design is AMAZING!!! Costumes, sets, scenery, etc. They were all perfect for me! The cinematography is beautiful, not as good as Roger Deakins' work with Denis, but still top notch. And then Hans Zimmer... he does it again. Not his best, but how could he? He's already made some of the best scores ever. It's a little too ambient for me at times, and I would have liked the vocals to be a little more present in the film. Other than that, it's musical perfection, no complaints!!!I want to talk about one more thing, the style of Denis Villeneuve. Denis is a filmmaker who makes his films on a basis of world building. The best example is Blade Runner 2049, the whole film is one big exhibition in the gigantic universe created by Philip K. Dick in his novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".For me, that's when Denis is at his best. But I missed a bit of that, it felt like Dune could have felt even bigger. The whole time it felt like we could have gone a little further, just a little bit.I realize now how bad my review sounds, I'm just pointing out some things that bothered me a bit. I love the movie, and always will!!! I'm still figuring out if I think it's a masterpiece, but for now, I'll leave it for discussion.",Dune

2342,gabrielferreiraestanislau,A perfect prologue,9,26 October 2021,"Dune, directed by Denis Villeneuve, and scripted by the director along with John Spaihts and Eric Roth, an adaptation of Frank Herbert's book, considered one of the greatest and most influential books in science fiction, tells the story of Paul Atreides, whose family becomes command the planet Arrakis, a desert planet and the only place that has sources of the rare spice ""melange"", which has a great impact on technological development and trade. The rival family called ""Harkonnen"" is conspiring against the Atreides on Arrakis, which creates a major conflict between these two families.Denis Villeneuve contains great projects in his cinematography, being director of: Blade Runner 2049, The Arrival, The Suspects and Incendiaries. The director has a great responsibility to adapt a great book in which adventure, ecology, religion and politics are approached as the main elements of the narrative, and he does this in a way that is faithful to the original work of Frank Herbert. Villeneuve's challenge was to simplify a text rich with lots of information and terms for a large audience that did not read the original work.Therefore, the director has to make a great contextualization of concepts for the general understanding, for that person who has never heard of Duna in his life, I was extremely satisfied with this contextualization. People who have never read the work can rest assured, it is not a restrictive film, but it requires the viewer's attention. Some people may find this tedious and slow, but it's necessary for the film's narrative and it didn't bother me at all.The technical work of the film is perfect, Greig Fraser, responsible for the photography direction, left me totally speechless with his work, scenes that convey a feeling of a great film, that explore how dense and difficult it is to live in the desert of Arrakis, and of course, showing all its immensity. Also, something that, together with the beautiful photography makes Dune an epic film is its soundtrack, made by the great German composer Hans Zimmer, every scene with major events had an impact driven by Zimmer's soundtrack, that makes you feel the grandeur of the action scenes, and the impact of important scenes for the development of the narrative.Duna's cast is amazing, Timothée Chalamet is simply the ideal Paul Atreides, I can't imagine watching Duna with the role being another actor. Other names also stand out, such as: Oscar Issac (Duke Leto), Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica) and Jason Momoa (Duncam Idaho). The cast is all starred, however, not all actors have scenes to show what they can act, an example is Zendaya (Chani), who appears in a few scenes during the film, which is justified by Duna not being a complete adaptation of the first book. Villeneuve, in this first film, adapts two-thirds of Dune's book, Zendaya's character has a greater prominence after the course of these two-thirds of the story. No wonder, said the director that Chani will be one of the main characters in the sequel.Dune 2 has yet to be officially confirmed by Warner, but it would be a huge disappointment not to have a second movie, Dune is a ""great prologue"" to something bigger, a second movie with more happenings and the closing story of the original work.Dune is a grand and epic movie, a movie worth a movie ticket if you get it and can, as it's a movie to be enjoyed on the big screen, as the Dune experience will certainly be better at the cinema than at home.",Dune

Special praise to Hans Zimmer. The plot of Frank Herbert is lovingly transferred to the big screen by one of the best directors of today. Lovely caste, which accurately conveys this action.The main disadvantage stems from the limited timing, namely the missing arches of the characters, locations and some events that are of great importance in the plot and understanding of the causes and consequences. + Perhaps the age rating has imposed some restrictions. I really hope that the director's version will be released in 4-5 hours, or at least in the sequel Denis will return to these nuances.So you just have to carry your money to the cinema, otherwise all we have left in the future are the endless conveyors of spheroic and the continuation of the Fast and the Furious.My score 9.3.",Dune

The plot feels very thin, with way too much emphasis on sweeping visuals and a soundtrack that after a while becomes a bit much.It feels like it's all packaging, and no substance. They took everything that's in the trailer, and stretched it into a 2 hour+ movie that at least for me, was a disappointment after all the anticipation.",Dune
2349,Mike_v_E,"Dune: Part One exceeded my, already high, expectations",10,19 September 2021,"Let me start by saying that I have not read the Frank Herbert books, I have only seen the David Lynch film. My introduction to Dune came from Denis Villeneuve.Like you have probably seen in the trailers, the cinematography of Dune: Part One is grand and mesmerizing. The shots, by Greig Fraser, beautifully visualized the massive scale of the film. The grand and mesmerizing cinematography, combined with the eerie and hypnotic score by Hans Zimmer, provides a dreamlike experience that let's the viewer lose themselves into the world of Dune.I don't think I was ever so fully transported into a film as I was with Dune: Part One. It is a mesmerizing thing to lose yourself into another world. The pacing felt just about right, it did not feel slow by any means, although I am someone that also likes slower paced films like Blade Runner 2049. The action in this film, combined with the grand cinematography and eerie score, had such a visceral impact that it literally blew my mind. Pure madness and pure chaos, but with the right proportion during the 2 hours and 35 minutes.My concern before seeing the film was that it would be visually stunning, but lacks the emotional connection to the characters. Luckily there were a few characters I was emotionally invested in. The scene with Leto (you know which one) was an emotional scene and really made me feel bad for him. The flashforwards Paul had contributed to the story and the emotions he is dealing with, which made me also more emotionally invested in Paul. It also made me curious about what's next, even though I know what will happen next (sort of, because I have only seen David Lynch' Dune). Unfortunately I was not emotional invested in all characters, Dr Yueh for example. Maybe this will change on a second viewing, because it's all a lot to take in on a first watch.I have seen a few people say the ending felt too abrupt. For me the ending did not feel abrupt by any means. Yes this is Part 1, so you won't have a concluding ending. For me personally it made me want Part 2 and also gave me a proper ending of Part 1.Oh.. and don't worry about Dune: Part One only being available in 3D. Yes the glasses made the screen a bit darker, but the 3D actually looks better than I expected. This comes from someone that thinks 3D is just a gimmick.Now I do have a negative thing I would like to point out. I've seen Dune: Part One in IMAX and the volume was really loud, a bit too loud. In the beginning of the film it's fine, but I had the impression that the volume went higher by the minute. Because it was so loud the score and sound effects became a bit muddled at some point.Overall I would highly recommend seeing Dune: Part One in the theaters, whether you're a fan of the books or not!",Dune
2350,contactmarkmorrissey,True cinematic experience,8,30 October 2021,"Definitely one for the big screen visually and aurally..... Reminded me of the original Star Wars experience back in the day.

2352,Liam-Reynolds-,"If you've read the novel, I'd be suprised if you like this.",6,25 October 2021,"Obviously I've read the book hence the review tilte.I felt the film lacked so much in terms of being magical and mystical, it really didn't develop characters and define their roles. The casting is well done and the acting is great, even with a dumbed down Americanised script. Yet the character arcs and backgrounds aren't even scraped over. Dr Yueh is just some strange doctor seemingly without a profound relationship to the Atriedes. Duncan and Gurney are just humans that are good at fighting. Paul, Leto and Jessica are just there and they rule a planet. The lore and delineation of the super powerful nature of Benne Gesserit was neglected and over shadowed by the special effects and CGI.This film is just a spectacle. The CGI and world building is remarkable, truly. But, it's just a feeble story for what could have been so much more gut wrenching and potent, imo.Plus, the council scene from the novel was cut which hurt my soul lmao.Not enough magic, too many explosions.",Dune
2353,missdaisybuchanan,Style over substance,7,23 October 2021,"I read the book and to me this was all surface over substance. The visuals are stunning but I expected more from the human side of the story.. Gorgeous landscapes, constant slow motion and epic music alone will not make me connect to a story. The point of a movie is to make you feel something and I did not feel a thing while watching it. The relationships between characters are not developed. Some people who have important conversations in the book don't even share a single scene in the movie. I get that the complex nature of the politics, history, myths and science in the books is hard to adapt to the screen. But they had two and a half hours to cover half of the first book.. and they spent half of it on slow motions. It was sloooow. If I hadn't read the book I wouldn't understand what strings are pulling the story in the background. I'm not saying it's terrible, only that I expected more. But the music is absolutely amazing.

I mention this only because the Villaneuve version has done the same thing for my son. He loves this movie and now wants to read the book. I couldn't be more please.

Viewers need to be rooting for someone, we need to care.I can't overstate how tediously slow-paced this movie is... It's laboriously setting the scene for a sequel I can't imagine wanting to risk viewing.The innumerous murky, dimly-lit, shades of brown, scenes made watching on the big-screen a waste of money too...

2363,taylorjmcgraw,A Marvelous (pun intended) Adaptation,9,25 October 2021,"Beautiful vision from one of the most perennially visionary auteurs of modern cinema.Two minor grievances:1. I was somewhat surprised by the lack of depth / screen time devoted to exploring the mentats and their abilities, as this is an extremely important facet of Paul's development in the story. If this is covered well-enough in pt. 2, that's fine but I hope that it is.2. I think a lot of the criticism directed at the films surgical 2.5 hours and what some feel is an emotionally barren plot could have been solved by including the Atreides dinner party when they get to Arrakis. This was imo a missed opportunity to give us a little more understanding of the characters, the situation they've just walked into on Dune, and more natural segue into the crescendo of the second act. Would have also been a good opportunity to develop more of an emotional connection to Leto and the entire Atreides house before they all get slaughtered.I didn't have a problem with any of the other choices made with respect to the source material. Overall, phenomenal work. I've watched it three times in the Three days since release. The haunting score is truly otherworldly and absolutely perfect. As are the set designs, cinematography, costumes, and just generally everything else. TC is perfect as Paul. I don't understand the negative things people are saying there - the nuance he brings to an incredibly difficult on-screen character makes me feel like I'm in his head, hearing his thoughts like when reading Herbert's novel.The story DV really wants to tell ends with Dune messiah. Warner is salivating over the opportunity to build an IP universe on the scale of this magnitude, and a cinematic trilogy helmed by a Denis Villeneuve at the top of his game is the essential piece of the puzzle. Hopefully, this marks the beginning of a franchise that will prove that you don't need a halfwitted, spandex toting super hero to monetize big universe IP.",Dune

I liked this.However I thought it ended pretty abruptly, and there was a fair amount of filler and arty scenes that were not befitting of a space saga. The world feels more thought out than Star Wars, as an obvious comparison.I think the slight criticism stems from the fact this is a two parter.That being said, it's a good film that held my attention long enough to get in to it.It feels like it has set up a truly delicious second film, and I'm hoping I am right.",Dune

Since there several scenes of Paul's dreams/visions, this makes one of the central plot elements difficult to understand.--As a corollary, we do not get to see the spacing guild navigators actually navigating, which was one of the most amazing (and unintentionally hilarious) scenes from the 1985 adaptation.--The pacing of the first act is too tight for some of the characters to have breathing space. Dr. Yueh is a prime example as his only role in the script is to betray the Atreides.--Writing out Feyd makes sense, but not having Irulan makes the Emperor's role in the story unclear.A few standout moments:--The scene of Paul and Jessica in their tent, where Paul is seeing himself become a monstrous tyrant, is chilling and very well acted.--Kynes and the Sardaukar commander being eaten by a sandworm.--Oscar Isaac's delivery of ""Damn the spice!""--Skarsgaard is perfectly cast as Vladimir.

Imagine the first lord of the Rings movie that just stopped when Frodo left the shire. Its the best trailer for a movie that has jet to be made, but its simply not a finished movie. Steam users would have annihilated this movie in their reviews if it was a game.Also I'm oddly enough not entirely convinced by the soundscapes and sound effects. I can't tell you why but exactly. Some of the major themes and sounds appear to be recycled or at least inspired from other recent movies and there wasn't a particular moment where I was really impressed by the background music.

After, all, we're not dealing with technological and scientific developments and ideas here, but instead with an empire, arisocratic houses, magic and cultures, only it takes place in space. Being the classic story that it is, I don't think I need to go into detail about the plot. Villeneuve has succeded tremendously in the worldbuilding of this movie. It sets up the plot and the world it takes place in perfectly, and shows us hints of traditions and cultures at the same time. This all makes the universe feel much more believable. All that is set up leads to epic confrontations, only strengthened by the amazing acting of all cast members and by Hans Zimmer's epic score.

2394,oleh_holodyshyn,Great adaptation of the great book,8,3 November 2021,"Movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's «Dune» is an extremely complicated task for any director. Jodorowsky and Lynch wore the first to step up and adapt the book. Although, due to many issues, in post-production (for Jodorwsky) and in production (for Lynch) - we have never seen a decent adaptation of the book. However, it seems like a visual master Denis Villeneuve did what some considered the impossible - a very well book adaptation.The first 20 min of Lynch's «Dune» begins with a very long exploration of the Dune lore. So did Villeneuve, but the way he revealed the basics of the story is quite extraordinary. One merely drowned in the beauty and surroundings of this magnificent word that Denis and his team had brought up. So continues the film with its visuals and the story. One can argue that the way the story had been revealed is very on the top, meaning that there are to much of the ""non-hide"" exposition that is put in the form of exponasions. Nevertheless, the one who's familiar with the book will confirm that the book is overfilled whith all kinds of exponasions of all kinds of stuff, and the exponasions in the book are put gently in to the plot. So may be sad about the film. The feeling of overexponasions was abandoned while watching the film, because it was done in the best way possible, and also gently.That been said, I do understand viewers who felt that they were taught about the lore in some parts of the film. So I deduct that if one read the book before, one might enjoy the film more.Hence I conclude that the movie is not for any viewer, however I do belive that one will enjoy the movie, notwithstanding.The visuals, the story and the work of the great Denis Villeneuve are remarkable. The film gives you the feeling that one encounter while reading the book, and that is an achievement.",Dune

I thought the actors were good but the content was so Disneyfied there was nothing left to care about. Paul was supposed to be so consumed with revenge that he is willing to unleash galactic gynecide. Did not see it. Everyone was so flat. Lady Jessica had two expressions mousey and distracted. So uninspiring, unimaginative, unflattering. Why am I supposed to get so choked up for fascisms. Stilgar, ok.

2401,ramsoundareswaran,A visual spectacle that puts form over narrative.,8,24 October 2021,"Dune is a one of a kind visual spectacle. I know now what people in the past would've felt when they saw 2001: A Space Odyssey or Lawrence of Arabia on the big screen for the first time. Every shot is filled with grandeur and beauty. When it comes to the narrative the film takes it's time to introduce us to the world and it's characters. The slow building can put off some people but once the film gets going in the second half it's a treat. The film has the emotional depth of a cardboard and despite Timothee Chalamat's superb performance we don't really care for his journey. This cold nature of the narrative, as often with Villeneuve's films, is a by-product of the extremely formal approach towards the story.

It almost felt like the movie was 1 hour long and then they added all these slow motion scenes which made it 2.5 hours.

The music, direction, and visual photography transports you into the fictional world of Frank Herbert's Dune. You become one of the characters travelling with Paul on his journey. The political drama is really well captured by Villeneuve as you feel the tension brewing between the houses as the plot moves ahead to the final checkmate.Second, the story of Dune is well represented by Hans Zimmer's music. The music sets the tone of each scene quite perfectly and keeps you at the edge of your seat.Third, the actors casted for Dune were phenomenal. Personally, I really enjoyed Rebecca Ferguson's performance as Lady Jessica. I was able to connect with the character really well which made me feel as a part of them. I think that's the point.I really look forward to the Part Two very soon. I do hope Warner Bros. Do not screw it up as they had already released it digitally making it difficult for the movie to make up for the audience considering piracy.

2415,davidugarte-35647,Unfortunate cuts to the plot and characters but overall still not bad,8,29 October 2021,"I am a big fan of the original book Dune. I have read it many times, it is one of my favorite sci-fi stories, and as such, it has a special place in my heart, and so I went into this movie with a high bar for Villeneuve to meet.That being said, while I agreed with some of the changes made to the story, some of the scenes skipped, and some that were added, there were a few plot threads that I felt were sorely missed, and some characters were virtually gutted to serve only their basic functions - most notably the main antagonist, the Baron Harkonnen.Among the parts that were cut, I felt that the Atreides' suspicion of a traitor among the high ranks was a virtually-essential piece of the story because it sowed distrust between the Duke's top officers, and Jessica. In the books the reader is told way in advance that the traitor is the Doctor, but even with that knowledge, we enjoyed a lot of tension leading up the moment of betrayal. I had assumed the movie would not give away the Doctor's role before he made his move, but by completely skipping any hint of suspicion of any traitor at all - it really made the betrayal feel random, abrupt, and less impactful. It's supposed to be a moment of high drama and it comes off underwhelming. The Doctor, like many characters, felt like a hollow shell of the book's character. It's like Villeneuve cut all the personality out of the characters, left no shred of backstory, quirks or flavor.Later in the book, Gurney finally reunites with Paul and Jessica, and has mistakenly been harboring a grudge against Jessica, as he is convinced she was the traitor, and this is another point of tension in the book, which I think will either be skipped entirely in the film, or they will have Gurney freak out on Jessica without any of the backstory that they've already started skipping, and it will once again feel underwhelming.Another huge plot element that was utterly abandoned was Piter - the Baron's mentant, who is a very interesting character in the book, but is just a plain old servant in this movie. In the book he lends a strong element of villainous discord in his dialogue with the Baron and helps explain the Baron's scheming. We lost something really juicy with this omission.Along that same vein - the Baron's character is a shadow of the book's Baron. Stellan Skargaard is a good actor and I think he could have portrayed the Baron in all his quirky, Machiavellian glory, given the write director, but apparently Villeneuve said ""forget this classic, iconic arch villain character and all his lines, we're just going to make you a generic, quiet, grumbly, scary guy, and you're only emotion will be Grumbling.""
The Baron in the books is amazing. We get multiple chapters from his POV with awesome insights into his ability to scheme and plot, his plans within plans, and also his faults and blindspots. He's charismatic, if gross and cruel, and just the perfect antagonist, the kind of bad guy you Love to hate. This movie really dropped the ball with him.Lastly, so far - and I preface this that way, because there is still the second movie to come and there is still hope of salvaging this plot element - the movie has completely skipped the Spacer's Guild. The Spacer's Guild are an integral part of the plot of Dune. Not just because they explain how interstellar space travel is made possible in this universe, but because they explain why the spice on Dune is important, and therefore why the empire even cares about ruling over Dune and what the planet's eco-system looks like. This is fundamental stuff. But they are barely mentioned in passing in this film. They play a very big role in the second part of the book, so I trust they will come up more in part 2, but in the book they had gotten some more mentions by now, and so, I feel I am justified in expressing my concern that this vital plot element is MIA.On the bright side, the actors were great, the cinematography, set design, the costumes and the way things like shields, sandworms and stillsuits were portrayed were all very good. That is why I am giving this movie a solid 8. Although I have this big complaints I've explained ad nauseum, overall it is still actually a pretty good movie.",Dune

Spectacular cast, interesting set/ideas, good pacing of the story with proper character introduction/development and spot on soundtrack that kept you engaged throughout the film.Villeneuve's Dune was more like an endless shallow well made perfume ad with a stereotypical cast that kept dragging on forever. Even as as a die hard Dune fan I was just sitting there bored and eagerly waiting for the movie to finally end. At no point throughout the movie I felt any connection to the story or any of the characters though it was nice to look at it in a sense you would stare at well made screensaver. The soundtrack didn't do it for me either because it was too pretentious and didn't connect well with the shallow narrative nor the well made visuals.Ultimately I don't even care if there is going to be another part because I certainly won't buy another ticket for it but maybe consider watching it through a streaming service when I feel really bored on a rainy cold evening.David Lynch can be proud of his unloved baby.

2439,Crimsus,"Visually stunning, but the rest is mediocre at best...",4,29 October 2021,"First, this movie is visually stunning! The cinematography for the movie is absolutely wonderful. Most of the landscapes are real and not CGI. This detail really helps to draw in the audience, until...I had high hopes for this movie, but the visuals are about the only thing going for it. There are changes in the movie that depart from the books in many critical ways. Sometimes it is obvious, sometimes it is subtle until the next scene in the movie and you realize they have to make up dialogue to maintain continuity in some form to stay close to the original novel. The dialogue is painful at times. There are conversations that should seem to be fairly easy and fluid, yet there are dramatic pauses in conversation that makes one believe the characters all have problems speaking. It's crazy and highly disappointing.Timothée Chalamet's performance was a bit disappointing. The one mistake the prior two Dune movies made was using an older actor for Paul. This version got the age pretty close, but his mannerisms and behavior seemed to immature. The way Paul was portrayed in the movie is like he is a whiny varsity kid that needs justification for whenever he is told to clean his room.Zendaya's performance, what little of it there is, seems like a waste of money and time. Other than a few sentences here and there, her character basically does nothing but stare at Paul in his dreams. The way Zendaya deliver's her dialogue seems mechanical and without any convincing emotion. Her performance really makes me doubt that there will be a good sequel.Rebecca Ferguson's performance was spot on! There are a few times when I think maybe she overdid things, but it was by far the best performance in the movie.Oscar Isaac did a fairly good job, but I think what held him back the most was the way his dialogue was written. The movie strayed a bit too far from the novel.There are also key elements from the novel that were left out. I'm not talking about a scene where a character sneezes or something trivial like that. KEY elements that demonstrated the character's personality, prowess, and ability, were left out of the movie. For example, there is a scene where Rebecca Ferguson's character (Lady Jessica) needed to act fast in a life or death situation. Instead of doing the ONE THING that makes her character so unique, she does some basic hand-to-hand and that's it. Don't worry, there are at least 12 other scenes before that where key elements of a character were just left out.The stunt work was ok, for maybe a made-for-TV movie. There is a combat scene where Jason Momoa's character (Duncan Idaho) leaps from one place to the next over a great distance. The problem is that the scene literally makes it look like he is leaping over a great distance by invisible wires. It was painful to see that. The other combat scenes were ok, but that one scene really hurt to watch. It looked so fake--the one thing you want to avoid in a movie.In the end, it felt like I watched a version of Dune where the only information they could find was on Wikipedia and no one on the staff read the books to understand the characters and how they developed. In the Sci-Fi (before it was SyFy) Dune mini-series/movie, most of the outdoor and indoor visuals were CGI, but at least they stayed true to the novel and the dialogue was fluid and the character development was natural and easy to follow.",Dune

We never see how the Guild fold space how the spice plays an important role for that and how it plays a role within the whole structure of the story.I was disappointed.

As someone who didnt watch the old movie or read the story I was very disconnected with all the characters. The director didn't try to engage the audience or make them emotionally attached to any particular person in the film. Almost 70% of movie happened in a Zendaya slow motion and Timothy dreams. I'm still very confused about his father and his mother. Everything felt so half baked almost like pilot episode of good show rather than an actual movie.

It streamlined certain events yet managed to communicate the core messages of the book.I do believe however, that the soundtrack albeit BEAUTIFUL was sometimes undercut by the excessive ambience.(It didnt bother any of my friends though, so it might be a ME thing). Also ,I think that we could have had the ending about 10 minutes earlier. Some say that it ended abruptly but in all honesty the point where the story stopped seemed logical to me. It might be because I have read the book.It was a long ride but a suspenceful one.

All in all I thought they did a great job capturing the dreamlike quality the book had to it. It may seem counter-intuitive but 165 million dollars is not a lot for a 2.5 hr blockbuster in 2021. Considering what they did with this film it looks and plays out as a truly grand epic sci-fi story. Most of the effects are first rate. The studio DNEG did an impressive job producing realistic looking scenes. I feel like the filmmakers did an amazing job on the whole tapping into the weird world of Dune without going into tripping on Acid territory. Many speculate that Frank Herbert was doing drugs when he wrote Dune, after all, it was the 60's!! What they end up with here is a story that has a lot of eventful stuff crammed into it but the flaw in that is there is a real lack of any sense of time. It's almost like a movie trailer in that it possesses a narrative structure but lacks a distinct timeline with middle beginning and end.

2470,jeff-98697,Meh! Definitely not an improvement over the 1984 Lynch version,3,1 November 2021,"I watched the original David Lynch 1984 version just before this one debuted, falling for all the fawning reviews about its scale, its conception, its refrain from voice-over narrative (not true), and production values. I was severely disappointed.1. EDITING
Its editing is plodding and confusing. The scenes are redundant and way, way too long without revealing anything new or important. Even while David Lynch reportedly was incensed that the studio cut his own version because it was too long (2:17, and it does seem rushed at the end), this one was even longer (2:35) and stopped not even halfway through the story. I actually found myself nodding off. Pretty sure I won't see Part II if it's ever made.And the so-called waking dreams that Paul is having are not delineated from the ongoing ""real time"" narrative, so that we get confused about what is really happening vs. What he thinks is going to happen. I had a few ""wait-what?"" moments watching this.2. MISSING THEMES
Though the script is almost exactly lifted from the Herbert novel and the 1984 movie, key themes are completely left out.For instance, there is no reference to the idea of using sound as a weapon (at least in this Part I). Which as important part of the plot and the source of Paul's emerging power.There are no revelations of the particularly sadistic nature of the Harkonnen (the heart plugs, for instance in the '84 Dune, or their creative, Eraserhead methods of torture), which make them so reviled by the viewer. While we are led to expect some treachery, it is telegraphed and doesn't paint the innate sado/masochims of their culture, just one of the characters.There is no explanation of the class of people called Mentats or their powers, who figure pivotally in the '84 movie.Nor is the sinister political control that the Navigators' Guild has over the Emperor brought up, with their monopoly over the economy and infrastructure of the universe. Or of the importance of that McGuffin, Spice, in the maintenance of that power. It's not mentioned at all even though this was a driving engine of the original.Likewise the equally sinister ""weirding"" influence of the Bene Gesserit over politics is not as stressed as in the '84 movie. Instead, it is used like a prop, as a ""special superpower"" akin to the Jedi's mind-warp techniques. But as Villeneuve has not included those expository scenes of the first Dune showing the influence of the Bene Gesserit in the Imperial court, we aren't aware of that...unless we've seen the first Dune or read the books.None of those important narrative concepts are mentioned, other than as decorations or gimmicks to an otherwise dull script. I guess we're just supposed to think the conflict in this movie is as simplistic as the Star Wars' Evil Empire vs Noble Republic. So this version is shallow of concepts.3. SCALE
This latest film version of Dune (there have been three) has been praised for its scale and imagination, I have to say that if you watch the Lynch and Villeneuve movies back-to-back (if you can stay awake that long), their scale and conception is on the same level. The Sand Worms in this one are almost identical to those in Lynch's, even to the special effects and size. The space ships just as big or bigger in that older one. The battle scenes just as vast. Though size or spectacle should really have nothing to do with substance.4. PRODUCTION DESIGN
The costume and production design in this version feel particularly banal. While Lynch's version is thick with rococo sets and costume design, this one feels like a run-of-the-mill, late-twentieth century sci-fi production; in which the future is all sleek and shiny. There is nothing exotic about it.For instance, while this movie copies Lynch's detail of floating lights that follow people around, the ones in older movie seem like elegant, Renaissance barges, something out a Medici palace; works of art. The ones in this one look like they were picked up at Ikea; Danish Modern. A small detail, but one I think is emblematic of the art direction as a whole, which feels like something you could throw together for your high school production.The interstellar ships in the Lynch version, while just cylinders several miles long, are decorated with strange, almost medieval facades and portals, like moon-sized cathedrals; while those in this one, while still big and cylindrical (tapered, though), are just smooth--you know, like 1950s spaceships are supposed to be. A failure of imagination. This is supposed to be ten-thousand years in the future, not next year's Car Show.5. BIG IDEAS: INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL
An exciting concept in the 1984 version was the visualization of interstellar travel, in which Navigators, humans who live only on Spice and have mutated into giant fetal creatures (anybody remember the baby in Eraserhead?) who ""fold space"", imagining the destination, sucking in the current position, digesting it, and expelling that planet's image out their anuses, so that the whole ship just disappears and then reappears in front of the destination planet, outside of space/time. Surreal is an understatement. That idea of folding space raises the hair on the back of your neck (as most Lynch ideas do). In this version, Villeneuve just has us assume that rapid interstellar travel just happens--you know--off screen. I was surprised in that he himself visualized this idea of folding space/time in his far-more imaginative 2016 Arrival. But in this Dune, he didn't think that was crucial to the plot.And we had to get to the...6. SWORD FIGHTS. REALLY?I know Star Wars fans love the idea of sword fights in the far, far future, but I kept wondering, with this ten-thousand-year-old, universe-spanning civilization, they're still fighting with swords and knives? In Lynch's version, they fight with sound and psychological weapons, and even blasters. But in this one; nope; Get out your swords Atreides! Charge!7. VOICE OVER
One criticism of the Lynch version was the use of voice-over narrative. And one of the praises of this one was that it didn't use that. I know that with certain cineaste pedants, voice-over is as cardinal a sin in screenwriting as an Oxford comma. But in the 1984 movie, it was the voice-overs that set the stage and then invited us into the inner thoughts of the main characters. In this one, there are still voice-overs (it begins with one, in fact, just like the David Lynch version), but they are not used to forward the plot; but to portray telepathy. So what's more of a gimmick? I missed the voice overs. They could have, at least, set up what was happening if you hadn't seen the older movie.8. MISCASTING
Believe it or not. I was prepared to like this new version of Dune. I was actually excited about it. But the main thing that got in the way for me, aside from the slow editing, the unimaginative production design, the abandonment of key themes, was Timothee Chalomet.I know this trending, young movie star has been idolized by so many critics. But he has one take: that pouty, Zoolander-face of a petulant, spoiled teenager. That's his look in every scene. He was like that in that other miscast movie, The King, in which we were supposed to believe that this skinny, sullen kid was the warrior-king, Henry V.I was so distracted by this miscasting in Dune that it popped whatever illusion a fantasy movie was supposed to invoke. Everyone else (Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Mamoa, Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Hynes, Josh Brolin...) was doing a marvelous job. But they all felt like they were acting around Chalomet rather than with him.He is just so irritating.9. THE LOGO

Now, that Dune was not a master piece, but was excellent. If you've had enough of repetitive script lines being copy/pasted all over Hollywood movies, repetitive music/direction/acting, skip this new 2021 version and look at the '80ies version, and the documentary about how it became. The book's great of course if you have time for it, and you should.As for this one, I thought I saw this movie a 1-2 years ago. Then it was named Blade Runner 2049 and Star Wars Something Something.Casting here is okay, except for the role of the Paul. You can't take an unnamed actor and put him/her through connections (nepotism) in the movie. We saw a bunch of ""should have been good"" movies thorn with this, e.g. Any recent Transformers movie.The movie's lacking also the ""mystery""/super-talented people that give their contributions, e.g. Sting in the original Dune, Patrick Stewart, etc. We could call them real-actors. Or at least striking people such as Kyle MacLachlan (great actor also).

He is here to write and direct a commercial and shiny adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. And I'm here to tell you, he has stank it up commercially, he has actually done it and the studio execs will keep making money out of it and lowbrow sequel viewers.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so I decided to read the book. And to this day, it's one of the best stories I've ever read. Perhaps that is why it cannot be a good movie. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal. Of course, Denis 'Blade Runner put you to sleep and this one will put you back to sleep' Villeneuve doesn't care. He has the check cashed and the hype behind him.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after I read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and I didn't enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused. This one is worse!!! It is, in tandem with all Hollywood, inferior as films become more and more cheesy and focus on technology/cinematography/fx instead of story or acting. I mean The Rock??One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. So it leaves you hanging with no conclusion. Bla bla bla talk talk talk no conclusion.From reading the book, I know what comes next, I know how this story ends and this film just goes astray with boring boring boring bad acting for almost 3 hours. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book want entertainment, want a story, want good acting and those are not here..., you obviously feel like you were watching a prologue to something commercial and that is all this is. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the Chinese production companies, Word of mouth and reviews will tell others that this stale film is just a bait and people will stay away. It is just like Ishtar and Blade Runner 2049.But, still, without a conclusion, the studio is hoping they can book future revenue out of suckers (us!).The actors are near perfectly boring and hacks, all carrying their roles like they are checking their royalty statements and that they get paid by the word and the music is electronic fa rting to zip you back awake.I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because I am in a good mood and generous.",Dune

A. so special, yeah the warriors was trained by Duncan and that should have made them better, they fell like rye before the scythe anyways, so nothing special about them.The storyline should been made into 4 movies with more details upon which to create the story, it feels so rushed and so forced to have action upon action that it forgets its telling a major story.All in all, id give this movie a 7, because as a movie it still has value, but as for story of Paul, from original concept, it lacks more.",Dune

No real chemistry between the characters even though the movie is star-studded.The director failed to marry the story with epic fight scenes.The soundtrack sounded amazing but felt like it was all used in the wrong scenes.As for Jason Momoa, it's like the director watched SEE and just said ""Be like Baba Vos if he wasn't blind"".If they don't make the sequels, this movie is very forgettable.Javier Bardem and Stellan Skasgård are the most memorable performers in the movie.Still, it's a watchable movie.",Dune

2497,mortenjp-07072,"Long-winded, pretentious, and strangely empty",1,26 October 2021,"I don't even know where to begin listing the problems with this movie (coming from someone who's usually in favor of Villeneuve's movies):1. Whispered dialogue doesn't make a movie more gripping or ""mysterious"" (looking at you, Rebecca Ferguson).2. Since 'spice' is such a big deal, let's actually SEE what it does and why it's important. One or two voice-overs won't do. Show, don't tell.3. I don't mind dark colors, but this movie uses very (!) dark colors. An effective way of either cutting the costs or disguising the special effects - or both.4. Changing the gender of Dr. Liet is such a ""woke"" move and, obviously, untrue to the book.5. The music is constant and loud, definitely compensating for the lack of plot complexity and many times completely out of place; one of many examples being the grandiose music in the very short scene (with simple dialogue) between Jason Momoa and Dr. Liet.6. Key characters are completely underused. For the most part, we don't get to hear about their motivations and, hence, why we should care about them. Josh Brolin disappears after the first hour.7. Villeneuve's never seemed interested in action scenes, and Dune's no exception. When action scenes do occur, there's a strange disposition. The ""big fight"" where house Atreides falls has only few fight sequences, while the not very exciting plane escape to the desert (Paul and his mom) is too long. The fight sequences are very bland.8. In the last half of the movie, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) seems absolutely numb. He says his lines without much - or any - emotion, making it very hard to believe what he's supposedly going through.9. It resembles the old Dune (1984) suspiciously much. Sure, the effects are ""cooler"". However, the storyline's very similar. Not much original content in the new Dune, and the characters certainly aren't more nuanced or relatable. Quite the contrary.10. Excessive slow-motion clips of Zendaya and others of Paul's ""visions"". Filler, nothing more.11. The ""climax"" isn't really a climax. It's a new part of the story that we get to see right before the voice-over conveniently finishes with: ""It's just the beginning"".It's suspicious that the ratings for this movie are so high. It's an extremely simple plot told in a superficial way, pretending to be complex. An example of what happens when people (even some of the best reviewers) are persuaded by Hollywood marketing to think it's a masterpiece, even though we haven't even seen the sequel yet. Funny and tragic at the same time.",Dune
2498,viktorrasse,Waited a long time for this and it was worth the wait! Will be going back to see it on the big screen again!,10,25 October 2021,"First: Ignore those who said it was slow. I was in a theater tonight without an empty seat, and only one person checked his cellphone a few times during the 2 1/2+ hours. It flew by. For viewers with less stable bladders I would suggest not having liquids a few hours before your showing, because you will not want to miss a second of this amazing film.Second: Despite the big name actors in the film, you quickly forgot who they were before this production. Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista and Javier Bardem became their characters so completely that you didn't have time to think of any of their past work. Notable performances by the young Timothee Chalamet as Paul (who played well beyond his years), Rebecca Ferguson (who played a very different version of Jessica than we saw in the good David Lynch interpretation - much more human and self-doubting) and especiallly Stellan Skarsgard. He made the character so real even with the limited screen time, and much less a caricature than the Baron in the 1984 film. Though he is a legend, you immediately only saw his as the Baron. And the truer-to-the-book Liet Kynes is amazing even with the gender change from the source material.Third: I WILL be watching this repeatedly on HBO now that I have seen it first on the big screen. But I would STRONGLY suggest you all watch it on the biggest screen you can with the best sound you can get the first time. The visuals rival David Lean's classic Lawrence of Arabia.And fourth, for the soundtrack geeks like me: There are very subtle tip-o-the-hats to the 1984 film's Toto soundtrack. The first half of a theme updated and then reworked.The only complaint I would say: The opening credits only too quickly gave the title as ""Dune Part I."" For some reviewers, both amateurs and some ""professionals,"" even though it has been stated numerous times that this part 1 of a multi-movie production, they think the ""ending"" was sudden. It ended at a logical point and would have been awkward any time sooner or later in the story line. This movie is the first installment in a multi=film world. Denis Villenevue has even suggested that he is open to making the two-parter even into a possible trilogy by including some material beyond Frank Herbert's first book.This is the best film I've seen in the last couple years, and I already can't wait to see it again - in two weeks when I could get seats again!",Dune

I think a cross between MadMax and Valerian might be more appropriate. The story is somewhat contrived and over-complicated to manufacture an inevitable ""Good Guys vs bad Guys"" war in Part 2. I haven't read the book(s?) but the end of this movie, Part 1, didn't give any sort of conclusion, even a minor one, so it really feels like you've just stopped watching a film midway through. It doesn't satisfy in any way and doesn't intrigue enough to make you yearn for part 2.The sound and visuals are good, the acting is fine but the plot lacks any originality whatsoever and so the result is lacklustre. It's not awful - I've given it a 6/10. But the current IMDB rating of over 8 seems very high and I think as a larger audience views it, this will inevitably come down. Maybe part 2 will be so good that it's been worth it? I probably would watch it if it is made but fear it might just be more of the same with just a little more action.",Dune

I unilaterally declare that, in our age, there's no one can making this ""unfilmic movie"" brilliant like this, except Denis Villeneuve!However, this movie only get a score lower than 8 point, and even may be lower than Free Guy after few days. And that's the exactly reason why I unloaded Douban and came to here. Also I unconditionally oppose the chain of contempt, but I do think every groups should stay exactly where they should be!

2510,harry-khan-usa,Sad,1,22 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what legendary studio from C hina wanted him to, to write and direct a remake yet again that makes money and has potential for cash-ins. I'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it. It sucks and will attract lowbrow franchise remake lovers everywhere.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game Dune released that year. The story completely captivated me, so I decided to read the book. And to this day, it Is one of the best stories I ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale and filled with details making it really hard to adapt for the big screen even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after I read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and I did nOt enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel and feels shallow and unfocused. Yet, it is better than this remake. Well, there you go. It is a remake.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel because the studio told him we need SEQUELS, PREQUELS, TV SPIN OFF and a 2025 REMAKE (Hollywood cycle of commercialism accelerating). And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to put us to sleep for at least 3 rounds of good REM slumber. But on the flip side, this also means that we need earplugs because the flatulence (a.k.a. Music) is loud and obnoxious.From reading the book, I know what comes next, I know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something boring, which means this is a boring prologue to a boring film. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the Chinese production company (Legendary), so the studio has a special sponsorship deal with this site for shills, fake reviews, ratings and the like because this can only work if part 2 is released to make more dough. It's kind of how they did it with every other movie that Hollywood ships inferior sequels and remakes of.But, still, without a conclusion or story or action or acting or meaning, what a massive blast of revenue this could be for Legendary. I've seen it in IMAX three times already and I am caught up on my sleep on a grand scale. I have had epic dreams in every session because I have great earplugs. And all of this without losing anything because the film is stupid and boring. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend stupidity with commercialism.The actors are near perfectly cast, they are useless and in for commercial hackery like a fat wrestler and so on..This movie does follow the book quite slowly (remember the six sequels), but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, iAny content, morality, philosophy or politics have been removed to make it as bland as possible.But that being said, I have really high hopes for this film as I have bought studio shares through my broker i was one of those people who bought stock hoping for capital gains. I've been waiting to buy a new car and hopefully the stock will go up so go watch this darn boring thing and get some sleep!What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, He has satisfied commercial festivals, this site's marketing quota and given people good rest.One of the many big drawbacks is, as I mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion or meaning or acting, but hey that is Hollywood. Why start now? It's two and a half hours of build-up to something hopefully profitable, but it's still a huge marketing effort to get the hype going
It's most definitively made for the big Quarterly Revenue announcement, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's an accounting tool to be reckoned with, a brilliant bean counter, and one of the best GPs of his generation, even one of the best of all time in helping people visit Mr Sandman.I give this movie a 2 out of 10. We shareholders need part 2, we need it badly so people go watch already. This revenue capitalization deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of my shiny new car with this movie as the template.SAD.",Dune

2521,BeneGesserit-64001,Visual and Auditory Ecstasy,9,25 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve is this decade's most exciting director to come to the Hollywood fray. His knack for visual storytelling, shot composition, color saturation, and framing makes every film he conjures a unique and thrilling sensory experience. Suffice it to say I have seen all of his work and regardless of what he directs, I always purchase day one tickets with the anticipation of bearing witness to something wholly unique and enthralling.Following his daring first entry into blockbuster cinema, Blade Runnner 2049, he now firmly sinks his feet into the notoriously unfilmable Frank Herbert Science Fiction masterpiece, Dune. From David Lynch to Alejandro Jodorowsky, Hollywood has tried it's hand at bringing the pages of Herbert's magnum opus to life with one bitter failure after the next.I can firmly say that Denis Villeneuve has done the impossible, creating an adaptation which not only does justice to the source material's narrative and dense mythology , but truly brings a scope and bredth to it that places most other Blockbuster productions to shame. This is enhanced by Hans Zimmer's celestial like score, which only further exemplifies the otherworldliness conveyed throughout. Nowhere was this more effective for me than Paul Atreude's first encounter with a sand worm, possibly one of the most thrilling and visually awe inspiring sequences put to film, leaving me breathless.What separates this from being an empty visual spectacle of the likes of Terrence Malik is the dense and engaging source material as well as an all star cast bringing these rich and complex characters to life (Rebecca Ferguson is a particular highlight, effectively balancing strength and wisdom with vulnerability and regret). I have read the book and for the most part Villenueve miraculously retains the dense mythology and larger than life themes the book conveys. Every character is given at least one scene to standout and make an impression. Furthermore I personally enjoyed this iteration of Duncan Idaho more so than I did in the book, he was allowed to extol more personality in the film largely due to Jason Momoa's charisma.Why this film receives a 9/10 for me as opposed to a perfect score is that while this is an great adaptation of an otherwise unfilmable book, it is not a perfect adaptation . Most complaints hurled at the film is it's lack of resolution and how the overall legacy of it's relevancy is contingent on the greenlighting of part 2. I share this criticism but also understand that there was no other way to do justice to the source material. However even with part 2 underway, there were several scenes that were cut which, although not compromising Frank Herbert's vision, did leave certain integral scenes slightly lacking. Both Hawat and Dr. Uwe were reduced to plot devices, undercutting the emotional weight of their arcs in the book. Furthermore the lingering anxiety of the Atreides predicament was not felt as strongly here with several of Duke Leto's scenes being cut as well. Scenes where he shows both his political cunning as well as his vulnerability, making his arc all the more poignant.Structurally, adapting the first third of the book would have been ideal as opposed to the first half. This would have allowed for an expansion of the source material, humanizing the ensemble of characters and building to an anxiety inducing finale that would have audiences clamoring back to the theatres for part two. Furthermore it would have given the film a three act structure.As it stands though, with these faults aside, this is an extroardinary adaptation of Dune which, while not fully realizing the depth of it's characters, manages to effectively capture their essence. It is a tour de force in filmmaking which perfectly encapsulates how even with the endless tools and satruation of new technologies at filmmakers disposal, it is still possible to create films that elicit feelings of awe and wonderment.This is Hollywood at it's best, when allowing directors with vision and creative vitality to conjure one of a kind experiences that test our imagination and intelligence. I urge everyone to see it on the biggest possible screen while you still can.",Dune
2522,david-09632,Lynch mob,7,29 October 2021,"This is a handsome movie with a scale that I think makes sense given the material. It does have a little Lawrence of Arabia, and it doesn't attempt to dump any of the Islamic material for political reasons. So much of the visual detail is pleasing and accurate. Quite a few truly awesome touches. There is a tendency towards blandness that does tend to make everything feel worn down however.But I am also a little puzzled as to why it is so close to the David Lynch film. Yes, this is an adaption of the book - but after 40 years you would think there would be a deeper re-imagining. Other than Stilgar (Javier Bardem) who has a nice contrast to stilted court stiffness, there are no interesting characterisations.On reflection, there were plenty of scenes that added little, but were in the Lynch film and were here but felt pointless.

If this were based on a more simple story, as Transformers the movie was to the original cartoon, it would be a different story.So, unlike A Clockwork Orange, book readers will likely be disappointed. Also, unlike The Dark Knight, fans of the original movie will also, likely, be disappointed as this series may reveal less of this complex universe in seven and a half hours than it did in two and a quarter.

First off, I have a love of all things sci-fi; I found the premise to be interesting. However, the execution was a snooze fest. I found myself counting down the time throughout the movie. There were so many unnecessarily slow and useless shots of nothing. I understand when a shot has to set a scene or create suspense but it was way over done in this movie. I notice this is a common trend with Villeneuve's films (especially in blade runner 2029), sad to say I'm not a fan. I will say the trailer was very misleading; there was next to no fight scenes or dialogue in this movie. Instead there was far too much slow-mo of character's expressions and random scenes of no importance. I understand that this is the first movie in a series and setting up the characters and important but you've got to have a plot and this movie was lacking that. The production value was fantastic, it had an insane cast but it wasted their potential. If you enjoy the typical actiony sci-fi you won't enjoy this. I'm hoping the sequel is better.",Dune

2556,dhmoak,Stunning faithful adaption of a novel that helped shape my adolescence,10,30 October 2021,"First, let me explain the shaping. I survived my adolescence because of science fiction. Period. And Dune was part of that. I am thrilled with this adaption; In fact I never saw David Lynch's film because by the time I figured out that it was around it had been panned so universally that I wasn't interested. Are there some flaws - absolutely. But not enough to knock me off the ""10"" rating. The stunning visuals & profound adherence to Herbert's story make it a 10. If I had one complaint, it would be that at least during the first half of the film the acting/characterization seemed subdued. However, this made the moment that Paul turned on Jessica, his fury, all the more impressive. Timothee (spelling??) is an amazing actor. He is an excellent choice to play Paul. And Oscar Isaac rang true as the Duke. Another small criticism (and I emphasize small) is that some dialogue was hard for me to hear (mainly interchanges with Jessica & Paul early in the film). No problem though: it gives me a great excuse to go back & see it again. I can't wait for Part II. Thank you, Denis, well done & I have to say I enjoyed this a lot more than Blade Runner 2049 (in spite of my deep admiration for Ryan Gosling).",Dune

Great lines I anticipate as I have read the books and seen both previous film adaptations, just seem to be spoken more out of rote than out of any real place of feeling. Perhaps it will get better. There are a lot of good actors here, and maybe they will warm to the parts. There are exceptions of good actions, but it seems like the point is to not detract from the beautiful artful look.

2560,strieko,Very little soul in this movie.,4,17 October 2021,"Lets first get a few positives out of the way. Loved the special effects; creative design of clothing, vehicles, buildings, etc. Especially loved the ornithopters! But that's more or less it.Comparing David Lynch's Dune with this is an easy win for Lynch's Dune. But why?First and foremost, movies are stories, and the actors are pivotal in conveying that story. Pretty much all character in Dune have a rich back-stories, and spades of depth and soul. In David Lynch's Dune that soul can be felt in pretty much all the characters. In Villeneuve's Dune, very few characters have that same level of soul. Most notably: Leto, Paul, Jessica, Duncan, Liet, the Baron and Piter. (Feyd, the Emperor, Nefud and Irulan were simply missing in this version.)
The actors that played these parts were either not properly directed, didn't have the required insight in the character. Didn't get the creative freedom. Or for whatever reason they didn't manage to bring their character to life for me.I don't mind if an actor gives his own interpretation, or if the story deviates, but it has to be believable and done with respect the character's core. Stilgar was a good example of this. He was one of the character I did appreciate, even though his story deviates. But you could sense that he understood and inhabited the character. With Stilgar I never doubted whom I was looking at. Unfortunately he was one of the very few characters that managed to impress me so.The storytelling also seemed a lot stronger in Lynch's Dune. I am no expert in how one tells a story on a screen, but it seemed to me that the pivotal points of the story were a lot clearer in Lynch's Dune. There seemed to be more space for acting and story, while oddly he used less time. In Villeneuve's Dune, most interactions felt rushed; character is often conveyed when nothing is said. It's the expressions that communicate what is not said, the inner life, the soul. In Villeneuve's Dune, there is a lot of dialog and action, but there seemed to be very little time for true acting.I don´t quite understand, other movies by Villeneuve like Incendies and Arrival are some of my favorite movies ever. Also liked Blade Runner 2049. They have none of the problems this Dune has.For me Lynch's Dune will remain the true Dune.",Dune

This version is ponderously serious from start to finish and is all the lesser for it.Finally the audio seriously detracts - Villeneuve's trademark foghorns denote serious moments but so many scenes involving whispered or quiet dialogue are barely audible. Overall it takes itself way too seriously and ultimately I found it boring. Give me a Jodorowsky version any day!

Casting couldn't have been more perfect and he was perfect but everyone was underused J. B. spoke 3 maybe 4 times and little screen time, they failed to really show the true Mentor/Pupil relationship. The removal of Feyd and the almost non existent Bautista reducing him to no more than a senseless henchman was the worst part and spoiler what a waste if you're going to kill Jason Mamoa why not have him die fighting Bautista the lack of that fight is unforgivable! Like game of thrones not having the mountain vs the hound. The worst thing though was dumbing down the politics and the SPICE which was really reduced to basically Oil and where was the Guild? A few seconds in the background at the beginning for the most powerful organization in the universe, the only ones who can bend space and control space travel which we never get to see! No mutants! No amazing vfx of space being bent and there were 4 trips but none were shown. The effects were AMAZING! The shields, swords, costumes, ships you name it perfect but really no space travel?

2564,brumpf-1,I mean it's good but also not good,5,23 October 2021,"First off Timothee Chalamet is a subpar actor and it's distracting. Also, having seen Dune 1984, Dune 2000, and Jodorowsky's Dune I can say this one is my least favorite so far. There is a decent amount of exposition and its confusing. I feel like a narration in the beginning that lays everything out would have been better. Also, what are these characters motivations and why should I care bc I don't. Like Duncan and Paul's relationship. We never see any history with them it's just like here they are, they like each other. So later in the film their is no emotional weight to their relationship when it's supposed to have some.The special effects are of course the best part as well as Skarsgard's Baron. Also, why do people remove their masks when a thopter lands. Right when sand blows in their face. Also, the Fremen have coffee!? How? It's been awhile since I've seen the other Dunes and from what I remember is they are all very serious, kinda boring, and not much fun, but this version seems overly serious and almost no fun at all. But then again I like Denis' other films and his aesthetic is perfect for Dune. Honestly I think it's mostly Chalamet. I cannot get over how bad he is at times. And I thought he was really good in Call Me By Your Name. Maybe he just has no range as an actor like Remi Malek. He can only act one way which is basically himself.",Dune

It all feels a bit like a very high value TV Series, but that's actually not a bad thing.

2567,lukas-sumper,A risky experiment gone right.,10,21 September 2021,"I did go into this with holding my expectations to a minimum, saying to myself it could at least be a good arthouse style movie. Well, this was more than that but I want to start with the parts that I disliked.The exposition in the beginning was a bit forced, and was a lot more voice over than showing us unlike LOTR did with its great intro. Also Dennis film making style gave a lot of characters less screen time than what I expected. You basically see a lot of great A-list actors for less than 10 minutes. Which was understandable since he focused his attention on the protagonist.So you could even go so far and call making dune a two part series a necessity and if it gets a sequel the first one will work even better, especially if the second part has flashbacks of exploring some relationships more, which felt lacking in this one.The other reviews praise cinematography and Sound design/ music enough to drive the point home, I was impressed even though you knew who the team was behind this movie.

2573,ScottManJo,"Dune (PART 1): Brilliant Film, Misleading Title",8,19 October 2021,"As an avid fan of Frank Herbert's seminal masterpiece, I've thus far enjoyed all 3 cinematic adaptations of Dune--widely considered one of the most compelling and influential science fiction novels of all time. From the director of Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve revitalizes and revisits, in breathtaking cinematic detail, the epic tale of an intergalactic empire comprised predominantly of two competing families; the benevolent House Atreides and the villainous House Harkonnen. By imperial decree, the two families find themselves locked in a struggle for control over the desert planet Arakis (aka Dune), from which Spice, the most important and profitable substance in the universe is harvested. Greed and treachery have infiltrated and begun to poison the millennia-old Galactic Empire, threatening to ignite an all-out interstellar war over the right to control Dune, and the spice it contains.Over the course of this 2hr & 30min adaptation, however, only about 1/2 to 1/3 of the original story is told. One has to assume that a sequel is already in the works, as this film would prove hopelessly inadequate as a standalone production. Unlike other multi-part film series based on a single book, like Peter Jackson's The Hobbit, Dune's production and advertising teams neglected to mention, in either the title or trailer, that ""Dune"" was in fact ""Dune Part 1."" This will likely catch many viewers by surprise, as I couldn't have been the only who thought this movie would conclude where the author intended it.Aside from this questionable franchise decision, I found this to be an exceptionally well-produced feature film. Although, until I see the sequel, or at least am assured there will be a sequel, I can't say which of the 3 Dune films I prefer. David Lynch's 1984 production will forever remain a classic, while the 3-part made-for-tv version (2000), starring William Hurt and Alec Newman, contains more detail, dialogue, and character development. So, for now I shall wait and reserve absolute judgment.",Dune
2574,jonathan-hawes,"Tedious, plodding and self-important",6,20 October 2021,"It seems that fame and success have transformed Villeneuve into a ""fan"" and less of a groundbreaking filmmaker... which as he's demonstrated on smaller projects in the past, he clearly has the capability to be.""Dune"" is the new sci-fi epic from visionary director Denis Villeneuve. Having enjoyed ""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"" and ""Arrival"" I was really curious and excited as to where Villeneuve's career was going to take him. Sadly, with the release of Bladerunner 2049 (whose muted colour cinematography, bland villain and IKEA set design proved underwhelming to me) I was cautiously optimistic about how ""Dune"" would materialise, having seen the trailer demonstrated the same visual aesthetic. Unfortunately, this was the least of the film's issues for me.Timothee Chalamet does a lot of looking around and shooting pensive looks during the overblown runtime. He mopes around and pouts like a Renaissance statue. It's all very... self-important. I'm just not really into the ""chosen one"" dynamic that 'Paul' proved to be, or maybe it's the fault of the film for not conveying this tired trope in a new way. The ""chosen one"" trope is perfectly fine if the filmmakers and performer can emotionally invest you in 'Paul's character, but I just found his interpretation self-serious, uncharasmatic and ultimately hard to care about.The film tries to inject some comic relief with Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa's character, but because everyone and everything else is taking itself far too seriously, it feels like a drop in the ocean. The humour feel strangely out of place. Rebecca Furguson is another great performer wasted on the project. She seems to just be phoning in the ethereal, catonic performance she delivers in the film. Bardem is great, but Bardem is great in everything. Skarsgard as the villain felt like a hammy parody of Brando's Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. Underwhelming villains seem to be an unfortunate calling card for Villeneuve at this point.Overall, I'm sure fans of the novel will be pleased with the faithfulness to the source material of the novel, but I found myself rather bored during this, despite some awe-inspiring visual set pieces.",Dune

2576,imdb-com-575-205108,Fails at almost everything,2,19 September 2021,"The script and acting are cheesy. The use of voice-over, flashbacks, and simultaneity are both cliche, corny, and poorly executed. The effects, costumes, and interpretations of technology are corny and unconvincing, reminiscent of B-list sci-fi flicks of old. The pacing is way off, and nothing has time to mature. Similarly, the characters as well as the universe are shallowly portrayed, turning fascinating relationships and the sense of something larger in the source material into a bunch of mumbo jumbo and people you don't care about, if you even remember and can distinguish them. The characters you will remember are the antagonists who are portrayed as laughably flat and cliche bad guys, missing any sense of credibility. In general, the movie so often comes off as unintentionally funny on account of its tastelessness, and don't even get me started on the music. Lastly, just as Herbert's amazing world building is lost in the shallow portrayal, many facets of fictional technology important to the plot are either insufficiently or not at all explained, particularly the personal shields, making the story appear holed to the uninitiated.",Dune

A good cast for the most part, but some weak cast for the characters compared to the original movie. I guess some will grow into their roles better in the next movies of this series.Things were missing compared to the original movie in the story line and the story which made it weak too. It was Paul Atreides and his mother that was suppose to teach, not the desert people with desert power.

2580,stefan-healy,Did I watch a different film?,4,25 October 2021,"I cannot fathom how this film has an 8.3 rating. This was by far the most dull, lifeless sci-fi movie I've ever seen. Here are all my issues with it:It took itself far too seriously and had no charm whatsoever.The plot was boring and incoherent.They tried so hard to world build from the start, but it fell so flat. I didn't care or wasn't invested in what they were trying to tell me, because it just felt as if details of the world were being thrown at me rather than actually told through story.The characterisation was awful. I didn't find myself caring about any of them. The only name of a character I can remember is Paul. They spent too much time trying to set up the world and not enough making the characters interesting or in any way charismatic.It was too long, and there was no climax. I was expecting something big and exciting to happen towards the end. It didn't happen.The acting, despite the stellar cast, was bang average. Again the style of the acting comes back to taking things too seriously. Every character was so serious throughout the film, making them so lifeless and dry as characters.The score is really not good. I couldn't believe when I found out it was Hans Zimmer. That yodel/scream that's heard throughout the film was intolerable and so over-the-top-dramatic.The action scenes were underwhelming. This film would have been much better off with a 16 age rating so there could have been more blood and gore in the fights. They felt extraordinarily timid.I could go on. The only positives were the special/visual effects, they were pretty solid throughout. The sound design was good too (not the score).An incredibly underwhelming experience given the hype around this movie. I don't know how people have found this so entertaining.",Dune

But I have an intense feeling that I miss a lot of vital information of this universe. The movie starts to brutal i terms of expecting the viewer already has a lot of background knowledge. There are so much time used on dreams, lingering, scenic portrayal etc. But too little substance. We want to know more about the intergalactic flights (and the importance of spice), intergalactic politics. Who is the emperor? Why and what is the conflict between the houses etc. So few of these important contextual things where established, so much where unsaid.On the other hand. This is a movie for the big screen! And a recommend going to a theater with some high end sound system. I watched this in a iSense-theater and the value of entertainment was 10 points: The pictures, the music, the atmosphere.

The film paints in broad strokes and so you always know where you are, and yet there is enough detail there for the Herbert devotee.Watching this, it's really apparent the degree to which popular fiction owes Herbert a great debt: Game of Thrones, and Star Wars being two later universes heavily indebted to this work.Strongly recommend: in fact, I may go see it for a second time.",Dune

2593,viktorholmang,Wasted opportunity,6,1 November 2021,"The written Dune is a myriad of descriptions, details, connections, character growth, world creation, step by step, word by word. It allows itself to grow inside of the readers' minds.There was not enough time to tell the story when Dune was put on film before, and there is not enough time now. Sorry, better music, special effects, and costumes don't cover the glaring hole of substance.If you make a SciFi movie with a generally known world you don't have to explain everything, place, object, or relation. This move has to do so to push the story forward. Villeneuve decided, like people before him, to tell, tell, tell and tell instead to show!Narrating is slow and overbearing. After a half-hour, you either go insane or want to sleep.There is no reason for it either. If you read the book you don't need constant narration. If you didn't read the book you should be able to enjoy the action, scenery, and characters. You don't need a narrator that pumps ""ancient tung"" in your brain since those do not push the action forward at all.For instance, sandworms are not developed as a term or as a danger in the movie when the crysknife is presented! Because of that, I don't care if the knife is made of wood, steel, or sandworm tooth. You cant add significance to an object just because you said its name in another language or referred to an undeveloped character.You don't need a narrator to explain every single word. Imagine a scene where a talented digital effects crew of this movie presented a sandworm. 10-20 seconds max. Then a scene where the ceremonial knife is presented. A character can say ""crysknife"" or refer to a sandworm as ""Shai-Hulud"". The viewers will get it! They will. They'll remember and then you can use those words later in the movie. No need to narrate. Just show us the knife! We'll connect the dots. We'll add the importance to that knife through the movie and action presented to us.When we finally see a sandworm, it's in a scene where so much of intended character development is crammed. It's the scene where a sandworm attacks a Spice extractor. In just two minutes, Paul and Leto had to grow from characters at the beginning of the movie to those who will meet their destiny on Arrakis. Now, that's a tall order for any director. Why did Villeneuve decide to cram all of this in one scene is a mystery, especially when he had the contract for two lengthy movies.So many great actors. Great casting. So many possibilities. Instead, I watched hours of narrated ""walk and talk"" of characters that come and go, never being more than a couple of words from the annoying narrator. I don't care about any of them. I have no reason to. Villeneuve's choice of presentation made sure It's impossible. Such a waste of an opportunity. I guess that some books are too detailed to be transferred to a movie.Now I'm sure that I won't be alive to see a good adaptation of Dune.",Dune

This is very jarring and pulled me out the movie. It's a very sombre affair with little humour. Jason Momoa feels misplaced as if he's on downtime from aquaman.Every character is taking a back seat to the spectacle, rather than being the heart of the movie.I'm a fan of the book and i really liked the 1984 David Lynch adaptation, despite it's flaws and shortcomings, but this film is a tad hollow.",Dune

It's always interesting, patient and beautifully shot.This is a proper epic and definitely worthy of the big screen. Some of the shots and sounds were clearly designed for cinema viewing.

2604,cwhitehead73,"Horrendous pacing, heavy reliance on visual ambiancy and light on dialog",6,23 October 2021,"I don't hate the movie, you can feel there is a good story hidden under there somewhere. The problem is that story is never really brought to fruition. This is not because there is a second or third part that is out there over the horizon, it is the lack of bringing it to life in the here and now.While there are a combination of things, I believe one of the main problems is just the lack of storytelling itself. This has always been raised as the Achilles heel of Dune in its past incarnations on the big and small screen. Being able to compress the encompassing story into the alotted screentime. Yet here we are again and it seems as if the Director has not learned anything from past mistakes. Instead he's decided to go his on direction and attempt to illustrate the story through a sort of visual ambiance, kinda dreamily extending scenes. While this can work, the Director fails to do this in a manner that visually translates over to a coherent story or finds a way to represent ideas visually to fill in information about the story. It almost feels as if this ambiance is there to fill some artistic prerequisite over actual function. While I do like the style, which seems to be a cornerstone for this Director, it does need to serve a purpose over being part of a list you check off.The heavy reliance on this visual representation, without sticking to just good old dialog, really hurt this movie. Considering the runtime, there was ample time to allow some of these characters to be more fleshed out as well as tieing up some loose ends within the plot itself. The movie still could have easily been multi-part without the drawn out scenes and at same time telling a more complete story. It's a shame.Other little tidbits:
Pros
Visually, the slight darkness and muttled palette seemed to fit the movie.Props and CGI were goodMomoa, Bautista and Brolin fit their parts, but were held back/underutilized.Skarsgard(sp?) did excellent job as Barron, didn't realize it was him at first; also held back.Rest of cast was fine, except 1 which will be listed below.Cons
Audio/Soundtrack really brought nothing special to movie, little emotion. Completely forgetable.Zendaya, ugg did not fit part at all.Runtime for actual content, really bad.Wasn't made obvious this was multipart movie until you're already invested.Horrific ending. Didn't leave hanging, climatic or questioning in any way. Just ended.Lynch's version is far superior in getting an actual story across(regardless if the story is what you wanted it to be).",Dune

If you read the books after watching the mini series, you realize its like 95~98% dialogs from the books.

2613,slavko-desik,Almost a masterpiece!,9,28 October 2021,"There is rarely a sci-fi movie that stops you in your tracks. And this is definitely one of those. I've never read the books, which makes the experience even more exhilarating. The worldbuilding is superb! The story is more of a political saga, and a messianic tale, than hard-core sci-fi, but that makes it even better. Undeniably, they book material is mesmerizing - I've started the first one immediately after watching the movie.But what makes the movie so great?In short, it is a visual piece of art - in cinematography, set and costume design - coupled with powerful and emotional audio.It sets the story well, immersing you into the world of the characters, beginning the fictional narrative in medias res, just as the protagonists are embarking upon their most important mission. Soon enough, you start to care about them, and their placement in the fictional universe is starting to make sense. The pacing feels just right.The casting and acting is superb throughout, and Timothee shines as Paul. Every scene is mesmerizing, every exchange between the characters is rich and captivating. It reminded me of GOT, in the good old days. The fighting scenes are also real, though I feel as if more energy should've been spent on the Harkonnen ambush. GOT comes to mind again, as they've set a standard so high that it makes it almost impossible to enjoy other fight scenes on a grand scale.Why ALMOST a masterpiece?Most of the scenes felt empty, as if the set was staged for few actors to interact between themselves in a world that is otherwise barren. Perhaps this was the goal of the director, but I've felt that it somehow ruins the immersive aspect of the movie. Caladan feels empty - the palace, the landscape outside, the official welcome to the emissary... they all feel lifeless. Arrakis too, feels empty, though it might be the case that we are yet to be introduced to the culture of the desert planet. Interacting with the Fremen feels just as in Paul's dreams - meeting an isolated band of people on an isolated wasteland. Again, this might be an intentional decision, but it somehow feels artificial to me, odd.Anyway, the movie is masterfully made, and it is unrealistic to expect anything better than this, given the complexity of the source material. It is a pleasant experience to enjoy. I've watched it at home, and I'm sill blown away.",Dune
2614,DaRodus,Absolutely Immersive,10,7 October 2021,"I have read the books, the entire Saga, Seen the Lynch Film and the SYFY Series. And this version is a completely different experience.It is a true journey, filmed in a realistic style, to the complex world of DUNE, absolutely immersive experience.The script work is magnificent, coherent, entertaining. It respects the lines drawn in Herbert's book very well. It is striking that it is a movie for an older audience with a very strong anti-war tone, which is a real rarity these days.The stage work is superb. And the special effects are understated.More a low than con its the soundtrack, for me the only thing missing to be up to the task was the soundtrack that compared to TOTO / Eno is far behind. It has no melody and makes it difficult to hum a song. Rather one remembers the screams that present the BENE GESSERIT and the scream that is the theme of the Fremen.It is recommended to see it in cinema, especially IMAX. Since photography is wonderful and is designed for this format.The story is exciting and the casting works very well. It really has been a remarkable and meaningful experience.I think it is a movie that must be seen in 2021.Greetings and have a good trip to Arrakis.",Dune
2615,koen-timmermans82,'Dune' or better yet 'Yawn',6,24 September 2021,"Did Denis Villeneuve peak with 'Arrival'? I was impressed with the art design of Dune. And Timothy and Rebecca did an amazing job. But that's sadly all I can say to praise this movie. It's not a bad movie, it's just not engaging or thrilling. I had a hard time trying to empathise with the protagonist. I was unimpressed with the antagonist and did Josh Brolin fall down a plot hole? Maybe I zoned out for a second there. Anyway, fightscenes left much to be desired. Overall I wouldn't recommend it for it being very long and rather dull. Instead I'll recommend the chronicles of Riddick. Much more entertainment there.",Dune

Thanks to this I didn't enjoy it and missed a lot of it.The acting wasn't too bad but for a big budget movie like this I was expecting more.Visually it is good with decent effects and CGI.At the end of the day I can say I've seen it once but won't bother trying to watch it again.",Dune
2617,ciroque,So... slow...,3,4 November 2021,"I have two main problems with this movie:1. Far... too... many... slow... oh... so... slow... excrutiatingly slow... wide... pans... of... landscape.The imagery was quite beautiful, but it felt like nearly a third of this film was prolonged establishing shots with low and slow -- they keep going on and on in one incredibly long unbroken motion moving from frame to frame so that there was no place to interrupt it; it was really quite boring -- pannning.Then, don't get me started on the sheer amount of slo-mo shots to let you have excessive amounts of time to ponder what the characters just did.There's so much content to cover that would have been a better use of time than all this overt cinematography.2. The sound.Zimmerman is an amazing composer full stop. The problem was in the mix. The director chose to have so much dialog whispered -- another thing that drove me up the wall -- and then buried it under the sweeping pads from the soundtrack. I almost yelled out: ""SPEAK UP!! THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK CAN'T HEAR YOU!"".These whispered lines were crucial to the plot I imagine, but I have no idea if they added value or not since I could not hear them over the music.There was a lot to like, though. The acting was good. The directing was good -- until they hit post at least. The imagery was nice.BUT THE WORMS, LIKE THE DIALOG, WERE SHROUDED IN DARKNESS so there was not much of a awe factor to it (other than ""awwww, I wish I could see the fine work of the CG crew"").I will be in no hurry to see the second movie.",Dune

2619,rjcella,Meh,3,6 November 2021,"In all honesty I have to say this movie was very disappointing. I like sci-fi and I like epic movies and I'm usually the person in my friend group that doesn't mind a slower plot and a slow burn build and get into the depth of characters and things like that... But this movie just did not grab me at all. The best part of the movie for me is that there was a lot of very cool epic visuals, and you had the sense that it was trying to tell this epic story line... And I don't know, maybe if I had read the books prior to seeing this movie it would've filled in some of the blanks and I would've absolutely loved it, but I didn't. I found myself checking my watch. Numerous times I was irritated by the sound effects in the background drowning out the character dialogue. There were aspects that weren't really explained like what is this special voice that makes other people do what they want? What's the origin of that? I mean I speak to my dog in a special voice and he doesn't do what I want. I absolutely loved Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Star Wars (at least the first three) and expected to be pulled into the story and characters like I was in those movies/shows but I wasn't. Nobody character was jumped out at me. None of the plot and storyline drew me in and captured my attention. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen and for the movie to get some momentum but it never did for me. It kind of felt like when I watched the fourth Star Wars movie that came out... There was all this epic hype and I just felt like the whole movie was summed up with one word, ""Meh"". Maybe if I watched it again it might resonate better but I don't want to spend another 2 1/2 hours of my life on some thing I didn't enjoy. I doubt I'll see the second part...",Dune

The acting was fantastic, with a beautifully made visual experience, but at times I found it was difficult to understand the dialogue because the audio went from almost a whisper to a roar of the effects, so I found myself having to focus a bit too much to follow. It also almost took 2/3 of the movie before it ""picked up"", so it's clear this is just the first in a series we will have to wait on the truly understand the story arch. I'll definitely be going back to earlier versions to understand.",Dune

Before two hours of film I already wanted to advance the scenes.

2625,drexl10,"Lovely visuals, less vision.",6,23 September 2021,"I went to the movie hoping for a well crafted and epic narrative set in a sci fi environment. Reason being that´s what you hear about the book.Visuals and sound is good. Perhaps the sound is overbearing, but I liked the percussions setting a good tone. As for the design I wish they could escape the plastic casing and shawls you always get in sci fi. It all feels like home made masquerade costume. Interior decoration is apparently something unchic in the future too, but high ceilings in. All huge rock walls.Unfortunately was the expression a mixture of bland story with the usual tired storyteller features like-There´s a Galactic Imperium who is held together by the access to the McGuffin (aka Spice). Huge tension. Sure. And immediately raises a number of awkward questions like how did it evolve if travel is so dependent on the McGuffin? This overreach to make everything seem on edge is so tiresome. Notice Stephen King who manages to create massive tension writing about backwater towns.-It´s sci fi...with swords. Next McGuffin is the ""shields"" everyone uses and supposedly stops ""fast"" stuff approaching. Thus we get a reason to depict all sorts of heroic melee and weapon masters in action etc. Much cooler right? Yet somehow ships are blown up by rockets and some laser cuts through rock like butter? If you want to plant hth into sci fi do it more clever. See Star Wars.The Boy who Shall be king. The greatness of LoTR is that Frodo is just a guy who wants things to stay as they were and is trying to do something about it. Other people see he is well disposed to handle the trials, yet he just goes home afterwards. Messia figures are by necessity bland in comparison and this depiction is the typical one with very little intelligible reason for the viewer to invest in. It´s a just a scrawny teenager who is psychically gifted, having inexplicable visions or staring of into the vista. Or beating up gangs when needed.-Speaking of gangs. As per normal the ""western"" dudes are empathic, but the ""others"" have shallow respect for human life. At the drop of a hat there´s a leadership struggle among the Fremen (Bedouins) and it obviously have to be resolved by a duel to the death. Incidentally the Boy Messia gets a nice moment to show his superiority. It gets cringy when the ""tribesmen"" eggs him on to kill their mate (the best fighter of course to make Boy shine more and get on top of the tribal ladder) and just shrugs when it´s done.Zooming out a bit the whole thing is a long prequel. It´s all ""soon it´ll happen"" and ""greatness will come"" etc. It just doesn´t in this movie. I ended up feeling cheated on the story and unfortunately not with much appetite for more.",Dune
2626,alantarocinski,Would rather suffer through Dawn of Justice than watch this movie again,4,25 October 2021,"These are two hours of my life that I'm never getting back. This movie is stunning visually, but lacks so much of the story part. There are many plot holes, you are left with more questions than when walking into the cinema. The only part of the movie that I liked was the ending, not because the movie was finished, but because it's the only part worth watching. Last 10 minutes of the movie are literally the only exiting part.Just seeing ""part one"" told me this movie was going to be a waste of time.Although being dull, I have to give props to the choreographer for all the 1:1 fighting scenes, which were done perfectly keeping you in suspense.Overall not a movie I would recommend, and definitely a movie I'm not watching again.",Dune

This movie has none of that, very few mistakes.The best thing about this movie is that the director Nolan absolutely loves the source book -- and that really shows. Yes, they leave out some details from the book, but I'm fine, that can clutter a movie -- and this movie spends a lot of time (maybe too much) uncluttered.The kid, Paul Atreides, actually grows into the role as the movie progresses, and ends up a commanding presence. The mom is great as well -- suitably intense and bad-ass.The fight scenes are sort of well done example of the standard these days -- with all the superheroes we've seen a lot of them.The vehicles are fantastically done, very big and interesting -- dragonfly hover copters, totally cool, well done and believable.Baron Harkonen -- maybe they will develop him more in the next show but I thought he was a litte underdone, like he's way more evil than they showed -- but otherwise he'll do.Got no time for Dave Bautista, don't feel he' s much of an actor -- but just a small part hereDuke Atreides admirable job by the actor.The love interest Fremen girl? You see way too much of her with no explanation of why she is being shown. And she looks like a Disney pop queen. Anyway..When a movie is made about a great book, I hold my breath because if the movie is horrible (The Hobbit), then there won't be another movie made for 20 years and we missed a great chance.

So im glad that its 2 hr 20min long and i am looking forward for second part . I have watched it two times and there is not a single scene in the movie that i thought shouldn't be there , rather i wanted to see more of the world of astredies and how it is. The acting is just top notch and cahlamat guy is a superb actor.The screenplay is so well written that i felt all the emotions and importace of every scene in the movie.The visuals were great and beautiful to look.The emotions of characters were perfect.The fight scenes is where its lacking ,fights were okayish not that great . I wanted them to be like raid and john wick. 😅Overall i really loved this movie and wanted to watch more, i didn't wanted it to end 😭Also i feel like imdb should let us see reviewers profiles to see what they liked and didn't, so that we can judge for ourselves which review to be consider before watching the movie, till then I'm sticking to rt critics reviews to filter my selections.",Dune

2634,htnorris-618-165492,"Doesn't do the novel justice, but no one has",6,2 November 2021,"OK.A. Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" is one of my all time favorite books. I have read the entire series and ""Dune"" multiple times.B. I have both the David Lynch 1984 movie and the 2000 mini-series on DVD.Here are my observations:Casting
Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides - Artfully tousled hair does not Emperor Paul Muad Dib make. Just too wimpy.Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica - a weak choice with nowhere near the regal beauty, intellect, or grace as described in the novel.Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides - surprisingly good, the best Leto yet.Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho - a surprisingly excellent choice. A wonderfully natural performance.Josh Brolin as Guerney Halleck - another excellent choice, but where is his balliset and timely quotations?Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam - a short shrouded appearance, but wonderful.Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Liet-Kines - horrible, horrible choice. The worst bit of casting in the movie. A young woman just doesn't convey the gravitas of the Imperial Planetoligist.Stephen McKinley Henderson as Thufir Hawat - Poor casting. This pudgy doughboy is not a Mentat assassin.Zendaya as Chani - while not ""elfin"" as described in the novel, a superb portrayal. ""Tell me of the waters of your homeworld, Usul."" How did that line get dropped?Chang Chen as Dr Wellington Yueh - very good, the best Doctor yet.Stellan Skarsgård as the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen - Skarsgard has excellent but too brief scenes.Javier Bardem as Stilgar - very good, but a little over the top. Bardem just can't help himself.Golda Rosheuvel as Shadout Mapes - minimized and best portrayed by Linda Hunt. How do you drop the line ""Killed an old duke, did you?"" .Josh Brolin as Guerney Halleck - another excellent choice, but where is his balliset and timely quotations?Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam - a short shrouded appearance, but vey good.Dave Bautista as Rabban aka ""Beast"" - sufficiently nasty, but too little scene time.David Dastmalchian as Piter de Vries - I just totally missed it. When was he on screen?Where is Feyd Rautha?Where is Princess Irulan?Where is the Count and Lady Fenring?Where is the Padishah Emperor?Plot
Where is the dinner scene in Arakeen?Where are the smugglers?Total lack of reference to the Bene Gesserit Missionaria Protectiva in preparing Dune.Where is the Duke's troops being sealed in caves with artillery?The fight between Paul and Jamis occurred in the Sietch, not in the desert.Only 2 troopers captured Paul and Jessica. One is deaf? Never happened. Jessica uses The Voice and seduction to make them fight over her.One blip reference to the Spacing Guild and the Navigators? That's it?Other

This is an adaptation of the book from someone who's understanding of Dune is beyond ""just another book"". One cannot read Dune and not feel that the mind has expanded.The actor who performs Paul is THE person for the role. Great actors, wonderful performances.Regarding some characters: Lady Jessica is too ""weak"", a mother and not Bene Gesserit!

2642,introspect451,Finally! A film worthy of the title.,10,26 October 2021,"I have been a fan of the original 6-book Dune series since high school. I loved it so much that I hosted one of the biggest Dune fansites back in the early days of the internet. Although I enjoyed Lynch's film as a kid, it slowly lost its appeal as I read further into the books. When the Sci-Fi channel released its mini-series in 2001, I was still unimpressed, though mildly content with how it followed the original novel more faithfully.Dune: Part One (2021) blew me away when I watched it in 3D in the theatre today. The music and general ambiance were awe-inspiring and alien, befitting such a grand tale of the far-off future. Anyone who's read and loved the books will genuinely appreciate what the cast and crew have done. Even newcomers should thoroughly enjoy the first step along this epic adventure. It starts a little slow and dense like the book, but the impressive alien atmosphere should wow everyone to silence and draw them into this immense world.Again, the story is dense -- as was Herbert's original novel. So many factions, characters, technology, and terminology flood the story early on. The writers wisely whittled this down, avoiding many of the pitfalls of Lynch's Dune from 1984. Some things are omitted or changed, but for once, it was in the spirit of the original book, and I had no qualms with their decisions. In truth, books and movies are two completely different media, and adaptations require changes. That's why they're called ""adaptations."" But in all, little was changed, which pleased me greatly.Most importantly, I can tell that this series will include some of Herbert's insightful philosophy. The writers sprinkled in a few quotes throughout the film, not just those popularized by Lynch's version. There is attention to ecology, politics, and even a hint that this story will focus on the ""myth of the messiah"" (as Herbert intended) instead of glorifying blind faith and fallible leaders as Lynch's version did.As reviews found online have pointed out, the story has become increasingly relevant to today's global concerns: exploitation of indigenous people and their resources, climate change, and two-faced politics.I strongly recommend this film (as well as the original books) to everyone. I can only hope that they continue making these films, especially for the later books. If so, then The Golden Path awaits...",Dune

a triumph of execution regarding major characters and peoples,
paced how good classic science fiction is (see: Blade Runner, Alien),
and the attention and care handling each and every scene is incredible.Casting was superbe.Acting was brilliant.Score is exceptional (most of the time the music by Hans Zimmer is so much a part of the emotion and overall tone you can forget there is music happening; a mark of a great film score).My only negative takeaway is the abrupt ending. But even this will not register once the sequel is released (i heard the studio green lit the sequel today!).I will be seeing this at least two more times in the next couple weeks.Finally a great movie is made and released... seems like hollywood in the last decade has lowered its standards so much that Dune comes as a welcome open door to the great wide world of fresh air and excellence.I highly recommend Dune.",Dune

2645,jonnyal21,Amazing!!!! BUT not for everyone...,10,25 October 2021,"First off,
Let me start by saying I'm a huge Sci-fi fanatic and when I heard Denis was following up with this film after his much anticipated sequel to Blade Runner, I got excited! He knows the genre well. It became immediately clear that he knew the source content as well, there is a lot of thought out into every scene and every minor detail, in addition to the incredible score by Hans Zimmer! Although, I think we would've benefited more with an R rating, which could've been used to showcase more of the Harkonnen's brutality, it gave us a good foundation of the world and it's characters! Tim Chalamet as Paul was a great decision, he conveys the pressure of having to fit the mold of Duke and Muad'dib.Now, having said that, this film is VERY SLOW! There is lots of dialogue and information being thrown at you. If you are not engaged in the story and only came to see battles, explosions, and fight scenes, you will be disappointed! Better if you wait on that in part 2!Overall, exceptional film and I cannot wait for part 2!!!",Dune

Beautiful story telling, stunning visuals, and a nice pace on the action. The actors do a great job of creating the illusion of reality, so that you get lost in it. So good, it made me want to go re-read the books again, so good, I want to watch this movie again, just because they have done such a great job.The only problem is now, it left me wanting more.

2648,PrateekPrithvi,The Movie Is a Visual Masterpiece,7,5 November 2021,"I've been a fan of Denis Villeneuve since his first film, and have been looking forward to Dune for a long time. The movie is a visual masterpiece and the acting performances were very well done. Visually then ""Dune"" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then ""Dune"" doesn't disappoint. While ""Dune"" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of 'was this really a necessary remake?' once the movie ended. If you have the chance to watch ""Dune"", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie. (My rating of ""Dune"" 7 out of 10 stars)",Dune

Some good special-effects, but also some shortcuts in some of the bigger vehicles. All in all 2 1/2 hours I will never get back. If you gonna see it, see it on the big screen, I would never have seen it at home in a million years. I have heard many negative things about the previous Dune films, and the person said this was good in comparison. I think it says alot, when I haven't seen any of them and thought this was bland and too long dragged.",Dune

2654,TheDeadEndKid69,"WOW, Truly Great Storytelling & Technical Brilliance!",10,23 October 2021,"After this film, the entire original Star Wars trilogy looks like nothing but a terrible children's series that stole most of it's story from Herbert's Classic Sci-Fi novel, Dune. Truly, the guy's family should sue George and Disney and any of the other punks involved in the all out thievery. The Herbert family deserves a ton of that Star Wars money for sure, perhaps even most of it! This is very much like Star Wars, only much better and too complex for kids. Some older kids and teens may really get into it, but this film feels very adult. It's very mature in it's delivery, amazingly immersive and the layered complexity of the story is awe inspiring and jaw-droppingly all at the same time. Even The Lord Of The Rings films feel like nothing but silly and overly long children's films by comparison. All I can say is that I cannot wait for the second half, because this first half is nothing short of a masterpiece. Cut the check for part 2 right now!!! Really I kept saying to myself while watching this, wow, this is what Star Wars always wished it was, not that the Star Wars people care of course, they stole Herbert's paychecks over and over again!I'm calling this a 9 and a half out of 10, though I'm not so sure it could have been any better than it is. I just prefer to be mean. As Jesus once told his drunk followers, nothing is perfect but God alone or something to that effect. I'm God, now wash and kiss my feet. I feel the same. This is my review, so I'm the God here. No 10 out of 10's! As far as I'm concerned anyone who gives out a 10 out of 10 full rating to anything is a fool. How did this review start so serious, and then end with a bunch of silliness? Life is crazy baby! Iggy Pop said that.",Dune

Lol maybe not that bad, but they tried to make every up close scene so sappy It got old quick. It was hard to follow for so long I don't get all the rave reviews.

2657,lordnich,Show vs tell,4,17 October 2021,I don't understand who this movie was made for. People that are unfamiliar with the books will surely be confused about everything going on. People that are familiar with the books will notice all the things they left out. When it tries to show you what is going on its showing nothing relevant. Then when it tried to tell you it just simply tells you either what is happening or has happened on screen. It barely scratches the service of Dune lore. The characters are also just a paper thin synopsis of who they actually are. The art department on this movie did an amazing job. So good it seems they just let them make the whole movie with a 30 minute script. The made for TV mini series was better then this. The best thing I can say about this movie is it shows us that it needs to be a TV series and not a movie.,Dune

2663,daniel-a-1998,A Review For The Readers Of The Original Story,10,18 September 2021,"After a long wait - when the film was actually supposed to premiere in October last year - Dune hit cinemas in Sweden during the week. I just refreshed my memory of the original story when I finished reading the book a second time before the cinema visit.Taking on a story with as much weight and the scale that Dune has is no easy task. But with what the Canadian director already has in his luggage, Denis Villeneuve seemed to be the most suitable man for the job when he took on the project a few years ago. With the results in hand, Dune is absolutely massive and an almost unbeatable cinematic experience when it comes to the pure scale of the picture. The trust in Villeneuve has paid off.The scenes are epic and magnificent and the soundscape is huge. Hans Zimmer, who composed the music and constructed the sound, has polished his creation so that the bass tones make every single bone in the body vibrate. It is noticeable that he is a big fan of the book since he has worked beyond the ordinary with this project. Zimmer combines heavy drums and bass lines in all frequencies with almost religious voices to create something unique. When ships fly past the camera, it is difficult not to get goosebumps.Timothée Chalamet is in my opinion one of the best actors of my generation. I already know that he can act but Dune is proof that he can shoulder the greatest of roles with bravura. The entire cast is right for their roles. Stellan Skarsgård as the evil baron is a great antagonist and the mother Jessica's emotional bond with her son is beautifully portrayed by the Swede Rebecca Ferguson.Dune does not follow traditional film structure but is quite similar to the book. I think the film will appeal to the fans of the book more than the usual cinema visitors as the exposition at the beginning of the film is fast-paced and the story is complex and often throws itself with terminology that many people may not have heard before. The film also does not leave much time to breathe for the viewer to digest what happened as all the scenes are eventful and important for the story. If you take a toilet break, there is a great risk that you have lost yourself in the story when you return.With gorgeous design and many practical effects, Dune is visualized how I experienced it in my head when I read the book - and not many book-based films succeed with this. The atmosphere is deep and grabs you easily. I think it was very helpful that they filmed on location in the desert in Jordan because the heat and thirst really gets to you. Beautiful environments and great detail - what more could you want? Dune is a very good film adaptation of a very good book.",Dune
2664,vtgolfeagle,Best Movie Ever!,10,23 October 2021,"I don't say this lightly....this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The visuals, the music, the story, absolutely incredible! They better make a part 2, because I can't handle not finishing this epic story.",Dune
2665,cleusimyrita13,What have I just watched?,5,3 November 2021,"Let me start by saying I never read the book nor watched the first movie adaptation.This movie was slow and tedious. I spent the entire film waiting for something to happen until the credits, and I couldn't believe it when it finished. Nothing happened. Absolutely, nothing. I don't even know what have I just seen. After the end, googling about the movie, I found out it was only part 1. The only good thing about this movie was the CGI. There was no story nor character development. Basically, there were ""normal"" people (House Atreids) that had a hostile relationship with ""deep blue eyes"" people (Fremen), there were the evil guys (House Harkonnen) just because of their appearance, and there was a much bigger enemy - a giant sandworm in the middle of the desert for no reason, even though one of the characters explained it, but I cannot remember.Each character's dialogue was poor; they barely said anything and were almost inaudible, making it even harder to understand, even with subtitles. Each character's personality was very shallow, preventing the viewer from empathising with them and adding up a couple of unnecessary character's that just existed to die, like Jason Momoa's character. I couldn't care less about any of them, whether they died or lived. I was surprised they could tell apart their crew from the enemy's in the fighting scenes because the suits were almost identical.Describe this movie in one word: empty
The most memorable thing in this movie: the desert.I wonder if all the hype and great reviews were because of the CGI and the cast.This whole movie could be condensed into 50 mins or less for an episode of a tv show.I am glad I didn't waste my money in the cinema, because it wasn't worth wasting my time streaming it. I was not too fond of the movie nor hated it. I had no feelings whatsoever. Thus the 5/10.",Dune

This movie was specifically made to follow the book as closely as possible, and has been promoted as such. Don't expect too much of this movie if you haven't read any of the books. Personally having read EVERY Dune book out there, there are some interesting parts in this adaptation that are not in the original trilogy but ARE in other Dune books. And don't forget, we only got about 2/5 of the story in this first film, meaning the second film is going to absolutely destroy! It's beautifully done, and very intricate to say the least. The nuances in this film that stem from the books are what really make it so powerful. Make sure to watch it in IMAX, as that's the ratio in which it was filmed. Happy viewing!",Dune

And she hates the Apple TV+ Foundation series and isn't interested in The Expanse or anything easier to get into . They took one of the most complex and deep sci-fi stories of all time, one that just drops you into the middle of this complex world without any context, and not only kept most of the complexity and depth and world building, but did so in a way that everything just makes sense. The way they introduce you to all of these concepts, like the shields and fighting style and then build and build and build without exposition is amazing. Many movies fail to give their CGI sets weight and this movie made every single set piece feel like it was done without CGI. The thopters felt like real equipment. The lasguns felt deadly. The fighting styles matched the rules of combat that were laid out. Nobody felt safe. Everyone felt important. Nothing was wasted. This movie was a masterclass in cinematic ""show, don't tell."" My girlfriend came in blind to this, and left understanding the setup for the 2nd film to come in 3 years, the politics, the relationships, the danger, the rules of this universe. She left wanting more. Disappointed that the sequel won't be for several more years. And the acting of everyone involved was fantastic. I see many many academy awards.

2695,nikolay-45680,Finally both a coherent and high budget Dune adaptation,7,17 October 2021,"I must say I had a lot of doubts about this movie. Dune is an amazing book, but it has its own terminology which would lead to some heavy- handed exposition in a movie. This was handled surprisingly well in the movie.I also had doubts over the casting as I hadn't seen Timothée Chalamet or Zendaya before. However, I must say Chalamet is absolutely amazing as Paul. Chani only shows up towards the end of the movie, but so far so good. Stellan Skarsgard was great as always and I can't wait to see more of Javier Bardem. I just wish there were more scenes with Leto and Jessica alone as I wasn't entirely convinced of the chemistry between them.As far as the visuals go I love the sets and costumes with the exception of Thufir Hawat who for some reason is LARPing as a Soviet era commissar. The music is a bit droning at times, but I think it suits the visuals nicely. There was throat singing for some reason, but I liked it.Now on to the negative. I'm afraid I'm just not a fan of Villeneuve's style. Will someone please teach this man how to use spotlights? Seriously- what is the point of paying amazing actors millions of dollars only to have their faces concealed in shadow for half the movie? This is not a rhetorical question, I would genuinely like to now. Why not just get less famous actors if their faces are going to be in shadow anyway? Movies have been too dark for the last 10- 15 years. And no, I don't mean thematically dark I mean literally too dark to watch even at night. If you want to make a thematically dark movie use your actors, costumes, sets and music to do that. Don't just decrease the brightness and think you're being artsy.And what is this trend with movies being almost black and white? Why suck all the colour out? What's the point of advancing camera, projector and screen technology if movies these days look worse then they did in the '90s? Sorry, but I'm just not convinced of the blistering heat of the desert when everything is just shades of grey. A Dune movie needs way more red. What is curious is Paul's dreams/ visions have the right colour pallet with rich red, but the bulk of the movie doesn't and it just looks like it's taking place on a cool, cloudy day in Egypt and not on a hot, alien planet. I suppose you must be thinking ""Well, just increase the color and brightness on your screen"" and sure I can always do that and it does help to an extent. But when a movie is shot badly no amount of TV settings can fix it.Also minus points for shying away from the word ""jihad"" and Jessica and not asking the reverend mother to protect her husband. Somehow it's always okay to mock and accuse christianity, but never islam.On the whole I found the movie enjoyable and I'm glad to finally see a coherent Dune adaption which is also high budget and has decent visual effects. I do hope they make the sequel if only to finish the first book. I also hope Villeneuve learns to light his movies better and not have scenes with people just walking for minutes on end like in Blade Runner. But I'm not holding out my breath for this one.",Dune

But the mire annoying part was the mispronunciation of Harkonnen and that plot was revealed too early on.

As a nerd who loves the Syfy and Fantasy genres, I still can't believe we are so lucky to have someone of his caliber now directing films such as Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, and Dune! I highly recommend watching Vanity Fair's 20-minute video where Denis Villeneuve breaks down the Gom Jabbar Scene if you haven't already. His intentionality and genius in his craft is palpable.The movie itself was a new cinematic experience for me. The film was so well crafted, the actors so well performed, the set-designs/special-effects were so impeccable that it didn't really -feel- like a Syfy to me anymore. Instead, it felt like I was watching an excellent drama/thriller that was filmed in a different world and culture.I think every Syfy drama will have to learn from what Denis Villeneuve has done in this film.See this movie on the best screen/sound system possible!",Dune

Still not having an end for the story left me somewhat dissatisfied. But i also won't put a final rating on this movie until i have seen the second part.The casting was excellent, I had no problem believing any of the cast actors in their roles, especially T. Chalomet looks much more reasonable in age for Paul than both previous attempts. Similarly Rebecca Ferguson feels better realized as lady Jessica. Skarsgard is sufficiently menacing as Baron, despite being capable of flight.We get a tiny bit more character work out if Duncan Idaho and Guerny Halleck, regrettably mentats are largely ignored.The visuals are beautiful and stunning, the sound balance uneven, with too loud music.There are things I did miss, the political dimension of the story is severly underplayed, the Padisha Emperor is entirely missing from this movie, so is his entire family, and Feyd Rautha. Also having the importance of spice and Arrakis more stressed would have been important, but perhaps I'm just sore that there is no beautiful introduction by Irulan.Overall I believe once the second part is out, this will make a beautiful adaptation, but right now it's incomplete and shows it.",Dune

2713,Hayder_99,I never doubted Mr. Villeneuve.,10,23 September 2021,"I was lucky to watch the film today as it premiers in my country.After many attempts, it seems that we finally got the film that this great novel deserves.Denis Villeneuve, who grew up with the novel during his adolescence and refined his directing style with it, makes this not at all surprising.The film didn't fall into the rushing trap that brought down David Lynch's 1984 bid, and it wasn't as slow and monotonous as Blade Runner 2049 where Villeneuve learned his lesson this time.Villeneuve put all his passion and fondness into this project, and the adaptation was faithful and fair to the novel, and it is well aquainted with the messages and ideas it contains that have always strived for other works until Denis decided to create a cinematic legacy for it that bodes much good.The casting was wise in both its accuracy and even when deciding to take liberty (Leit Kaynes sex change). Most notable was Rebecca Ferguson, who embodied the role of a tender mother, a fearful wife, and a strong-willed woman at the same time. Next comes the brilliant young actor Timothée Chalamet in the main role, where he did not fail to impress in all his scenes. Zendaya had a presence and attraction despite her lack of appearance and was distinguished for her role, which will expand greatly in the second part. And let's not forget Stellan Skrsgard, who showed the evil baron in the best of horror, wit and absolute tyranny.The cinematography and the visuall effects were great and showed the wide world in a breathtaking splendour with the diversity of the many scenes of the film from the vast greenery to the arid desert.Finally, Hans Zimmer's music was the best thing in the movie and it overwhelmed all the scenes without exception, even in the moments when it chooses to be silent. It hits you from all sides and doesn't give you breathing space during the high action scenes. The Baron would not have been terrifying had it not been for the music that accompanied him, nor the giant sandworm could ever dream of having majesty and sanctity, had it not been for the music, nor the desert hot and desolate, had it not been for its music. If the film had luck in the awards season, the first to do justice to it is the living legend, Hans Zimmer.",Dune

I have never read Dune or watched the Lynch version, but I like Denis because I feel he merges the quality and taste of high brow art film and the entertainment value of blockbuster movies. And this definitely excelled in that regard.POSITIVES
-The atmosphere and world building in this movie is absolutely amazing and captivating (cultures, costumes, technology, lore etc).-Its Denis... it's extremely solid and quality in almost all regards. He didn't drop the ball.NEGATIVES
-The movie fits these tributes to the book (or things you would only understand if you know dune), such as the ""fear is the mind killer"" monologue. But these dialogue bits are thrown in there at random times and the characters are like muttering the words incoherently. I felt these bits of dialogue could not have been included at all at no downside... or not be put in in dramatic scenes where there is loud action and you can barely hear or understand the monologues.-Some things in the movie feel fairly cringey to me personally like ""the voice power""... But in this case I chalk it up to things like this coming across differently in books and hard to translate to anything outside your imagination.-I feel they could have cut the amount of dream sequences in half at no cost. (they entire theatrical trailer ends up being most made up of all dream sequences)-I REALLY, REALLY wish there were more scenes on the home world of the Harkonen and the Sarduakar army... For me, these scenes were extremely dark, gritty, and absolutely captivating, True sci fi/occult world building excellence. This was my absolute favorite element of the movie.. Unfortunately they are very short scenes and there are very few in the movie. I wish I got more to enjoy.",Dune

Dune 2021 is not even visually impressive, its looks like a generic action move set in the desert.With such a long running time, you'd think there's more than enough time to create interesting characters that the audience cares about... but this film barely gives any characterization to any of the major players.The characters have little personality, making them seem dull and uninteresting. Josh Brolin plays his character the same way he plays every tough guy... the Baron, possibly the most interesting character gets barely any screen time, Rabban is given few lines, and the Suk doctor appears to be played by a robot. Where was Feyd, where was Edric? No spacing guild?Lynch's version is no masterpiece, but it has style and substance, creates interesting characters and memorable music that really sets the tone. Dune 2021 possesses none of that, it's just dull and plays it too safe be what it should be.Dune has rich source material, that Villenuve wanted to use to make his own Stars Wars, well all he managed to do is make even the star wars prequels seem entertaining.

Stellan Skarsgard's Baron Harkonen channels Brando's Colonel Kurtz quite well. Special effects. Top notch. Music, properly grandiose.You know what can't be said about DUNE PART 1?That it's any fun. Or that it's entertaining.Timothy Chalemet has zero charisma and zero chemistry with Zendaya. I still don't get why he's such a big star at the moment. Maybe it's just me...Some don't recall David Lynch's 1984 version with the fondness it deserves. And while a bit jumbled at times. Somewhat hard to understand at others. During its original theatrical run a glossary page was handed to movie goers before each screening. (Wish o had one of those!)But it was tight. It was weird and wonderful in a way that the new version fails to be. Lynch took roughly the same amount of time to give us an adaptation of the whole novel. And it was an entertaining and engrossing cinematic ride.By stretching the source material to two films, it creates boredom where there should be excitement. Scenes go on and on, when they clearly don't need to. I found myself expecting the credits to roll for the last twenty-five minutes or so of Villeneuve's film. And when Chani finally gave the (incredibly predictable) last line of the film, I breathed a sigh of relief.I'm gonna go watch Lynch's version now.That is all.-SmokeyKorzeniowski.",Dune

Visual- and Sounddesign are breathtaking.Yet if you are personwho requires max clarifaction of the context in order to enjoy what you witness, you might be disappointed.That is because Dune plays in a Universe, in which technology (i.e. AI / Machine Learning) has been ""overcome"" as a consequence of a devestating war between humankind and intelligent machines.Thus we are diving into a world in which people.resigned from the idea that technology drives all progress and evolution.

Yet they have lasers that can cut through buildings.why would a sandworm eat a massive mechanical machine?

2737,paduxx,"Terrible casting, pompous aggrandized music and not as good as a TV movie based on the same book",4,28 October 2021,"Cinematic presentation of some very special books like the Dune is very difficult and it is admirable that some think to try. But in this effort, there is a completely unconvincing protagonist, a supporting cast that collectively seem to think some how their roles are too lofty and needs excessively aggrandized effort to do justice to - even the usually excellent Ms. R. Ferguson - and the usually excellent Mr. H. Zimmer has provided probably one of his worst music scores for a movie.The visual presentation is too far away from the starkness of the book and here again the TV movie does it much better, even with much less advanced technology and, presumably, budget.One key reason such books are difficult to present 'cinematically' is that there is a certain attribute to the characters and the visual impact of such characters is more than most if not all known actors (to my limited familiarity of those in that profession) can ever present. However, when the reader imagines it while reading the book there is no limit to the level of impact - but when there is an actor pretending (acting) to be that character if falls far lower from such levels and is a flat out disappointment.In this case, the lead actor - is just thoroughly inadequate in every possible measure to the character in the book. Not to be too harsh, but Mr. T. C. Is better off sticking to putting in good effort on movies like 'Call me by your name'.Ms. Z is not too bad a choice for pretending to be the character Chani. Here her screen time was very limited, so, more on that, perhaps, when the next part of this movie is released.Summary: This movie is not worthy of the book. To lazily hear the story and avoid the book, it is better the watch the TV title with Mr. W. Hurt as Duke Leto. A rating of 4 is kind.",Dune

I don't get it.The 1984 version was pretty enjoyable, with great visual and atmosphere, and strong sequences, both in great scale and close parts. And a mysterious original feeling around it, at that time.This one, although having some pretty nice visual elements, completely lacks souls and feelings, and is just totally flat and annoying.The story looks inconsistent, irregular, with the usual required parts that plagues almost all modern movies today, and all is slow and lacks dimensions.

They have been told again and again that we need some entertainment and dumbing down movies is not entertainment, but it seems that Hollywood rewards mediocrity in the form of length.

It just feels dull, the characters feel shallow. Like they don't really exist.It lacks consistency, drama, tension. I have never been scared for the characters. No matter how desperate the situation should feel, it simply doesn't !I spent the whole 2h30min feeling ""wow it's very nice !"" but that's it. Almost any Marvel movie could give me the same kind of emotion and even more actually. Because they are less pretentious. They go straight to the action without pretending they can be anything else.I haven't read the book, but to be honest if it wasn't for the title I wouldn't even believe there was a book in the first place.Beautiful and shallow.

So because they sign the treaty, they can now mine spice on Tatooine.Little do they realize the Emperor tricked them and is going to double cross them by teaming up with the Hutts who rule Tatooine, and blow them up using Star Destroyers and Storm Troopers.What he didn't account for is that a boy - The Chosen One - is having force visions and dreams of a loved one dying, and a girl the force will guide him to meet in the near future.Due to plot convenience, Anakin escapes because he's being trained in the Jedi arts by his Mom after passing the Jedi trials in front of the Grand MasterDuring their escape they happen upon the sand people/Tuskan Raiders, and because of their duel to the death tradition, Anakin wins and they're accepted into their tribeWe quickly find out that the sand people have learned how to tame and ride Krayt Dragons through the desert.

One thing that managed to impress me was how Dune introduces its world without making you feel like you are being force fed exposition. It succeeds in providing you with the overall story while being littered with those little worldbuilding details that are a delight for every sci-fi/fantasy fan.The visuals are breathtaking as many have already pointed out and I'd gladly watch the film again for that reason alone.

2804,Brukernavn03,Dune leaves you wanting for more - there better be a part 2!,9,15 September 2021,"This movie is big. It's meant to be on the big screen. The visuals are captivating, the music is mesmerizing and the actors are convincing.This is an adaptation of the Dune novel from 1965, and it covers about half the book. I have read the novel long ago, but I'm mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It's a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to. But it's not dumbed down so that those who will recognize the names feel patronized. This is very hard to pull off, but I think this movie did so masterfully.I would describe it as a mixture between Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. You follow individuals in a grand and complex world. The majority of the movie takes place on a desert planet, so it really needed an amazing soundtrack to elevate the experience - and it has. Hans Zimmer turned down Tenet to work on Dune, and I think he made the right choice.However, this is only ""Part 1"", as it says in the beginning of the movie, so you know it won't be a complete story. I was ready to watch Part 2 as soon as it ended, but will have to wait. LOTR The fellowship of the Ring would be an insignificant movie without The two towers and The return of a king to complete the story. Together they are great, individually they are not enough. So it is with Dune - It is a great introduction, but it desperately needs a part 2 to conclude the story. And there better be a Part 2!",Dune

It was predictable however it being on a book series that has influenced almost all sci-fi since I would give it a pass except that it does not need that pass because it is done well.

It is THE definitive cinema experience !The only criticism I have is that the villains (Harkonnens) don't have enough screen-time which is a shame because their acting is fantastic! Other than that we could start nitpicking at each scene or little mistake but it just wouldn't be fair.The reason why I only give the movie 8,5 out of 10 is because Dune DESPERATLY NEEDS a second part !Without a sequel this movie makes close to NO SENSE !

Have read all the books multiple times and of course I've seen Lynch's version. This version is a lot better. Excellent world building, visually stunning and full of star power. It moves slow, which on the plus side gives it the chance to go into detail, but on the negative side means by the end it's not even at the halfway point of the first book. So it ends at the moment the mythology is just picking up. Which made me leave the cinema wishing to see part two, which unfortunately they haven't even started filming.So IMHO the reviews giving this movie a 10 or calling it the movie of the year are overly positive. It's a visually stunning start to a potentially mind blowing universe, but mainly an introduction to that universe. Maybe when the story is finished (wouldn't surprise me if they need three movies for the first book) it will be mind blowing and perfect, but for now this movie is a great introduction to the duneverse.

Some of it was pleasant for the eyes. Great music. But flat. Interstellar which I would say is a film of similar magnitude was a story about humans. This felt like a story with tooo many characters in and no story to any of them... really. I couldn't give a breadroll if Paul got his head blown off or not. You know I didn't feel for the bloke.

I love this book - but I love it because of the characters - here we skip through them and instead have action sequences and battles that are more at home in a marvel movie. Rather than doing the book justice - we have a modern action movie with an interesting backdrop and a lot of 'mood' pieces.Maybe Lynch's movie was a little cheesy - but given its time, it did better justice to the book.If you liked Blade Runner 2049 you will appreciate the mood and visuals - if you felt it lacked the depth of the original, you may be disappointed by this interpretation of another Sci-Fi classic.",Dune

Like Blade runner 2049, it's not for everyone. But you know, no good adaptation of Dune was ever going to be for everyone. It's actually a good sign I think. Let's just say that if Transformers is your idea of the perfect movies, you might want to skip this one but I think most of us know that. Also, the lightning is unusual in the movie, in some scenes. It's all about natural light so if you like everything in a scene perfectly lit and visible it might bother you a little. I personally thought it made the movie look very ""artsy"" (not a bad thing btw)Other than that, music was amazing, acting was amazing, special effects were pretty convincing the sandworms were so well-done! Their entrance was epic!The only thing that stops it from getting a perfect score for me is that I kinda like the most outlandish and original design in science fiction works. This one is very realistic and grounded, but I understand why it was made that way and it doesn't stop it from being impressive and gorgeous. In fact, some people might prefers this more realistic universe, it's a matter of taste. It's such a small nitpick really when compared to the positive elements of the movie.Also, it needs to be seen in theatre, trust me. I can't ever imagine seeing it for the first time on my TV. What a shame it would be! I'm probably going to see it again while it's still in theatre.PS- Looking at the reviews with the lowest score and the users who posted them, it's clear that many MCU fans are salty and trying to get back at Denis for his (very tame) comment about Marvel movies. Really you guys? Did you read the full interview in context? I love many Marvel movies as well (going to watch Shang-Chi next week!), but I thought he had a point and there was nothing I found offensive about his comment. It was not all negative as some people made it sound. Let's not be petty shall we? You are allowed to like both Dune and Marvel.",Dune

Belongs to IMAX theaters,7,28 October 2021,"Disappointing and underwhelming...probably cuz i expected too much...No as grand as I thought...A little bit scattered. The sound/music of the arrival of house Atreidies does not match the image. I've been looking forward to the usage of that soundtrack ever since i started to listen the sketchbook album. A bit disappointed. I hope part 2 can be better, at least as good as this one. I don't know.....The story is too old for the contemporary cinema.However, i would say it's still, a very good one. Denis clearly saved this movie. Can't imagine if it's another director, this would be a total disaster. A very Denis movie. We can see that the director is holding back those big scenes, it's minimalistic.This movie belongs to big screens, big theatres, and, obviously, IMAX theatres. It needs to be shown in a huge screen.About the soundtrack problem....the one called House Atreidies is a true masterpiece! It's like a three-act play that has a clear development, and key changing is wonderful. However, while the director is trying to minimize the whole movie, telling a big story in a small way, the musician is using his musics to making everything big.... Results in watching the movie feeling that the music is too noisy.... A big problem. Hans Zimmer and Denis Villeneuve, they just don't match. Hans better just go stick with Nolan.... All i wanna say is that Johann Johansson left too early...(ps...Jason Momoa is so hot in this! Didn't get in at the premiere night in the standby line but unexpectedly met Mr Villeneuve....

2840,mini_jeffrey,The Introduction to the world of Dune,8,29 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve did it!.. Almost. Let me elaborate.A masterclass on three things. World building, world building and world building -In Dune: part one, Denis Villeneuve opens our eyes to the world of Dune. By staying as true as possible to Frank Herbert's novel, we as the audience get to experience what Dune 'feels' like. Cinematographer Greig Fraser has together with Villeneuve skillfully utilized the beautiful and immense scale that the Imax technology provides. They were able to balance that with exciting handheld shots in the desert and dreamy close up shots during Paul's visions. During most parts of the film the editing is good, while other parts are great. 'The voice' plays a significant role in the story of Dune. There are several scenes in which characters make use of 'the voice'. Editor Joe Walker, who has collaborated with Villeneuve several times before, uses his editing to let us experience what it would feel like if 'the voice' is used on someone. The visions from Paul together with the orange b-roll shots are also smartly edited in the film. Joe Walker nailed it. This can also be said about the great Hans Zimmer. In order to create the sound of Dune, Mr Zimmer wanted to create sounds that we are not familiar with. The story of Dune takes place far in the future. This is why Hans created new instruments that could make sounds that fit the Dune era. Together with deep throat singing and the female voice at the head, Hans Zimmer has created one of his most unique and most creative scores to date.Two missing ingredients -The all-star cast of Dune definitely brought their a-game to this project. The acting is amazing, especially that of Rebecca Ferguson. But the film lacked a degree of emotional connection between the viewer and the characters. As a viewer I became in love with the world of Dune but not that much with the characters living in it. The second missing ingredient isn't really a missing ingredient, it's instead an unappetizing ingredient. I'm talking about the ending. Even though Dune: part one is ""Just The Beginning"", the ending did not tickle my brain or emotions. The ending of this film should give us the excitement of what is still to come, but alternatively it felt like a moment to take a bio break.My final thought -There will be people that find the pacing of the film way too slow, or the film itself boring from time to time. But I think that exactly that is the beauty of this part one. The first part of the story Dune isn't about the fighting or the action, nor is it about friendship or love. The first part of the Dune story is and should be about the world of Arrakis, the political game controlled by the empire, influenced by the Bene Gesserit and played among the houses and most important the journey of Paul Atreides that has just begun! I'm in love with this world.",Dune

At times I felt like I was watching the equivalent of LOTR in space. Every department that worked on this movie was on it's A-game. From the sets to the actors portraying the characters , to the music and the cinematography , nothing took me out of the immersion from start to finish. The pacing makes for a fantastic build up to the desert of Arrakis, and it's scenes will keep you captivated until the end , ultimately longing for more.This is probably one of the best science fiction movies I've ever seen , and I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates the genre.Let's go Warner Brothers and bring on PART TWO!",Dune

It has ruled my imagination for the better part of two decades. It has yet to be adapted properly. The David Lynch movie was garbage. The Sci-fi mini-series got a lot of it right, but it was still pretty far away.I have been excited for Denis Villenueve's Dune since I first read about it. He is a great director and it has an amazing cast. There are a few things that were left out and there were a few things changed, all in the effort of moving the film along. They got very little wrong (and don't think I didn't notice the things they did), but it does not ruin anything.Two things blew me away. The first were the sandworms. They aren't exactly how I pictured them but they are amazing to see and we should get to see more of them in the future. The second is the sound. Hans Zimmer has made this such an auditory experience that is unlike anything my ears have ever experienced.This project was too much to fit into a single movie and the story is perfect to be split as there are two deinitive parts to the novel. Sadly Warner Brothers did not let both parts be made at the same time and the sequel is dependant on the success of this movie. With the decision to release it on HBO Max simultaneously with the theatrical release, they have taken away a lot of the possible box office earnings.Go see it in theaters.

2850,AverageMalickEnjoyer,What on Earth happened to film consumers's self-respect?,4,17 September 2021,"Oy vey, looks like we've got ourselves yet another Hollywood blockbuster that was originally planned as part of a large franchise and therefore holds no independent value whatsoever. A classic Hollywood mash-up of impressive visuals and no substance. 2 and a half hours of pure exposition with the story either moving at a snail's pace or rushing like there's no tommorow.I saw it in a movie theater and man, you should have seen the look on people's faces as the credits started rolling. A gaze of genuine confusion and annoyance as if somebody had sold them a juicy, freshly-picked red apple and ate half of it mercilessly right in front of their faces before handing it over. But hey, I guess the visuals are cool sometimes.Those respectful towards the medium should avoid and at the very least wait for the entire franchise to roll out. I'm tired of Hollywood selling us raw, uncooked sausages while marketing them as hot dogs. I'm sure I'm not alone on this. This way of distribution is highly disrespectful towards both the medium and the viewer.",Dune

2853,lachrymalisis,"Terrible Pacing, Poor Character Development, Questionable Performances...disappointing.",4,22 October 2021,"Throughout this entire picture Jason Momoa can't seem to deliver a line without mumbling or sounding like he's in a damned SoCal buddy-cop comedy (his only emotionally expressive moment is his character's death scene), Josh Brolin- who I normally find to be a good actor- had a similar issue with overly amped up line delivery (""The Harkonnen's are BRRRRUUUTAL!""). Timothee Chalamet was far too little-boyish and awkward in a very uncharming way, and his delivery was mumbly and detached as well. And just once I'd like to see desert dwellers not modeled after Arabic cultures on planet Earth... oh wait, David Lynch already avoided that trite pitfall in the original Dune picture!I really wanted to like this, and it's not all bad- Javier Bardem and almost all of the Fremen actors do quite well, and believe it or not Dave Bautista is appropriate and well-placed as The Beast Rabban- but I'm scratching my head at a lot of these other casting choices. I will say that Stellan Skarsgard did a good job as Baron Harkonnen for the most part- but again, Lynch's Baron- reveling in his own disease and foul industrial imagery- paints such a more fascinating picture of the nature of the Harkonnen savagery and disgust than this version's neutered ,whimpery Baron.The one thing that I cannot forgive though is the rushed and absurdly soft take on the ""box of pain"" scene. I've never seen less character development or less intensity in a scene that demands so much of those things. It is unforgivable and baffling to me why it was done so weakly...and why it felt so rushed. The overall pacing struggles for the first hour and a half. There are a lot of very questionable line deliveries that do not make for an immersive experience- from Mamoa, Brolin, Chalamet, The actor who plays Thufir, the actress who plays Dr. Kynes, the actress who plays Shadout Mapes. Much of the acting seems forced and incompatible, as though the cast was not absorbed in the moment of the picture or one another. The accents and diction of speech were inconsistent across the actors- like there was no attempt to make each group sound like they're from the same place... It also felt emotionally piecemeal and incongruent for most of the picture. This is extremely disappointing, and all of the visual grandeur is meaningless if you don't have appropriate acting. It feels like they lost sight of that. It also felt like a lot of the effects were after-thoughts- the voice of the Bene Gesserit order was not very compelling compared to our original frame of reference that was Lynch's incredible sound-design. I know people are going to say that we ought to avoid comparing the two films, but guess what, that is inevitable and the only reason people say that is because they know this picture will fall short of the images and sounds of Lynch's film. This picture cannot be viewed in a vacuum. If something has been done better in the past already, then remaking a picture is nothing but an act of hubris and greed.",Dune

While he had already proven himself in handling delicate material with Blade Runner 2049, I think Dune strikes an even better balance, partly due to the phenomenal source material, which however poses more challenging tasks to the writers and director due to the inherent political backdrop of the storyline.Even the stellar cast, which are all very recognizable faces and could take away from the world building of the movie deliver excellent performances, and Timothee Chalamet (of whom I am not always the biggest fan) seems born to play the role of Paul Atreides.DO NOT listen to predominantly American professional reviewers who accuse the movie to be a slow burner and a slog towards the end: in the last few years the ""Marvel pocorn"" movies have dominated the big budget landscape and the reviewers are just not used to immersing themselves anymore in an actual story.",Dune

This movie kept me on my toes as I squinted my eyes half the show to find out what on earth was going on. There were moments where the movie was just too dark, it made me wonder if the cameraman forgot their lighting. Then came the next scene where the lights were so bright it reminded me of the beach in Hawaii. Please. If you do decide to watch this, bring shades. The plot was on another level of its own. It's like the levels at the shopping mall. There isn't just Basement, there's basement 1,2,3.....
this is basement 4.There was simply no plot. If it wasn't the lighting that affected the show, it was the words spoken by the actors. They either had to film with food in their mouth or the mics they got were from the old days. Caked with dust to muffle the audio. I thought I needed hearing aids halfway through the show. As the show reaches its climax at the end, it suddenly ends. It's as if the story was being written upside down with half of it scribbled on by a toddler with crayon. It was an utter mess. I thought I was the only one who found the whole show confusing.. to my delight, when the movie ended and the lights kicked back on, everyone were muttering. Oh, it wasn't the usual mutterings you would hear at the end of movies, it was the confused words of people. You could sense it! One lady at the back when: What???Yep. She summed it up pretty well.Now you may ask:
Who is this show for?Those who needs to be convinced that they need hearing aids and photochromic lenses.Who would enjoy it?Those who like being shocked by loud noises and bright lights.The only good remark I had was that the graphics were eye catching and the burger we sneaked in to the cinema was good.

Unfortunately, several elements have been left out and other elements are meaningless long and without substance.Even the beautiful visuals seem dull at some point - I attribute this to a lack of scale. The shots are mainly overviews with no clear reference to scale or medium close-ups and not that interesting.The actors play decently but the dialogue is quite story driven and feels unnatural at times.Too little effort is made to set up the intrigues of the involving houses and other worlds. Maybe this was done on purpose not to make it too difficult, but this came across as if something was missing (knowing it should be there).The music was very good but not iconic like Inception for example.The promise of an all star cast, director, music director may have raised expectations too high.

Congrats to him! The ending is bad, they obviously didn't care about giving the movie a proper ending and instead they just ended abruptly on a cliffhanger, probably in hopes it will make people interested and they'll get a sequel. If you actually did your best to createe a great movie then why do you need to pull of these kind of tricks that ultimately only make it worse? Timothée and Rebecca were fine, Jason and Oscar were fantastic as always, however Zendaya's forté is definitely not acting and I can't find a reason why they would cast her aside from the fact that she's popular with kids on social media and that would help promote the movie. Again, ""If you actually did your best to create a great movie then why do you need to pull of these kind of tricks that ultimately only make it worse?"", need I really repeat myself?All in all, it's painfully obvious no one here genuinely care about the books and are merely using Frank Herbert's amazing story writing and world building skills for money, fame and to score the next big franchise now that it's obvious Star Wars has been dying a slow and painful death over the years.",Dune

It was like watching scenes on YouTube one after another, sure it was interesting but that's about all I got out of it. It was a passive movie at best and fails to pull you in and strike any emotion whatsoever.",Dune
2881,mimi0108,A great immersive and psychological experience,10,2 October 2021,"Visual:
I don't think I've ever been so impressed in front of a movie. The visual of the film is amazing. The attention to detail and the realism of the world portrayed on screen is impressive. I was more than once impressed and gripped to my seat in front of some visuals (especially those related to the sandworm). The special effects, the way of filming and the precision on some details allow a total immersion in the world of Dune. You could almost touch the quicksand with your fingers.The sandworm is definitely the best visual thing I've seen. The realism of the sand waves created by the worm is astounding and gives a real sense of danger and wonder. In fact, the film creates the necessary tension around this creature. I had never been especially terrified or fascinated by the worm before seeing this movie.I also particularly liked the richness of the Fremen universe that this film shows. The different equipments used to survive in the desert make it possible to understand the hostility of the environment as well as why the Fremen are dangerous and particular because they have managed to adapt and live with the desert not just in terms of climate but in term equipments. These are the kind of details that enrich the universe.Sound:
Sound does not have the musical function it often has in films. It is a real prop to immerse the viewer in the universe, underlining an action, a noise and the like. The rumblings, tremors, pulses felt make the world of Dune alive, captivating and make it a real 4DX experience in a normal theater.Story:
The story of the film is very well constructed. The director takes the time to set the scene, introduce the universe and put the characters in their comfort zone before launching the plot. This time given to the exposure of the world and the characters allows the audience to understand the issues at hand, to know the different relationships and what is going on in the minds of the characters (mainly the character of Paul).The film builds a palpable but subtle tension throughout its first arc which leads us to the mid-film climax. The pace doesn't slow down after that. The film subtly and dynamically alternates action scenes with more poised ones. The action is present and well paced without being omnipresent and does not suffocate the audience with endless sequences without emotions. The film is understandable for everyone. It takes the time to present the different political factions and the issues while maintaining a little mystery about some political actors.The ending, although very open, fit with the story told in this first part and gives a feeling of accomplishment of a quest while making the audience understand that nothing is finished, far from there.Characters:
All characters serve their purpose. The ones that revolve around the Atreides are specially well written. Each has their own personality, function and relationship to other characters. The acting combined with the writing allows the audience to become attached to these various characters, to understand them, to have empathy for them and to fear for their lives.The main character, Paul Atreides, is written with a lot of subtlety, complexity and emotion. Everything is done, including the acting, so that the audience understands and sympathizes with this affectionate teenager, still immature and lacking in self-confidence, who is aware he must grow up and try to live up to his position as heir to a Duke. This complicated period between childhood and adulthood is well portrayed on screen. To this gradually comes to add an understanding of his difference. And the audience feels a great pity to see him progressively become someone he doesn't want to be and be thrown into a path he doesn't want to take.Lady Jessica, the film's second leading role, embodies with great charisma and subtlety the mysterious aura of her order. Alternately self-confident, emotional, stoic and badass, she is a complex character that is still a little mysterious but terribly human and understandable. The mother and son bond is also well exploited on the screen.The Harkonnen are not caricatured but frightening and cruel.Conclusion:
Dune by Denis Villeneuve is a very good film, even an excellent film. It is rare to succeed in combining visual, sound and storyline without it being to the detriment of one of these elements. It's also complicated to make an adaptation of a book that satisfies both readers and non-readers. And this bet was successful. Non-readers will not understand everything at 100%, but the film gives them enough to understand most of what it says. The rest can remain a mystery, understandable after a second viewing or when Part 2 airs.After all, when the first Star Wars came out, not everyone understood what the Jedi, the Force, the Emperor and the like were, but that didn't stop us from enjoying the adventure. Here, since the film is intended to be more political and immersive, the audience has a lot more information and explanations.Dune is a real sci-fi rodeo. It is a science fiction movie, a Greek tragedy, an art's movie and a blockbuster. This is an immersive and psychological experience that will not leave the audience untouched.",Dune

2892,jakobkralj,It's like a monkey had written the script - it misses the point.,6,31 October 2021,"Dune is a brilliant book, but a complicated one. This movie had quite a task to accomplice. It should have been easy enough for normal people to understand and still capture major undertones of the story. But it did not. Sure, the score was very good and the visuals also, but the story THE STORY was done quite poorly.PROBLEMS WITH THE STORY:
1. Paul
Paul was trained in the ways of Bene Gesserit, who are masters of self control and observations. He was a strong child - able to control himself and deduce much in others. In this movie, for some reason, they tried to make him look weak. In the book, the convercation between the reverent mother and him is an intelligent, reason based discussion. In the movie, the mother uses voice to control him and torture him - for no reason at all is given to him prior the control. He has frequent bursts and seem to be a total loser - for what, for the movie to force some growing up hero myth? I hated that part. In the book Paul is strong, but not a hero. In the movie, he seems to be destined to become one.2. Jessica
Much of the same holds for Jessica. She is a master of self control, but seems to be all over the place emotionally.3. For the book lovers only
I have watched the movie with one, who had no prior knowledge of dune universe and I needed to do a lot of explaining. The bull for example, or how the seeker works and why is it used. Or what is an Imperial conditioning. Or what just happened to house Atreadis. Or how the shields work and why they need to be disconnected on Arrakis.4. Not the right book
There are 3 types of fantasy books. The ones where the movie can capture most of what is happening (Harry Potter), the one where a lot is happening but you can cut most of it out and people will still get most of the underlying ideas visually (like LOTR) or ones where most of the lore and story is in thoughts and conversations between characters. The Herbert's way of narrating the story, where he uses 3. Person omnipotent does not help either. The inability to show thought of people kinda removes 30 % of everything the dune is.5. The message
Herbert wrote the book to warn us from who we follow. He said that:""I wrote the Dune series because I had this idea that charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: ""May be dangerous to your health."" One of the most dangerous presidents we had in this century was John Kennedy because people said ""Yes Sir Mr. Charismatic Leader what do we do next?"" and we wound up in Vietnam. And I think probably the most valuable president of this century was Richard Nixon. Because he taught us to distrust government and he did it by example.""I think most of that is lost. And I feel sorry that people will get a wrong idea about the story and not read the book.I think a miniseries would work better here.",Dune
2893,nmiodrag-40072,Visually stunning but fails to convey Herbert's grand ideas,8,21 October 2021,"Dune 2021 is brilliant in imagery and technical achievement, but it ultimately fails to communicate Herbert's key ideas, it focuses too much on building the details of Paul's world - leaving out the details of greater universe. Dune was never about Paul. Herbert's grand ideas are: advancement of humanity by evolution (mutation) rather than technological advancement, misuse of religion - ""When religion and politics ride in the same cart, the whirlwind follows."" and ecology, governance and preservation of resources (more on that later).There is one scene completely out of character: when Paul suggests to Kynes that political marriage into the imperial family will be offered as solution - Paul is supposed to be 15 at the time, much too young immature to even consider such a thing. At this point in time he is a rebellious teenager and tells Jessica that he disdains duty and ceremony as he has been force fed both.As mentioned before, third grand idea of Herbert's is ecology and governance and preservation of resources - terraforming Dune is way more horrible idea than exploiting it - Paul realizes in his visions that terraforming Dune will actually kill the worms, and it is this horrible thing he uses later for political leverage - it's not who controls the flow of spice but who is the steward of the sand - i.e. Who has the power to STOP it. But this is much much more mature Paul - years later.So, as a final thought - until I see part 2, my favorite rendition remains the miniseries, however poor effects and over the top acting I think it conveys the main ideas of the book series better.This is how I would rate different Dune renditions:
Dune 1984: 7/10 cinematography, 5/10 for adaptation
Dune mini series: 5/10 cinematography, 9/10 adaptation
Children of Dune mini series: 8/10 cinematography, 9/10 adaptation
Dune 2021: 9/10 cinematography, 7/10 adaptation.",Dune
2894,daniel-meteora,Sensationalism but nothing more,5,4 October 2021,"This take on Dune could have been a visually groundbreaking Sci-Fi movie 5 years ago, nothing more though....Looking at it today, it lacks of good or basically ANY storytelling (there is hardly any context between switch of scenery, the whole move is just a wild sequence of scenes, and 80% of them start with spaceships landing or taking off).It fails to build up any emotional relationship to any character. While watching, you don't feel a single thing when affiliates die.It has a weirdly imperialistic undertone it. To depict the foreign tribe, they prey (covered up), kneeling on carpets, facing in one direction and holding prayer beads?? Plus the soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, is another miserable attempt to depict the foreign tribe as ""exotic"" and ""mysterious"".Visually, it looks good but nothing jaw-dropping. It is basically the Blade Runner 2049 setting: Big monumental concrete structures without windows, simple and minimalistic interior, extremely wide and empty setting.The only thing this movie doesn't fail at is the costumes. They are actually very pretty and sophisticated and every single one has an unique design to it.

Technically, the film hits all the science fiction elements of Herbert's novel. Ornithopters look like dragonflys, the guild ships are massive.

A story of far away galaxies, in a very different time that is unmistakably from the Earth of 2021.It's disappointing to see the really (truly!)

2912,Arepo302,Almost a Masterpiece,7,24 October 2021,"To preface this I have never read the book, so take this from the standpoint of someone with zero knowledge about this going into it.From the moment I saw the trailer I was enamored with this movie. I had it circled on my calendar and could not wait to watch it. The moment finally came and after the final credits started to roll... I was a LITTLE disappointed.Comparison:
I am your average movie connoisseur. If Denis Villeneuve makes a movie, I am going to watch it. At the same time, if Christopher Nolan makes a movie, I am going to watch it. Now I am not comparing the two directors, but I will compare their most recent movies. At the ending of DUNE I was left with the same feeling I had at the ending of TENET. The trailers for these movies were phenomenal - I had not been as excited for a movie for its release as I was for these. That being said, these movies left me wanting more. I say this because I feel as though in general Tenet was received with similar opinions. I see a theme with movies like these that have stunning visuals, but the character development kind of gets swept under the rug because Harry Styles (Dunkirk), Ryan Gosling (Blade Runner 2049) and now Timothee Chalamet are just enough to keep the audience interested.The Movie:
When discussing Dune by itself, obviously the visuals and the score were 10/10. The quality and FEELINGS the shots evoked were very reminiscent of Arrival in the sense that I could not remove my face from the screen. However, the actual dialogue and character development left me wanting more. This is due largely in part to the fact that it is Part I. This movie was about setting the scene for Part II which will inevitably be epic, but the scale of this movie and the message it was trying to convey should have resulted in a deeper relationship between the audience and the characters.Overall Plot & Thoughts
At no point during the movie would my emotions have changed if Paul or Lady Jessica had just been eaten by a sand worm and the credits started rolling. Leto Atredies (Oscar Isaac) was probably the most relatable character in the entire thing, as far as his values and relationship with Paul, but if anyone was going to resonate with the viewers, it should not have been him. Paul being The One was believable. I liked how he had signs of being the Lisan al-Gaib and his new planet was decieved into believing there was such a thing, but the way it unfolded to the audience made me feel like he was just discover by Qui-Gon Jinn and was trying to get smuggled off of Tattooine, not onto it.I DONT DISLIKE THIS MOVIE. I actually enjoyed it very much so, I was just expecting a sensational intergalactic masterpiece that I will tell my children about, and it almost was, but for now I will be patiently waiting for Part II to complete the the story and make it so this first installment of Dune really was what we hoped it would be.",Dune

The amount of changes to the source material makes this not an adaptation but an interpretation of the source materials. The characters of Jessica and Paul at so incredibly under whelming. Jessica is portrayed as neither beautiful nor regal, in no way a person that a Duke would regret not marrying. The character of Paul brings to mind horrifying visions of the whiney Anakin Skywalker of prequel infamy. Seeing Liet Kynes gender swapped is simply more evidence that the director has never truly read the source materials.It's disappointing when expecting to watch a movie that brings a novel or series of novels to life, but this tripe is definitely NOT Frank Herbert's Dune and doesn't deserve the title of Dune in any way.",Dune

For getting Villeneuve on board for this magnum opus and giving him a chance to full fill his dream to make Dune. I can now say that Zimmer & Villeneuve collaboration is simply staggering, they nailed it perfectly & Villeneuve with his spectacular vision leaves you completely awe struck with the scenes which is just a sheer pleasure to the eyes.Having read the books, the film truly abides it as you can completely draw parallels and seeing them on screen with Villeneuve's vision can't be explained.Cheers to Greg Fraser for amazing cinematography.You just have to experience Dune and leave the theatres with a treat of a lifetime.

2925,Micasso-1,First half of the first book - Think of it as a prequel,8,23 October 2021,"The Dune universe is very rich and substantive. My first copy of the original book includes a glossary for words, organizations, etc. For example.Having read the first 6 books more than 20 years ago (I'm 35) I've been waiting for this series to get cinematic adaption like Star Wars and Star Trek and comic books have for the longest time. Dune to me has always been the better story/universe to me (and Frank Herbert wrote Dune before Star Wars, and a year before Star Trek first aired).So for me I absolutely loved it. I am not going to nitpick the little things as to why I gave it an 8 and not a 7 or 9 or a 10. What I will suggest is before, or after you've seen this movie, read the book(s)! I'm not going to compare this to Dune (1984) film either, which I also enjoyed as a kid. It'd be like comparing Batman (1989) to Batman Begins (2005).Mostly younger, unfamiliar viewers I think will find this slow but understand it needs to be. One of the, if not, most important, characters in the entire series isn't even born until the end of the second book, Dune Messiah. Won't go into that spoiler, but those who know, know.One way I look at this is (and I'm a big Marvel fan), Avengers Infinity War had edge of your seat action for three plus hours after how many years and movies leading up to this epic showdown. Then End Game, was mostly story-telling, and had its slow buildup to that epic finishing hour or so. This movie is like that in reverse (if you find you have a problem with the speed at which it progresses).I had a couple of teenage girls sitting near me who were clearly there for Timothy and Zendaya and I heard one of them say it was ""good but dry"" to which the other one responded ""but I can't wait to see what happens next"".Just my two cents.

If you can, go watch it on IMAX, it's totally a different movie.For a sci-fi movie it's a lot of ""earthy"". The music makes it SO EPIC.The picture was hazy and that's the only thing that I didn't like.For me part 2 is almost certainly!",Dune

2947,xandervmoss,A great adaptation!!!,10,22 October 2021,"This movie is a wonderfully made adaptation. It seems like a lot of people don't realize that this movie isn't the original. The complicated concepts and plot points came from the book, and I think they did a great job of making a cohesive movie that looks amazing. I think the set and costumes were fantastic, and the cinematography was amazing as well. I think they did a great job with some of the iconic scenes from the David Lynch version. I'm very much looking forward to the second part. And hopefully to the movie adaptations of the other books!!!!",Dune

I really really really hope we get at least a second one and if that's the case and Villeneuve is able to stay at this level of quality it could even get better than this one because the second half of the book is EPICAll I can say is that I trust him 100% with Dune from now on.Dune (2021) 10/10.",Dune

The acting was amazing, Zendaya really did well playing the fremen girl, and the Paul convincingly played Paul arthritis with emotion and strength!I literally had a heart attack from the Adrenalin whilst watching the scene where the bad guys attacked arrakis. The special effects for the explosions and heavy guns was the best cgi I had ever seen!If you are a child like myself please watch the movie, and if you're not twelve yet, just tell the workers that you are twelve, because they don't care.That's it. That's it man.",Dune

While no book will translate perfectly to the big screen, this is possibly the best adaptation to the big screen that I have ever seen. I loved every single minute it. It is beautiful, the characters are awesome, the music gives me the chills, EVERYTHING! After watching this film, you will wonder why all scifi films can't be made this way. Absolutely incredible.",Dune

2957,davidblanke-83280,A masterpiece in the making,10,20 September 2021,"I did somewhat expect Villeneuve to deliver on the high expectations. What I didn't expect was to be so blown away by this movie. Every frame we see on screen is an artwork in itself and the way every scene is shot makes those alien worlds so much more believable. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer once again elevates the movie even further while the acting ranges from decent to outright great. Those two and a half hours flew by in no time and by the end you are hungry for more. It's a shame we may have to wait for a few more years to get a part two, but once it comes I'm sure we'll have one of the best Sci Fi movie series of all times on our hands.",Dune

I kinda knew what to expect, but after watching Dune in the big screen, after rethinking again and again I feel that something is missing. Unfortunately.Everything was perfect except for the story, its fullness, its richness as it was in the source. I spoke to those who didn't read the book and they seem pretty delighted, but even some of them say that things were a bit confusing, like what's the name of the Baron, or why the hell spice is SO important apart from ""bad guys drain Arrakis, we not like them"", why Duncan or Gurney are that cool and Paul has such deep connection with them, etc.I have to mention the atmosphere with the music, and wide views, and loooong shots, just *chef's kiss*, fully immersive. But the great view will not tell you the story behind the world :( And going to cinema twice-thrice to make the box office just to push the sequel is a bit funny... It shouldn't be like that.P. S.: Btw, I would swap actors of Duncan and Gurney, it seemed like that they rehearsed for other roles and suddenly something changed, it's just how I imagined when the cast was released.",Dune

I went in blind, seeing minimal trailers and having not read the books of seen the previous films for Dune and all I can say is wow.

2970,oscarjuice,Just wait until the sequel,6,22 October 2021,"& then see both. While Dune is no doubt beautifully done...2hr35mins isn't worth this slow burn anti-climatic masterpiece for me. If I would've known how I felt now, I would've just waited until part two came out to see this one. You can call me Captain Hindsight I guess. I'm more than sure after I see the sequel I'll be giving this 15/10, but for now I'm left with a feeling of discontent and disappointment. I know it's better shot in two parts. I know. But still...why not release both parts to us at once? I get it though, no worries. For a slow paced old school, yet futuristic action movie that will obviously leave you wanting more for good reason check It out. Acting, score, scenery: perfectly crafted...it just left me knowing I should've felt more amped,pumped, and engaged while watching this instead of allowing my ADD to best me at times. My attention span isn't the issue for me though, as I know I would see the sequel right after this one if given the opportunity and would be left with a feeling of fulfillment...It's just this first one left me wanting more while not fully being satisfied with what It offered to me overall. Forgive my impatience, but I am only human like you my fellow movie lover. Take care and best bets!

Star studded cast, but you better watch it quickly because some stars may not make it into the sequel. I guess that is to be considered considering all of the upcoming movies these stars are juggling. Man, HBO Max delivered on this classic. There are a lot of similar movies all over streaming right now. I wished they had made it a weekly series, because now I am anxious for a climax. How long will we have to wait?",Dune
2973,fingerman-47305,My review is for the IMAX experience.,10,24 October 2021,"So, I watched the first 5-10 minutes prior to going to see the IMAX version. I was deflated. I thought uh oh, I'm about to be underwhelmed.Well I could not have been more surprised. From the first second of the film I realized the movie was true to the Director's comments, made for IMAX.The sound and visuals were an utter experience. I then came home and watched the full HBO/MAX version. There are actually parts that do not translate through the same way on a home theater system. Like the part where Harknonens were speaking with the Witch. You can actually hear very wierd bass noises as they speak with the noise shield on. But at home it is purely silent. And I had the stereo blasting in dolby surround sound.The emotional pay off will have to wait for part 2. Some of the characters introduced, but not fleshed out, left me wanting more. Who is this evil emperor? So I had such a good time at the IMAX, I have to give this a ten. Even my asian wife who doesn't understand everything on screen was blown away by the experience. For me, the proof that the movie is a good is if the wife falls asleep or not. And she did not.Even if you watched this on HBO/MAX, I can tell you that the IMAX experience is COMPLETELY different. Which I would not have thought I would say. Worth every penny of investment.",Dune

I also want to praise Hans Zimmer for his masterful score and Rodger Deacans for yet again his amazing cinematography. There is not much else to say about this film, it's a masterpiece.",Dune
2975,christiandmiller-55119,Two Words - Transportive and Transcendent,10,30 October 2021,"Those two words perfectly encapsulate the limitless essence of this masterpiece.Dune brings you right through the screen into its world, thanks to IMAX (it should be seen no other way), thus - a transportive experience. But the manner in which it achieves this is what separates Dune...Watching this film was an experience so immersive, so stunning, so raw, so gentle, so vivid, that it was a ""first experience"" I think may never be replicated or attained again. Words fail to describe completely the fullness of this film-watching experience, thus - my other word - transcendent. Very simply, there are parts of the film-viewing experience that words will always fail to touch.I think I finally understand what Christopher Nolan describes when he talks about his experience watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" at Leicester Square.IMAX feels less like technology, and more like a magical device for momentarily transporting people into other realities.But you need great storytellers like Villeneuve, and truth-telling performers like Chalamet to deliver the magic completely. They have indelibly done so with Dune.It is is one of the great films of our time.",Dune
2976,collinwayneknowles,Huh?,6,19 October 2021,Why didn't they just make this into a 8-10 hour mini series? I feel like nothing happened in this film and it only really got interesting in the last 20 minutes when they FINALLY established some world building amongst the non game of thrones monarch family bs. Now we cant watch more for several more years. Part 2 is going to be vastly superior but part 1 as a stand alone is a complete waste of time. Id suggest reading the book first and maybe consider watching this dull film.,Dune
2977,ailensofiachoe,Loved it,8,22 October 2021,I wasn't expecting a lot but I loved the film . I was expecting Zendaya to be one of the main characters but her screen time was super short . I recommend reading the book before watching the film .,Dune

An what makes it even better is the score by Hans Zimmer, it compliments the scenes so well and makes me appreciate this film alot more than i already do. I enjoyed every minute of this film. I think if you put the 84 version and this side by side you can see a diffrence in how its being set out dramaticly. I think id say the 84 version is quite set and dosent go into as much detail about the characters where as the 2021 does this. To conclude this review i would say if you are reading this and the film is still in cinema i highly recomend you watch it as soon as you can!

I read the comments and I said oh I am going to watch a fantastic movie but it was really without any content. Sorry for this brilliant cast for acting this movie. Even I dont think the time that the movie is made for will be a little like that!,Dune

The soundtrack is full of ethereal minimalism which creates a vacuum void of human emotions for the action to carry on in of course epic fashion. Epic sweeping camera angles lead to stone faced expressions from each and every character in epic fashion. The whole thing is quite epic and quite boring.,Dune

Pacing is flawed, acting feels mostly by the numbers, the truly emotionally evoking moments are few and far between because you often feel almost too distanced from the character(s) in question to empathize with them or you haven't been given the time to soak in what they feel before the movie is forced to move to the next step in the plot. The pacing somehow feels both rushed when it comes to getting from one plot point to the next and yet feels too slow when it comes to the establishment of characters' relationships with each other or giving them the time to express important inner monologues. For many characters it was very hard to care about them without having previously read the books.",Dune

The Spacing Guild, a major player in the book, only merits a brief mention here. No mention that Thufir Hawat is a mentat or what a mentat actually is and why they exist. No mention of Duncan's history at the hands of the Harkonnen. The Lady Jessica is portrayed as perpetually afraid and on the verge of panic. Of course if you have not read the book then you would not realize exactly how many important such aspects of the story are missing. So in this movie ignorance is bliss.",Dune

I'm not beating on Lynch - I love some of his work (Mulholland drive is a masterpiece). But his version of Dune is revolting! This was beautiful, dystopic, haunting and perfectly paced. Ant to all you that just have to criticise 'cause you can. I guess you just don't get directing where the actors don't babble and overact. So you get bored if the dialog i at it's minimum and the actors are acquired to act with their faces and body-language. To bad for you!

3007,jrtgvsff,Not Herbert's Dune,6,27 October 2021,"Special Effects: 8
Costumes: 4
Art Direction:5
Cinematography: 7
Acting: 5
Script: 4
Character Development: 3
Adaptation: 3
Direction: 6
Editing:8
Soundtrack:6The Good: Special effects and editing were pretty good, though there were a few frames where the special effects looked more like a high budget TV show rather than a 200 million dollar film, specifically the Harkonnen ships at the beginning on Arrakis, as well as the arrival scenes on Arrakis.The Bad: the acting, art direction and costumes were sup-par for a film of that magnitude with several books to reference along with the 1984 Dune, and the early 2000s Dune and Children of Dune. The actress playing the Lady Jessica is all over the place with her emotions which was very off putting if she was supposed to be playing a bad-ass Bene Gesserit. Her version of the Lady Jesica can apparently survive the box/gom jabbar test, control other with ""the voice"", get the upper hand in combat against one of the GOAT Fremen fighters, and yet can't seem to control her emotions or carry herself like royalty.Oscar Isaac is a dynamic as a snowman melting. And Timothy Fenchypants still can't get over how good looking and talented he is, he smudges the screen in smug smog.Ironically the actor I enjoyed watching the most was Jason Mamoa who really did the best with what he was given via script.The costumes felt like a design still in progress and not fully fleshed out, which I suppose this could be said for the entire design of the film.The Ugly: Adaptation, script and character development.Well Hollywood today sure knows how to do one thing very well: put a lot of money on glitter and glam and have no substance in the storytelling. This is especially true within the last decade into now. You can trace Hollywood's decline beginning in the early 2000s and peaking in our current time. Sure great films exist, but many of them are not mainstream and if they are they are rare jems like Interstellar.That said here are my main problems with the French-Canadian version of Dune: 1. It has very little resemblance to Herbert's novel. One major character is missing: i.e. Fayde-Rautha. One character changes genders: Dr. Keynes, one character who is all the books by Frank Herbert ends up dead: Duncan Idaho.",Dune

The movie makes very few departures from the novel, and brings to life some of the more obscure aspects of Dune's universe with cinematic intrigue. Thopters that resemble Dragonflies, Bene Gesserit powers, and bodyworn shields help create a futuristic world that feels authentic and natural to the characters. Add the beautiful cinematography, gritty screenplay and intelligent dialogue that we are use to in Vileneuve's films, and you've got an amazing addition to the Sci-Fi genre that will hopefully produce many more Dune parts and offshoots for us to enjoy.",Dune

The first half an hour or so was an incredibly slow and boring start. Almost bad enough to make me want to stop watching. It them improved a bit but never got to the point where I thought it was even good enough to be a TV movie, let alone something to watch a the big screen.The script appears to have been written by people who haven't even bothered to read the book. Large and important chunks of the story are missing. Other parts have been twisted out of shape.At best, this movie should only be watched by viewers who have never read the book and never watched either the original movie or the TV series. Otherwise, expect to be disappointed.If there are follow-up movies, as suggested by the ""part 1"" part of the title, they're going to have to be very much better than this one.",Dune

3024,gvwebsitesales,Overrated,1,26 October 2021,"1)This movie could have easily been under 2 hours. Most of the scenes are dragged out to create more suspense and drama. Honestly, it was difficult for me to watch this movie in one sitting.2)The casting could have been so much better. Personally, I can think of many better choices. I'm certain many people would agree with me. The acting isn't very good either. I think it's too easy to act serious, depressed, and angry the entire movie.3)Consider other films with a rating of 8.3 or higher. Can you honestly say this film is that good? I strongly disagree with the current 8.3 rating. I didn't enjoy most of the scenes because they felt empty and could have easily been cut out. I can't imagine myself watching Dune ever again. I might watch Dune again if I want to feel depressed or go to sleep.4)Big titles always come with a lot of hype and fanboys. Don't believe the hype just because a movie has a high budget and production value. Dune has an 8.3 rating because the fanboys give automatic 10/10 ratings. That's basically them claiming that this movie is absolutely PERFECT. This is one of the main reasons why some IMDB ratings are total BS.***I don't think Dune is a one-star movie, but I had to lower the ridiculous 8.3 rating somehow.",Dune
3025,jjamieallen,Let down by its changing pace.,6,2 November 2021,"(full disclosure, I haven't read the books)This sci-fi semi epic is Dune's big screen debut, but lacks some nuance of genre greats. The fast paced and eye opening first half leaves the viewer poised, only to crescendo into an arid and far too slow moving tail-off into a slightly empty cliff-hanger.The opening shots of dramatic oversize oddly proportioned space ships and megastructures are tasteful and pull you in; perhaps slightly over used to some effect, but clean and well executed enough to steal your mind. The characters are well aligned and the plot forms into the usual Shakespearean vengeance story, set against a brilliant backdrop of a huge universe encompassing some well depicted baddies. Scenes of large scale conflict are somewhat odd as shots of entire cities and vast fleets of colossal ships are levelled in seconds, only for it all to just stop for a sword fight between a handful of men, as if the 'gentlemanly warfare' option was suddenly selected. Of course this is true to the novels, but doesn't scale up particularly well to the big screen.Not long after, our hero is forced into hiding, which takes the wind out of this movies' sails significantly. It seems as if the creative energy was so expended by the midpoint, and so much film paid for that suddenly every frame just seems to be held for 2 or 3 seconds too long. Every gaze overdramatized and every sentence slowed. My fiancé and I both agreed that roughly a third of every shot could have been removed, cutting it down into a much more appealing sub 2 hour watch, without loss of quality. Oh well!",Dune

3032,positivesmilely,"For those who are prepared to immerse themselves in a new world, Dune delivers",10,23 October 2021,"I won't sit here pretending that this movie is meant to please every viewer; it certainly isn't. Denis Villeneuve is consistent to his interpretation of Dune, to his cinematic quips, and to his grandiose style. For those looking for less world-building and more intense action, Dune might not have lived up, but it certainly did for me.It is an exercise in world-building - how to traverse through a new universe with fluidity and impact. To anyone who remembers the pilot episode of Game of Thrones, it is important to consider how difficult it was for the writers to show the world effectively. I, myself, struggled to keep going with the show after finding the pilot a bit convoluted and confusing. For that reason, I find it especially remarkable how Villeneuve managed to compact such voluminous exposition in Dune pt 1. From the moment the movie started, I felt gripped, and it guided me through the universe beautifully. By the end, I felt equally versed in the world of Dune as someone who might have read the book. That is the greatest complement I can pay to this film.It goes without saying, as well, that Dune is a visual feast - an overwhelming favorite for Best Cinematography at The Oscars next year. Seeing it in IMAX only elevated the beautiful scenery and thoughtful directing beyond its unbelievably high standard. Dune's filmography also impressively pulls you into its story, and the lack of noticeable CGI helps keep you engaged and immersed - not allowing you or any audience members to get distracted by elements outside the movie's story and themes.Overall, my opinion of Dune is sky-high. It is everything I have learned to appreciate about well-thought-out writing and directing, and it is a true testament to an unwavering vision. I can recommend it for all those reasons; so if you are looking for what I've listed, I am confident Dune will meet your every expectation.",Dune

3040,knbrates,This is only the beginning!,9,15 September 2021,"I must admit, I still believe ""Frank Herbert's Dune"" to be unfilmable. I realised that, watching Dune: Part One in my local movie theater today. That's why people who have read the book should see this movie adaptation as a single piece of art.Forget the book while watching this movie. Dune, the book drives on the thoughts and inner emotions of the characters - the things that are left unsaid. Visually, that can only be adapted to a certain extent.Villeneuve has done a better job than anyone could ask for. I think he had to compromise on not bringing even more details to the movie, considering that the majority of the people will not have read the book. The information overload would have been difficult to follow for most.This movie is definitely slow, so if you are accustomed to constant dopamine stimulation then you might find it boring.The visuals in combination with the sound/music are hauntingly beautiful and will stick in your mind for a long time. I got goosebumps almost throughout the entire movie.Dune: Part One definitely serves as a stepping stone for Dune: Part Two, and more to come...
If you are looking for action, Dune: Part Two is definitely the movie to be waiting for. So grab some friends and go watch this movie.Make ""Dune: Part Two"" happen.This is only the beginning.",Dune

CGI & Acting was GREAT, The makeup and costume design was also amazing.Now the bad stuff:
1. Audio Mixing was very bad, Don't know if this was just the cinema or an actual movie issue but I could barely hear what the actors were saying and the music was blowing out my eardrums.2. It took about 90 minutes for anything significant to happen, So if you are watching this at home I would highly suggest skipping the first hour or so since there isnt really any back story to be told or anything else important.3. They would go from a really dark scene to a really bright scene on multiple acations. It was a little blinding but I think this might have been their intention, Just kind of annoying.So yeah, Easily the worst movie I've watched this year, So much build up to nothing... F9 was trash and I still prefer it to this.Side note;
I know this is supposed to be ""part one"", but 1 hour in i was checking my watch and thinking to myself ""oh god am i really gonna sit through 90 more minutes of this""... Dune Pt. 2 will hopefully be better.",Dune

Once the movie began my fears were gone.Right at the very begining I felt engulfed by the movie's atmosphere - combination of stunning visuals and intense music score. The characters were brilliantly portrayed (especially Duke Leto and Lady Jessica). The story is incredibly intruguing.As a whole Dune is masterfully created prelude that left me content and hungry for more.

Aquaman without a beard? Come on! He looks like a fool! Get his beard back.Another thing, they have space ships but not guns? What the hell is wrong with them?

And whats the deal with the sand worms, all they did in the film was to eat a factory that mines paprika.This film is just a waste of time and trust me, if you want to enjoy this film: just watch the trailer.

Now after watching the film for 2hrs and 15 mins you have reached the place in the film where Luke meets Ben for the first time then the Movie ends. Now imagine waiting 2 years to watch another 2hrs and 15mins worth of movie to reach the Death Star Trash compactor scene. Then you get to wait another 2 years just to watch another 2hrs and 15mins worth of Movie just to finish up with the end of A New Hope.Essentially after watching this you will come to the realization that you will have to wait 4 more years minimum just to finish a movie that could have been done in 3 hrs, maybe 4 Max.Scenes are drawn out and boring. Character development is virtually Non existent, and the longest continuous fight scene in the whole movie was when the main character was training fighting.The best part was Zendaya....one of the top billed actors in the movie. Essentially what we learned about her character in the movie and her two prominant lines in the whole movie is that she has wicked Ninja skills and has her Uncle's dagger that would be an honor for anyone to die while fighting with it.Personally, I'm going to wait until all the movies are completed in 2-4 years then watch them all at once because this one was too boring to even grasp your attention and I will end up having to watch it again anyway by the time the second is released because it has been less that 24 hrs since I watched the first one and have pretty much forgotten the whole thing.",Dune

3052,disabledvet-71637,The most overhyped failure of the year...,1,18 September 2021,"First, I will state that there is no Feyd in this film, since I know that has been the biggest question that many have been wondering for the last year. Sorry, but that's the breaks.As a fan of the books, and of Lynch's iconic version from 1984, I was very hopeful that Hollywood was going to do it right this time, with a massive budget and some ringers cast in the right roles, etc. But alas, all the hype was for naught. I should've known.What an utter waste this film is. A typical example of the continuing of Hollywood's ""throw a bunch of money and get a bunch of big names and it will succeed"" theory. For starters, this sad excuse for a movie is only part 1. But somehow, despite that, the whole thing feels extremely rushed. No real attention to detail was put into it at all. When compared to Lynch's version, it's VERY apparent which of the two films had real passion put into it's making. (Hint... it's not this one...)The following actors are almost not in this movie at all, I kid you not: Zendaya, Bautista, and Bardem. Onscreen only slightly more than those 3 are Brolin, Momoa, and Skaarsgard.That leaves Chalamet, Ferguson, and to a lesser degree, Isaac, who hold the bulk of the screen time. They do OK, but their talents are wasted due to the rushed script. I say with all sincerity that David Lynch's 40 year old version is better in every way, despite it's technological shortcomings compared to the effects wizardry the industry is capable of today.DO NOT be fooled by all the fake 9s and 10s posted here in the reviews. I gave it a 1 to help counter some of those frauds, but in all honesty, this film is worth no better than a 3. Think about that given the star power and budget that this film had. How very, very sad that is.Following the tradition of everything they've released in recent years, this is yet another fraud that should make them hang their heads in shame. Frank Herbert is likely rolling over in his grave right now...",Dune

3056,AlexanderDan69,Dune(2021),9,5 November 2021,"I was fortunate enough to get a per-release screening of this and I really enjoyed it for the most part. As with any book to movie adaption, I wasn't too thrilled about some of the decisions. The cast was well chosen. Because of the incredible leaps in CGI, some scenes were spot on. The acting was pretty spot on. Hans Zimmer did the music, but I found the constant presence of it a little on the monotonous side. I also could tell he paid homage to the previous movies, primarily the first one scored by Toto. The film also had moments when it dragged.",Dune

Viewers should be aware that it is part one and cannot swallow the whole book in one go, hence it does not have a neatly tied up ending, but certainly enough for viewers to anticipate a second film. This film made all the marvel movie trailers before it feel line cheap gimmicks trying to mimic the sublime glory of what true cinema is about. Would STRONGLY recommend viewers to see this at least once in theaters.",Dune
3058,dominga_oliver,Dune review,8,8 November 2021,"I am not a film critic, but I do want to review the film. So I watched the movie without knowing anything about it, I didn't see the trailers, I haven't read the book either, and I wasn't familiar with the story. I think the movie introduces you very well to the story and the characters, maybe to the people who read the books the movie was not complete or it was poorly explained but I think it deserves all the hype it had, the cast is incredible, the images they show are magnificent, the characters are in the movie in the best possible way and I think that it was a good movie to explain the story. For me it was easy to understand since the film is slow and what it seeks is to introduce you to what would be a movie saga. It is very well done and you can see the time and dedication, if the whole story is not there and not so complete it is because more films are coming and I think that over the years we will know more things that maybe were left unfinished in the film I also want to say that the performance of Rebecca Ferguson was incredible although everyone did it great, and also about the participation of Zendaya I want to say that clearly it was not much but it is because they want to introduce her character little by little and it will be very relevant in the following movies and a she's gonna have a bigger role. I loved the movie, I understood it, enjoyed it and left me with a lot of intrigue for the next films, I also bought the book so that after reading it I would make an improved criticism with the aspects of the book, anyway I loved the film and it I recommend for all audiences also I think the story is long so most likely there will be a lot of more films and that gives me hope that in the future it will be a good movie saga and loved by people.",Dune
3059,dakykj,A Visual Masterpiece,10,22 October 2021,"Right off the bat, I just wanna say that this is probably the most visually stunning movie of all time. The cinematography is beautiful. The visual effects are so real and vibrant that it doesn't feel like a green or blue screen.The performances are great, many complain that Timothée Chalamet is dull and heartless. But I think he gives a very realistic performance. Jason Mamoa as Duncan is also great, he's the most charismatic character in the movie. And the baron although not having a lot of screen time, is menacing and gross and intense. Whenever he appears, the atmosphere is intense and uncomfortable.Well, this is obviously a part one only so it obviously feels incomplete. But if their trying to sell a part 2 well it's working already. Average moviegoers won't really enjoy this movie though. If you're not a fan of Denis Villeneuve you probably won't like this movie as much. His movies are thought provoking and deep and visual treats. So if you don't like Blade Runner 2049 or Arrival, you probably won't enjoy this movie. But I'm a big fan of his. So I just love this movie.",Dune

3063,Matteo_Sacco,Great and well directed Adventure/Drama,8,18 September 2021,"I've just watched this film few hours ago and I'm already looking forward to see the second part.I've loved especially the visual look of this film and it's of such stunning visual power that literally should be considered as a new standard for every film now on. The photography during the entire film looks amazing even in the most dark frames Greig Fraser managed to keep the scene easily readable and balanced between lights and shadows.Speaking more of the film itself I think it needs to be watched at least two times... It's a little bit slow in its plot but as audience we have to consider it's just Part One and a back story was needed to make a solid Part Two. And according to that the main character Paul Atreides has been well introduced to the audience, the entire film keeps using his dreams to tell little parts of his back story and to explain the story of the Atreides as well as the Harkonnen and the Fremen.In conclusion it's a little slow but this choice is supported by the clarity given to the story preparing the audience to Dune Part Two.Finally speaking of the cast I really got surprised by Timothée Chalamet as its interpretation has been magistral. He managed to give his character life as a person rich of pathos, emotions and with a pure heart, but also ready to make hard choices to live and fight for his idealistics.I give this film a solid 8/10 just because i think it's a bit too slow, but I've really loved it.",Dune
3064,mireillekessler,What I've Been Waiting For!,10,21 October 2021,"I saw this film last night and WOW! I haven't been this excited about a film of this genre since The Lord of the Rings!! I normally never take the time to review much, but I had to for this cinematic masterpiece!First off, this movie was visually stunning from start to end. Seriously. Secondly, the sound and music were entrancing and you feel completely immersed. These two aspects really make it a must-watch just for that type of experience alone that so few films really manage to do perfectly; it's often one or the other (sound & music or visuals) that stands out more, or one is simply lacking altogether -not in Dune, though. I really enjoyed the intent, the storytelling, and the pacing.. Everything was very thoughtful so that the audience (and anyone unfamiliar with the novel) would really get to understand what was going on without it being rushed through. Then the acting was super solid and very well cast! I always love Timothée Chalamet. He's got such talent for such a young age; he was a great choice to portray the main character. Rebecca Ferguson was also a standout and was excellent.I read an article somewhere with Villeneuve explaining that he would describe this first film (Dune part 1) as ""an appetizer"" and that part 2 is ""the main dish"", and that makes me terribly eager for it since this one was so captivating and enjoyable. I wouldn't be surprised if this film picks up quite a few awards, and rightfully so. 10/10 hands down!!! If you're going to see a film in the theatres this year -pandemic and all- let this be it!",Dune
3065,richard-47302,Dune review for Cult Film Fans,9,11 September 2021,"So a little background first. I'm not a fan of action movies from he past 15 years or so. Don't care for Marvel films, don't care for DC films, don't care for Star Wars films, or Star Trek. I didn't even care for Fury Road, though I love the earlier pictures in the series. I think they are over-produced and sanitized for general audiences, and ultimately safe and uninteresting.And as far as DV goes, the estimable Denis Villeneuve, I love his early movies, especially Polytechnique (which you must see if you haven't yet) and sort of dislike his bigger budget efforts and really didn't care for his Blade Runner at all. I felt Denis was proving to be all flash and no substance.But I have to say... I really enjoyed Dune (part 1 ... because remember this is half a story). Part of it is, the acting is great, which is a failing of most big action films these days. But that doesn't mean Jason Momoa doesn't try to ruin it with his hammy nonsense. But aside from his inept mugging, everybody else is good, Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Stellan, etc etc. And I continue to think Timothee Chalamet is a serious film lead with great talent.Also the visuals are, of course, terrific, because Denis.. yea he has that shit down.But most of all I like it because it is dark, but not dumb and gratuitous dark like a Nolan Batman movie, but because it succesfully gets into the mind, mystery and insecurity of the protagonist. I thought the trailer for Dune made it look like a Star Wars movie. I was worried. But every big budget sci-fi sanitized trope is just tweaked a little, put off-kilter, and it all looks and sounds gorgeous. It won me, a major skeptic, over.Ultimately, I loved it because, maybe because, it is mainly about politics and political intrigue, which I guess, ultimately, is what the iconic novel is about. I don't know, I never read it and I couldn't get through ten minutes of the Lynch film - much as I adore Lynch. The politics in Dune isn't just a brush stroke like the Star Wars series, an excuse to roll into another overdone CGI battle sequence. The politics is sort of the beef in this film, a little like Shakespeare. Oh and when it comes to effects Villeneuve blows away the competition. He's one of the two or three best technical craftsmen in the movies today. It's him, Cuaron... and that's it.So, Dune, I recommend it. I recommend it even though it has no nudity and isn't transgressive in the ways we all love as cult film fans. It is still great even though it doesn't have those things. And I look forward to Part II. Hope you like it too.",Dune
3066,ingemarwiderstrom,Greatly disappointed,5,21 October 2021,"Slow, uncommitted and almost completely monochrome version of Dune. Does not succeed in conveying the fantastic original material at all, still after an hour, you as a viewer do not care at all about the characters or their fates.

3068,sean_rollins,Almost Perfect,9,5 November 2021,"""Dune"" is quite possibly the largest movie I've ever seen in terms of scope. You really need to watch this movie on the biggest possible screen you can find, with the loudest sound system you can stand. It is epic.I would give this movie a 10/10 but for one glaring flaw: there is a MAJOR theme from the book that gets totally omitted. Granted, this only matters if you've read the book. If you haven't, then I don't think this omission will dampen your enjoyment of the movie at all; but, if you have read the book(s) and understand one of the overall major messages that Frank Herbert was trying to express with the ""Dune"" series, then I think it's disappointing that the movie totally glosses over it.Aside from that, yes... you need to go see ""Dune"" immediately, preferably multiple times. It's one of my favorite movies in years, and I suspect it will find its way into my overall ""Top 10"" list at some point, if it isn't there already.",Dune

This is a dud. Took 2.5 hours and they didn't even finish the story. They got about 3/4 of the way through the story, so now there has to be like a 45-minute sequel that they will stretch into 2.5 more hours, which I doubt I will see..Overall, I'm just not impressed. Great special effects, but not much action, way too slow, and then it slows way down, too. Way too much ""HIIII-YEEE-IIII-EEE-IIII HAAAAAA"" yell-cry music. If they were trying to annoy me with the music, then I give them 11 thumbs up. The other droning music sounded too much like Hans Zimmer's Man of Steel throw-aways.I don't think this director understood what went wrong with the original.I'm gonna watch the original now cuz it was more sci-fi and action-packed.",Dune

3076,rolandofarias,8.5/10. Nearly flawless. Great work. ((SPOILERS ONLY AT THE BOTTOM)),9,17 September 2021,"This is the first time I try to publicly present a well-thought critique on a movie. So, please bear with me.I usually write fast, and without any edits. And this is no exception.I first read Dune about 20 years ago. Since then, I read it again one or twice. Last time was about 9 years ago.I decided to not re-read it, prior to the movie. To get a bit of both worlds. The newcomer, and the knowing fan.My memory is pretty good, but I've forgotten some of the details over the years.I've always been a cinephile of sorts. And I'm pretty demanding.I've worked on myself over the years, to keep my own expectations (and those of the general public) from affecting my perception of a movie too much.And I think I'm good at it. I try to keep my demands as objective as possible, while remembering I'm there to enjoy art in all of its subjective glory/awfulness.And I also believe, this was THE biggest debt the ""sci-fi adaptation"" genre had with us. Dune is sci-fi's biggest best-seller and a masterpiece, after all..It's a great adaptation. An excellent experience for both fans and newcomers, I believe. Well-balanced, for the most part.It sticks pretty closely to the source material, but without being a carbon copy.Doing everything ""by the book"" when it comes to adapted material, defeats the whole purpose. What's the point of just repeating, after all?Also, it's bound to fail. Some stuff, you just cannot adapt as is.So, where the movie adapts, it does so out of necessity.To avoid forcing it, to speed up the pace 'cos it's a movie, and to simplify for newcomers.In short, whatever sacrifices in accuracy and detail are there... Make sense, almost all of the time. It's done with respect, and quality.You get the necessary explaining and clues. Mainly through the actors' fine work, I'd say.The acting brings us in emotionally. It makes both newcomers and fans care.For a fan, some of the clues may seem too small. Glossed over, even. But subtlety and brevity are positive here, far more often than not.It's rather slow-paced, for a 2021 movie that's meant to be epic and include some action. But that's a GOOD sign.I saw it as a healthy middle-ground. It's not as slow and intellectual as the book (that'd be a snore-fest, in cinema). And it's not as fast as your average big-budget big-FX flick. So, it has a balance between complexity/detail and intensity.Considering the sheer pressure to oversimplify and make everything as action-packed as possible... Dune's pace being that slow, is bold AND respectful. A show that Villeneuve prioritises art over business.I'm more for plot and characters, than an FX and aesthetics. On the latter, the movie works pretty well too. We're finally at a time where technology is worthy of bringing such an epic story to life, and it shows.I just cannot quite put my finger on the small sensation, that some parts of the aesthetics fell maybe a bit short of ""flawless."" That they didn't contribute as much as they could, to the atmosphere. But I'm sure it'll be fully captivating for most, still.NOW, FOR THE SPOILERSUpon watching the film, I realised that what I remember the least about the book is the exact order in which things happen. So, maybe that's the reason Yueh's betrayal caught me unprepared.Or maybe the movie is just THAT good.I think Jessica's portrayal was more successful in this movie, than in the book.There. I said it.Her position is makes her the most troubled character. Because she cares deeply for many others. And is also far more aware of the dangers awaiting them, than the rest. In a more precise and acute way.She's our emotional delivery.And, while the book shows us how distressed she is... I think it falls short on its delivery. We're so focused on how brilliant and resourceful and strong she is, that the parts where she's our emotional connection to the story... Are thus overshadowed.Or at least, that's what I think happened to many Dune readers. Me included. Herbert was great, but here he didn't quite managed to convey it as deeply as he should've.The movie IMPROVES upon this, by showing us her suffering in more expressive ways. While not taking away from her strengths.Considering that the rest of the characters don't give nearly as much of that emotional stuff, this is particularly important to me.Also, when she has to be ""intense but subtle"" to show the mixture of a passionate heart along with great talent as a controlled Bene Gesserit... Rebecca Ferguson delivers beautifully. She really stands.Pretty much all significant actors get to shine, even when they have small parts.Bautista expresses much about the Beast's raw personality, in a few gestures.Skarsgard is subtler than the Baron would seem in the books, but in a good way. He casts an imposing aura of menace and cold ruthless intelligence, just by his simplest body language. He uses the grotesque figure of the Baron to greater effect, keeping it from becoming silly or too off-putting. The ""less is more,"" used succesfully.Zendayah runs all the range smoothly, really selling each scene in spite of how much they repeat ""girl in Paul's dreams"" thing (a bit too much, I'd say). She shows affection, calculated mistrust, honorable respect or rugged confidence. And the way the movie mixes present and future regarding her... That contrast just adds to the mystique. You just can't wait to see what happens when they meet for real, and those scenes keep showing her at her best.Chalamet shows Paul's mixture of confidence, burden and doubt, without exaggeration ( which is the biggest pitfall in such things, usually). He's not overtly expressive, but it fits the character. And when he explodes with emotional reaction, it works quite well.With that, along with some short peeks, we're already getting a visceral, intense foreshadowing of what the future will mean for him personally.Isaac takes advantage of every opportunity, to show us the most compelling qualities of the Duke. His loyalty-inspiring attitude and ethics. The love for Jessica and Paul, is played out just right. No corny stuff, no exaggerations, no clichés.I could keep going on about the actors, but you get the point.The visuals are quite good, and the music does its job nicely. The stillsuits are good, the ships are cool, the indoor scenarios capture the essence of what Dune is about, the sandworms and the spice look great. The teasing over finally seeing Shai'Hulud in all its glory, only adds to the experience. The choice in the spice's aesthetics, added to how it's shown in subtle or obvious ways in different situations, is a good one.WHY A 8.5, AND NOT A 10First, the smaller issue. The landscapes.Maybe my expectations are off. Maybe I was expecting something more ""alien"" and Villeneuve didn't feel the need for that. Since it's still human settlements we're talking about. And Herbert never made the planets THAT alien-looking, really.I think my biggest reason to expect something more outlandish, and also the reason the previous filmed stuff relied on such outlandish stuff as some of the costumes and so... Is the fact that it's such a distant future.But it also makes sense, to not deviate too much from common sense. After all, even while humanity has varied a lot over the millennia... Once it reached a certain level of ""civilisation,"" things became more streamlined. Patterns became more common.It doesn't make sense to expect our highest social class to start dressing like witch doctors or Queen Amidala, after all... Impractical as it is... Just because ""oooh, it's the fuuuture.""Also, I got some Ridley Scott vibes from the flick. From some of the visual, atmosphere and music. Mostly reminding me of Blade Runner, and Prometheus.And that felt kinda cheap. Not a rip-off, but still sort of wrong.So, you can see I second-guess myself about this ""negative point."" And that's the reason it only lowers the score by 0.5.What manages to lower it by one whole point, is something that was bound to happen. Important stuff, left out for no good reason. A mistake that, in my opinion, diminishes Dune's greatness as a masterpiece that stands apart.They would've done much to show how complex and clever Dune's plots are. Considering how good they were at showing and explaining other things, they should've made it just a few minutes longer and add all this too.It's mostly about the Harkonnens' plot. It's too oversimplified. It loses its ""that's genius"" factor.Duke Leto questions Jessica about her loyalty, but we never see that the Harkonnens were engineering that mistrust. As a distraction.Yueh's betrayal looks really generic. We're never told, that the reason he was never suspected is 'cos of the Imperial Conditioning and how it's believed to be unbreakable.THAT bit alone, is what elevates the Harkonnens above overtly simplistic villains. Breaking a technique so reliable, every paranoid noble and Bene Gesserit thought they could trust.In spite of my high regards for Jessica's portrayal, now I see, we don't yet truly get shown just how talented she is. She's not just a well-placed Bene Gesserit. She's one of the best among them.A good way to show that, would've been to include her body language use of the Voice.And I totally understand that's hard to convey through film, but still...They decided to scratch that. Which also diminishes from the Harkonnen's cleverness AGAIN.The rest of the movie, convinced me they left that out with the best of intentions. By following the same guidelines, that turned out to be a good idea throughout the vast majority of the film.For example, Jessica´s exchange with Shadout Mapes changed significantly yet managed to convey all it had to flawlessly. Transitioning smoothly from the book's slower pace, to the movie's dynamics.",Dune
3077,wbnrpqww,Such a master piece !,10,17 September 2021,"I was twice in Arrakeen this week...And I think I will come back with other friends next week.What can I say..we have been waiting for that stunningly beautiful Dune for years.But not only beautiful, clever, subtle, flowing like the sands of Arrakis.....Flawless.The way Villeneuve treats the sand of Arrakis, flowing like water, with waves like assaulting Paul, after the sand worm is gone, a vision of what will happen and maybe a last wink to the Caladan world he lost, maybe, maybe...Subtlety.Not some sci-fi movie with five words catch sentences and embarrassing comic bursts. We already had a great Blade runner, now we have this master piece.Many subtle winks for movie fans (Marlon Brando in Apocalypse now, or a building very similar to Tyrell co...).Subtle, not annoying...Never childish.Like you said in an interview, dear Mr Villeneuve, a sci-fi movie for grown-ups, with a real content, with real complex characters, with a great plot. Close to the books.Great casting too !I was afraid about Timothy Chalamet. But he is perfect as a 15 old boy (yeah, Paul is a teenager in the books).Tormented by visions, by the loss of his father, by a future he is not sure to be able to handle, angry and sad.But so human ! A great interpretation.Now waiting eagerly for the second part !THANKS SO MUCH !!! A hope for movie fans.",Dune
3078,filimattalli,Dune,10,17 September 2021,"When the film started I was excited and curious to understand how Denis Villeneuve has modified the story in order to adapt it to a movie; the results: at the end I was shocked and I was saying: ""I want the part two.... I want the part two"".Anyway the film is excellent.",Dune
3079,lauraniederbruckner,Visually overwhelming but emotionally empty,5,17 September 2021,"Since this movie is getting a lot of rave revies I thought I'd share my thoughts on why Dune didn't really do it for me. First of all: I haven't read the book and wasn't familiar with the source material when I went to watch this movie. The visuals, as expected, are very good and there's nothing more to say about it, really, than that Dune worked very well in terms of visual appeal. The problem I have, though, is that the movie - while undoubtedly pretty - made me feel nothing. The protagonist, Paul Atreides, is yet another chosen one who spends a lot of time staring melancholically into space and has a lot of visions of Zendaya (like, a LOT of visions of Zendaya - I guess they had to force in as many visions as possible to justify her having been marketed as the female lead of this movie, which she's not). Apart from Paul and his parents Lady Jessica and Duke Leto, pretty much everyone in this movie felt underdeveloped or downright stereotypical to me. Most side-characters (played by well-known and talented actors) are barely even characters, because they have no personalities asides from basic character traits like ""grim soldier"" or ""Asian doctor"". When a character I know nothing about betrays other characters I know nothing about later on in the movie, I just feel nothing, because I don't care for these people even the slightest bit. The same lack of development goes for the villains, only that it's even worse. The villains in this movie are some of the most stereotypical I've seen in a long while. Nowadays I just expect more out of a villain than ""he's evil and power-hungry and kills people"" - that's a character trait basically every villain comes packaged with anyways. To emphasize that these are the bad guys, they live on a cold, dark evil-looking planet and they for some reason have a huge spider as a pet that serves no other purpose than to show us that these people are EVIL. The only character in this movie that exuded any life whatsoever was Jason Momoa's Duncan Idaho, even though I'd still call him underdeveloped. Overall, this is by no means a bad movie but it's also not a movie I see myself ever rewatching again and I don't think I'll watch possible future movies in this franchise either. I always have the feeling with Denis Villeneuve movies (like Blade Runner 2049 and now Dune) that by putting in as much pompous and convoluted dialogue as possible and wrapping everything in overwhelming visuals he tricks us into thinking we've just watched a highly intelligent cinematic masterpiece when in reality, this movie could've desperately used some character work, emotion and better pacing.",Dune
3080,fabianluft-82510,All time classic Potential,10,17 September 2021,"Dune is a masterpiece.A masterpiece in filmmaking. The performances are all top notch. Denis Villeneuve pulled of the impossible, he adapted an ""unadaptable"" story, weil the first half of the book, because this is just Part One.As someone who didnt read the novels or watched the infamous Lynch movie, all I knew was that Dune is the ""LotR of SciFi"" and it blew me away. I cant say how faithful of an adaptation it is but what I can say with confidence, for movies like this cinema excists. And it should be watched on the bigscreen.Hans Zimmers soundtrack just hammers you into your seat and just like the movie it can be a little pretentious at times but it has every right to be that.Some if not most of the shots in this film are just breathtaking.Its a long movie 2 1/2 hours and for such a long movie not that much happened, but thats because Villeneuve takes his time to really explore this world, its characters and sometimes just for really cool shots.The movie asks for your attention and you really need to give him that. Yes there are Exposition dumps but they fit into the narrative, the movie even pulls of the impossible ""show dont tell"" trick, a nice example is the ""mood"" scene.Long story short, go watch this movie, watch it on the big screen, not only because we want a Part Two but because this Movie is truly a cinematic experience which should be experienced in the cinema, we dont get these kind of movies that often nowadays.",Dune
3081,markuswcarter,My thoughts,10,16 October 2021,"I don't read a lot of books, at least not yet. My Dad had told me that Dune from Frank Herbert was his favorite book ever, so I couldn't wait to see the movie. He had been disappointed with the first movie they made because of all the stuff they left out of the book. The first one was a disappointment. We watched the movie on opening night at are town. Now ... I liked the movie itself. It was amazing, and in my eyes a ten.When the movie was over I asked my Dad what he thought of the movie, and was it like the book. I watched a smile over my father's face, because, ""It was so close to the book, it was amazing."" He loved it and it is one of his favorite movies now. If the second movie is like the second half of the book, it will be his favorite movie ever, both together. Thank you Denis Villeneuve for making the movie so close to the book. Thank you. I started reading the book after the movie, and so far it is so similar it's amazing. Now this is how other directors should make a movie based on a book. I can't wait to see the second part, and I hope that it's like the book. Thank you Denis.",Dune
3082,nrdmoreau,Magnificient but clumsy,5,17 September 2021,"It is a magnificient movie. As beautiful as Blade Runner 2049. Stunning. (You've got to appreciate Villeneuve's blurry photography though).And the actors are great. Jessica and Paul are excellent. Jason Momoa is as cool as expected. Stilgar is perfect. The Harkonnens too. And Zendaya well, is Zendaya...Villeneuve even managed to bring some AD&D drow lore in the movie.Yet...It's slow. Awfully slow. 1/4 of the movie is literrally shot in slow motion. As a logical consequence, the movie ends in the middle of the story. And it is very frustrating.Frustrating for the fans, who know the story, and start to fear after two hours that the movie will end in the middle of nowhere. (And this ruins the experience, really).And frustrating for the non fans, that are supposed to understand things that are only understandable for those who have read the book or seen Lynch's movie a few times.Moreover, and that's the worst part, you simply don't feel anything. The plans are so empty that they cruelly lack life. You never believe in them. And the direction failed to make us feel anything. I am supposed to be empathic with the Atreides or disgusted by the Harkonnen, and I just don't. Caracters can leave or die, laugh or suffer, and you just don't care. Same with the not-scary-at-all worms.You remember these cool and magnificient movies like Avatar or Titanic, you enjoyed on big screen but never watched again ? Dune might end up like this.I am also very disappointed with Hans Zimmer's music. A genius like this, for such a lazy music score... Nothing to see with the fantastic score or Lynch's Dune, created by Toto and Brian Eno.Moreover, Villeneuve should have shot both parts at the same time, and try to stick to 2 hours movies. Because now, between cowards producers and direct to Netflix videos, this might end very poorly.",Dune
3083,GuyEatingShawarma,THE sci-fi movie to watch!,9,17 September 2021,"I've been hyping around this movie since the first time I saw a teasre from this. With the first teaser being almost over 1 year ago I was already completely sold for it, honestly...! And it totally lived up for the hype I had!But I won't just sit and say ""it's good and amazing blah blah..."", I will acctually try to describe why I really enjoyed this beatiful piece of art! (yes, i wrote art, because this movie... it's art!)This is the first i fully try to acctually review a movie, so please bare with me! ^^Picture:
How the movie looks is phenomenal. It's pure art.Have you ever just looked at a beatiful painting and just having a really good ""wow"" moment? Add that with movement and plenty of different colors and you get dune. When I watched the at the cinema I was completely lost over the visuals.Tl;dr the visuals are mind-blowing!Sound:
I'll probably keep listen to the music by none other than THE film score composer Hans Zimmer.Hans Zimmer have allways blown me away over how much feelings you get by just listening to his music, and Dune's score is not and exception. I just get lost in the music, I can't say much other than it's great!I don't really know what to say about sound effects due to I didn't really try to focus on them as much as I maybe should, but hey, another reason to rewatch the movie!Story:
If you don't follow along all the time, it's hard to keep following the story.The story is really good yet complex. I didn't really have any issues to get lost or anything because I were thru the whole movie, meanwhile my 2 friends were distracted a bit by the phones they were completely lost over what the heck was going on in the movie. If you watch this movie, follow it all the way from beginning to end.While Dune being a story/book/novel written by Frank Herbert and being released all the way back in the 60's it might be one of the factors why the movie/story is rather weird/complex (I can't say much about this either due to I haven't read any of the dune books. But for what I know more old stories are a bit more weird/complex and slow.)I still think that Denis Villeneuve made an excellent work with writing and directing the movie to make the amazing story we have been able to watch. At some points it was a bit misleading but it was really easy to find back.Cons:There are no cons really about this masterpiece to a movie more than that we are missing part 2. Atleast I want more, and I'm pretty sure the majority want the same here!However, there is one more downside though; it's a cinema movie. Or, atleast you need a big screen with a very good sound acctually experience this movie to 100%. I will surely watch it when it arrives on the blu-ray, but I will really miss the cinema feels, it won't be the same.Tl;dr this movie is a masterpiece with a complex story but keeps you hooked with stunning visuals and music that really blows you away! Is it worth watching? Oh yes, it is!Sidenote: I heard that the Dune novel have long been trying get fit on the screen but haven't really been able to get the spotlight, even though David Lynch is one of the greatest directors of all time it just didn't work out. But now it does! Denis Villeneuve has done it!I think that was all from me! As I wrote before, i'ts my first time writing a review so this might not be the one to read to really convince you to either watch or not. I hope I did a decent work however!Thanks for me! :D.",Dune

Special love for the ornithopters.The music is out of this world. Hans Zimmer wanted to do something new and it's impressive, scary, haunting...Actors are well chosen and at their best. The main trio (Rebecca Fergusson, Oscar Isaac, Thimothée Chalamet) are humane and kind, while the Harkonnen are evil and scary without being a gag.The sound design is very interesting too (the cone of silence is a fun little idea)Denis Villeneuve really loves the book and it shows.

They succeeded where pics like ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" went wrong.Everything from the design and scenery, music and camerawork, effects, CGI, to acting, plotline, language choices, twists and focus points has my complete stamp of approval ion this movie.

Of course, 2 1/2 hours is not a lot for a novel of this scale, but I believe it is as faithful as it can be and does the book justice. It's a wonderful introduction into this story, and I hope there will be part two and, maybe, three, to explore the rest of the plot and to dive
into the themes that were established here in greater depth.Villeneuve is to be applauded for this masterpiece of a movie.",Dune

I also particularly like, that the focus is not only on an exciting plot, but also on a powerful, underlining music and breathtaking recordings of the setting.The cast is ideally selected.

I just watched the trailer and I knew that I had to see this one, which i did last weekend in cinema. After 5 min i was blown away by everything. The soundtrack (hans zimmer ofc), the world, the story. I had the same feeling about this movie as when i watched LOTR when i was younger. The grand scale and epicness was the same as lotr for me.

3108,Vinzent-Frost,Dune is best left in the dunes.,3,21 September 2021,"Honestly, if I should describe Dune in a metaphorical fashion, it's like you've met a very beautiful person, how it dazzles and intoxicates the senses, until you wake up and realize, there is very little to no content(story telling/character progression).I will however give it 3/10 stars for the lovely scenography it portrays. Now onto the critique.The Harkonnen, are usually portrayed as monsters having, slaves, heart plugs, blood curdling torture and generally being de-humanized. In this movie, the Harkonnen almost seem too politically correct, it seems they were more worried not steeping on toes then actually portraying the Harkonnen, as they are. As a part of the audience, you really don't get much of a glimpse into their unique and cruel ways. Which would in a sense build up a stronger emotional tie to audience to actually cheer for house Atreides, and Paul. Mentioning not steeping on toes, changing it from ""Jihad"" to ""Holy war"" is again another example.As for Paul Leto's mother Jessica, she was taught in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, she eventually falls in love with Duke Leto, and bears a son Paul and a daughter too, none the less Jessica doesn't portray any of the renown social qualities of a Bene Gesserit witch, she's got the voice and can fight a little, hooray! For her I guess. However, what about the cold and calculating intellect? A Bene Gesserit posses, the manipulation and the emotional stability they seem to have? In Dune, Jessica is portrayed as borderline emotional mess, which switches from crying one moment, to being well stable the next, then crying again.They also clearly forgot to mention in Dune. That the sandworms produce the melange(spice), which Dune is all about, fulfilling and delivering that capitalistic quota, ordered by the emperor himself.But like in all good movies there's 2 sides to a coin, the desert in Dune, isn't just horrible and terrifying it's also beautiful and mesmerizing, forgot that pov too.If you're expecting a climax in this movie, I would suggest you too look elsewhere, because as soon as immediate scenography has worn off, there isn't much too come for. For crying out loud, even the worst video on Phub has more climaxes than this movie.",Dune

3110,sebbeholm,Created this account just to tell you about this movie!,10,22 September 2021,"I created this account just to tell you about this movie. I went to the cinema with low expectations and no knowledge about the ""Duniverse"". It blew my mind! I would describe the movie as mystic, action-packed and it certainly leaves you with a feeling of just wanting more.My favourite thing about this movie was how it felt new even though elements were familiar. There are some sorcery, the bad guys and the good guys. But there are also alot you are just hinted about. Speaking of hints that was another thing I really liked about the movie. It gave you breadcrumbs as the movie went on but without giving away to much detail. Alot is left to your imagination and that just makes the story and characters deeper.The actors did a superb job. Especially the main characters. I'm not very good at judging good or bad acting unless it is super obvious but these actors made me feel the mood in every set. In the battles I felt like rushing beside them into death and in distress I could almost feel like fleeing in fear.The music and sound in the movie added to the feelings described above. Whether it is the deafening shout of an armys battle cry or the music that adds the sense of severeness or power to a character, it was brilliant. I would definately recommend seeing this in the cinema or with a good sound system.My hype could depend on the low expectations I had before seeing it. I thought it was gonna be one of those sci-fi movies that I have seen a hundred times before that I might enjoy because of the effects. I'm glad I was wrong.All and all I want to see it again in the cinema. And that has only happened with two movies before both which has a high IMDB-score. So take my word for it. The movie is phenomenal.",Dune

3112,piv-97234,New franchise is born.,7,22 September 2021,"On the movie Dune unequivocally worth going and better do it in IMAX. A poor-quality cinema will not be able to fully convey the audiovisual splendor. A ticket, of course, is more expensive, but at least once in life you should try, especially with such a high-quality picture.I will remind you that only half the first book is shown in it. For those who do not know this, the session will end ""in the most interesting place.""If you did not read the book, you will like the film. Those who read, too worth going because of the visual. But do not count on the same depth as in the original. Frank Herbert, the author of the book, asked a very high bar. Despite the efforts of Denis Vilnev, he could not move everything on the screen.If you have not looked at the movie yet, I really do not recommend reading further, it can spoil the impression.""Only a shell""I have to agree with the director Alejandro Hodorovsky, who in the 1970s tried to film novel Frank Herbert. The director noted that he wishes a project for success, but admitted that the picture causes him dual feelings.It was more logical to divide the first book on 3 parts and make a film more detailed. The main advantage of ""Dunes"" Frank Herbert in the spiritual fullness of books. The spirituality is transmitted through the thoughts of the characters, a psychological game and subtle comments are visible. Without this, the film is felt like an empty retelling of the plot.The translation on the movie woman turned out to be at the Fincher with his ""Fight Club"", where he was even able to surpass the original book. Perhaps Villeneva cost consulted by the Finecher.It is very strange to not use a off-screen voice for the transfer of characters thoughts. It seems that the director was simply forbidden to do it. If he is a true fan of Herbert, then all this looks doubly strange. The whole point was in the thoughts of the characters. Because of this, the heroes look flat.Despite this, I am glad that more people find out about the Dune. Book heroes, Pool and Chani are good models of behavior for young people.7 out of 10Further comments with film SPOILERS.In the book, the duke Leto Atreides knows that Arrakis will become his grave and deliberately go there, face meeting his death. The duke was initially in a losing position and each his step worsens the situation. He only wants his son to survive. All this is played as a chess game workshop. The film also had the impression of him as naive fool, which was trapped.Paul from the superman turned into an ordinary teenager who accidentally tried LSD. Jessica to convey her mental experiences through external behavior as a hysterium. In the original she was very strong morally. Even when she cried, all this was transmitted more subtle, ""not in the forehead.""Another main planetist in the book was a white man, a black woman played in his film. It looks like Villeneva allowed to remove the two films only subject to the insertion of the writ. Because of this, there was a vague replica about her romantic relationship with some freeman.In the scene with Gom Jabbar, it would be possible to transfer everything more clearly as it was in the book. Show as a hand Paul lights up with her skin, muscles and only bones remain. When the box turns off, he sees his hand untouched. Ideally, a +21 rating should be used for the Dune. The Book Universe is a cruel place. Hodorovsky even wanted to show the dismemberment of the duke.",Dune

I also have to bring up that I wasn't born in the US or any other place where people have to say something nice or to say nothing at all(result is all a bit great when it really isn't). So when I say that the movie was great you multiply ""great"" with 2. It. Was. Great. Get it now? Go see it NOW. Theaters really do set a nice vibe for this movie.Second of all, adaptation or not I didn't need to read the book to enjoy the movie as a movie without referring to the book. I am really invested in the story and in the characters, so I want to see part 2. When I try to review this movie, criticize it or say something nice... I... I just can't find any words good or bad. I can only give a strong recommendation for this movie. I still have nice spice kinda feelings still after 3 days. The End.

It's gonna be great.I thought I will definitely see this movie twice or more times with different people, because it's going to be a true cinematic experience.Nope, it's not.I watched Dune 2021 yesterday and got tired of it very quickly. I got tired of the bland pictures, I got tired of the painfully invasive soundtrack, I got tired of the lack of character of the characters, I got tired of the story that lacked coherence, I got tired of the lack of creativity and effort. How come we see so little of the Harkonnen's world? Who is the emperor, why is he not shown? Why is Dave Batista shown for roughly 30 seconds in total? Why can't I properly hear the characters talk? Why does the movie feel so lifeless? Why is Jessica crying all the time? Why is everything happening inside these helicopters? Why are the mass battles done so akwardly? Why is Jason Momoa the star of the show? Why are the Fremen so stereotypical? What time is it? When is it gonna be over? I don't want to watch this mess anymore. I can't leave. I'm here with my girlfriend and a friendly couple. Damn, OK, hold on, it's just 30 more minutes. The colours start to annoy me. I don't get a sense of the endless space of the desert of Dune. Didn't they promise exactly that? Why don't they show this massive underground architecture of the Fremen instead of talking about it? Wouldn't this be much more interesting? I can't stand watching Paul's visions/dreams anymore, they look like fancy tv ads for perfume or expensive soap. Oh, now Paul has to fight this stereotypical Fremen warrior to the death? Of course he does! And in one of the final scenes you see some Fremen guy casually ride a giant sand worm. This made me laugh. I lost all respect.To hell with this movie.

It was fine at first, I found the setting quite exciting and at least i understood what was going on, but going mid-way into the movie, I started feeling lost and I tried to link the presented plots together but simply failed to do so because too many essential details were cut off. The plots got messier and messier that the only thing that was worth paying attention to were the scenes and main characters. I totally do not understand the high ratings around this movie. Not to mention this movie is extraordinarily slow, I almost fell asleep at some points. Certainly one of the worst movies IN TERMS OF STORY PLOT this year.

The invasion fight felt underwhelming, it's also nothing amazing in the book, but this isn't the one... you have to wait for part 2 (?!) ;)
Had it been a TV series this part 1 alone would have been 9h ++. For ex. The betrayal of Dr. Yueh felt meaningless, there was no time to develop his character & the unbreakable Imperial Conditioning... but long movies get complaints ;)
What Denis Villeneuve says? That Dune part 1 was meant to build the foundation, it's an ""appetizer"", the ""real meal is on part 2"". His own words, and it's pretty obvious ;)

3125,grafer-den,Is Harry Potter the Chosen One?,7,25 September 2021,"I'll say right away that I didn't watch the 1984 film, like the 2000 series. Or maybe it's worth it, by the way. Also did not read the novel on which these films and series are based. Therefore, I really have nothing to compare with. Thus, I do not pretend to be an expert judgment. Rather, there will be purely my subjective impressions.The first thing I want to note is that the film turned out to be really worthy. Good acting by Chalamet and other actors, magnificent landscapes, beautiful scenes, pleasant music, a touching story - this and much more you can see in ""Dune"", which is going to the cinema right now.This rarely happens to me, but this film directly interested me with its story - a plot written on the basis of the book. I wanted to figure out what's what.As a separate plus, you can highlight some lengthy scenes just to the extent to reveal their meaning. It can be seen that there is no unnecessary haste; that everything, as it were, is called upon to talk about something. A subtle storytelling style that pleases. The director lets us know that he really believes in what he does.As a separate plus, you can highlight some lengthy scenes. They are tightened exactly to the extent to reveal their meaning. It can be seen that there is no unnecessary haste; that everything, as it were, is called upon to talk about something. It's a subtle style of storytelling that pleases. The director lets us know that he really believes in what he does.But a lot of things in the film didn't go well for me. To begin with, it's fantastic. Maybe I'm just not a fan of science fiction, but still. There are legendary films by J. Lucas - ""Star Wars"", in which there is no less fiction. By the way, ""Dune"" is quite reminiscent of the stellar trilogies. But this film falls short of them. It only lasts until the last trilogy shot by Abrams.You still feel some kind of clownery - plastic costumes, Oscar Isaac, who starred in the Abrams trilogy, Zenday - in ""Spider-Man"", Jason Momoa - in ""Game of Thrones"". It can be seen that they picked up a little from everywhere. Extra poses, the pseudo-grandeur of what is happening, the far-fetched greatness of the heroes are visible. Somehow, at the level of feelings, it becomes clear that this could not have happened in real life. I'm not talking about new planets or the abilities of the characters, but about some seemingly trifles: their gestures, their manner of behaving and saying something, and the like. This pseudo-epic, unfortunately, almost completely pierced the entire modern cinema, and ""Dune"", alas, could not completely become an exception in this regard. I hope that I am now expressing myself quite clearly, because, in my opinion, this is just a disaster - all this obvious bombast, pretentiousness, superficiality, ""costume"", ""super-heroism"". Not that the entire film is saturated with this, but it is not without it.As for the plot
1. I can hardly imagine how you can live for centuries on a desert planet.2. I don't understand how you can just take and disobey the order of the emperor and attack the planet from which you should have departed?3. Why would a traitor try to kill someone to whom you betray someone? Why try to kill the protagonist first and then promise to protect him?4. Why would Baron Vladimir (keck) try to kill his own daughter? Well, that's all right. Why promise the witch not to touch her and her son, and then take them prisoner and try to take the devil knows where?I'm really unclear why there are so many artificial plot twists? It's noticeable! Naturally, when you write a novel / script for a film, you need to come up with something, but where to sculpt something so hard? Maybe, of course, I just misunderstood something, but even so - it looks too complicated - false. If the picture turned out to be too pompous, then the meaning of this picture is too fake.This is roughly how, in my humble opinion, things are with Dune.Despite its many flaws, there is something about the film that is catchy. Some kind of philosophizing, always relevant. Some kind of desire to give hope to people, something like that. In a word, I will hope that Dune 2 will be better. :) Although I understand that most likely it will not. But if not, then it will be something like the same stars of Abrams, nothing more.7 out of 10.",Dune
3126,myrene-81302,Phenomenal,10,25 September 2021,"This movie is breathtakingly beautiful and overall phenomenal and these are phrases i use very rarely. If you have ever wanted to see great movie in cinema, this is the one, don't miss your chance, i mean it. Specially in times where great movies are hard to find. This is the new epic sci-fi saga. This the new Star Wars (because Disney destroyed old one), but way more mature and deeper (i'm saying that as a Star Wars fan by the way). It's very obvious there will be second part, there has to be. But i'm actually hoping that they make it a trilogy (at least). There's absolutely no question, that this movie will make it's money back. It has already earned over 37 million in Europe and it's main theatrical run hasn't even begun yet.

3130,koerber-82021,"Go, see it!",9,26 September 2021,"I love the David Lynch movie and did see it a lot of time, because of the atmosphere and the epic story. The intro with the female voice gave me goosebumps. The new adaption by Villeneuve takes the visual impressing part a bit further and makes you ""feel"" the scale of the unsiverse, the political connections and the story itself.This movie visually is a masterpiece and you can sit, watch and be amazed, how they made it feel so incredibly real - even for the 155 minutes it runs. I only missed a bit of the ""darkness"" i felt in the Lynch-movie and they seemingly moved away from explicitly showing violence and gore overly. Baron Harkonnen e. G. feels more like a greedy, intelligent gangster boss then the schizophrenic sadist i remebered from the first movie. Anyways - the movie is actually the most interesting sci-fi flick i've seen in the last few years. With an incredible score, an immersive story, most impressive views of landscapes, mass battles and not to forget: the Shai-Hulud.If you get the time: Go, see it - and share your own impressions. I'm definitely up to see the second movie, if it comes. Plus i will finally buy the original books to dive deeper into the dune universe.Have fun!",Dune
3131,sonatafanatica,By far the best version of DUNE we'll ever get to experience,10,26 September 2021,"Is Denis Villeneuve's DUNE a masterpiece? Undoubtetly. Is it comparable in its grand spectacle to the Lord of the Rings movies? Or even comparable to Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve's previous movie? I personally wouldn't say so. It's a completely different beast altogether, I'd say.As most people my age (turning 39 this year), I got into the Dune universe via the 1992 video game ""Dune II: The Building of A Dynasty"" by Westwood Studios (which later served as the blueprint for all real-time strategy games such as ""WarCraft: Orcs & Humans"" and ""Command & Conquer"").When I later watched the 1984 Lynch movie, it kinda left me a bit grossed-out, understandably, though it still left a positive impact as well. To this day, I am in awe of the glorious palace interiors and the imagery of vast armies on Arrakis, let alone the breathtaking sight of the sandworms.During the past few years, I have read all six original books in the Dune series written by Frank Herbert and I bought all of the other (""expanded universe"") books by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson as well. (Planning on reading all of them very soon.) The Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ""Dune"" (and ""Children of Dune"") were quite well-made, if you ask me, and were a noble effort to incorporate most ideas from the books.In my personal opinion, Denis Villeneuve's DUNE is a perfect retelling of the original source material. Great performances by all people in the cast, a breathtaking soundtrack that perfectly sets the atmosphere at all times, and a visual spectacle to behold. If your wish before seeing this movie is to be absolutely transported INTO the world of Arrakis, that's exactly what you're going to get. Two and a half hours of being ripped from your own world and placed into this world of sand, spice and audiovisual magic.If I had to point out some negatives, spoiler-free, they would be: Some character relationships among the Atreides were depicted in a bit of a weak way (no especially notable chemistry between Leto and Jessica, for instance), and the power and control of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood was merely hinted at. Here's hoping we'll see more elaborating on that in the second movie (or, most probably, in the announced Bene Gesserit TV show, of course). Another detail that seems a bit sad in hindsight is the fact that all the palace interiors weren't very grand - a clear case of ""convenience over grandeur"" in their architecture.(Also... am I the only one in this review section who would have loved to see Gurney Halleck play the baliset?^^)",Dune
3132,gcbzzctvr,"Visual spectacle, falls short in storytelling",7,27 September 2021,"I have enjoyed many of Denis Villeneuve previous films. I thought Arrival, Bladerunner and Sicario were outstanding movies. I do not know any of the source material of Dune and have not seen the previous movie adaptation, but I went into this movie as fan of the director and of the sci-if genre. And I was excited going to the cinema again after a long time for a ""blockbuster"" movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. However after seeing this movie I cannot feel differently than disappointed.Although the movie looks undoubtedly beautiful and the overall setting and atmosphere is intriguing, I find the storytelling severely lacking. The acting is good (although I think Bautista is wasted as he has very little to do), the score is great and the cinematography is beautiful although repetitive. Unfortunately, I could hardly tell you what the story is about and I felt very little for any of the main characters. Although I appreciate it when a director does not explain every single thing, there was simply too little for me here to hold on to. It almost felt like a random chain of events. Every time the story seemed to progress into a certain direction it was interrupted, by a vision, a dream, a sweeping desert shot... and we would be somewhere else with someone else. I found it hard to find the motivation for peoples actions or any goals they tried to achieve. I checked my watch after thinking ""when is the story going to start"" realizing I was already more than 100 minutes into the movie... and even at the end I felt the story barely started. I don't mind a slow paced movie, like Bladerunner 2049, as long as I feel it is going somewhere, or I get to learn the characters better.And if I am honest I find the marketing slightly disingenuous as it is nowhere clear this movie is a part 1 of x. Ok, maybe that is my own fault not realizing this is a story that needs multiple parts, but I was surprised to see ""Part 1"" on the title screen even though it's not on the poster or in any trailer.At this point I'm not sure if I want to see the next part. I am not invested in this universe. I think a movie should stand on its own. If I need a second film to understand the first, it did not succeed. Overall I feel Villeneuve is so much into this universe himself that he forgot to pull in a new audience. However I appreciate it from a technical perspective.",Dune

Frank herbert had worked as a political journalist and knows the history of middle east and had built the dune legacy over it with few touches of things like melange (petroleum) that controls universe (earth), sandworms and all the little extras.I feel like most of the movie is covered with over-reacting of duncan, lady jessica, chani, vast scenery, little to none converstations and over-looked part of historical references.It might be fun to watch but probably i will forget it in a few days.

Great waste of great actors, by two dimensional characters in the script, and one dimensional direction. Cinematographer gets an Oscar, CGI coders get rich on Overtime, but the movie falls flat.The Sci-Fi Channel mini series(when it was still Sci-Fi) did not have the A-list cast, but they were competent, especially the Czechs(this Chani was far more dangerous than skinny waif of 2021, or the soft Sean Young).

3142,0bi-J0e-Ken0bi,Dune Dichotomy,7,29 September 2021,"As a fan of the novel, I can safely say that this movie's definitely worth watching! You can tell that the cast and crew have put their heart and souls into this piece of art, and it's precisely that--the visuals, sounds, and musical score are breathtaking. I've seen a lot of negative reviews regarding the pace of the movie; believe me, there's nothing wrong with it! The pace is acceptable, albeit a little too fast, if anything! From someone who knows the source material, I can tell you, the film moves a tad too quickly, and therein lies the problem. YOU CAN'T PUT DUNE INTO EVEN 5 HOURS OF SCREENTIME!Many of the criticisms I've seen before release revolve around comparisons to the book. So, okay, allow me to summarise without spoiling the plot of the film. The book is beyond epic; it is entirely thought-provoking and incredibly detailed. The world-building, for instance, is second to none. Now with that in mind for those who have no prior knowledge of Dune, the book reads like a historical record of the events surrounding Paul Atreides--hence, there's little actual action, there are no plot twists or surprises, and his path is pretty much laid out from the beginning. That put a lot of people off Herbert's writing; I'm not a big fan of his writing style, but I love the plot and character development. I adore the 'ideas' in Dune.This film is the opposite; Villeneuve has created 'his' vision of Dune, something he wanted to see from the book. It ends up being the visual interpretation of the novel, entirely abridged and in fast-forward. Complete chapters are missing, and characters have limited background description and time on-screen. Massive chunks are left out, providing little detail for what's happening and why which will also have a knock-on effect for 'part 2'. The character development is lacking on-screen.The action, however, for the most part, is present here in the movie, but NOT in the book. So, you see, the film is the inverse of the book. Dune needs to be made into a Game of Thrones-style television drama not, an abridged, action-filled shell of its former written self. Villeneuve quoted Dune as: ""Star Wars for grown-ups,"" well, I'm afraid this is ""Dune for teenagers."" It's a loud and grand epic for the senses with little depth, and whilst certainly a must for any science-fiction fan, it's all trousers and no talk.",Dune

It's tempting to compare this film to Villeneuve's previous entry in the genre (Blade Runner 2049) as both draw on older movies for inspiration (in this case as a remake rather than a sequel). However, Villeneuve seems to learned from the criticism of Blade Runner 2049 and delivers a film in Dune that keeps the best aspects of his previous work (incredible casting, stunning visual effects, and an engaging storyline) while doing away with some of the less successful elements (incredibly slow pacing, and an occasional tendency for style over substance).

I expected nothing less form big names like Momoa, Zendaya and Isaac, but this was my first movie with Chalamat. Consider me a new fan. He nails Paul's inital teenage mindset and his personal growth. Most importantly he delivers a stunning performance in scenes I imagine are really hard to do, like the box scene.I also want to mention Stellan Skarsgård who gives us a captivating antagonist.

Having seen the film, i think they did a very good job.Yes, some details got left behind, but i don't think that's had an effect on the integrity of the story. The world design was great, comparable to my own imagination of dune and the actors did a really good job of portraiying their characters. Especially Stellan Skarsgård, had me really conviced with The Baron.I would overall recommend taking some of your time to watch it.The only complaint i do have is that the music was too hard for my taste, but i always have that in cinema's.",Dune

You have a whole load of desert and it doesn't do much apart from make each scene hazy with the sand in the air.The action sequences are sporadic and really unoriginal.

The cinematography is stunning, clear and believable. Along with IMAX, you feel you are there in the middle of the action. The planets' people and their rulers, like houses in Games of Thrones, play chess matches with each other. Similar to The Matrix and our earth there is ""The One"", who will save.Don't get concerned about the length.

3185,ColeAntares,This movie is Important.,10,23 October 2021,"This movie is important. It is also a work of art. I made an account just so I could review this masterpiece. Dune is not a movie to distract you, like so many movies are these days. Dune is a Meditation. It's strength is in its depth. The story burns slowly, pulling us deeper in with its glow.It is a hypnotic dance of audio and visual used to craft a story filled with symbolism. It feels like everything carries meaning in this film. Even things such as gradual change in attire of the characters seems to carry a message. Layers of protection disappearing one by one as the walls close in on our protagonists. It is a very sensual movie, in that it activates the senses. The juxtaposition of cool and soft water with the harsh sands is tangible as the story moves us from a feeling of safety and comfort towards a beautiful and terrifying desolation.There are also many elements of this story, particularly with Paul's visions, which leave room for interpretation. This is a gift which is so often not granted by movies these days which prefer to specifically spoon us feed every story element. It was so refreshing to have a story which activated the imagination. Dune is a conversation with the viewer, not simply a one way flow of information. You become part of it.This type of movie needs to exist. It does not fit the same mold as other action adventure movies of this moment, and that's exactly why it's so important. It is art and it requires our attention and involvement.Some people have said the story moves slowly, but I felt as if the world of Dune was being revealed one part at a time, like a flower opening. Giving us time to settle into each moment and feel the sense, mood, and emotion of it. Honestly I wish many of the scenes would have been longer. The visual compositions combined with the audio (music, effects, and speech) was just staggeringly beautiful. I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at many of the scenes. Dune is an artistic feat of incredible proportions.If you go into this movie with an open mind, expecting something unlike what you're used to seeing, and are willing to settle into the flow of the story, you will be taken on a beautiful journey. I hope this movie inspires more directors to take risks, and to add more artistic depth to their works.",Dune

3188,qpzjkrbq,Amazing adaptation of the novel,9,16 October 2021,"I first entered the movie with no knowledge at all of the synopsis or that it was a retake on a 1965 novel. When I saw the title ""Dune: part 1"" at the beginning I thought ""Great now I will watch a movie with a cliffhanger and be left hanging for two or three years until I have already forgotten part one and don't care anymore"". As the movie went on, I felt stupefied by the world building and the heaps upon heaps of new terms and words of things I had no idea what they were. I kept waiting to understand till the last minute of the movie to no avail. I was so annoyed by the constant wailing in the soundtrack and vexed by the very stereotypical depiction of the native people as religious, naive and ""Arab-like"" which felt as a great affront. They even believed in a white leader to salvage them- rolls eyes. Nonetheless I was awed by the acting skills of the cast, especially Oscar Isaac and Timothée Chalamet, and the epic CGI, most appreciated in the execution of the sandworms which were epic and the ornithopters. I came out of my first watching of the movie with a sense that it was a mix of GOT and Star Wars with a ton of corny stereotypes. But.. it still intrigued me... I wanted to know what was going to happen next, and I empathised so with Paul Atreides that I couldn't get the whole story out of my mind.So I read reviews here, and I found out that it is a rendition from a book. I started reading the book and all of a sudden all of the things I didn't understand during watching the movie became clear. I even appreciated some changes made in the movie from the original story, some scenes that were deleted, the gender swap of a character, the addition of new scenes or changing subtle things like in the scene of the hunter-seeker. I went and watched the movie in the cinema again after finishing the half of the novel depicted in it and it made all the difference. I fell in love with the haunting soundtrack. I can no longer think that the story is a mix of GOT and Star Wars as it predated them! If anything, Star Wars and GOT were inspired by Dune. However, I can honestly say that I prefer the movie to the novel, to the point that the movie feels to me like the original story and I don't want to ruin my perception of the coming part two by finishing the novel first. The movie certainly made the story better in many ways, like the personality of Leto Atreides - though a lot of how likeable he was is due to the amazing acting skills of Oscar Isaac - the convincing progression of events, the respect you feel towards Duncan Idaho, that there was not this silly suspicion of Lady Jessica as in the book, and many other small things...
Ultimately, I am now officially obsessed, and I can't wait for part two - hopefully soon🙏🏻",Dune

3193,podeanum,Not bad but also....this is what is wrong with Hollywood these days,6,18 October 2021,"Let me start of by saying that yet again the CGI.and grafics people did theyr jobs and managed to put into picture what I would say is one of the most dificult book series to do so for. So it gets a 10 for that.Moving on to the way that the movie was put toghether and directed. I will be honest , it is a good revamp of the old movies as a whole and even though it is missing some level of detail from the book I gues this is unnavoidable. So overall it gets an 8 for that.NOW ...WHAT is WRONG with Hollywood.It seems like every single movie made in the last 3-4 years gets infected by some bs marketing meeting or demographics or some piechart and ends up being just another ""B or C rated movie"" when it could have been a masterpiece.In case of DUNE 2021 someone decided that F. Herbert was good....but not that good, and although he wrote a book series that sold in the millions and still is a thing after so much time, he needs to stand corrected. Let me tell you something Hollywood : LIET WAS A MAN ! Plain and simple ! This is not a sexist remark in any way. It is just the way the guy wrote the book and the way it sould be put into play. You get a 1 for changing the story and not find some other way to fit your need for PC when PC is not a thing. It is a book.If they feel the need for more contemporary compliant script....just write some new stuff and stop messing with the stories and history. What is next ? : Queen Kong ? ""CleoPeter of Egipt"" and ""Abrahama Lincon"" (the documentaries ) ?!?!?! John D'arc or perhaps Emilian Earhart? You get a 1 for this !!!!And last but not least ...Casting is good, in some cases even great...BUT .. Jason Momoa ?!! Seriously ?!?! Stephen Hawking has more in common with Duncan character than him. Duncan is supposed to be this rafined swordsman, elegant and swift ... not the guy that only looks good with a club in his hand and could not help himself to use his signature moves that, to be honest, have started to become realy old and had nothing to do with the part. Hollywood bs again ! You get a 2 for this.So 10 + 8 + 1 + 2 =21 / 4 is aprox 5 wich I will bump up to 6 because of all the other actors.SHAME ON YOU !",Dune
3194,partisantshirts,I'd rather watch David Lynch's version on a loop,1,18 October 2021,"This is empty, bad storytelling. The fact that you have state of the art technology to make your movie does not guarantee results. Unfortunately Villeneuve is a director who has become a master of style over substance. This film has more exposition than the one from 1984, and plays safe all the time. At least David Lynch's movie was more punky and felt dangerous, featuring a naked Sting and insinuations of pedophilia. I didn't believe the ""white saviour"" complaints until I heard a black actress utter some cringe worthy line about her only ""master"". Hans Zimmer score is good except where he seems to be recycling the Wonder Woman theme. The film is a huge disappointment as a whole. Villeneuve needs to go back to his roots and rediscover his own identity, if not he is at risk if becoming something akin to a late period Ridley Scott.",Dune

3200,danpetrache,A spice dream of a movie,5,18 October 2021,"Dune 2021 is a perfect example of a movie that trades its ""soul"" in favour of looks. I am writing this from the perspective of a person who has read the book in adolescence and re-read it in anticipation of the movie's release, suffice to say I was excited going into the cinema.My biggest problem with Villeneuve's vision is that it drastically reduces the major characters that were so emblematic for the book by butchering the dialogue and cutting great scenes from the picture, a good example would be Thufir Hawat, the duke's mentat and one of Paul's teachers. Honestly, if I haven't read the source material I wouldn't have paid much attention to the overweight little old man and I would definitely not know what a mentat was. Instead of someone with a reputation that terrified the other great houses and a fierce dedication to the duke we only get an old man that rolls his eyes to crunch big numbers and strolls on the surface of Arrakis under a fancy umbrella, much to the audience's amusement probably. Scenes like the one where he, with much pain, tells Leto that he suspects Lady Jessica of being a traitor for the Harkonnens, a scene that shows the stress and anxiety experienced by the Atreides during the takeover of their new planet, but also the deep relation that the mentat and duke have with one another is completely eliminated from the movie unfortunately.But important scenes are not only missing, some were simply reduced to strange encounters with even stranger characters. I am talking about the well known gom jabbar test, the test our her Paul has to go through at the hands of Reverend Mother Mohiam, Jessica's former teacher. Most of the dialogue between the young Atreides and the old Bene Gesserit was meant to drop hints about what exactly this order of space witches is trying to accomplish and consequently what Paul might turn out to be is, but it is instead replaced with tense music, staring between the two and a pretty good emotional display of Jessica's love for he son, oh and more question than anything else. Questions that are however answered in a hilarious conversation between Jessica and Paul. I don't know about many people, but I find scenes where characters resort to whispering in order to convey important information to each other and to the audience simply tiring. In recent movies, it has become a sort of a signal, ""Hey, something important is being said, better pay attention"" instead of actually trusting the viewer to be immersed in the story and to let him use his own judgement in regards of what is being said between characters. But instead we get Paul and Jessica standing 6 meters from each other in foggy weather at night and whispering about thousands of years of selective breeding and political intrigue like there was someone there who eavesdropping.Moving forward, I would like to talk about the butchering of the Fremen and their culture. I honestly got tired sometimes of how many times Frank Herbert reminds his readers of the importance of water on our ""spicy"" desert planet. However, it is important for driving home this idea, water IS essential and the Fremen are perfectly adapted for living in such conditions. So adapted that it created unique and also very strange customs in their culture. Shadouta Mapes doesn't insist in ""wetting"" the crysknife with blood when pulling it from it's sheath, the custom of taking the water of the dead is not shown when Stilgar appears before Leto and what I found just disappointing, Fremen traversing the desert during daytime. The myth planted by the Bene Gesserit with Lisan-al-Gaib is ok, not as pregnant in the planet's culture as I would have expected, but enough.I could keep going with the examples of what should have been, Liet Kynes' mysterious and knowledgable character, the Baron's scheming traits and so on, but let's move on. What many people agree on is that Denis Villeneuve is a top film maker and I have to agree, Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 had stunning visuals. However, I have to question some of Dune's, especially the choice of dull of color palettes. Arrakis is a planet with landscapes that can be beautiful but that are still very monochrome and this in combination of the rest of locations we see and the character's costumes result in a very boring experience for my visual nerves. Caladan and Geidi Prime are not desert planets and together with their inhabitants were great opportunities to make short escapes from the dull of sands, rocks and pale blue skies, but it was not meant to be. When I think of it, the movie is full of very simple, dull and blocky designs that fail in my opinion to stimulate the mind.Action scenes sometimes failed to convince me adversaries had to slow down in order to avoid shield blocking attacks, or that the Atreides troops were so fierce, but other than that I can't complain. I especially liked the portrayal of how good of an idea the baron had to use artillery as a workaround for the perimeter shields of the Atreides.I am certain that if I raked my brain I could find crucial things missing, like how usage of lasers is somewhat of a taboo in this universe because of a potential atomic explosion caused when intersecting with a shield, but it is completely not mentioned at all and at this point it would just be adding to the pile. As a conclusion, Dune is in my opinion just another movie that takes the route of appealing to the ""lizard"" brain types of pleasures, spectacular eye candy with instant gratification and lack of depth, betting on technology like IMAX to attract the viewer instead of offering a compelling story as well as an entertaining experience.",Dune

I had no clearly defined expectations for this movie, I had not read the book, and honsetly I was not even aware of its existence. Yet, this movie blew me completely away. From the very beginning until the last second of it. In fact almost a week after seeing it, it still occupies my mind. Though it took some time before I really got a grasp of where the story was going, this movie got me engaged from beginning to end. It does a very good job I think of introducing people to the vast en complex lore behind the story. Getting acquinted with it of course took some time and a little effort too, but since the movie is a cinematic spectacle, I did it with love. The epicness and scale of this movie is translated so well in the beautiful visuals that it delivers. The cast is great, and does a very good job of delivering honest and believable perfomances.

Writing is at the same level as Alien: Covenant.And here's real reasons why it's not a masterpiece:1 - How do you defend the fact that one chief-doctor in this movie effectively assassinates the Duke, and at the same time gains access to the equipment shielding the whole army (he probably teleports or has dozens of clones)? This chain of events led to Atreides fall in the given movie, it's absurd but it's totally perfect for Herbert's fans that we didn't even see how the main culprit did it on screen. The guy literally just mentions it himself in one line in a movie before getting his head chopped off.10 outta 10 writing. So subtle and genius. I'm pretty sure source materials would have this betrayal stuff figured out way better.2 - Why Atreides don't have any early attack alarm systems, enemy fleet recognition systems, radars? The general of the army literally sleeps with other soldiers in the same barrack and runs out to a parking lot just to witness a giant ship hanging in the sky. It felt so cheap and overused so many times. Again, such brilliant writing! That's why you can't even feel any pity towards any Atreides when they die, the characters are poorly written!3- Major battles in the movie don't make any sense no matter how you can try and defend them. Sardoukar (basically a SWAT team with riot gear) fall from the sky in their uniform, when they have just discussed that the operation would be discreet and nobody should know that sardoukars are there to help harkonnen out.4- Fight choreography, omg, that was bad, you could literally see how most guys swing their prop weapons through the air, no impact, no clever cuts.5- For like 20 mins in the movie we see Paul having dreams of this girl Shani and the other dude that is getting stabbed in the end, all this screen time could have been utilised to show us things that would fix plot holes and things that make this beautiful universe look believable, but who cares, here's more Shani in slo-mo, because, reasons.6- Also the fact that Paul followed Benne Gesserit to a parking lot in the rain and overheard their conversation with their mother and nobody noticed, made me laugh so much. Another magical montage moment.7- Oh, and remember the death of an ecologist? She was standing in an open field on a giant dune. Just think about it, out in the open in the middle of the day and for some reason sardokars managed to sneak up on her while they were on foot, catch her off guard and stab her in the back without her even noticing them! Montage magic! This movie is a masterpiece!For me personally, by no means this is a masterpiece or 8.3 out of 10 on IMDB, at best this is a 6.5 out of 10 movie, no matter how you try to defend it.",Dune

I'm speechless I'm actually shaking. Literally, I stayed awake till 1am watching this film. Im shaking. It's trash oh my god. The movie hypes the plot by building the suspense that this boy with the most perfect jawline is some sort of prophet with powers, only to have more more dreams of the chick! And wait!! WE DONT EVEN KNOW WHO THIS CHICK IS!!! And then finally, once we see her in real life...* roll the credits* WHAT!?!? I swear to god, a maximum of 2 min of screen time and that's it!!

But since I was in the cinema, I was a little too overwhelmed to maintain these suspicions.Now, watching this on TV, I see that my initial suspicions were right. It's alright not to cram Herbert's entire novel into one film, but then at least cut 30 minutes off the movie's runtime. It could easily be done without missing anything vital.I like most of Villeneuve's movies because of their tension and complexity, but this one seemed emotionless and trying too hard to seem ""grandiose"".",Dune

It's mostly exposition, It's not good when the ""action"" plods along at the same pace as the opening exposition. The background music drones on and on and on.The acting is wooden... which is likely due to the soulless dialogue. For many of the characters, it sounded like they were talking like they thought Shakespearian actors should speak, but without ever actually having heard any Shakespearian actors before. While others were difficult to understand, whether using silly accents or over-breathy whispering. What did he say? What did she say? Who knows.If you've read the books you might like it.

3220,nomcarver,Immersive but Incomplete Story,6,26 October 2021,"Dune is a film based on Frank Herbert's 1965 Sci-Fi novel. Directed by Denis Villenueve, it focuses on building a story and immersing the audience in the desert world of Arrakis. I intentionally didn't read the book or watch David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of the story. This way, I went in with an open mind. I was immediately sucked into this universe. While it was very complex, Villenueve did an excellent job of educating the audience on what this world is like throughout the 2.5 hour course of the movie. Like many of his films, Dune was a very slow movie, which helped to put the spotlight on not only the story, but stellar performances by Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Jason Momoa was surprisingly great as well, adding a much-needed energetic spirit to the mood. His strong relationship with Paul Atreides (Chalamet's character) was clear from the start. Hans Zimmer delivered as usual, with another fitting soundtrack that with the atmosphere of each and every scene. While Dune has many upsides, it did fall a little flat for me. Villenueve put so much emphasis on building a story and setting up a second film that it felt like that's all it was. If you're looking for exciting action sequences, you won't find them here. If you're looking for a climax, you won't find it here. I was probably more disappointed than many viewers since I didn't actually know before watching that this was only part 1, so I was expecting a big finish, though it quickly became clear that wouldn't happen here. None of the villains played a large role in the film. It seemed like they were there because they had to be, but they didn't do anything. This was the case with many characters introduced around the 2 hour mark, including Zendaya's character. Their sole purpose in the film was to provide a smooth transition to part 2. At the end of the day, Dune is probably the longest first half of a film I've ever seen. It did a great job setting up part 2, so I'm hoping, as is everyone else, that it comes. You'll be left wanting more with this movie. It's still hard for me to think that they created such a beautiful and engaging world, but I feel like I didn't get even close to enough. If you like Villenueve's slow-burn films, and are okay with there not being a climax or ending, you may love Dune. As for me, I'll be waiting for part 2.",Dune

3222,benazevedo,Film Perfection. Villeneuve only gets better.,10,21 October 2021,"Storytelling on the level of the original Star Wars trilogy. CGI on the level of Avatar and Blade Runner 2049. I've watched thousands of movies in my day and I can honestly say I have never been thoroughly entertained from the first second to the last second of a film like I was in Dune. The script was fantastic, the acting electric, and the directing unimaginable. The common cliches and shortcomings of the sci-fi genre were absent. The design of set, wardrobe, and technology were simple and practical for their use. There was no obscure sound engineering used in space travel, instead silence. The laws of physics were followed (for the most part). It is rare, maybe even an impossibility to find movies of this genre without plot holes, but again Villeneuve found a way. Yet, the perfection of Dune doesn't stop there. Sci-Fi movies are notorious for their use of obscure references, languages, and names, which often distract from an audiences experience. Ive never found a film where the exact, perfect amount of words were used. Villeneuve found a way to use no more words and no fewer words than absolutely necessary to get the story across. If Dune: Part Two is anywhere in the vicinity of Part One, this will easily be the best two-part movie series ever made.",Dune

3224,ameristylz,1984 verus 2021 version. Original much better!,1,21 October 2021,"I have read the books years ago, which were well done. I have seen Dune 1984 several times over the years so I was curious to how the remake compared, since it is is 3 years shy of 40 years ago since the original.Dune 2021 does not hold a candle to the original 1984 version for several reasons. First off they dragged it out. Dune 2021 (part one) runs 155 minutes and they want you to wait for the next one. The original 1984 version runs 137 minutes and is the complete story - no part 2 needed.The casting, the storyline, the filming (especially the lighting), the directing, the cinematography, and the costumes were all vastly superior in the original version. For a movie, that is supposed to offer tech that is close to 40 years newer this movie was a major disappointment. If you never read the books chance are you will not even be able to truly follow the story line. Dune 1984 goes out of its way to help make you understand the storyline at least.Even the themes and presentation are terrible. For example, the Lady Jessica, a major character is both beautiful and regal in the original movie. She is quite the opposite in this new version. The same is true of other characters. Perhaps with an emphasis on diversity for political reasons in our society today, they decided to cast non-white actors into what is originally a very white movie. But Sean Young and Max van Sydow
being replaced in 2021 by a Zendaya and Sharon Duncan-Brewster simply does not cut it in terms of quality of acting performances.I strongly suggest you stream Dune 1984 and watch it before ever seeing this movie and then you will quickly understand and agree that you cannot even compare the two movies. That is how much better the 1984 version is!",Dune

The special effects alone couldn't deliver a story as rich, deep, strange, and mysterious as Dune. It's NewTRASH in my opinion. They believed they could have done a better job than 1984 Dune and the early 2000s Dune from the SciFi channel. They didn't. The Lady Jessica is a horrible looking plain Jane..., The Bene Gesserit Witch was not as powerful as I thought she would be. Oscar Isaac is NOT a real Duke Leto.

I've been a dune fan for 30 years.So I have been waiting for the new DUNE film for over a year. I was over the moon about it.The best I can say about the film after finally hookin' my peepers on it, is that it didn't suck. What a huge disappointment.There are some moments when it is good, and they are making a point to explain the story (which the first DUNE film did not do), but they didn't develop any of the characters.For instance,Lady Jessica is portrayed as this frail, small woman who seems to be always on the verge of tears. She a strong character, with a powerful story. That was ultra-annoying to watch.Chani seems to be a bubble gum-chewing teenager like she just stepped off the set of Mean Girls. Absolutely no voice talent, and no acting talent. She's visually stunning in the film, but that is about all she had going for her.TC as Paul was a mistake. He looks like a royal who is the offspring of too much interbreeding. He's just a dopey character without any substance. Vanilla as vanilla gets.I could go on, but you get the idea. For a two and a half hour film, we got very little. Scenes were drawn out past endurance, and we aren't rewarded with any gem of dialogue or spectacular character chemistry.The film was visually stunning.

3240,jversluys,"Visually impressive, but emotionless",7,22 October 2021,"First of all, Dune has been one of my favourite novels since I was a kid. I was impressed with Villeneuve's Arrival and Bladerunner 2049 so I had high hopes for this one. After seeing it, however, I was surprised by how little character development was included, and by some of the story choices that were included or omitted. Major characters are introduced and then die shortly afterwards without really being fleshed out at all. Considering the length of the novel, this isn't so surprising, but it just doesn't work to create a emotional narrative that the average viewer would care about. Thufir. Kynes. Leto. Dr. Yueh. None of them have time to establish themselves or create meaningful relationships with the other characters despite their importance to the story, and to Paul.Paul himself was so bland, and yet he is depicted as effortlessly powerful and confident. Lady Jessica, who is supposed to be this badass master witch was instead the one who cowered and recited the litany against fear. Only later does Paul begin to realize he might be the Kwisatz Haderach. He even casually gives away the ending (his plan to thwart the imperium by marrying Irulan) despite us never having seen the emperor or his daughter. I'm surprised they didn't just come out and say that spice comes from the worms the second they land of Arrakis.I feel like Denis knew this film was going to be confusing and decided to rely on extensive exposition rather than trust in the audience's intelligence and leaving some elements of the plot unexplained. Only Paul's visions leave any room for interpretation.The ships and environments looked great. The costumes looked great (except for perhaps the Baron's). Speaking of the Baron - what an incredibly boring villain thus far. He's supposed to be a strategic mastermind, but all we see in part one is that he's this gross, mysterious Emperor Palpatine-like figure with zero personality. Where is Feyd? Seems like a waste not to set him up in contrast to Paul during the first film. Instead we get snippets of Rabban.I thought a significant portion of the roles were miscast. Josh Brolin was pretty good, and I didn't have a problem with Oscar Isaac, but Jason Momoa felt wildly out of place as Duncan Idaho. Everyone is playing these stately, aristocratic characters and then you have uber-bro Aquaman who can fight a dozen Sardaukar at once. Also, I hated the way they portrayed the personal barriers? What is the point of a shield that literally can't stop anything!?In many ways the Dune miniseries from the early 2000s was superior to the 2021 version, I'm sad to report. At least those characters received ample screen time and Paul has an actual character arc that feels realistic. If only they had the effects budget to really bring the environments to life, it would have been fantastic. I won't hold my breath for part 2, but I hope it happens for completion's sake.",Dune

The sacrifices made by some very heavy hitters was done in such a way as to add to the amount of loss felt by the main character. I think Chalamet gave an amazing performance. I didn't believe in him as the heir to house Atreides in the beginning but felt it by the end of chapter 1. I look forward to chapter 2 very much. Director Villeneuve did an amazing job bringing this epic to new life and I for one am impressed and found it thoroughly entertaining. At the end of the day it is a movie. Entertainment. And it did that. There may have been flaws or issues but I didn't see that. I watched this because I wanted to. I have never written a review before but felt I needed to let others like myself that saw the previews and have been waiting for it to know it was worth the wait. Watch it, let yourself be immersed in it. I watched it on my phone thousands of miles from my family, alone and isolated and it was still amazing. I will go see this in theaters if I am able to. Enjoy the movie for the art, not to think you're an amateur film critic and I think you'll get out what you sow yourself to invest.Thank you.",Dune
3244,mydataproco,My undercooked Domino's pizza was better than this movie,3,22 October 2021,"Very disappointing. Bad dialogue, bad acting. Everyone felt like they were trying very hard to be grand or epic and it fell flat. The world building was comical at best and I couldn't get sucked into it at all. Barely anything happens in the two and a half hours, maybe one major event of any importances but that's it. I don't recall a movie of such length where so much nothing happens. It feels like it could've been condensed into an hour and then have more actual story. Sure, it's setting up the next 12 movies or whatever but damn, give me some good story to work with. I'm glad I saw this on hbomax and didn't pay at a theaterAnd Zendaya didn't have any lines until the last 15 minutes of the movie, ugh. What a shameDammit, I really wanted to love this movie. I was so ready.3 stars because we laughed while making fun of it, so there was some entertainment value.",Dune
3245,cmkenerly,Unnecessarily Slow,3,22 October 2021,"This movie was unimaginably slow and could have easily been condensed into a much more interesting, faster paced film that would have left viewers craving more. Instead it was a boring, forgetful film that moved at an absolute crawl.",Dune
3246,stephaniegarcia-54711,Beautiful,7,22 October 2021,"Everything was beautiful. The outfits were gorgeous and the scenery of these two different worlds were breathtaking. The music was very unique and the language used by the Bene Gesserit was very interesting as I was wondering how they were going to portray this. The music at times didn't fit with some scenes and the transition scenes were a little choppy in some places. I wasn't a fan of the beginning of the film but I understand that the audience needed to see this at the beginning in order to make some type of sense of this new world. The movie was long but I believe every scene was necessary, every discussion was extremely detailed and for those who have never read Dune would be very confused with this new concept.",Dune
3247,afreeman-00421,"Wow. If you've read the books, you'll love it.",10,22 October 2021,Such a fantastic and faithful adaptation. I felt like every role nailed it with the casting and the execution. Every character was close to how I imagined them reading the books years ago. All the little details they included from the book were awesome. I just really hope people not already a fan of the books get onboard enough to help us get the second part. It's slow and methodical in the buildup. Trying to catch the uninitiated up without overly bogging it down was a tough task but I thought they did a good job trying. I was just giddy watching it play out. 10/10 for me.,Dune
3248,sanketnain-14429,Walmart Brand Star Wars,3,22 October 2021,"Honestly, this movie was an utter disappointment. The way it was hyped up in the trailer led to a tragic watching of the film. Plus, the killed off most of the main characters and zendaya rarely appeared in the film.",Dune
3249,danieltc-18873,Dune is perfect!!!,10,22 October 2021,"I watched the film, it was better than Dune 84 in my opinion! What an amazing film and the book references along with themes we see in our world as well. No spoilers in my review but I will say this Dune 84 was a two part film technically. On VHS, it was two seperate tapes. I can see why Villenueve wrote part 1 with part 2 in the works. He did it like a tribute to Lynch's Dune 84. When you watch it you see a some what similar connection, but wow!!! I want to watch this again and again! Villenueve hit a home run with this movie!! The drop off ending an issue?? Really??? Its not a drop off lets say that.Most Scifi films even Alien or whatever are tough to watch and you get bored easily, most don't really explain too well how things happened precisely. This film does not lack emotion despite what people have said. It is building it up. The movie is Paul Atreides, it seems to have a life of it's own. It is truly Dune 10/10!!",Dune
3250,rafaminervino-60212,World Building at its finest. Sci-fi fans will be mostly pleased.,10,22 October 2021,"This is a groundbreaking saga in the making, one sci-fi fans were hungrily waiting for. The world building here is masterful, and if you like Villeneuve's style, you'll probably like this. Its also quite clear he tried to please a bigger audience and went for a more direct style than, say, Blade Runner 2049. I myself prefer his ""don't tell, show"" storytelling of previous movies more, but i can see why he seeked more balance regarding this (Blade Runner was a box office failure after all). If this is what it takes to reach a bigger audience and make a sequel possible, I'm perfectly ok with it, because it still manages to make you get youself fully immersed.Watch it in IMAX, if possible. Its a treat to the senses, and it makes a huge part of the experience, especially because it's a slow burning movie. I can understand why the director didn't want it to premiere in streaming platforms along with the theaters.I find book fans will be pleased, since the adaptations made are understandable and doesn't hurt whats crucial to the story. But the amazing thing here is that Villeneuve made a DUNE movie that appeals to people who haven't read it. And that in itself is an enormous achievement, since book fans know it's a rather dry and detached read. To make it pleasing, even in the slightest, is great filmmaking.If you don't like slowburning movies, i'm afraid this isn't for you. It's not really a matter of good taste, but simply a preference, and I fully understand it. But if you want to see an entire universe being brought alive vividly right in front of your eyes in its own time, than I think you should hop in and enjoy the ride.The only complaint I have with this movie is with the coreography of the fight scenes. They are underwhelming. Since they do not cover a big part of this masterpiece, I honestly didn't mind.",Dune
3251,bennettmurphy,A faithful adaptation of the greatest Sci-Fi epic of all time,9,22 October 2021,"The story of Paul Atreides and the Dune universe in general - which has served as a foundation for so many other Sci-Fi epics (including Star Wars) - has never had a good film adaptation... Until now.The casting is impeccable. The visuals are stunning and perfectly encapture the grunge and elegance of Frank Herbert's universe. And for the most part, the story stays true to form while at the same time building upon the one Herbert imagined nearly 60 years ago.I won't go into details because this is a story that's so rich in nuance that it can't be explained in a review. All I can say is that I loved it, and I can't wait to journey back to Arrakis.",Dune
3252,fortekosakku,Very Impressive. Very original.,9,22 October 2021,"Hated the book. Hated the original movie. Havent liked anything ever about Dune.This movie was really good. The soundtrack, the atmosphere, the technology and the acting were all pretty top notch. It felt like something different. Ive seen every sci fi worth watching. I was absorbed into this new world in a way that all the other mediums couldnt do with storyline. I didnt mind the pacing. I didnt mind the dialogue. It felt like a drama most of the time with the action being good without being too over the top. The soundtrack choices and audio work really really helped this movie draw you into a new world. To me, thats what going to the movies is all about. I want to be absorbed into a new world where every piece of information feels new to my senses. Ive always put down this series since the 80s as being far too overrated. This time, however, I felt that it was brought up to date in a way that will let millions of people enjoy a fresh new sci fi experience in a way the formers could not. This isnt a cult classic anymore. Its a sci fi original. For that, I thank you. In a world where we dont get anything decent from Hollywood anymore, this had nothing woke, nothing political, nothing to tie into our own madness at home and during the present. It was pure escapism and I thoroughly , massively , appreciatively thank you for that. It felt like my own world didnt exist for a time. Well done. Good work on the casting and directing and editing. Im sure you cut out a lot of parts that will show up in a directors cut someday but it felt professional and it will no doubt, go down as a sci fi masterpiece. Who knows how the little kids of todays 20's will take it though. It may not be fast paced enough for them and they will cry like babys as they do with everything. The thing that surprised me the most was the original shapes and designs of the spacecraft. That made this sci fi classic feel more set apart from everything else you have seen before.",Dune

3254,neilukd-70129,Disappointing!,2,22 October 2021,"My wife was bored after the first 5 mins and we left before the end. I have read the book and the subsequent books in the series many many times and I was left wondering if the screenwriters and casting had. The acting was wooden and unconvincing of the characterisations from the book. I was also disappointed by the 1984 David Lynch version which whilst being more representative of the story was also a partial butchering by the screenwriter. The best version by far and adhering to the story was the 2000 3 part sci-fi mini-series and the subsequent 2003 sequel Children of June, with Alec Newman, cast as a far more convincing Paul Atreides, with William Hurt as Duke Leto Atreides and Saskia Reeves as Lady Jessica. Jason Mamoa's portrayal of Duncan Idaho was a disaster, James Watson was far better. Charlotte Rampling as the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Zuzana Geislerová played the part much better. Mohiam is supposed to be terrifying Ramping had all the terror of a newborn kitten. The only thing to commend it was the graphics and effects.",Dune

3257,sweatypig,Meh,2,22 October 2021,Think just because you paid top dollar for some actors it'll make your movie good. Sure the acting was great but...the story...only depicting the exact things wrong with society n no one wants to see it. Just see a movie and see no issue with that.,Dune
3258,anastasiapraz,"Beautiful - yes, soulless - also yes",6,22 October 2021,"We haven't had any good Sci-fi or even fantasy movies about vast other worlds with deep lore in the past decade. So Dune was something highly anticipated by fans of the books, Sci-fi lovers and other people who were hungry for a great epic adventure that can carry them away into another exotic world. And I was one of those people. I didn't have any specific expectations about Dune, and perhaps it was intentionally, since I was not really delighted about previous Sci-fi attempts of Denis Villeneuve. However, the exciting world of mighty houses, breathtaking landscapes of mysterious Arrakis - definitely was something to look forward to, since in my mind the right direction, beautiful visuals, vibrant characters, powerful soundtrack and more than solid source material could create something truly amazing and timeless.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. And it is hard to say why straight away.To me personally almost nothing was enough: the characters were not enough for me to like them or to hate them or to care about them, the story despite following the book (more or less) was not enough to be captivating, the action which is presented here (more or less) was not enough to impress me. The soundtrack (despite me adoring previous creations of Hans Zimmer) was not enough to highlight the uniqueness of the world or to make me feel it rather than just set the mood (usually this mood is quite over the top, filled with brutality and trippy motives) or to become a timeless audio experience that you can revisit again and again, in fact you more likely will get tired of it.And the most disappointing to me - I didn't feel the mysterious and mesmerizing Dune's atmosphere I was hoping for. I thought - ok, if the story will not hook me, if the acting will be a bit off, at least I will definitely come out of cinema with a bit of Dune inside me, you know. That exact feeling when, after watching something truly atmospheric and inspiring, it stays with you for days or even weeks. Nothing like that happened, unfortunately, even tho I really wanted it to happen. What a shame.Creators tried to show us beautiful views of Arrakis, endless dunes crowned by moons in the blue sky, sure. The movie literally starts by pointing out how beautiful Arrakis is, and after this theme being continued throughout the entire movie. But to be very honest with you, nothing special. Some documentaries about wildlife can do it even better, and more likely you have already seen better views in other movies set in desserts.On other hand the designs of vehicles and architecture delivers much better. But again. You are trying to show the beauty of Arrakis not machines, but machines turned out stealing the show and even mighty sand worms do not help much.And here I start remembering other movies that tried to impress us with unearthly atmosphere, landscapes and architecture but actually succeed. One of the best examples - Lord of the Rings.Thing is, in LOTR when the characters we are following discover something new (for them and for us) they react, the music reacts, the movie itself reacts and trying to highlight the greatness of the moment or of the place. For example when in the first movie fellowship reaches Moria and discover Dwarrowdelf, you can see that they are impressed with the greatness of the place, the music does it too, and you have goosebumps because all together builds such a powerful reveal. Or how this movie shows the beauty of Elves' towns, how many details it shows and how music works for it as well. And in Dune we usually get a helicopter view as introduction to the city or a landscape with no particular reaction from the characters whatsoever. No goosebumps here, but could be!From other things that from my point of view didn't help - visions and illusions of Paul. Tiring, dragging, too much. Those visions are essential to the story, I get it, but I can be done in a way more pleasant way in order to not break the already not very focused plot.Actors are ok. Direction does not really allow them to shine.Overall, I understand why some people might like this movie, it can be pretty, and can set moods, but they do not stay with you for long tho.Perhaps in the hands of a different director, we could get something more substantial and significant. What a shame.",Dune

3260,datmotorstormer,A movie I have almost entirely forgotten about after leaving the cinema,3,22 October 2021,"Granted, I'm not the target audience for this movie -- nor am I familiar with the source material -- but rethreading such a predictable storyline for what seems like the umpteenth time in recent memory, it begs the question as to why so much money and talent is spent to visit the same beats in dialog and plot that you would find in any other teenage-dystopian-futuristic movie such as The Host, Maze Runner or even The Hunger Games.The insipidness of this movie is further exacerbated by completely uninspired costume and (mostly interior) set design, a needlessly singular color palette (some of the panning shots might as well have been an untextured 3D render) and possibly the worst sin of all, which is that the movie does not stand on its own without reading its source material. If you're unfamiliar with Dune, about 80% of the dialogue will be complete gibberish -- and the remaining 20% will be exactly what you expect from this sort of genre, tepid and predictable.The bizarre pacing of this movie makes it feel as though it has double the runtime, and it is no slouch at 2 hours and 35 minutes (of which, admittedly, I must have watched about an hour and 50 minutes before walking out of the movie theater). Mostly inconsequential scenes carry on for far too long, while action scenes are resolved almost immediately and leave us with no time to take in and understand what we just witnessed. Not that we care at all about anyone or anything that happened, because none of this movie makes any sense (I imagine) without the book. I'm sure there's an explanation as to why we're still fighting with swords and knives in the ludicrously advanced year of 10191 somewhere, but without context it just looks as ridiculous as it sounds.",Dune

Too many martial arts, repetitive dream scenes that only made this film boring, filling minutes of literally nothing.I understand that with the new technologies films can bring more realism to the screen, but that's not an excuse to direct a movie like it would be a nature documentary. Good movies are able to tell a story without toppings, ornamentations, and blah blah blah.

Answers to Herbert's character's story arcs are thrown at the viewer before we realize what the questions are. It feels like we walked into a room in the middle of a huge argument. These books are essentially about humanity's struggle for power and continuity told through the lives of his characters. They are also about the futility of that struggle in the grand scheme of things. I have read the original 6 books back to back multiple times.

3273,csqcmmy,awe-inspiring,9,23 October 2021,"TL:DR
althought few details was left out it's a huge and very succeseful adaptation of immensely complex book. Must see IMHODune was one of the first sci-fi books I've ever read and I loved it immensely. I saw two Dune adaptations - first the Dune 1984 film and second Dune 2000 mini-series. From those two second one was much more close to the source IMHO. In my opinion it's all about small details, mini-series simply had much more time to reveal them all.And now we have this epic film. Now it's my favourite Dune adaptation for sure. And epic it is, truly.Yes, some details was lost. Some VERY important details I must add, such as Dr. Yueh association with Suk school and thus inability to betray.Yes, some details was changed, such as Paul assassination attempt, where he was supposed to be sleep under Dr. Yueh pill influence giving us reasonal doubt in his loyalities, but those doubts sqashed a little bit later by mere reminder of Suk school whole paradigm.But still so many more details was retained and much was added (such as whole Salusa Secondus scene or epic spaceport scene - who knew Atreides liked bagpipes, or with Emperor Herald scene). Honestly it's baffling for me how such lore-packed book (and yeah - first part of it I mean) has been abled to be condensed into movie without losing core of it.Yes it's a Villeneuve film, you need to understand it. But it was supposed to be so in my opinion. Dune as a book never was a fast-paced shooter-thriller, it was always scrupulous and meditative reflection on many themes and in Villeneuve it's got a perfect director for adaptation.If his films are not for your liking - then yeah, maybe stay away from this one.If ""Dune"" as book are not for your liking - then yeah, maybe stay away from this one.But otherwise - it's a perfect adaptation of a HUGE book and truly a must-see.I must say add i've imagined mostly all of the charaters exactly as their was portraided, i'm most certanly look forward to see Padishah Saddam, Princess Irulan and Feyd-Rautha in next film.

3283,pfwjnnmh,Just okay,5,23 October 2021,"I loved the scope, the grandeur, the worm effects, the sheer technical brilliance that Denis V. Delivers. HE is a genius and his masterpiece Arrival, is my favorite SciFi movie ever, but this one is just competent. It makes a fun HBO movie... but that's all. I liked most of the acting, Brolin, Isaac, Momoa and Bardem are standouts despite cardboard characterizations. Chalamet is engaging as Paul. Character development in general is lousy. Poor Ferguson has been given 2 emotions, tears and broody silence. What a waste of a fine actress.I feel betrayed by the ""if it does well enough we may make pt 2"". Bull. Great display of Warners lack of respect for the source material. I also feel it wasn't marketed openly as a ""Part 1""... but perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention. This movie tells part of the story well, but there is zero payoff in the end. Hero arc? Whats that? I have always wondered if the book is just too big, too good, too broad to be filmed. Now after attempt #3 (to my knowledge ) I still wonder. Lord of the Rings made superb standalone movies you hated to see end but individually worthwhile and they built to an excellent trilogy so surely this could have been handled better. Of course the Hobbit movies were just horrific, so there is that.Another huge gripe for me is the dialog, which is unintelligible in parts. Did Chalamet, Zendaya and Ferguson regularly mumble their lines or were they badly mixed? I just know I was glad to be able to turn on subtitles at several points.

They either should have done what other book based movies do is not follow the books completely, but they did so they should have made it slower. I don't really know what they should have done, all I know is that it was hard to follow for me. And then when Part Two comes out I will have forgotten part One but not much happened in Part One anyways. Probably won't be watching Part Two.",Dune

3292,yamaninoru,Empty spectacle with moments of brilliance,6,23 October 2021,"Visually, it was amazing. There's no denying that. Rebecca Ferguson was wonderful, and the best of all of the cast. However, the rest cast was largely flat and emotionless. The movie didn't really have a lot of soul. It didn't do very well at setting the political context or the stakes involved. There's so many missed opportunities to bring needed intimacy and strong character to the film. A few examples (spoilers unless readers):The love between Jessica and Leto just does not come through, and it was important to have done so. This is the heart and soul of the beginning of the story. The information gets to us that Jessica was ordered to bear only daughters, but we never understand as an audience that she not only had the ability to choose, she chose to betray the sisterhood to give her Duke a son, out of love. Where was this? It was so important. Rebecca conveyed more emotion with her acting than anyone in the film, yet this moment was not there to show their love, other than the scene in bed where Leto says almost as a throwaway ""I should have married you."" There's a more groundwork that was needed to build their relationship and it ends up feeling empty. It would have helped the film immensely to warm our hearts to the Atreides, but the film offers little to no room for this, despite the long run time.The scene with Jessica choosing Mapes was amazing. Truly tense, and it afforded both a great way to introduce some of the Fremen culture and religion, as well as the Atreides sign-speak, and even just how dangerous Lady Jessica really was. This was masterful, except that we never see Mapes again until she is lying dead. Gone are the scenes where Paul's curiosity about the Fremen lead him to some interaction with Mapes. Again, it was needed in the film, to better develop Paul, to better develop the Fremen and to give some intimate character moments, as well as to establish the setting. There is little emotional or character development of the Atreides until the battle starts and they are all killed. Just a little more time of them living in and performing their role on Arakkis would have done so much to this end, A scene with Mapes and Paul is sorely missed as are a few more character moments before the second act of the battle begins.The scene where Leto uses the poison tooth. Mostly good except that Baron Harkonnen is under-developed and not the villain he should or could have been. After the poisoning, he is seen to be floating on the ceiling whimpering, by the people coming in to clean up the bodies. This is perfect, for they should never have been able to see their terrifying Baron in such a state - except - the scene ends there and it loses the greatest needed opportunity to establish the vileness of Baron Harkonnen and the hatred he has for the Atreides. Why does he not float down and recollect himself, maybe kill those in the room, and then go into a momentary monologue and terrifying madness as he gloats and cheers over the dead Duke Leto? For the life of me, this scene ended where it did without him on the ceiling and I couldn't believe it threw away the one chance to convey this easily. In the end, Baron Harkonnen is left as a shadow of himself in the books and hasn't a single remotely terrifying or even interesting scene for him in the film, as a character. Barely intimidating at all.How about the brutality of the Harkonnen? We see nothing but Rabban lobbing off some heads, shot in a way we don't even see that, and one scene of him with an outburst to the Baron while he is in the oil tank. So where is the return outburst from the Baron that eclipses that? Where are the heart plugs and the mix of blood and oil to terrify us? How about having shown us Harkonnen brutality before they got to Arakkis, so we had reason to fear them? There was nothing. Chani's narration, in the beginning, tried to set them up as brutal oppressors, but it didn't succeed to do more then set a little context on Arakkis. Nothing to make the Harkonnen even remotely brutal or to give us cause as an audience to take Gurney's warning to Paul to heart.It goes on and on like this, with missed opportunities, keeping the audience at arm's length emotionally, while showing us amazing scenes and characters that are not developed. Even as a book reader, except for Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson was amazing, again), these were pretty empty characters, most of the performances flat and emotionless in delivery, except for Jessica and the other star of the show? Jason Momoa. He outshone everyone else except for Rebecca Ferguson, so I am left wondering how that happened.I desperately want the sequel. I want it to also cover Dune Messiah, so we see a third film and Children of Dune, with this cast and production crew. I want to think filming through the pandemic and pressures from the studio led to shortcomings. We got empty spectacle with this film, but the potential is there I think to see greatness yet.",Dune

For example when the baron has the duke captured at the table and then cutting to Paul and Jessica in the tent. The movie as a whole was very dark and the voices were very muffled.

3297,caadn,Still Chasing the White Whale,3,23 October 2021,"Herbert's original novels have been a passion of mine since an early age. Through multiple re-readings, they have held up due to the depth and complexity of their mix of compelling characters, philosophical concepts, mysticism and political intrigue which work to paint a universe of immense scope. Sadly, Villeneuve's reductionist vision comes as a crushing disappointment in light of the richness of the source material.Understandable, and even necessary, was the urge to streamline the storyline in order to make the dense original narrative comprehensible to unfamiliar audiences. This is even more the case given how much Lynch's attempt (and to a lesser degree Harrison's) struggled under its weight. However, in his quest for accessibility, Villeneuve and his screen writers cut too deep and gutted the narrative of SO much material that what makes the Dune universe truly compelling and unique is lost. The pendulum swinging so far in the opposite direction from the earlier film and mini series leave us with nothing more than just another forgettable, generic action sci-fi epic. While the universe is beautifully rendered and a visual treat to behold, very little beyond the visuals exists to recommend the film. Key elements of the social, political, ecological or anti-colonialist plots are carved out or downplayed to the point of forgettability and cliché. Key lines that could have quickly and easily added context and depth are omitted from the dialog. What remains is often underwhelming and delivered in a manner that misses accentuation of important points or conveyance of convincing and compelling emotion. This so effects characterization that the fate of the characters becomes at best an intellectual concern. Odd timing choices also exist where information that would have provided insight into the universe, character motivation and lend narrative tension are often provided either after the scenes in which they would have been most useful or so early in the film that by the time they're relevant they've been lost amongst the clutter of prior scenes and the slow drag the lack or real content turns the film into. The sheer missed opportunity Villeneuve's film represents is made even more shocking and tragic given the decision to cut the original novel into two films. With a 155-minute runtime to tell just half of the story, you would expect a significantly deeper and more nuanced tale, not one floating so much closer to the surface.While I feel Villeneuve's approach to Dune was attempted with much more artistry and reverence for the source material, it nonetheless reminds me of Verhoeven's treatment of Heinlein's Starship Troopers, another conceptually rich novel that did not deserve the cinematic abuse it received. Villeneuve, with what feels like some more or less simple changes regarding direction and the screenplay, could have delivered to us not just a visually stunning film containing the action he was clearly aiming for, but also one that preserved Dune's more cerebral nature that has made the novels so engrossing for so many.As has been the case for Villeneuve's directorial predecessors, the challenge of Dune has proven to be too much. Hopefully, we won't need to wait another 25 years for someone with greater vision to make an attempt to deliver the adaptation both Herbert's novels, and we as an audience, deserve.",Dune
3298,grahamandrewthomson,So slow,4,23 October 2021,Villeneuve had the chance to make a great movie but instead ruined a great movie.Each scene could have been cut by 5 seconds with an unnecessary lingering look into the distance or a comment of he has locked the door after they see him lock the door and run up and can't open it.Even the dialog seemed to be deliberetly slowed down. Especially in the first hour as if the director asked for that.How many slow 30second landscape pans does it take ruin a movie probably about 30.The movie could easily have been cut from 2hours 35min to 1hour 50min and would have massively enhanced the flow and excitement of the film.Villeneuve had had 2 attempts to improve on classic films and has failed on both occasions with the same issue. He has tried to turn classic sci fi movie into slow artistic films and it just doesn't work.I am done with Villeneuve. He has ruined dune and blade runner.,Dune
3299,pts-51215,"Finally, a film worthy of the novel",10,23 October 2021,Villeneuve has made a rare thing - a film based on a book that is friendly to newcomers but does not disappoint fans of the original work. Seeing it in a theater is a must.,Dune

3302,jameswigman,A fantastic adaptation of a great book!,9,23 October 2021,"I'm a recent discoverer of Dune, reading the first book earlier this year after being suggested in by numerous people as I mentioned my anticipation for the Villeneuve's adaptation.Denis had quite the mantle to take up trying to bring this complex and massive story to the screen once again and I believe he's done it. The films long run time almost seems too short and I'm already eagerly awaiting part two!Some things have been changed during the adaptation such as characters, and the language used, such as the step away from the eastern and Islamic themes which is an iconic part to the Dune universe to suit Western audiences which is a shame. However I believe it's sort of justified for the sake of making it appeal more to the audience, albeit a disappointing one to have to do.The cinematography is stellar and I'd be very surprised if it doesn't pick up an Oscar for it, alongside the incredible CGI work and good costume design the film in itself already has a great backdrop for a story revered amongst the sci-fi community. Not to mention the acting, sound design and its brilliant soundtrack which seems fresh in comparison to Hans Zimmers usual work.So the story itself, as aforementioned a very complex one to put onto film and Villeneuve definitely knew this and I'm so glad he stuck by his plan to make it into two parts because it could not be told otherwise. When the 1984 Dune was made, apparently viewers in cinema were given a leaflet explaining various parts of the universe such as who was who, what spice was, etc. Doing something like this these days just would not work sadly, however Denis has done a brilliant job with pacing and exposition to help offset that.The film tells you all the important pieces at a good rate to not overwhelm the viewer. Rarely does it get too complicated and I cannot fault him when it does, there is so much to the Dune universe to try and explain and Denis even attempting this is a great act in itself. I truly believe he has done it and done it extremely well. Multiple scenes in the film are almost exactly how I imagined them when reading the book and it just felt wonderful to see them on the big screen.I cannot really say much bad about it, my only real gripe is the aforementioned step away from the eastern and Islamic themes which is iconic to the universe and the recasting/changing of characters, Id argue unnecessarily.It's also the first time in a very long time of going to the cinema where EVERYONE was quiet because they were all engaged to the film. I heard several people mentioning that they didn't want it to stop and neither did I.I have a feeling Denis Villeneuve has once again taken the sci-fi genre up a gear and Im confident we are going to see a lot more sci-fi films in the next few years that will be trying to ride in the boat alongside Dune.Please go see it for yourself though, It may be a long movie but it truly is an epic in every sense of the word. I cannot wait for the second part.",Dune
3303,cmbmwc,most boring movie ive ever watched,1,24 October 2021,"God i hated that movie! I hated it so much! They started like 30 different storylines and resolved none of them, and somehow managed to still be boring! I got my hopes up for the five separate times i thought it was going to end and wanted to bash my head into the wall every time it kept going! I didn't know how much hate i could harbor toward a film until dune ! The only interesting part was sandy the worm and as soon as it went back under the sand after its 38 seconds of screentime i lost complete interest. I can't believe they made 2.5 hrs of scifi movie and made every single part uninteresting. I was being rude and checking the time every now and again, my only thought being, is it going to end soon???

It is best watched on the largest screen you have.I've watched it a few times, and wow is it thrilling to finally see such an incredible sci-fi movie on the big screen again. It is tastefully refreshing and supplies some much needed juice to the genre. I can not wait for this saga to continue.The story is gripping once you understand it, you may have to read a brief summary of the book to fully understand what is going on. But after that you can just take in the design of the space ships, the costumes, the factions, and the monsters. Let alone the knockout performances by the cast.If you're looking for something to bring you back to a more Star Wars side of sci-fi, while maintaining a more higher realism.

3309,lechrogulski,Should have been either 4 hrs long and complete or not done at all,5,24 October 2021,"No denying, the visuals and CGI are spectacular. As are both the lead and support performances. Pace is good, considering source material, which is basically a philosophical sci-fi with little action.It could have been great.What went wrong then? You either do the whole thing or just forgo doing it at all. The relatively short novel is cut in half. I get that explaining the Dune universe or some relevant background was necessary. But it wasn't actually what we experienced in this ""part one"". Lynch film had done so much better, showing the imperial court, navigators and the space travel. Sure, its CGI looked horrible even by contemporary standards. But still it managed to cover the story in one go with audiences being able to understand most things. Of course voiceovers are now passe so we get a lot of needless minutes and even then viewers unfamiliar with the novel may struggle.The new Dune fails in my opinion because it's simply half of the film it should have been. Had they been really bold and gone for a 4 hrs full story wrapped with magnificent visuals and such a splendid cast it would have been one of the greatest sci-fi epics of all times. Now it's hard to imagine that part two (if it materializes at all) will keep us thrilled in anticipation. Now that we've seen what we've seen it simply will not have such an impact. Especially in 2+ years that will have likely passed.PS. Another possibility to make most of the short novel is to just make things up that were not in the book. See Hobbit. They wanted a triliogy so they just decided to lengthen the story artificially. It was shallow and meaningless in some parts but worked.",Dune

The touted complexity of the source material is no more complex than our own society. Indeed, with no ""thinking machines"", we are given a clearer, starker, higher contrast sociological mirror. The stoic mix of classical, medieval, and future/brutalist aesthetic - accused of being unimaginative - is an intentionally retrospective canvas on which the conflicted, terse drama can stand out truthfully and vividly.

This film made me feel uncomfortable and sit on the edge of my seat. It was absolutely stunning. Having not read dune and not being a book Purist I thought it was adapted in a way that no matter if you read the books or not, you could actually understand it.

The dialogue was muffled and not helped by loud inappropriate music.The whole thing was so drawn out, yet still managing not to develop any characters or give any context to these 'houses', the Emperium, or the witchy women.As for the special effects, well was nothing special about them.If felt like a lot of sand and bugger all else, watching this felt more like a penance than a pleasure.If you want a sci-fi film with lots of sand, but much more action, better character definition, context and clear sound quality then watch Star Wars: A New Hope (or the 1984 version of Dune, which is infinitely better with the baddies having real menace and much more clarity about the narrative).",Dune

The last thirty minutes were the only okay part, Zendaya finally showed up, even though she just stood in the background watching Paul compete in yet another fight that does not even comply with the plot.The trailer was so misleading, they basically only showed flashbacks and visions from the movie, not actual scenes.The only aspects of the movie I actually enjoyed is the aesthetics and soundtrack.Trust me when I say that during the movie, more than a few times I thought ""I could be sleeping or watching something else that I actually enjoy instead of sitting through this""

This film has come so close that I cannot wait to see a continuation of the series. Herbert included so much detail in his novels that it is impossible to convey them all in a film. Herbert fans will understand the minutiae but novices could use some explanation through short features. Suspensors, chair dogs, Gom Jabar, Family Nukes, Shari Hulid, thumpers, maker hooks, sand trout, firemen ways.

The cast looks good, though a few scenes needed a few extra takes and a few lines got an eyeroll. Beautiful design, like that WAS a Thopter, and the cultural choices worked, though nervous about the guild navigators now, I'm expecting a megamind fish in that head now. Love the litany being done and some scenes gave me chills for how much like the book they felt. However, there was not only minimal book lines in the movie, making it feel like someone was ashamed of the dialogue, which is just rude. Biggest issue is there was so much cut that it not only felt weird but not like Dune in far too much of this movie. Outright missing characters for one, and not small ones, and the film adjusted and lost whole concepts to remove them. One of my favorite scenes is in chapter 17 between Thufir and Jessica. It's a mirrored theme throughout every Dune book I've read. The blindness and foolish rush to judge or act against others for various causes and the use as well as restraint of power. Jessica was amazing in that scene and I wish ONE director would actually appreciate how important it is.Changes to some scenes were also strange, one Kines scene was pretty cool on the surface but all the important contemplations had in that moment were lost. The Duke acted less than complex in several scenes where he showed why he was so charismatic and deep, pity as I liked the actor. I just don't know what to say, fun sci-fi flick, the tent scene will not disappoint especially for at least some complexity but it's lost enough that I have settled on the idea this needs to be a full series, possibly by the guy who made the 2003 version as he basically saved the it from the 2001 or at least someone who isn't afraid of the dialogue, certain themes and characters.",Dune

Vladimir Harkonnen and Gaius Helen Mohiam, same.Bad interpretation of the book: many of them, but most disturbing was the Fremen desert walking. They were supposed to have an arrythmic, silent walking, for kilometers, not that ""dance"", with jumps and leaps (I tried myself and couldn't make more than 100 meters distance).

3342,gkwpvdvp,Dune Part I,8,25 October 2021,"To talk about generally, the movie did not surprised me at all, because for me they overrated the movie on the social media and about the casting; seeing Zendaya on the screen for maximum 10 minutes upset me because in the announcements or in the gala they gave same importance to her as they did to Timothée and I think that is a bit brutal. I also could not help but notice they have written her name above Timothée's so that is quite unfair too. I'm not a big fan of him but he did a pretty good job as the lead actor in this movie. Also I think that Oscar Isaac was a bit weak for this role (sorry).Also, as a big portion of audience have told before, it was a bit Star Wars-ish. When I first saw the banner I thought that the cape guy was Kenobi but I did some research and the book was published before the Star Wars and there are rumors that George Lucas had the idea from this book.Lastly I did not like the ""Dune Part I."" from the beginning because we already know that it will be series of movies but I think they should not make it so obvious.",Dune

3344,david-28023,Best DUNE adaptation,10,25 October 2021,"I am a huge fan of the Dune books. I have read them many many times. My son has never read them, nor seen a Dune movie. He and I went together. We both made sure not to look at anything regarding the movie other than the one trailer he watched before he asked me to go.I liked the 1984 movie - it was cool, but not very close to the books. I liked it though, as I thought it was a good telling, but it missed (and changed) so much.I really liked the Sci-fi miniseries - I thought that it was close to the books, but still was a miss.Then My son and I went to the theaters to watch this (in 3D). He HATES 3d, so I didn't tell him we were doing a 3D version until we got there. When we went in, we didn't even know this was only part one.When we saw the Part One on the screen, we were both excited and hopeful that they had already planned a sequel.In his words, the 3D started a bit off - the moving sand opening was blurry. (moments later we could see why - it was on purpose). But in the end, he commented the 3D didn't feel like a gimmick, or took away from the flow, but instead enhanced it and made the immersion deeper.The representation of the DUNE technology was wonderful. The Stillsuits look like they could actually work, and all the key components are there. The first time I saw an Ornithopter on the screen, I almost jumped from my seat - that is what an Ornithopter is supposed to look like. Everything is thought out. Even the carvings on the walls, the layout of the buildings, the fences and shield wall - all looked perfect - even showing details that were only hinted at in the books.The acting was great. From the many times I have read the books, I felt I knew the characters. I had an advantage that I understood their inner motivations, so I could SEE how the actors were expressing them. Stellan Skarsgård gave me chills as the Baron Harkonnen. The look was perfect, the mannerisms spot on, with a little channeling of Brando. He made Baron Harkonnen frightening. Dave Bautista is spot on as the Beast Rabban. Jason Momoa is great as Duncan Idaho. He captured the original character well, but gave Duncan a little more ""oomph"". Josh Brolin did a wonderful job as Gurney Halleck, but I wish he could have had a hair more screen time (and played the Baliset) - it might be in deleted scenes. Rebecca Ferguson figured out how to show Jessica's inner (and mostly hidden) emotions, and once you got to know her, she told stories with her eyes in silence. The rest of the cast is just as spot on.There were some minor changes to story points - but I felt it simplified (and shortened) the telling, and some events that were in the book were completely left out, though the scene may have been set up visually. I expect when we get a ""deleted scenes"" release, we'll see that they were there and just trimmed for time. In the end, it didn't leave anything important out, though a few minor characters were left completely undeveloped.The pacing was great. It was more of a character story than the classic Sci-Fi ""pew-pew"" that we see so often. My son only counted 5 times a projectile weapon was fired, 2 lasguns (it might have been 3) and a couple of missile barrages.The Combat is very up-close and personal (as it is in the book) - there are a few mass battle scenes, but they are not the focus.As it finished, and we left the theater, we discussed the movie as we always do. My son's opinion is that it was the best movie he had ever seen. It didn't try to stand on gimmicks or Sci-Fi technology or creatures. It stood on it's own. It is a people story. And the story is carried by the acting and directing in a way that I haven't seen in a while.They nailed it. Looking forward to part 2. (now where's my time machine?...)",Dune

Hans Zimmer did again do an amazing job. The music in the film was beautiful there were moments where I got chills all over my body, the vibrations of the music were sometimes so loud that you could feel it in your feet and throat.Casting was also amazing, but I didn't understand why Zendaya got so much interviews when she wasn't seen a lot in the film. I hope that in the next parts her role will be more explained. I loved that every actor in this film could show their emotions so much and so beautiful.Not to forget the costumes were absolutely stunning. Especially the dresses that Rebecca as Lady Jessica wore. Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan, great work.I wouldn't give it a ten, because of the fast pacing and the ambiguity sometimes.Because of the visuals and the amazing actors I give it a 7.",Dune

There is nothing wrong with being chosen while you could keep the self-effacing tint of the hero like Neo or Aragorn.

Little context is given to the events of the film, but the reasonable viewer will get a general understanding of it. I wish there was some more character development and we were given more of a reason to care about the protagonist(s), as well. Despite this, however, I rarely felt bored because of just how immersive the film is. The universe is put together so well by Villeneuve it rarely felt boring (its first act was a little too long).

Remember, this is someone that loved Blade Runner 2049 and I thought that movie used it's long run time appropriately. This movie, though, seems to have something off about it that is hard to pinpoint. It's rushed but also feels like its dragging its feet at the same time somehow. The motivations of characters were virtually non existent. Two characters die before you really even care about them at all. They tried to give a heroic death to (x) but it just ends up feeling so forced and expected. Zendaya (Chani) plays almost no part at all in the movie despite being marketed as if she's a main character.

Denis Villeneuve did an amazing job making this new world fairly easy to take in, and i never felt overwhelmed or disoriented.What i believe makes this peice stand out from other modern movies is the pace of the storytelling, taking a slower pace and going more into details which makes it easier for the audience to comprehend whats happening and building a understanding for the world. To compare with other similar modern movies i feel like the focus have shifted from making great storytelling to showing of cool special effects. I would take the new star-wars movies for an example which i feel are a disaster. I feel like the older movies which couldn't rely upon special effects had to nail the storytelling. And Denis Villeneuve complete nailed the story with Dune!What about the visuals? The camera work, special effects, editing and music cant be overlooked... this movie is mesmerising to watch, you could probably be satisfied even as blind or deaf. The planets we get the se, the character design, the machines, the rain, the sand, THE MUSIC! I get goosebumps thinking back to it and i can't quite get my head around it.To summarise, i feel like everything a movie needs to have to be good, Dune delivers. And what captured me was again the pace of the movie really taking the time every scene needs to make it whole, which obviously leads to the ending that we didn't get the full story in a two and a half hour movie, we need the second part. And even tho it hasn't been confirmed and it will take years before we get there, i cant wait for the second part, and personally i think there is definitely enough material to make it into a trilogy. But after this, i feel comfortable that Denis Villeneuve will make the right decisions. He and the cast is incredibly talented and will not disappoint. The review speaks for it self, go and watch it if u haven't already. And im happy to say this really are a modern masterpiece! :)",Dune

I'm extremely happy to say that this movie surpassed all of my expectations and I can't wait for part 2.The cinematography is nothing short of a masterpiece. Every single scene in this movie is a spectacle. Absolutely watch this in IMAX if you can, it's well worth the ticket price.The casting is perfect from my understanding of the characters. Each actor put their heart into their characters, and nobody felt out of place. I can't recall a single poorly given line.The pacing is also great. For a movie to keep my attention for 2 and a half hours, it has to be well paced with engrossing scenes and dialog throughout. I was able to follow the lore and motivations for everyone's actions perfectly fine without having to look anything up afterwards. The film was never boring, and I never found myself checking the time to see if it was almost over.The only thing keeping this at a 9 rather than a 10 is that this movie is very clearly setting up the second movie, rather than being an at least semi-conclusive story of it's own.

You can just feel the depravity and horror exhibited by this ruthless and disgusting man. Unbelievable in how great this role has been played.Lady Jessica. I can't begin to describe how terribly this role has been played in contrast to the character as written in the book. The series portrays Jessica as a steadfast holder of generations of knowledge brought from the teachings of a sisterhood that has survived over ten thousand years. She was raised a warrior, taught how to control every aspect of her body (to include the biochemical make-up of her metabolism). She's a warrior, that holds the secrets of a martial art so deadly that she's the better of almost any human in existence. In the movie, she's an emotional mess prone to tears. A far cry from a royal, warrior priestess. Just a terrible example of a key character.I feel that the first movie left a lot on the table, but with a story with such depth of characters and story lines, there's a lot to cover.",Dune

Sci-Fi's most influencial saga gets the adaptation it deserved at last.,9,27 October 2021,"DUNE was a blast, I went to see it on IMAX this afternoon with a friend, it was marvelous. I could feel every page suddenly emerge from the book into the screen. Timothee was...well Timothee (hot as always), besides the entire cast was skillful as I thought they would be. The only thing I thought was a bit left out is the concept of the mentat, like Thufir Hawat's character, they never clarified their powers for what they are because they're initially human super computers. I remember them showing Thufir roll his eyes to make a precise calculation that a regular man couldn't possibly pull off, but that's still not enough. Paul's prescient dreams were fantastic and his outburst in the Fremkit tent near the beginning of the second half showed exactly the tragic and dramatic nature of his character. The Duke Leto's death scene was incredibly shot. I loved it, in fact I loved it so much that it made me want to read the first book again and not mind if the second part doesn't get made. I got a taste of what I wanted and the story panned out just like I imagined it, 4.9/5 for me!! WHAT A SHOW!!!",Dune

3372,jeffreylovejoy,Just another remake,7,27 October 2021,"Every 20 years or so, a Director decides he needs to remake Dune into his own vision. In 1984 we were introduced to the world of Dune, at that time what seemed like a cinematic marvel. However, that movie failed to capture the true spirit of the books.In 2000 we were re-introduced to the world of Dune by the Syfy channel in a miniseries. While some parts of it were more visually stunning than the original movie, the special effects seem to at times be very amateurish. However, this adaptation did captures the true spirit of the books and became my favorite version.This latest version hosts a number of movie stars which we have seen in the Star Wars, Marvel, & DC universes, as well as other movie genres. While this latest adaptation is visually stunning and brings a modern twist to the Dune books, I feel that the movie at times feels overproduced, and we don't get to see elements which we had seen in previous adaptations. The lack of a visualization of the sandworms seems to stand out the most, plus we are not really given a background of the Wierding Way, and the mysteries surrounding the ""witches"" of the Bene Gesserits.I am also beginning to find the need to produce movies in parts becoming very tiring. I can sit through a four hour movie; that's no problem. I know that there are budgets to consider, but if you're going to produce a movie on this scale why not just do the whole thing in one shot?

Special effects were great. Actors, and their actual acting, were great.But the movie itself was 2+ hours of boredom, with about 5 minutes of actually interesting film.

Gender changes? So freaking what, they are minor roles to begin with, it's not like they made Paul into a Paulina.That said, this is a dark movie in that there is little to no humor but that really doesn't deter those who want a good movie with a good story and good world building. They are trying to fit A LOT into this movie, while it could use some good banter, funny moments or even light moment, it's still an enjoyable and epic story.My one complaint is that many of the characters, especially main ones, tend to deliver lines as monotone as possible and sometimes the acting seems a little wooden, which is confusing because there are certain scenes where the actors break away from that and display emotion which is believable. I'm guessing it's just the direction they wanted to take in this but it is a bit disappointing and the movie feels a little heavy because of it.",Dune

Maybe people felt nostalgia because they read the book, but I was bored out of my mind while watching this. I actually fell asleep the first time I tried. There's no reason for this movie to be 2 and a half hours. The dialogue is long and drawn out without needing to be. There's long pauses where it pans to characters in an attempt to display their emotions, but it just feels like unnecessary filler. I really didn't care about any of the characters as there wasn't proper build up to make me invested in them. Overall a very boring dry film which matches with the desert setting.",Dune
3383,nicolaescustefan,A much needed breath of SCI-FI air,9,28 October 2021,"Just saw Dune in IMAX - overall a great experience, a much needed breath of SCI-FI air, a big leap from the cartoonish star-wars-like movies from the last decades.What I was impressed the most was NOT the visuals (kind of hard to surprise us with anything new in regards to CGI), but the sounds!Don't get me wrong - the visuals are great but the sound-track is serious... almost solemn, not cartoonish like in StarWars and not colorful or dreamy like in Interstellar or The Martian, but serious and cold and powerful, and it fits perfectly with the desaturated color-palette and the mood of the movie, and it also fits perfectly with the loud sound-effects.These + the acting are the ""Pros"" and it's enough to make it great, but I have some ""Cons"":1. The Atreides time on Arrakis was really short, almost rushed. Because of this it felt like.. why would the emperor move them to Arrakis at all and not just kill them directly? Why so much trouble to move out a house and bring another in if you wouldn't at least give them a chance to fail so you can justify your drastic actions against them?2. where is Jason Momoa's run through the desert that he was complaining about so much in the interviews?3. it felt strange that Jessica was so afraid of Paul meeting the Reverend Mother (great scene btw) but really calm when he offered himself to fight for her TO THE DEATH....4. Also... she looked she could take care of herself... besting even Stilgar... why ask Paul to fight for her? Ok maybe this is from the books but they could have down-played her fighting a bit...5. Duncan said a Fremen almost killed him cause they are great fighters, but it takes Jessica 3 seconds to submit Stilgar? And as leader he should be their best fighter...
Also Paul beats this guy (supposedly a good fighter as per Chani) with ease. So Paul > Duncan as a fighter?(Jason Momoa even said in an interview that Duncan Idaho is a better fighter than Kahl Drogo :))6. Weirding Way... did I miss it? Was it so subtle that I have to watch the movie again?7. The doctor serving an entire planet to their death for his wife plot seemed kind of weak .And the ""I promised I would free you just like her"" line was a bit cliché. Again, it's like in the book but maybe they could have served us this in another way to feel better... in tone with this movie's standards8. The fight-scenes setup felt a little ""Hollywood"". The way they would prepare us, like Duncan locking the door behind himself.. was like - here we go... fight scene! It's good but cheesy9. If Gurney is actually dead I feel betrayed, because they build him and poof - he's just gone?10. The finale: So...the Fremen catch the two. They say kill her and take him. Then they fight a bit and Jessica capture Stilgar, so they say - ok, ok, both of you can come, just put your weapons down - Deal! And then they say - no, actually she can't come unless someone will fight this guy to the death. Looks like they kind of went back on their word....I would give it 8,5/10, and my biggest problem was it was too short. Big characters like Stilgar, Duncan, Gurney get only a couple of minutes on screen in total.Javier Bardem could have filmed his scenes in half a day.Maybe because I went to this movie with high expectations I left thinking - It's good but it could have been better...",Dune

It is a very drawn out movie that i couldn't help but sleep through a lot of it. I had never watched the original Dune from 1984, as i was hoping this remake would fill me in... but i was left completely lost for the entire movie. It had no pace and lacked anything spectacular.

They all had a dozen lines and got a few minutes of pointless screen time each at best though. For a 2.5 hour movie thats pretty unexcusable.Negatives for the movie- everything else, seriously. Storyline was drawn out and meandering. All the characters have the depth of cardboard, which also could describe their emotional range during this movie. Sound was done by a partially deaf person. The whispering dialogue was almost inaudible and the half baked action scenes try to knock your socks off by blowing your ear drums out.

It's been on my reading list for years and I was not disappointed. Awesome book, highly recommended.So I was very aware that the film could be a major disappointment.Arthur C Clarke described Dune as without comparison, except perhaps Lord of the Rings. In terms of the film adaptation, this is true again. Wonderful, sensitive and clever adaptation. Enough originality to be loyal to the source material and enough minor changes to bring it to life in modern cinema.Perfect, not quite. Could it realistically have been any better? Certainly not.Stunning visuals, brilliant design, dialogue lifted from the original pages and pretty good acting all around.

The visuals and music score are worth the money alone. Hans Zimmer NEVER disappoints and I HIGHLY recommend going to a dolby or IMAX theater. The cast, oh my god, the cast! Tim, Jason, Oscar, Rebecca, everyone, they brought these characters to life! You could tell the passion for the roles was present in the scenes. The X factor in this movie to however, is the lore. The details in every scene leave you informed but even more curious. I feel like 2 parts may not be enough for this Universe.

3395,Springgh,Why is this rated so high??,2,30 October 2021,"Seriously though, why do people rate this so high?The visuals and the score are outstanding but like...that't all.The movie drags on forever yet acheives absolutely nothing. The ending scene is literally where the story starts. Now this wouldn't have been a problem had it been the case with the first episode of a series. But this is a movie and thus has to be able to tell a story of its own. The fact that this is the begining of a trilogy does't excuse the vague storytelling and horrible pacing.And don't get me started on the charactars. The MC has literally zero personality, let alone the rest of charactars. Dune introduces us to a huge number of different charactars and I know for a fact that I am not the only one who got puzzled and put off by this. Yet none of these get any peoper introduction or development. This very problem makes the movie excrusiatingly mundane and unbearable.And lastly, the climax to this movie was Anti-climatic. Just like every other action scene or those helicopter moments, it was suposed to be interesting but it was't. The movie simply faild to make me feel for the charactors, even the MC. Therefore, I couldn't care less about the final battle and its outcome. I only rated this 2 and not 1 because of the two points I mentioned above that I found actually good.",Dune

The start of this remake was a warning by the mid pronounced Hark-O-nnens with Hark-a-nnens. The decapitations wasn't necessary. No need for that. I guess because I read the book and loved the original, I found it hard to enjoy the remake. They tried to hard to make it a action adventure . Dune lovers loved the original for the story. This remake focused more on all the fancy pyrotechnics and forced action. I'm 57 so maybe it's just me but we grew up with a saying , if if ain't broke , don't fix it. Again why can't Hollywood writes come up with new material instead of all remakes of great classics. Just found myself criticizing and comparing this to the original.

I could go on about how marvel has shaped our short attention spans in consuming movies today but I won't. Nonetheless, I throughly enjoyed watching Dune as a viewer who had never read the book or was familiar with its universe. In hindsight I would've read up on the dune universe to have some background as the movie itself explains partial elements of itself. If you go into the movie with little knowledge of Dune you can piece together the framework of the story without knowing all of the inner workings of its universe.

Some overviews were okay but even those were just all in the same tones. And probably couldn't even get the sea to be level in the shot. You can see the wind blowing very hard and yet you hear none of it.Their conversations crystal clear in a studio room with some music. I just have to end this somewhere, my list would go on and on about being disappointed and surprised about the score this movie has gotten so far.The color of the film felt like all it could do was turn the exposure down to make it look more serious, with the scenes pasted together feeling chaotic and I'm not talking about the visions
I'm forced to watch the second part but so far this movie can't hold a candle to the old one. Where is the madness of the Harkonnen leader or Bautista acting very tame, neat and obeying. Where is the fear that these people radiate in how they act and do because they are a brutal race of people selected by strength and cunning?!Ships fly in and do things and you can barely hear the sound effects above the music. Missing the impact (huge) ships have.Was there no one weathering some costumes here and there.I feel like people are voting high because it has the name Dune and the story of it is cool. If it's trying to portray just faithfulness to the book and squeeze out as many sequels I could just stick to reading the book where I have that kind of time reserved for it.Or is this all about giving new actors a chance.

Josh Brolin just disappears in the darkness. Poor Stellan Skarsgård, hours of make up apparently, and no great dialogue scene with Oscar Isaac. I remember how Skarsgård was brilliant in Chernobyl, but here? Just wasted. I think Jason Momoa had more lines than Brolin and Skarsgård combined, which is just so wrong.The 1984 film had lots of voice over narration throughout. But at least you understood the Dune universe. Where were the space guild navigators? I was looking forward to seeing what they might look like in 2021. But nothing. They're kind of the whole point.

3415,cmjmarshall,Brilliant for fans of the book,9,4 November 2021,"I read Dune in my late teens maybe 5 years after Herbert published it. After a lifetime of reading SF it remains iconic for me - flawed, maybe but one of the greatest pieces of world-building in the genre. I hated Lynch's galloping, unpersuasive adaptation in the 80s because it utterly failed to deliver the immersive experience that one got from what was, admittedly, a behemoth of a book.Villeneuve, however, has done Herbert full justice. It's a testament to the faithfulness of his adaptation (and to the impression the book made on me 50 years ago) that I actually recognised some of the dialogue as having been lifted straight from the original. And visually, the film is stunning, a remarkable evocation of the desert world. At no point did I, as a fan of the book, find myself thinking ""that's wrong"". In my experience of film adaptations I'd say that's close to unique.I can see, however, that those unfamiliar with the book might struggle with the pacing. This is a big, sprawling story and it unfolds at a languorous pace. Coming to it fresh you might wish that it provided a bit more context earlier, so that you were better able to understand that some of the slower passages would turn out to be essential exposition for later. But stick with it. It's absolutely worth it. And book your seats for part 2 in 2023.",Dune

This gave me similar vibes to when I first watched the Fellowship of the Ring and for me this is another epic that will stand the test of time, ranking up there with the LoTR movies.

3424,alexanderbrianhayes,Why is everyone raving about this movie?,2,5 November 2021,"This is supposed to be a faithful interpretation of the book, but you're left feeling that nothing is explained. If you want to know what is actually going on you should read the book because you won't have any idea watching this film. Everything is hinted at and nothing is explained and as a result your left with the bare basics of the plot. Why it took two and a half hours to elaborate it I do not know. The book Dune is basically a combination of a story about revenge and coming of age. Basic things which annoyed me were: in the book Gaius Helen Mohiam asks when Paul tells her of his dreams ""Do you know her?"" and he answers ""I will"". The film fails to certify the veracity of Paul's prophetic dreams. The mentat and their exceptional computing skills were not explained at all. Nor was it pointed out that Paul was being trained to be a mentat. Worse from a plot point of view Yueh and his imperial conditioning were not explained. The entire subplot of Jessica being framed as a traitor was cut so the significance of Yueh's tatoo becomes irrelevant. Most of the scenes between Leto and Paul were a departure from the source material and just embarrassing. The failure to even introduce Feyd-Rautha in the first film is mind-boggling. He should be the main antagonist in the second film but he hasn't even put in an appearance yet. Basically, the story was cut to the bare bones and left you wondering why what remained took so long to screen. Admittedly, the previous David Lynch film took some wild and wonderful liberties with its source material, but in other ways it was more faithful to the book. This film was just long and gutted like a long dead fish of any depth.",Dune

3427,mdeckett,Movies like this is why I love the cinema!,9,6 November 2021,"When I was young, I saw snippets of David Lynch's Dune on TV, and I remember feeling intrigue by it; there was something about it's atmosphere and vibe that resonated with me. However, when I actually saw the full movie years later as an adult, I found it deeply flawed despite containing some really good elements; I felt like it was a huge missed opportunity.I've read the book and IMO, this movie met and surpassed my expectations. The atmosphere, cinematics, acting, cast choices, costumes, artwork, special effects, music and direction are all stellar. It's staggering how people can be so talented and even more so when they combine their efforts to produce a colossal masterpiece like this.From the moment the film began I was fully engrossed and transported to another world. I'm also very happy that they decided to split the book into at least two movies. There is simply too much material to cover in just one movie as I'm sure David Lynch would agree.I also want to give a shout out to the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson. When I heard that she was cast in the role of Jessica, I was slightly disappointed because I had always pictured Jennifer Connolly in the role (I still think she would have done a good job). However, Rebecca absolutely delivered and she is impressing me more and more with her acting ability; I also thought she was fantastic in Doctor Sleep.Put it like this, if you like a serious, deep, science fiction movie that will give you a genuine escapism experience, then watch this movie in the cinema while you can. It's made for the big screen. Movies like this are why I love cinema!",Dune

3440,elanpromusic,"Mediocre As Standalone, Pathetic as Adaptation",5,9 November 2021,"Having little faith in modern Hollywood movies I went into the theater with zero expectations on this one. For backstory I am a fairly big fan of the dune series and have read the books many times as well as having seen the '84 version and the sci-fi miniseries multiple times. The short of it is that while I feel this is a fairly decent sci-fi movie in it's own right, it is a rather poor adaptation of a great novel and inferior to both prior attempts to bring this story to the screen.People like to bash Lynch's version, which certainly had some serious issues, but in my opinion '84 Dune was WAY BETTER in every way (except visually). I also feel that the '84 version was truer to the novel in most regards (having read it 4 times). This new version leaves so many vital details out it's ridiculous. No mention of what mentats are, no spacing guild navigators and their intrigue with the emperor, we haven't even seen the emperor and his daughter Irulan yet (who is the narrator in the novel and '84 Dune) nor Feyd Ruatha, Paul's' evil counterpart. Maybe we'll get some of that in the sequel? Even if so they should have included them in this one, it would have given more insight into the story for new viewers.You would think with 2 1/2 hours for just half of the story they could have been truer to the book, but they seem to make minor changes every chance they get, usually in ways that seemed insignificant one way or the other so not sure why they changed it. For instance the scene where the worm swallows the spice harvester. Instead of the carryall not showing up (due to Harkonnen sabotage), as happened in novel/'84, in '21 Dune the carryall breaks one of its grapple arms and has to disengage. What was the point of changing this? They even downplay the fact that the Duke was more concerned about the men in the harvester than the spice it held. This greatly impressed the ecologist Liet Kynes, which they kind of alluded to in the movie but again it is it is downplayed because you cannot hear her thoughts (which is portrayed in '84 Dune through voice-overs)And then they changed some super important things like when Paul sheds a tear for Jamis after he kills him in the duel. The Fremen are amazed that he would give water to the dead, and this plays into his mystique as their Messiah. That to me is really important stuff and not sure why someone who claims to be such a big fan of the book would leave it out. I don't care about changing men to women or white to black or whatever that's all fine with me (though I'm not sure why they didn't make Liet Kynes be Chani''s mother in '21D, since in the novel/'84 he was a man who was her father?). But they cut vital plot points out and replaced them with a bunch of meaningless scenes of Paul sticking his hand in water, which were pretty and ""artsy"" I suppose, but really? You're going to reduce Piter de Vries, the Harkonnen mentat, to a side actor with a couple lines before he gets killed and instead give us a bunch of long scenes looking into Paul's eyes that gave me flashbacks of the original '79 Star Trek film?!! Pyter was such a diabolical character in the book, and played beautifully by Brad Dourif (of LOTR Wormtongue fame) in 84' Dune.And to address the voice overs in 84' Dune, anyone who's read the novel knows that it is incredibly psychological in nature and much of the text is what is taking place inside characters minds. In my opinion this is the primary reason why it is so hard to convey this movie to film (although the massive scope of the story and universe would also be very challenging for any filmmaker). '84 Dune tries to portray this aspect of the novel through voice-over monologues, usually taken directly from the novel word for word, and is fairly successful in my opinion. '21 Dune opts not to address the internal dialogues at all, which to me just gave everything a very cold and surface appearance without really any insight into what was going on with the characters. I really felt that most of them had zero chemistry with each other as well, especially Leto and Jessica. Jessica's love for Leto was the only reason she bore him a son against all her Bene Gesserit responsibilities and training. I didn't feel that love and devotion between them in '21 Dune, but I definitely did in '84 Dune. Overall the casting for '21 Dune was decent, but off in places (especially Timothy as Paul, who looks like he belongs in one of the Twilight movies). That is an unfair comparison I suppose between this cast and '84D, because how can you compare with the likes of Kyle McLachlan, Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, and Brad Dourif to name a few (and a ripped young Sting of course) alongside a soundtrack by Toto and Brian Eno? My lady crystallized it for me when she said the character she felt the most emotional connection with in the whole movie was the desert mouse lol.But the special effects in '21 Dune are way better of course, and for many that will be the most important consideration. Add this remake to another long list of movies (including Lord of the rings) that if you really want to experience the story you just have to read the book. And if you are unable/unwilling to do that then watch '84 Dune or the sci-fi miniseries as they are both WAY closer to the story than this hyped up snore fest.",Dune

Villeneuve has managed to wrangle this material in a way that Lynch wasn't quite able- not that I don't enjoy the '84 version of Dune.However after seeing this new film, it's essentially unwatchable for me now. There's just so much voice-over exposition-dumping going on in the Lynch version, it's maddening!Dune 2021 manages to convey all of the plot points and imagery of Lynch's version in a purely cinematic way- it doesn't bother to Tell.It simply Shows.Those unfamiliar with the source material may be lost in the sauce but for those who have truly been waiting for this epic to unfurl in all its glory, the wait is over...this is it!Also extremely important- Hans Zimmer's score is magnificent!

Paul Atreides had some emotional scenes but other than that there were hardly characters expressing emotions.CGI: the thopters and the blue/red forcefield effects were great. The sandworm was supposed to be 400 meters long but just the maw of the sandworm is already hundreds of meters long. Similar scale issues exist with the starships compared to the size of the humans. The starships are way too large, and there was not even a proper propulsion system blasting away the sand and or evaporating the water with its heat. It was simply a an iron ship floating in mid air. This is also problematic with the city shown later. It was bland, empty and liveless. Really terrible world building.The Baron was done terrific and the spice running through Paul Atreides' hands was done excellent as well, so on the detail level the CGI was fantastic but al the shots with a sense of perspective just fell flat because it was so empty liveless and the proportion was off. If you want to show the epicness and grandeur of the starships and cities, at least invest the effort to display the hustle and bustle of the city or the intricacies of how a starship would actually work.",Dune

Yes, a lot was left out round the political machinations of the lansraad and thufir hawat may have been underserved, but it doesn't matter. Denis Villanueve has taken the images I created of the fremen, arrakis and shaihulud right out of my head and put them up to see.

TLDR: This movie is a cinematic spectacle. It is very approachable for those who are not familiar with the source material. For diehards it streamlines the first half of the novel, keeping the plot and character development essence while trimming away a lot of exposition, scenes, and story branches that would have ground this film to a halt. A warning to everyone - this is definitely a PART 1; but I promise you it will make you very excited for PART 2. Suggestion: See this on as big of a screen as possible, with a great sound system. This movie is made to be an immersive experience.-------------
FOR THOSE NEW TO THE DUNE UNIVERSE
I had the pleasure of seeing this in IMAX with three different people who were not familiar with the source material, and from two different generations - my daughter and her BF (Millennials) along with my fiancee (GenX). All of them were very excited with what they saw, and said that the material, while dense, was very approachable and exciting. They were transported to this universe and were able to follow along really well. All of them are very excited about PART 2.FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH DUNE
Full disclosure: I'm a huge DUNE fan. I have read the first six books countless times since the first time I read it when I was 11. It is my most favorite novel of all time. I was also (un)fortunate enough to have seen Lynch's 1984 Dune, including getting the ""Glossary"" they handed out to moviegoers. I think it's an abomination. Overall, to say I'm familiar with the source material is an understatement.Denis Villeneuve had a monumental task in front of him. To take one of the most densely packed, complex sci-fi novels and make it approachable on screen is a task that has been tried before - and has resulted in everything from abject failure (Lynch) to middling success (miniseries). The original book contains a lot of political intrigue, exposition, and scenes of static dialogue where people just stand around and talk. And while reading these scenes is fantastic, they just don't translate well to the big screen as they tend to ground the momentum to an absolute halt. Therefore Denis has boiled his script down to the main touch-points of the plot while maintaining the overall emotion and feel of the source material. So, is this a word-for-word, page-to-screen adaptation? No - and it would have been foolish to try to do that. MAYBE if this were done as a 12 part miniseries you can do it, but not in a movie made for the cinema. Therefore I personally understand the direction Denis took this movie, and feel it was the right move.What Denis got VERY right was HOW he brought his script to the screen. You can tell that this is a man who a) understands what the source material truly is, and b) actually loves it. This movies conveys his reverence for the source material in how well it is crafted. From the incredible cast - especially Timothee Chalamet (Paul Atreides), Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica), Oscar Isaacs (Duke Leto Atreides), Stellan Skarsgard (Baron Vladmir Harkonnen), and Jason Mamoa (Duncan Idaho) - to the cinematography, to the pitch perfect score by Hans Zimmer, this is filmmaking at its finest.So, I hope the purists give this movie a break. Denis had to not only tame an ""unfilmable"" source material, he had to make it approachable for both newcomers and diehards alike. And if you go into it with the right mindset, you're in for one hell of a ride.THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE SEEING IT IN THEATRES
First, this movie is long - over 2.5 hours. And I'm not sure if it's this way everywhere, but where I saw it there were at least 30 minutes of previews before the actual film. My recommendation is to go to the restroom about 15-20 minutes into the previews so you can make it through the film.Second, this is made for a huge screen. If you can, see it on as large of a screen as possible. Viewing it there vs on a TV screen is worlds different - and I promise this movie is worth the investment.Third, if you do see it in a large screen theater (IMAX or RPX), I will let you know it's loud. Not so much that it's distracting or painful, but if you have sensitive hearing I just want to make sure you're prepared.Finally, like I said in my TLDR summary, this is most definitely a PART 1. This may be frustrating for some people, because while it is an amazingly enjoyable spectacle, it does leave many plot lines open. Still a great movie, but don't expect it to be all wrapped up with a bow at the end.FINAL VERDICT
As a die hard DUNE enthusiast this is the film I've been waiting for since I was a kid. It tells a story that I deeply love in a way that is approachable and enjoyable for a wide audience. I think it will spur some people to even read and experience the source material, and that's a great thing. I expect DUNE to garner quite a few nominations come award season, and should take home a few golden statues as well.",Dune

No lack of intense scenes and the drama seems to focus on the right emotions and add to the main storyline as well. The characters look epic without being over the top. They are uniquely assimilated to their natural habitat/profession.The story is a Game of thrones in space-like story. It follows the book relatively well. There are multiple storylines and mysteries. Things are often not what they seem, therefore relatively unpredictable.The movie was definitely prepared with a second episode in mind as the 2.5hours length was quite packed already. The scenes were tightly directed and the dialogues are very good, I would have been sad to miss any scenes just to compress the full book into one movie.If you only want to choose a single movie this year to take the risk and watch it in the theatres during the pandemic, I would definitely recommend this one.

3508,elon_bust,An epic and profound feel without much of a story to justify it,5,25 October 2021,"This film is set in the one hundredth century. Why, in the future does everyone stand around in enormous, cathedral-like buildings to conduct business? Why, despite really advanced space travel technology, have people gone back to using swords instead of guns?This hype around this film echoes that of 2017's boring, tedious Blade Runner 2049. That was given five-star reviews everywhere in Britain except the Spectator magazine, who bravely wrote an honest review. Film critics these days seem to be reduced to shills for giant film producing corporations, hopelessly captured by groupthink.The character of Dune is just epic, epic and more epic. But so what? I barely know anything about who these characters are or what is going on, so the epic scenes feel empty. Visually, it is very pleasing but even that is not enough to carry a film in the 2020s. Special effects nowadays are basically limitless and we can see them any week of the year at the cinema.And on the subject of the 2020s, it becomes clear as the film draws on that it is captured by contemporary ideology. Make no mistake: this film is ideologically positioned in the 'noble savages' idea. The idea that technology is basically bad, the people that make it are bad, and that primitive, tribal people are sustainable, perfect, peaceful and wonderful and we should all turn into them.Anyone who thinks it's coincidence that the main empire and their rival empire are mainly white people and that the natives on the desert planet are entirely non-white is in denial of reality. In the typical fashion of this era, even a film in the one hundredth century just happens to have a plot that would be entirely inoffensive to the Democrat Party, the New York Times, Guardian and BLM.Very little about this film is deep, bold, original, or even entertaining. The special effects, depth of the scenery, and soundtrack are what stop it being an overtly bad film.",Dune

There wasn't a bad moment in the entire movie imo. I LITERALLY wouldn't have changed one thing.I walked out of the movie EXCITED and immediately called 3 people and told them about it. I NEVER do that. I told 5 people about it the next morning at work.Visually it was breathtaking. Absolutely stunning. Costume design was immaculate. Casting was perfect. Acting was brilliant. Editing was done in such a way that it told a great story and kept the movie flowing. It was perfect imo.Much like movies like Star Wars and Matrix showed audiences something fresh and intricately brilliant; I think DUNE (2021) did the same thing.I will be going to rewatch this in an IMAX as soon as possible.

This movie was not what I expected at all. Too many long slow shots that did nothing to advance the plot and tell the story. Far too little development of characters and storyline. I was very disappointed to find this was only part 1 of the first book. For a nearly 3 hour film there is so much more the director could have done with this exciting story.

To assemble everything and to manage the sheer scope of Dune, Villeneuve deserves all the accolades he is getting.

3525,mcbrain_damage,Virtually perfect,10,23 October 2021,"My bullet point review:overall takeaway - the best book adaptation since LOTR. Hard to give a concrete number but compared to my expectations, somewhere around 9/10 to 10/10. Having found so much blockbuster cinema and even sci fi leaving me cold, because it was so facile, the complexity of this attempt made me extremely satisfied. Very few stones left unturned.won't be surprised if many don't like it, it has a vibe not dissimilar to Prometheus and that is a widely disliked movie (not by me though!), but one can hope there's enough people who like it.I had no idea this was only half of the first book before I went in. I almost shouted for joy when I saw 'part 1'. This is a brilliant decision. It is impossible to capture the perfection of this literary gold with just one movie.the music and audio engineering are incredible.the sandworms are eye-wateringly awe-inspiring.the shields were perfect. All of the shield fighting was as described in the books.everything looks and sounds right. This is a serious attempt to capture the sheer majesty of Dune. Great stakes politics in space. 'Star Wars for grownups' is in the right ballpark, honestly. You might also call it Game of Thrones in space.The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was portrayed as less grotesque than in the Lynch version and in the first book. It put more emphasis on the fact that he is a ruthless, strategic genius. The look of the Harkonnens, opting for baldness rather than red hair, was a stunning success. The way he hovered was less obvious compared to the book, but I preferred it.Paul and Leto the First are perfectly cast. Stilgar too. The Lady Jessica too. Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck. Thufir Hawat. Chani. All the performances were good to great.THE VOICE used by the Bene Gesserit is incredible. I LOVED THE WAY THEY DID IT.extremely true to the experience of the books. The only issue is that a viewer who hasn't read the books will not know about things like the Butlerian Jihad which might make them wonder why no one uses computers or AI.gom jabbar scene gave me goosebumps, I never get goosebumps in a movie. Watched it a second time...goosebumps again!showing Caladan, Giedi Prime and Salisa Secundus made me so happy. I loved the sardaukar and their scenes.the 'flash forwards' were perfect.I really cannot think of a single thing I didn't enjoy, with the tiny, tiny exception being the use of the phrase 'holy war' instead of jihad, and also maybe the laser used to shoot at Duncan when he escapes. But that's just because of the impression it left on me from the books. But it's basically a non issue.I hope beyond hope this keeps going past the first book as if the trilogy can be done like this I will feel very complete.",Dune
3526,alexrcampbell,True to the book and truly beautiful movie,10,23 October 2021,Beat movie I've seen in years. I'm a massive fan of Frank Herbert's work and I don't think it could have been done any better. Absolutely mesmerising for every minute.,Dune
3527,feistyflo,A cinematic triumph but not for everyone,9,8 November 2021,"A truly cinematic experience. There are only a few cinematic moments like this I can remember in my lifetime, once when I was 8 years old watching a film in the cinema for the first time, and again when I saw Lord of the Rings visualised on the big screen for the first time. Denis Villeneuve's boyhood dream came true in this spectacular masterpiece. You see his palpable love for cinema and excitement of the source material everywhere in this film.You're never just an audience with Denis's films. The minute the opening scene appeared, he wastes no time dropping you into that world. Despite this being an epic sci-fi story, the human connections are strong. In every film Denis Villeneuve has made, he makes you a part of the journey. You're with Paul every step of the way here. The film rests a lot on the slim shoulders of Timothée Chalamet and this young man held up the film so damn well. His eyes tell you everything despite the wordless scene in one very important moment. Watch this guy, he will have a long and illustrious career if he keeps choosing roles well. His on-screen mother, Rebecca Ferguson, is as vulnerable yet powerful as Lady Jessica. Javier Bardem is Stilgar. The CGI of blue on blue eyes did not detract from his performance and his piercing gaze during his entrance. All in all, Denis cast his film really well. Each and every actor inhabited their role perfectly and played off each other to perfection. Even though I knew some of their fates already from reading the books many years ago, I wish I had more time with them.The sound design - PERFECTION. Do not skimp on your cinema experience. Find one with Dolby/Dolby Atmos. I saw this in a Dolby Atmos theatre, the sound was perfectly balanced and it wasn't overwhelming to the ears. You do not want to miss out on the details of the sound design and the score. This film is absolutely tactile, the sound design and mixing is the reason for it. It feels as though you are on Caladan or Arrakis in that very moment. The ornithopters sound like real flying vehicles with its unique rhythm. Even silence is well played in some scenes. I won't bore you with the details. Watch and listen for yourself.I felt disappointed when Roger Deakins could not join Denis Villeneuve for Dune. They had a marvellous working relationship in several films prior. I admit I had some trepidation when Greig Fraser was named Director of Cinematography. Fortunately, he did not disappoint. Visually, it is so damn beautiful. From the waters and fjords of Caladan to the undulating dunes of Arrakis, the scenery took my breath away. The fight scenes were well-shot and they didn't use the ubiquitous gazillion cuts that most movies use (which is honestly very irritating). The interiors of House Atreides and House Harkonnen sets were amazing and lived in. The sandworms.... oh, the sandworms. Fascinating creatures that looked believable denizens in the sea of sand. The attention to detail really made this film.When Warner Bros Studio announced last year that they were doing a same-day release of theatre and streaming, after watching Dune on the big screen, I could understand Villeneuve's anguish. This film isn't meant to be a time-filler like Netflix features for pauses and breaks. This is an experience to be had.Having said that, this isn't a film for everyone. Do not expect to turn your mind off and be spoon-fed. This film engages almost all your senses completely. Thankfully there's not too much exposition. You will be shown how things work and how things are in the world of Dune if you let yourself immerse in the film. If you enjoyed Sicaro, Arrival, and Blade Runner 2049, you will feel right at home with Dune. I've watched this four times, each time with a different friend who didn't read the books. They came out of it blown away and amazed. There are also some minor pacing issues, but they do not hamper the entire storytelling.Do yourself a favour and watch it on the biggest screen available for a once-in-a-lifetime experience in the safest way possible. If there's no IMAX screen near you, find one with Dolby or Dolby Atmos. I was double-masked up and didn't even have time to eat my popcorn or sip my drink. There's no time for that. You won't experience anything like this again for a long time.PS. ORNITHOPTERS!!!!!!!!!",Dune
3528,onefaststi-251-306546,"Good movie, but even better for fans of the novel.",10,22 October 2021,"With little to no exposition, non-readers are just put into the movie, and may get a little lost, but for those that have read the novel, it is a welcome difference to other movies based on books. We already know the character backstories, and we really don't need or want those stories. There is a lot in the beginning of the book that does not translate to the screen, and it was refreshing that it wasn't even attempted.We know how Duke Leto's father was killed, but it was nice to see how it was more hinted to than explained. Little things like Leto looking up at the head of the bull are for the readers, not the casual viewer.I did come into this movie with a perceived negative. The gender swap of Liet Kynes. I am not against gender swaps, but when I had first heard that they were casting a woman in that roll, I thought that the similarities and comparisons of Liet Kynes and Paul would be lost. Some may know that in earlier drafts of Dune, Frank Herbert had Liet Kynes as the hero, and in later drafts, he transitioned it to Paul. Kynes was a ""voice from the outer world,"" but was not the ""Kwisatz Haderach."" The similarities of Kynes and Paul was central to the story, but with there being very little exposition, the gender swap is no longer a source of conflict for me. The actor was great in the part and it was written well, for the minor roll that it ended up being.The only thing I would have liked to have seen more of was the interaction of the Atreides and the people when they come to Arrakis.I cannot wait to see if there will be a longer, directors cut or extended version of this film.",Dune

3541,jokroeger,"Impressive, but indulgent...",6,22 October 2021,"Let me preface this by saying I have never read the book, or seen the other adaptations. Critics saying that it works well enough on its own to explain the world and lore should be good enough for me. The big problem here is that the ad campaign is misleading: this is a Part One (of two), and Zendaya's character who is prominently featured in the trailers only shows up at the end to say, ""This is just the beginning."" That said, the first HOUR of this is setup and tedious exposition. Many scenes are Timothy Chamalet just sitting there watching holograms full of exposition, or we would be told about events that would be much more effective to see. Fortunately, the story does take shape and things start moving forward a bit, with lots of Villeneuve's trademark epic spectacle and scope, dazzling visuals, strong performances, and great action scenes. But then Dune just struggles to figure out how to end, and only does so just when the main characters and story are getting interesting. Sure, I'm no ""Dune"" scholar, and adapting epic literary works to screen is challenging, but judging this as a movie, I wanted to like it a lot more, considering the promise it held.",Dune

3543,k-merse,What it could have been...,5,26 October 2021,"Herbert's epic is worthy of a multiple-part movie, but not like this. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent movie, and unfortunately still the best Dune adaptation as of 2021, but it derivates way too much from the original content. A few key points:Eyes don't turn bule due consuming spice, only the irises become bright blue.Liet-Kynes, a character very important to the original books falls victim to Hollywood's LMBTQ+ and feminist mania, and from a man, becomes a black woman.The Emperor, a sinister manipulator in the original, becomes a beneficial godfather, double-crossed by the Harkonnens.Dune is not a merciless harsh world. Sure, it has sandworms, but come on! The Fremens, who are forced to conserve every drop of water are now people roaming around with their heads and mouth exposed (you lose the most perspiration on your hairy scalp and through your mouth) but with funny piercings in their noses.Lady Jessica's trademark flaming red hair is now just... brown!The supporting characters of the Atreides (Duncan, Gurney, and Thufir) are just portrayed... wrong! Mentat's mouth is not purple of consuming Spice. Gurney's supposedly brutal scar is just a cut. Duncan is supposed to be friendly and sexy and he is none of those (IMO).The Harkonnens are not believeable. Vladimir is not ridiculously obese, only somewhat overweight. Heck, my father looks fatter than he is...All in all, you can watch it once, but it is not a worthy representation of Herbert's epic. If you are a fan of the books and the universe, I would suggest you pass on this one.",Dune

Someone found a way to do it and this movie is the result.

Even the names of the ""sand people"" and the language they speak are abstracted to something neutral, but not when it comes to their admiration to ""the white saviour"" young man. In this case, he's given the highest description in Islamic mythology, ""Al Mahdi"" and ""Lisan Al Ghaib"". Not a single character of the movie is Arab or Muslim, which was also part of the casting decision. There is no doubt that the story is highly based on T E Lawrence's (Lawrence of Arabia), which basically romanticises the horrible act of colonialism and deem natives so powerless that their only way out is to be led by the white Messiah. Jesus of Nazareth was appropriated into this blonde blue eyes European man and Al Mahdi is appropriated to be Timothée Chalamet.",Dune

But nooo... Ones again they messed up perfectly good opportunity.First of all 2h and 30m is crazy long especially when you get nothing in return. Yes! There are few good hits, and few good scenes but that's about it. Half the movie was slow motion with a big nothing. I have no idea how they successfully make me hate every second of the movie.Second - they don't explain the story they just trow things at you (not a problem for me, but for a friend I brought to watch with me it was pure torture having to ask me about everything)They make Jessica look like a small, scared servant... That's not the story as we all know.And who will like to watch a slow story at a slow motion and not even a good one. They don't work on the relationships at all. They just show them and that's it.The friend I went with was sure that Paul and Jessica are having an affair and was petrified.That's not the way you tell such a big story.May be my biggest disappointment ever.P.s. - for the fans of Jason Momoa - have in mind that watching the trailer you have watched almost 99% of the scenes with him.",Dune

He does not have the punch and maturity as a composer for fine music - whilst he is a creative mind who finds solutions for his tasks, and he found one here too - he is not the one to compose with diligence, like a morricone, and a flavor for oriental culture.

This movie holds true to the intent of the first book. I found this movie to be made for grown ups which is so refreshing. I was truly amazed and in awe by the movie . For 2.5 hours I was in another world and time and most of all I really felt like my grandmother was next to me watching the movie.

Both the original film and book, at least for me, required a great deal of concentration to keep up with proceedings. Al the houses, acolytes, and planets are dumped on you in one go in the originals.Whilst I found Dune 2021 to be a lot easier to follow, it hasn't lost any of the feeling of depth of the original.Casting is spot on for every character, with Isaac, Skarsgard and Bardem being stand outs for me. Brolin is also magnificent despite his screen time being less than extensive, but all I hear now is Thanos. Sorry Josh.This BEGS for many sequels and you MUST watch it at the cinema. You will truly miss out if you wait for home release.Villeneuve paces it beautifully.

I cant help but feel exactly like I did when I watched the first Lord of the Rings for the first time.I know these are big calls but warranted - if you are scrolling through reviews thinking whether its worth forking out the money and watching it in the cinema, look no further and book that ticket!Everything hits the mark for ""part 1"".

A few years ago I watched the documentary about the project that was taken from the hands of the controversial Jodorowski and passed on to the great David Lynch. But due to the various concessions he was forced to make, there were a lot of holes left in the script. An epic story with great potential, but poorly used. Since then I've always been hoping to watch a version to match. I'm a fan of Villeneuve's films, so I was even more hopeful! But... the movie is a visual spectacle most of the time, but there are a lot of very dark scenes where I couldn't see almost anything! And the incessant and very noisy soundtrack! Why??? The script is better than the previous one, but I'm still hopeful that ""Dune 2"" will plug all the holes.",Dune

There were also a few scenes, where I didn't really got the point or why it was necessary.At times I actually felt a bit cringy, with a lot of cliche liners and some really exaggerated parts, that just got too Hollywood/Blockbuster for my taste.

The visuals were and special effects were amazing and as usual Hans Zimmer and the entire sound department cannot be understated.

3591,dantonsandoval89,"Tremendous potential, weak by itself",6,25 October 2021,"Even though the visuals, effects, soundtrack and cinematography are amazing, the Story by itself is really weak. It just feels like a huge trailer, an appetizer for a second part or maybe more, which if they fail to make, this movie will be a waste. But WB does fund this franchise, man we're in for a treat.The whole movie is a huge appetizer, a preparation for the real plot. But unlike Lord Of the Rings, Star Wars or Harry Potter, this first installment has no real story. Un those franchises, there are always two plot lines: the main plot where they introduce the hero and their world, present you with the problem they'll be facing and set up what the whole adventure will be about, which gets you hooked with the franchise. And a small plot for each movie, with its own mini adventure, climax and conclusion, which makes you like each movie by itself and makes you even want to watch it again in the future.Un Dune, they fail to do that. They just present you with the big picture and keep you hanging for the next movie, which will be the valuable one. In this case, If they make it right, I would probably never watch part one again and just focus on the sequels. Which in this case Dune part one doesn't feel like a part one. It feels like a huge 2.5hr trailer for the real action.Dune has SO MUCH potential, but it's just missing something. Maybe they could've shortened this 2.5hr buildup to the first hour of the movie and added the really good stuff on the next 1.5 hours. Or maybe this franchise needed a TV Series, not a movie, like Game of Thrones did, to really have time to set up all the houses, characters, adventures, AND give you the good stuff.Even though I really enjoyed the visuals and sound, Dune has a very slow pace and I never felt really excited during the movie like I have in the other franchises I mentioned before. In the end, I really hope they make the second part to get a bigger picture and and maybe really fall in love with it.If they fail to continue the saga, this movie will be almost worthless by itself.",Dune

Key moments from the book are portrayed well. The soundtrack and visuals demand your total engagement but don't overpower the experience.

And this is great. New viewers are interested, and old fans have something to show.There is a minus, rather two. I was missing details. In the description of the world, the smell of spices, the enmity with the Harkonyns, the ambiguous dialogues of the Arrakians.And, the final fight of the film, Paul's first.Conflict from nowhere.

3600,Geraldcrum,Lowest chasm of Mediocre,3,23 October 2021,"I went into this movie with nothing super high in the form of hopes. I didn't really think it was going to be bad nor good just something I could be entertained with for a few hours . What I received was something more along the lines of a A caramel apple but what I got was an onion instead.Let me break this down into several stages of dumb .Sci-fi - future 10000 ADWe still use forks - spoons - eat normally - use paper - cloth - and clothes look around the same as today's . Same as space suits and general all feel of the world .The aliens from other planets all are about the same . Oh interesting how Asian man has Asian accent and Spanish man has Spanish accent . When that far into the future of co inter breeding among races should all basically have a normal type of dialect , they did right for one in ""after earth"" (pains me to say that )So there's no space weaponry that is projectile in any way ... it's future sword play only ? We have guns that shoot around corners and drones . 2021 seems much more high tech than this film .Plot -It's the normal ""I'm special and everyone knows this except me"" kind of plot. This is so over done it's almost a joke in this movie because everyone knows this and makes a remark about the kid but for some reason the kid never knew he was looked at as a chosen one .The story forgets the kid and mother have super powers of controlling people with their words until the plot says they should use it . Literally it could change so much but no we need sword fight .The plot is as easy as this.Plot - these people get access a planet to mine the best resource ever . And so they go to do that when a lot others have failed . So they do that than 45 min later get attacked and demolished than the kid running away and meets the sand dwellers and that's the end.""He's never taken a life "" mom says during that scene to make it epic but let's disregard the people he and her killed earlier .The plot instantly happens 45 minutes into a world building that is so easily explained we could have learned it by actually starting the story instead of taking the time to build this world up. And even then they failed to build up a world that even seems like it would work .So many times they talk about how amazing or strong this army of this race is and boom they get wiped off the butt crack of dune easily . But why did they get destroyed - who knows . The reason behind wiping out an entire civilization of people is so lost in this story it's like saying ""because the script says so"". Most of the movie is that way.Action -Lack there of .The action isn't anything special . You won't be wowed to watch the same sword play 900 times . You will get bored with it super quick and hope that maybe there will be an interesting way to make it less boring . Nope .You get what you get - the past cafeteria lady's words haunt me.Many times did I check if the movie was almost over .The action is like someone handing you a 20 dollar gift card to a store and asking what your gonna buy there ... umm...one item or a bunch of cheap stuff ...With epic adventures happening frequently you would expect either a story with an emotionally gripping power play or something that will kick up an excitement to thrilling proportions.I laughed so hard at one point when there was a alien group bombing everyone and than they say ""oh screw it let's just go fight hand to hand "" and than go dump 200 people down there and both armies charge each other like a bad game of thrones episode.Thrill isn't necessarily done by putting a character in a situation that is crazy hard to get out of but by adding stakes to that situation. Or at least shooting it to where we feel that there are stakes to this situation . If your character is hiding don't have the bad force seem almost demolished by the good force than all of a sudden two minutes later a character have to end up being the only thing between the main hero and the bad army. We didn't see any type of threat coming from these goons and saw moments earlier they got out played by a smart group .It's one of those movies that pretend to be everything great about cinema but is more like a creative brain fart on sci-fi auto pilot while using unlimited money.",Dune
3601,matjes501,The greatest cinema experience since Lord of the Rings,10,20 September 2021,"This is a very personal 10. Maybe it should be a 9 for some but for me it was the greatest cinema experience I had in AGES.I've read some of the worse critiques here and feel like it's more a mismatch of the viewers taste and the movie rather than the movies fault.The sound is amazing, and even though I'm often a proponent of thematic pieces used by the old masters for movies like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones or even Harry Potter (1,2 and maybe 3), the whole audio experience including the sparingly used music couldn't have been done better.The visuals are the most epic shots seen in a long while and surprisingly even the 3D was descend, something I didn't expect.What REALLY transported me though was the screenplay. I have seldom seen characters with such little screen time and such minuscule amount of Dialogue (this is like the anti-thesis to Lynch's Dune, though there are nods to it throughout) played to such perfection. It's what ultimately transports the viewer into this world.Another interesting choice is the sparingly used dialogue throughout the whole movie.Some characters like Duncan Idaho had almost all their dialogue shown in the trailer, other important figures have about 3-5 lines of Dialogue and not much screentime, and yet they feel real and like they were portrayed through a characters lense that might be Paul or a third unnamed and not visible character altogether.I'm not a fan of minimalism but this movie somehow marries epic and minimalism so well that both feel heightened by the other.If you loved LotR and always craved for a Star Wars that felt a bit more grounded (don't expect space battles!) this is the one you should look at.",Dune
3602,anthonytyquin,If I could give it zero I would,1,18 October 2021,"As a FH fan, this was totally unwatchable from the start. Massive story interpretation mistakes and inaccuracy, incredibly poor casting (employing mates?) the screenplay was obvouisly created by some inept moron who doesn't care or know the story well and is looking for the big payday. Just garbage. Like everyone says the 10/10 reviews are fake and this is a cash grab for the big players.

3604,silentbazz-569-194205,Not for those not already familiar with the story,6,24 October 2021,"I loved this film.However I knew the story well, I'd recently re-read the book and so I was subconsciously filling in the missing plot from my prior knowledge of the story. I was in awe of how good the film looked, how magnificent the scope of the cinematography was that I overlooked the fact that the movie wasn't really explaining the plot particularly well.There was too little explanation of the importance of spice, the effects of spice on the individual, the fact that spice permeates everything on Arrakis.Doctor Yueh's role as the traitor carried no weight, because the film didn't explain that he had conditioning that should mean he could never betray the Duke. Indeed, until Yueh goes on a murder spree and begins lowering the house shields there is no suggestion at all that there is a traitor in the midst.Thufir Hawat is completely dismissed, as is the importance and the brilliance of the mentat.It's all very pretty but doesn't convey the story that Frank Herbert wanted to tell. It also focuses on unnecessary points, like the death of Paul's grandfather at the horns of a bull, far too much.If you're going to watch this read the book or watch the 1984 movie (which, although flawed, actually tells you the story) beforehand, and then get lost in the sumptuous portrayal on display here.",Dune

3609,serbinistom007,I'm tired of hyping everything,6,25 October 2021,"Let me start with the good things.Sound design is amazing! Hanz Zimmer delivers 100% and creates an atmosphere like no other alongside (and we go to the second possitive aspect) production design and costumes, you have a good audiovisual package to get consumed by the big screen and good home-cinemas.But this is where the bad things start for me.Am I the only one that is pissed with the CGI? I can see so many problems and mistakes, that considering the hype should not exist in 2021 speciap effects scene! That scene where there is a mechanical helmet in one of his visions, and opens iron-man style, feels like we went back to 00s, with really baf shadows and it feels like completely detached from the actual actor! Also, the ""fly"" type aircrafts physics felt completely off at many points and the miniature style shots of big buildings felt completely off and small which drew me.out of the magical feeling created ouy of the huge deserts.One more in the negative side of things is the focus on the fans! Why should i have to read a book in order to completely understand a movie! And i got this from other reviews of fans of the Dune universe, where a lot of things didn't make a lot of sense and it is unacceptable if they want to have a broader appeal and create a franchise out of it.Finally i want to mention some scenes with a lot of fast cuts in and out of the visions that in the end didn't make a lot of sense and left the viewer questioning what was happening without a huge impact or meaning to the end story.Don't get me wrong, i can see why this is a big thing, but i think that it didn't deserve the hype! It's a good movie and i would prefer to watch the whole story (don't get me started in the ending) at once and let it die like the reboot of Blade Runner! But in 2021 it seems like.we have ti hype everything, watch a trailer that spoils 80% of the movie and go to the cinema for something mediocre in the end, all because of that f. Hype.6/10.",Dune

Sadly there was little in the way of character building so while the actors put on a great performance I did not feel close to them.

I think this movie does a great job of showing what's possible now in terms of scale and atmospheric immersion but it needs much more attention to the number one ingredient - the characters.",Dune
3613,kadoll555,"""The Lord of the Rings"" of sci-fy destroyed for kids to look at Zendaya a couple of minutes.",6,4 November 2021,"So much wasted potential, all this modern technology at our disposition and the original Star Wars trilogy still remains a better work of art. The movie itself was very forgettable in terms of how visually elaborated it was, maybe that was the intention to convey that this is the source most sci-fy comes from, or maybe there wasn't much more that could be done in the department.Technical execution apart though, let's mention how flat this interpretation of the original book is. This is not the point of Frank Herbert's work whatsoever, there is a whole world of political tension missing here, all the depth of the relationship between the different parties involved in the switch of fief in ""favor"" of the Atreides. Where was the complex interaction between the characters with each other, all the pressure between the different members of the Atreides house that menaced to destroy them from within. The betrayal of Yueh was barely explained and represented so coldly and lacking significance. And one of the biggest issues I have with this movie, why was Jessica crying all the time, a trained Bene Gesserit and one of the strongest characters in the book just represented as a constantly crying failure.Anyway, even leaving apart all the book related complains, this movie does not go further than a 6 out of 10. It's very forgettable and nothing like previous Villeneuve's works of art. Maybe this is for the better, maybe making this as digestible as possible and casting a brainless talentless Disney kid will attract more younger people to sci-fi. Maybe by some wild chance some of them spend their super precious Tik-Tok time to read a couple of pages and learn a word.I am rating this movie the same as the latest Venom movie.

The dialogue and the characters are hollow; lifeless happenings that occur in order to connect scenes to action in hopes of stimulating something fresh. This film has dialogue so bad, so flat, so thin, I genuinely think less of the actors that spoke them. Mamoa farts out lines like he just left the gym. Zendaya is a model in this film, not an actress (which is a shame). Timmy. Oh Timmy. What have they done to you. This film should be studied for how not to write characters; how explaining relationships vs showing relationships negates character depth and the audience's empathy for characters. Anyone stating that the film is beautiful or the cinematography is amazing or the sets are so incredible etc, that's the vehicle of the film - the spectacle.

Sword battles, there is a reason we don't use it today and I have no doubt in mind that we won't be going back to that anytime soon. And let's be fair, Rebecca Ferguson plays the character with the most battle power in the family but basically never fights or use it, and needs protection from her less powerful son she said she'd protect. A culture where ""the physically strongest lead"" is the oldest, and least likely style of successfully leading in any larger group of people. And they have advanced technology, they aren't cavemen.

3644,j-galan1337,Our New Hope,9,24 September 2021,"Despite my failed two attempts to read through the books, I always acknowledged Dune to be one of the best Science Fiction book series of all time.When I made it into the theatre, on the day of release, I did expect a movie made for the fans of the books; with constant mentions to its lore and very little explanation about it, knowing of the previous works of Villeneuve. Yet, I was welcomed with proper introductions and good explanations of what was going on; sometimes explicit (The Fremen assaulting the Harkonnen harvester), sometimes implicit (The Voice). This shows expertise in storytelling as I didn't perceive it until I was thinking about writing down this review.The movie has a very simple plot on its fundament, which serves as an introduction to a second part which is at the moment in preproduction, and I became aware of it when I left the theatre, craving for more. But this doesn't mean it lacks of depth; in fact, most of the movie, beautifully displays and tells -through breathtaking photography, acting and soundtrack- the information required to understand the world and (most) of its characters making use of all of the different tools at the disposal of the director, even Soundtrack. All of this, put toghether, makes the movie feel foreign, distant and refreshingly new. As any Science Fiction should feel, A New Hope is a good example of this.The film has a rythm that gets interrupted eventually, when both Paul and Jessica leave Shield Wall. The story then takes a slower rythm and the contrast, in reference to the rest of the movie makes the viewer feel boring for about ten or fifteen minutes, but it also helps to worldbuilding as walking through the desert is not short nor fun. Such thing was described by Duncan, when he met the Atreides in Arrakis.I expect the movie needed more time to settle down, as the change of pacing is abrupt, and I can only think and hope there is a Director's Cut, giving more screen time to characters like Dave Bautista or Javier Bardem.In a sense, this saga comes in the right time. The enviromentalist problem implicit in the world, the struggle of people that live far in the desert, how the Bene Gesserit affect the idiosincrasy of the people of Arrakis as social media does nowadays, the youth taking the lead of their parents, all of these factors may have a good impact on this upcoming generation as we can reflect on those problems, and also its solution: Fear is the mind killer, I will face my fear, and when it's gone, I will turn to see the path.",Dune

Not only is it visually stunning, but it chapters the Essenes of Frank Herbert's epic saga almost perfectly. That being said it is still a very superficial adaption. For all it does well, it is lacking substance. Anyone who watches this movie without having prior read the novels will not leave with a deep appreciation for the masterpiece Dune is. I wish this would have been 10 part mini-series vs 2 part movie. The story of Dune cannot be told in a mere 5-6 hours. We do not see a full development of Paul or Lady Jessica. Duke Letho, Liet Kynes, Thufir Hawat, Shadout Mapes and Dr. Yueh are criminally under developed; it's a shame.

That's what I give two stars for. The rest is just one big disappointment. Important protagonists in the books are shown in a few scenes. There is no in depth character development, not at all. The philosophical, political and religious background are hardly mentioned at all.Lady Jessica, a strong women in the books, is portrayed as a whining, anxious woman, not at all comparable to the books.Out of political correctness or what reasons whatsoever, Liet/Dr. Kynes is portrayed by a woman of color. I don't cara about the color of skin. But Kynes in the book is a man. And it makes perfectly sense that he is.This movie completely fails to embrace the multi faceted story. If you haven't read the books, I doubt you could understand, what's going on and why. I seriously hope, they don't bother producing a sequel to this.I had high hopes for this, but even Lynch's version of '84 is better.What a waste of resources and talent. And how sad that we will probably never see a movie true to the brilliance of Herbert's books.",Dune

Minor complaints might be that we don't get to see the emperor, the princess, the guild navigators and some other things, but maybe we will in in part 2.

If you have seen the epic series Twin Peaks, as I did, you probably have the same I have, what is Agent Dale Cooper doing in a SciFi movie. Kyle just falls to be Paul Atreides and leans way too heavily on his legacy of special agent Cooper which totally spoils the mystery the story of Dune is built on.The only screen adaption that could intake me is the Dune 2000 mini-series, with Wiliam Hurt as Duke, Alec Newman as Paul, and Saskia Reeves as lady Jessica. It is produced on budget and oh boy it shows in every prop, but the storytelling is really good and immersive a joy to watch and rewatch as I did once a year for many years, as this adaption, gets the story across as the original book does.And now the long-awaited Dune 2021 by Denis Villeneuve... Oh boy..... How did he misses the mark, miss good storytelling, and miss all balance. This movie is an assembly of scenes that are put in more or less the right order, but it totally misses the mystery and the immersive storytelling of the book and the mini-series.Acting is bland, actors are just speaking their lines from tier heads and not their hearts and are not involved nor connected with the bigger story that Dune is. It just comes across as robotic acting.The scene where Paul is tested, the scene where Paul sits in on counsel, and where Stilgar spits on the ground is in the mini-series well-integrated in the storytelling and shows the stuff Paul is made of, as in the 2021 adaption are just thrown in like loose sand and acted very unnatural.This movie has the same flaw many remakes have, too much focus on CGI and special effects and no attention for narration, developing characters, and most important pay attention to the core, good storytelling....That a screen adaption of a book can also be done in the right way is shown by Ender's Game (2013), so there are no excuses for doing it as badly as it has done in Dune 2021....",Dune

Thus I went to watch the long-awaited Dune, and I left the theater satisfied.The universe of Dune as displayed is varied: from the damp and dim Caladan and the dark and grim Giedi Prime, to bright and scorching hot Arrakis - even the notorious and deadly Salusa Secundus gets a scene.The creations are VAST. From the constructs -buildings, spaceships, entire cities- to the creatures (sandworms).The characters are portrayed pretty much as intended; the internal conflicts within each member of the Atreides family are let out to be seen, ranging from the wariness of Leto to Jessica bracing against the consequences of her actions, leading to Paul taking steps towards unknown worlds, outwards and inwards. The Atreides household do their part as well, from the steadfast Duncan, and the devoted Gurney to the calculating Thufir. The opposing house of Harkonnen are portrayed in all their villainous glory; none of the comic excessiveness of the other adaptations is here to be seen. The Fremen are only partly seen as the mystical, resourceful and stealthy warriors to be feared; their impact, however, is undeniable.The music is SUPERB. Hans Zimmer outdid himself.Regarding the story as told - the exposition is kept at a minimum. The 'information dump' of the book or the earlier adaptations is omitted and only the most vital are provided, giving more room to action where the plot allows it. The most distinguishing elements, like the Voice, the Shai-Hulud and the Shields, are portrayed to their full glory.There have been, however, a few caveats that deprive the film from a 10/10 in my opinion:-There is dialogue which is too faint to hear. Hope for subtitles in such cases.-The portrayal of Rebecca's Jessica consists of multiple reasons for ""worry"". It often comes across as ""fear"", which is a bit undeserving.-(Book reader disappointment #1) Some of the many iconic lines are missing or spoken from other characters than originally, coming off a bit 'weird'.-(Book reader disappointment #2) We don't get to see or hear balisets.This adaptation does not render the other adaptations unwatchable - the different approaches are still enjoyable.

Light is obviously overrated. This is now true for the ""good guys"", as well as for the ""bad"" characters.All in all, the film radiates coldness, distance and emotionlessness from the beginning, which doesn't really develop in the further course of the film. But let's start at the beginning:1. Pacing & storytellingDune runs 2.5 hours. That's pretty long for a regular feature film. Movies like Lord of the Rings or Schindler's List fill their extra length with important emotional scenes, twists, and character development. In Dune, however, the length seems to exist only for its own sake. To possibly suggest an epic story, when in fact nothing important is being told. In purely scenic terms, of course, a lot happens on screen, but none of it sets meaningful focal points.From the beginning, the film feels like one big exposition. Names, planets, ruling houses are mentioned, with no time for individual explanations or deeper ideas about characters or contexts. Yes, you basically understand who is against whom, but not where the primordial conflicts stem from.A big additional problem, in my opinion, is that the film constantly spoils itself. Without giving too much away, the main character ""suffers"" from dreams or visions that give a glimpse of the future. Unfortunately, in such a binding way that the end of the film is literally given away. This ruins any suspense and doesn't exactly make you root for the characters.The visions are also used so often that they not only become completely redundant in terms of content, but also take up a lot of the film's overly scheduled time. After the second vision at the latest, the audience has understood what it's all about, so why bother them two or three more times with the same information?In the meantime I had the feeling that I was watching a compilation of cut-scenes of a video game. More or less the parts where there is some pretty action to admire, while the whole story takes place in the gameplay itself. In the case of Dune, offscreen.2. character development & castIn a nutshell: There is none. All the characters in the film, including the main character, are nothing more than stereotypical clichés. It's as if the hero's journey was implemented with the least amount of effort.We learn absolutely nothing personal about the backgrounds of the characters, only their hierarchy and position within the family. There is no small talk, no everyday situations with which we get access to the characters. This leads to the fact that we can't really sympathize with any of the characters, because they all remain empty shells. We learn nothing profound about the wants and needs of the characters and even the inner conflict of the characters remains absolutely superficial.The main character, Paul (the name seems completely inappropriate for the fantasy world), seems to have supernatural powers (*cough* Jedi) that make him a contender for the role of the ""chosen one."" For what and why that might be. The film assumes that the audience will accept this information outright. There's no believable training sequence, nor any major self-confidence issues, which is why Paul slots right in next to Rey from Star Wars as one of the most undeserving ""Chosen Ones"" of all time.Overall, we're presented with the bare bones of characters who have nothing about them to warrant sympathy.The only character that seems human or likable in any way is space Khal Drogo aka Duncan Idaho (what a stupid name). Unfortunately, his character remains completely underdeveloped as well.In general, the more familiar names among the cast add no depth to the film. They are mainly ""fan favorites"" of the nerd culture from other successful franchises like Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy or just Game of Thrones.3. sensitivity and tonalityI'm not really known for my political correctness, but the film already crosses some lines in 2021 that have sometimes been discussed extensively in public, and rightly so.Dune can certainly be understood as an analogy to imperialism and colonialism, when superior white superpowers invade and massacre desert peoples to mine ""spice"" (oil) there for their profits.The desert peoples, of course with black skin or Arabic appearance, are ""noble savages"" who prefer to kill each other immediately rather than negotiate diplomatically. They drink their own urine as well as their saliva and are already portrayed in a strikingly repulsive manner. Despite their desert suits, they appear backward and irrationally religious. With space burqas and space turbans, however, they make good assassins.When terms like ""holy war"" were mentioned verbatim in the film, I was almost forced to think of space Taliban.Of course, the poor, savage desert barbarians are waiting for a space messiah to give them freedom or something. Of course, this messiah must come from outside, from the world of the white superpowers, since they cannot free themselves against their oppressors. Enter Paul.In fact, I'm not really sensitive to innuendo, but there's such backward storytelling here that even I had second thoughts about whether this would still be okay in 2021. Book template or not.ConclusionThe film disappointed all along the line. Neither the pace, nor the characters, nor the conflict are convincing or captivating. Nice audiovisual effects try to hide a gaping hole in the content, which seems all too visible.The film builds on stereotypes that we've wanted to do away with for quite some time. Not only because the film seems absolutely predictable with its characters, but because certain ethnicities and real conflicts are unnecessarily dragged into the film in a negative way, without at least reflective criticism on a meta-level.Those who have seen Avatar, Star Wars or Game of Thrones will be presented with absolutely nothing new. On the contrary: Dune takes the worst of everything.",Dune

Why rush the present. The harkonens hardly hav two scenes before the attack. U keep saying Duke Leto is becoming so powerful and so the emperor fears him, yet all his scenes make him look so weak. The lengthy emphasis on paul s dreams about the future was so unnecessary, could hav used that run time to show us more about the occupancy of dune and them settling in to their new home etc. It felt like they came they saw and they were attacked immediately.

It does pretty much everything right. It's close to flawless. The visuals will leave you breathless. They are overwhelming in their scope, detail and vivid clarity and I'm not talking about pixel resolution. Dennis simply sees the unimaginable, fictional worlds in distant future with vivid, intricate, multilayered clarity. It's a rare, super special gift he possesses. All of the characters carry mystery, depth, sensibilities, strengths and insecurities and they feel incredibly relatable. You feel them, even in their most surreal circumstances.Visual effects, spectacular locations, set designs, music score...this movie maxes and crashes through every metric. The story is vast. VAST. 2.5 hours are needed to establish the perimeter of Dune, rough outline of the characters, the hierarchy, the game itself. You're left wanting for more. And wait we will. 10/10 from me.",Dune

This is definitely one to watch, even If you're not a fan of the novel or games.",Dune
3714,mmstw,Shocking,1,17 September 2021,"It is now understandable why the release date has been delayed for so long: the film is a disaster. Or even worse: a weak rehash that wants to be better.During the whole time in the cinema I had the thought: Why am I wasting my time, why not watching Lynch's version again instead?It wasn't just me who wasted time, the actors also give the impression. Either they overdramatise or you can tell by the twitching corners of their mouths that they had to burst out laughing shortly after the cut. In such cases, Zimmer's interchangeable score is simply turned up, and this happens more often.What is so problematic about the film? Lynch's Dune told us more than we could see, Villeneuve's Dune tells us less than we can see. Lynch had actors playing characters, Villeneuve has actors functioning as stand-ins for CGI. Lynch's work has the maximum 80s futurism, Villeneuve's picture series doesn't understand the roots, kindly spoken it is bad retro, not futuristic.Moreover, Villeneuve often steers the viewer in the wrong direction: several reviewers wonder whether Arab culture is meant by the Fremen. The answer is: no. The depiction is loosely based on the Berbers. Berbers are not Arabs. In their language they call themselves Imazighen, which can be translated as: Free men.In fact, the descendants of the Muslim world also appear in Frank Herbert's novels, and it is in the eye of the beholder to take it as parody or sarcasm. They are the Bene Tleilax. They use their women as breeding chambers and speak of other cultures only as religious unbelievers to be exploited or destroyed.Javier Bardem plays the revenant of Anthony Quinn's character Auda Abu Tayi because the screenwriters and the director did not understand the novels. Chani is portrayed by Zendaya as a high school girl from a troubled neighbourhood, is this supposed to be a better substitute for the big screen goddess Sean Young? Liet Kynes was gender-swapped - could the scriptwriters explain how female Liet could become father to Chani as written in the novel? Finally, the leading actor, a sensitive arthouse youngster who is forgotten 3 minutes after his appearance in a trivial comedy by Woody Allen.Overall, the wannabe big movie is characterised by the arrogance of doing better while doing worse. This makes the colourless flick ridiculous. The roles are miscast, the director and script barely understand the original, and there is no criticism of big business. Please, Mr Lynch take over, please!",Dune

That's most likely because the book tells a story in a setting that's just straight up insane in terms of scale and scope. But Denis Villeneuve gave this movie a budget of $165,000,000, rounded up some of the best modern actors, and executed the plot 99% accurately in relation to the book. (Kynes is a chick (who cares))Dune is my favourite Sci-Fi book of all time, and yep I'm going to say it, this is probably the BEST film I've ever seen.As for people that aren't into complicated plots and lore and other intellectual legwork, it's an absolute blast.

I love BR 2049 and it's atmospheric shots and slow scenes but the concept didn't work as well for this film because there is just too much lore to this universe to gloss over. Additionally, there was almost no quiet time in the score to really appreciate these vistas. The universe of Dune seems to need a TV show to enter it's depth more so than a film. This should have been a three hour if not a three and a half hour film. I could recommend it as a fun visual ride for now as well as anyone who isn't patient enough to wait for the full vision to be realized. It's beautiful and interesting, but needs to get fleshed out. I'll return to this in a few years when the story concludes. Maybe once more prior if an extended cut releases.",Dune

3720,sudhakarkumarsrk,THE DEFINITIVE IMAX FILM.,10,22 October 2021,"It's one of those once in a blue moon type movies. Denis Villeneuve's vision is evident in every frame. Here is a director who can finally realise the ambition of Herbert's epic, which has long been considered ""unfilmable"" a point proven by disappointing and forgettable attempts on both the big and small screens in the past. It helps if you've read the books, but it's not essential given how screenwriters making the dense story more accessible.Dune has (intentional) parallels to Earth's history of colonialism, and the atrocities that have been committed by white men, who were only interested in the resources and the associated monetary riches. Arrakis represents the Middle East, with spice an allegory for oil.Dune benefits from the fact that Villeneuve understands scale. The film requires a lot of worldbuilding. The first non-action half of dune is devoted to this, with Villeneuve doing his best to make it as interesting as possible. The second half is pure spectacle. The tensions between House Atreides and House Harkonnen are intensely felt, raising the stakes and underscoring the entirety of the story and the characters' decisions. ""Arrakis has seen men like you come and go,"" says one indigenous character. ""Who will our next oppressor be?"" asks the world-weary narrator. The conflict is explicitly driven by wealth, and it's fascinating to see a sci-fi movie grapple with the economic aspect of politics. Its concerns - environmental stress, human potential, altered states of consciousness and the developing countries' revolution against imperialism - are blended together into an era-defining vision of personal and cosmic transformation. Dune is sci-fi world building at its best.Dune is a tour de force on every technical level. The set design and CGI work are both impeccable, creating an ambitious otherworldly landscape that looks flawless. The sandworm is incredibly cool looking as well. The action sequences, the effects, and Hans Zimmer's score all create a truly massive, rich feeling world that should seriously be seen on the largest possible screen. There is a sense of foreboding that permeates the film, elevated greatly by Greig Fraser's stunning cinematography. There is beauty in every frame, whether it's glowing orbs or a bloated Stellan Skarsgard floating in the air; Paul touching water for the last time or sand for the first; Lady Jessica's billowing hijab in the wind or her shrouded in mist. Hans Zimmer's score is rousing, with the synth and vocalising giving dune an otherworldly quality. Top-notch special effects bring the world of dune alive in a way that has never previously been possible. Unlike many other science fiction films, which have a tendency to let special effects bog them down, making them feel rather soulless, the CGI in dune serves the larger story. And as a result it frees the actors to create unusually well-developed and engaging characters that feel completely alive.Timothée Chalamet is a well cast Paul Atreides. Oscar Isaac gives a wonderful performance as the loving but strong Duke Leto. Jason Momoa adds great gravitas and charm to the warrior Duncan Idaho that he steals almost every scene he's in--there isn't a bad performance in the bunch. Rebecca Ferguson is easily the standout actor in the movie. She delivers some truly heartbreaking moments that are borderline haunting. By the time dune wraps up, you know enough of Arrakis and its evolving parts, that you will be intrigued enough to be craving for more. For some people, this film may feel anti-climactic and unfulfilling as of this moment due to it being the first part. There is no clear resolution as the journey has only just begun, but the structure of the film does help answer a lot of questions and the choice of where to cut the film does feel perfect in its own way.Villeneuve's dune is the best possible adaptation of one of science fiction's most iconic works. It's the one you've awaited for over five decades, or since whatever time you first turned a page in Herbert's seminal novel. The talented filmmakers and jaw-dropping cast have done it justice. The best part of this 2021 version of dune? It is only the beginning... Part 2 will hopefully be on it's way to grace our eyeballs with yet another stunning take on the popular book, and continue the story of Paul Atreides.Dune was shot for IMAX which is apparent in every single scene. Watching dune in IMAX kept me hypnotised for a couple of hours into believing that I had witnessed something spectacular. Dune is not just a movie, it is an experience, and it begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Please see it on IMAX if you can do so safely.",Dune

Paul surprised, Leto was decent, Duncan was solid but slightly too much Hollywood. The storyline slowly opened up, just like the novel.

3733,luap-79327,Dune - It fails at its own claims,5,10 October 2021,"I went to Dune without any hype or knowing what exactly this movie is about. Of course I had seen the trailers and was catched by its visual art style. As a really big sci-fi fan, that enjoyes seeing movies with complex structures, that takes it time and ad little more context than your usual Hollywood blockbuster I was sure I would like this one. So what didn't made the movie for me?First of all, the visual art style and the overall framework of the movie, from screenplay to camera work and choice of costumes, music and so on is on point. It creates its own universe within a world of overly seen sci-fi tropes and repetitive movies.But this alone doesn't make a good movie in my opninion. There are three negative points for me, which pulling the film down significantly: These are the pacing, the plot and the characters. Let me adress these points:1. The pacing
From the beginning of the movie it is clear that the main character, Paul atreidis, is going to get to the fremen and to chani, the girl which he sees in his visions. The whole movie is about getting there and trying to find out, why Paul is having his dreams and what the other factions, like the bene-gesserit are planning and why he is ""the chosen one"". But in the end all that waiting doesn't matter, because the movie ends when they arrive at the fremen. It's utterly unsatisfying. In a little scene Paul is maybe referring to the next movies because he is seeing a ""great universal"" war because of him. But seriously that's the great reveal?! Otherwise in every moment it is clear, that the main protagonist is not in real danger, because he will get to the firemen. But the big exposition of the storyline concludes to nothing. Many plot strings are barely touched and lead into nowhere (what does the pregnancy of Paul's mother mean? What is the motivation of the Imperator? What is that ""big, 1000 year"" plan of the bene-gesserit?). Movies have to stand for there own, also when they are part of a greater franchise. The lord of the rings trilogy is the best example, where every film has its pacing and they beautifully get together as a whole. But this is nothing like that. A long wait, for something you know will happens, for when it happens, it ends.2. The plot
Addionally to the bad pacing I want to adress the problems of the plot. A very long part the film is pure exposition. It explains what the world is about, what factions are involved, which character is who and what ""spice"" is. It's an complicated explaination for an easy constellation, just sci-fiiy words and world building around that, to hide the basic plotline.The twist with Paul's doctor is also not comprehensible. A character which has nothing to do with anything is a traitor and ruins a whole dynasty, because of his wife. Yeah, very good elaboration for a character that has 5 seconds of screen time. An even further problem is the non existing actionism of characters, particularly of Paul atreidis and his mother. They are just getting from one situation in another and have to look emotionally and mysterious in the camera, because the music is getting louder and the script says so.3. The characters
Evolving out of the plot problems you just don't feel connected to the characters at all. They are emotionally empty and cold. Even the frightened driven mother of Paul has no connection to him at all. It's like she's not even loving his son or caring as a mother for him. A scene where she really cares for him, instead of telling everyone or crying for her own?! No thanks, we don't need that here.All other side characters are barely developed in the film and that's why you don't care when the ""cool dude warrior guy"" dies, because why should you, you know nothing about him.The only exception for a great character is Paul's father. Although it's the typical ""you are not ready son"" type of father, his motivation of getting close to the fremen and not only mining out the planet is refreshing and has some interesting sides to it. Oscar Isaac also plays his character quite good.So what is left, when you exit the film? You have the feeling you have seen an audiovisually bloated up sci-fi epos with a pseudo complex politically and social structure, that in the heart is just some fancy world building with emotionally empty characters you don't care for and with plot lines that have no further consequence or pacing, as you haven't already know from the beginng.",Dune

3745,teddy_lease,The BEST Dune movie,10,22 October 2021,This is by far the best Dune movie I have seen. This is part 1 of a 2 part movie. I always thought Dune should be treated like Game of Thrones. There is so much going on behind the scenes in the book. The Space Guild really doesn't have a role in this movie. The Bene Gesserit has a small role. But it is mostly Paul Atreides' story and how he becomes the Kwisatz Haderach. This half of the story deals with how the House Atreides comes to Arrakis (Dune). I am really impressed by how the story has been told and the visuals.,Dune

3747,SamanthaFilmLover,Villeneuve Is A Return To Real Artistic Cinema,10,25 October 2021,"Villeneuve is in my mind clearly the best filmmaker of the modern generation. Of all directors that have not made anything previous to the early 90's, he is clearly in a class by himself I feel. He just continues to prove it every time out. Every feature film he releases is something special. To him it is obvious that the art is what matters far more than anything else. He's not interested in trying to just show off what he can do, or in making a film that is going to satisfy the majority of people, money is clearly not his motivation, nor are accolades. He's only interested in creating interesting artistic endeavors that always offer something that has never been brought to the screen in quite the same way. He wants to share something new with his audience, he wants to inspire. There's always a unique aspect to every film he does and every aspect of his films seem to be so focused and so well envisioned from top to bottom. From the stories, to the look and feel of his films, it is true creative expression all the way. While he is clearly always trying to add in deeper spiritual aspects to many of his films, they always seem to work because they're never overbearing, nor do they contain a narrowness of perspective. There is no agenda or pseudo intellectual nonsense with Denis. He just wants to create and share something fresh and interesting with other lovers of the cinema. Denis himself is obviously in love with film. He is to me by far, the most refreshing director of the modern era.Myself as an all out David Lynch fanatic, I really see no reason or need to compare Dune's. I think both filmmakers themselves likely have a ton of respect for each other. Both films stand on their own, with or without comparison or talk of the original Herbert Novel or to each others film. Lynch and Villeneuve are both true masters of the artform. Denis is a modern pioneer of the cinema, a return of sorts to the days when the artform was what mattered most to many of the great cinematic artists and pioneers of Europe, Asia and to American legends like Kubrick and Lynch. With so much stale, generic, self aggrandized and/or narrowminded ideology based nonsense being shoveled at us from all angles these days, we really need true openhearted artists like Denis right now. Real art is an inspiration, an inner ignitor of the Spirit! Our true spirit is creative. We only get so much from the older greats anymore, many of the best have passed on, so these days, we really need true artists like Denis more than ever.I'm not sure the first half of the Dune book could be made into a film any better than this. So based on that I gave it a 10. To get the most out of this wonderful piece of filmmaking. See it in IMAX as it was intended to be seen.",Dune

3749,sibaris,"A grandiose, beautiful, magnificent movie about nothing.",5,17 September 2021,"It's definitely a well-directed film. The music is beautiful and the desert views intended to show us the planet Arrakis are impressive. But unfortunately, there is practically nothing behind the beautiful exterior. Even if Villeneuve filmed only half of the first book, this half was supposed to introduce us to the universe and many main and secondary characters. Unfortunately, the duration of 2.5 hours for the director was only enough to briefly introduce the main characters and slightly describe the situation in the galaxy. Too little time has been given to supporting characters. Some are presented, but not disclosed. Especially disappointed by Liet-Kains, his line was cut to almost zero.Bottom line.The universe of Dune is very extensive and it is extremely difficult to film even one book in less than 3-4 films with a similar timing.It would be better if they made a series. With a budget like Game of Thrones. They would most likely be successful .A film can only be watched for the sake of a beautiful picture and wonderful music.5/10.Sorry for the mistakes. English is not my native language. Used google translate.",Dune
3750,cleciofs,A very clever adaptation,8,23 October 2021,"It's obvious that the film industry has long been interested in adapting to film a book like Dune, a classic science fiction work that has won a huge legion of followers over more than 50 years since the first book in the series was published.However, transposing a work so complex and full of nuances seemed an almost impossible task, so much so that the first attempt at production, still in the 70s, was at the hands of the eccentric director Jodorowsky, who ended up not being able to carry out the project. It was up to another director (also eccentric), David Lynch, to bring the Dune universe to the screen for the first time, in 1984. However - although it has gained cult air and has its defenders - as a cinema, it is a smaller work, with major narrative flaws.Therefore, it is natural that this new adaptation, which hit theaters this week, came surrounded by great doubts but, after watching 155 minutes of this film directed by Denis Villeneuve, I can't help but praise the extremely correct decisions that he and his co-workers made. Mostly by using the main elements of the story but without falling into the trap of trying to follow the same narrative features of the book, which work well in written form, but which would make the film less dramatic.Production Design is another major hit, bringing a perfectly believable - and beautiful - level of reality to the richness of writer Frank Herbert's imagination, so that fans of the books finally get a chance to see elements like the famous ornithopters the way they really should be.While the large number of characters doesn't allow most actors to show off much of their talent, it's clear that each of the many good actors has been handpicked for the right role. Even the (still) somewhat limited Timothée Chalamet fits nicely into the shoes of an insecure pre-Muad'Dib Paul Atreides.In the end, Dune (2021) is a good film, with good technical quality and which intelligently adapts a difficult work, in fact creating a new work, better suited to the cinematographic language, while still living up to the original text. I recommend.",Dune

Not this one.,2,17 October 2021,"Villeneuve is great at his own stuff, just not at adaptations.The movie is a travesty at so many levels that I can't even articulate the disappointment.Fist 2 minutes and we get to be cautioned about ""oppressors"".Then the gender/race switches in characters that were unnecessary because ""we gotta be diverse"".Then the relentless references to the bull and matador tradition in house Atreides. Seriously????Yes, they had bulls in Caladan. Yes, one head was mounted in the dining room. Does that qualify to be shown over and over again?No, Atreides were NOT mainly recognized by a bull.Ah, then comes the constant ""you are nothing but a boy"" lecturing from women to Paul.I guess inspiring and empowering people is only for little girls because reasons.Cinematographically speaking, the movie is great. Just don't expect to be watching ""Dune"" because it simply isn't.Villeneuve tried to hard to step out from Lynch's shadow. For the life of me I can't understand why actors have to whisper (hallmark of 21st century acting) and why thought-voice is heretic or something.Plenty of characters needed to be head in their thoughts and that's replaced by them talking to themselves. Really stupid.Also, ""thanks"" for not killing Ducan when it had to.Don't get me started with Duncan and Gurney (absolutely inconsequential), Yueh (I guess that was the Asian diversity card to be played) or Thufir Hawat (who is a bloody house Mentat and yet fails like an apprentice - and race card again).Well, another show that I'll be forgetting soon.",Dune

I couldn't make out most of the dialogue at all.The soundtrack puts you in mind of one of those awful dated 70s sci fi movies.This film feels more like a vanity project for the photography as opposed to delivering the story.If you value your time (and your hearing), give it a miss and read the book instead.",Dune

And for once the pacing isn't catering to the short attention span of the lowest common denominator nor is it undercutting every serious emotional scene with bathos. It is a breath of fresh air! The balance of intimate character moments and awe inspiring scale is exactly how the book felt to me. The acting is superb, the visuals are mesmerizing, and there is a lot left to explore. The movie treats the audience with respect and doesn't shove exposition down our throats. I can't wait for part 2!Denis really gets it. He clearly understands what this book is and is not. The book was a reaction and counter-narrative to the sci-if series that came before about galactic empires with clear cut heroes. I wish more was said about why there is no AI or computers in The world of Dune, because it says a lot about our time now. But perhaps part 2 will elaborate.**spoilers ahead for the whole Dune series (specifically Paul's character arc) as well as The Godfather trilogy**Also, I can already see the Michael Corleone-esque character arc setup for Paul which is what made me happy more than anything. Other adaptations of Dune mistakenly lean into the white savior narrative when the original intention of the story is to illustrate how we ought to be suspicious of charismatic leaders especially those who are a ""savior"" or ""messiah."" I can see how most folks miss this as well as the fact that Jessica and Paul are manipulating a system that the Bene Gesserit put in place and are basically con artists. Also, they willingly choose a path that leads to a war that kills billions because it serves their interests. Spock's/logic's ""the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few"" is totally swept aside for personal gain. Paul is like Michel in The Godfather because we start off identifying with and understanding why he enters the world of crime (a reaction to his father's attempted assassination), but by the end both Michael and Paul are dark and tragic characters who get corrupted by power. No one wants to be Michael by the end of his story and nor will anyone want to be Paul. Paul is not the hero of the Dune series.",Dune

Not to mention you can't have a full moon and a half moon at the same time so whoever was on art for those moon scenes should be fired.HEY THE MOUSE was cool and as it's pauls FEMIN name, but his dreams he was never called ""PAUL"" sooo why was the dumb overused flashbacks calling him paul, ""TELL ME OF YOUR HOME WORLD USLE.""like i consider this movie blasphemy just in the arrogance of the director and the hype train that convinces the weak of mind to believe it's better than it really is.There where serious Character development flaws, changed scenes added scenes that made little sense unless you read the book, the barron came across more like some GOD FATHER than who he actually was, and no he wasn't SCARY he was borng, Batista did a good job cos playing an idiot comes naturally to him i guess.Javier Brewster and Jason where possibly the most accurate to their book characters (Even tho Brewster was gender swapped)
Under explained characters where def a major disapointment, Piter and Hawat both turned in to nothing more than accountants and errand boys.There was NO chemistry beetween the Barron and anyone else, no one would work for a narcissist unless being bribed or paid so his carismer and charm was missing completely, which made it unbelievable i was not convinced he could even get anyone to do anything, every time we saw him he was doing weird things, sauna, mud bath, eating, sitting in a EMPtY ROOM, like what does he do with his time, oh wait no they cut that out cos him being in to kids would be a bit TO MUCH right?There is just so much wrong with this movie i can't rant without spoilers.",Dune

Very few times did I feel like he was displaying any real passion or energy. Jason Momoa showed energy, as did Oscar Issac. Rebecca Ferguson did a fine job, too. Maybe that's what Dennis Villeneuve wanted in his directing - understated resolve. I enjoyed it, but think it is drawn out for the sequels - which are bound to follow - especially considering where it ended. Don't think so?? How much more obvious than the very last moments of the film when Chani says, ""This is just the beginning"". It just seemed to plod along much too often.

The casting was great and I enjoyed the characters and their performances. There is not one scene of this film that I thought was ""bad"" (acting wise.) Action scenes were there and the CGI was incredible. I would recommend this film to anyone who has time for it, after all it is two hours and thirty five minutes. However at some parts of this film I did get a little lost with the story. (I cannot say that I've read the book or attempted to, so I am just going but the movie.) This film to me, seemed like two different movies in one. I do think it could've been cut short at least twenty minutes, and I thought the ending wasn't that suspenseful as it could've been. The characters did change in the end, though I just think there were many other scenes in the movie where it could've ended better and have more suspense. Yet the cinematography made up for it and made the film more enjoyable. This may be a great thing to hear for Timothée Chalamet fans but I thought that all of these famous actors and actresses weren't in the film a whole bunch. It was really only Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac. I do have to say that Timothée Chalamet did give a good performance especially being the main character with all of these other great actors and actresses. This is a spoiler free review so I don't want to give too much away. In conclusion, Dune is a solid movie and it deserves most of the hype and I think this is worth watching.",Dune
3789,mjmccabe-49272,I Love This Director,8,5 November 2021,"As a fan of Dune; both the novel and the much maligned video versions, I have so much good to say about what was achieved here but a few questions on casting that stunted the overall brilliance for me.The good-
Denis Villeneuve. Man, this guy has tackled two of my favorite films (blade runner) that I thought were untouchable. Both movies have cult followings, both movies have novels seen as seminal works in the sci-fi world, both movies are viewed as sacred, not to be touched. I am not saying this man bested either film, but I am saying this guy has gifts.Cinematography. Gorgeous shots, unreal setting, hats off to the set director and costume as well.Dave Bautista - this man can act on a big stage. He had a short bit in blade runner 2049 and a short bit here. I'm truly impressed that a typecast guy can play a similar role in all his films yet break and play a role emphatically is unreal.... He's a WWE superstar, built like a brick house but you wouldn't be any the wiser.The bad (or not as good)
Paul - The central character just cannot be this weak. Kyle maclachlan in Lynch' version was not weak at all. Sure, he was a successor but a strong one and his ties to the duke believable. It's part one so who knows but I don't love this actor or the way his character is developed thus far.Duke Leto- maybe it's Paul's role weighing on me, maybe it's the dynamic in the lynch version I'm not sure. This actor is good, this character and Paul are not. I think of the moment in the Lynch version where they are on the balcony at caladan... that's where we buy them as family and commit ourselves as viewers. The dynamic here is.. not sure, I guess supervisor and subordinate? It's different and that's ok but it doesn't work for me.I'm encouraged by part one. I tip my cap to denis, thank you for the best remakes of my favorite films.",Dune

3793,chasercarrington,Very well adapted,10,21 October 2021,Very well adapted. They balance story accuracy and quality filmmaking very well. The world is phenomenally built. The film brings to life the strange but grounded world. The story doesn't finish here so it is hard to judge completely without a part 2.,Dune
3794,nicksmoviereviews,The Hype Must Flow!,8,26 October 2021,"Dune is arguably one of the most difficult books to adapt to the big screen. Over the years, there have been different interpretations to varying degrees of success. With 2021's version, director Denis Villeneuve has made the definitive version - or at least half of the book.For those unfamiliar with Dune, the story revolves around Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his family (House Atreides) who are called to inherit the planet of Arrakis. A planet that harbors the most important substance in the known universe, spice, or Melange as it's called. Arrakis is also home to an extremely arid environment, big sandworms, and natives known as the Fremen.Let's say things don't go a certain way, and a rival house, House Harkonnen led by the Baron, played menacingly by Stellan Skarsgård, has plans of their own to take back Arrakis and put an end to House Atreides. The Baron, along with his nephew, Glossu Rabban (Dave Batista), is a force to be reckoned with.That's essentially the Sparknotes version of the plot, but what viewers must understand is that Dune was written by Frank Herbert in 1965, and was instrumental in shaping the sci-fi landscape for titles such as Star Wars. Some of the themes such as having a white savior for the oppressed natives have been done before, but in the hands of Villeneuve, it is handled with care.Denis Villeneuve shows how much he cares for the book. Every character is treated with reverence, and there's a more varied ethnic cast compared to previous adaptations. Characters such as Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), and Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson) to a gender-swapped role with Liet Knes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) show that there is variety. Variety shows how every character is meticulously thought out and executed.Other actors in Dune include Josh Brolin as the weapon master Gurney Halleck; Jason Momoa as swordmaster Duncan Idaho; Javier Bardem as Stilgar, leader of the Fremen (Arrakis natives); Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother Jessica; and Zendaya as Chani, a young Fremen woman and Pauls love interest. These are some of the many actors in this ensemble cast.This meticulous craft is also on display in the technical aspect of the film. Every part of the film works, from the cinematography by Greig Fraser to the unique sounds of Arabic and haunting throat singing conjured by Hans Zimmer. Even the sense of scale is breathtaking. Giant sandworms dwarf our characters while spaceships linger menacingly from orbit. It's truly a spectacle.The spectacle is icing on the cake in regards to Denis Villeneuve's approach to storytelling. The director takes his time regarding character development to the extent that big action sequences are even more impactful. With no disrespect to the usual cinema fare of DC and Marvel movies that rely more on the action and less on deep character development; Dune acts as the antithesis of this notion. The idea of filmmakers having the capability and support to bring high-sci-fi concepts to the big-screen should be lauded. It's nice to see production companies taking a risk to bring slow-burning knowledgeable movies to the screen. As is evident in Denis Villeneuve's last outing Blade Runner: 2049, even if the film does have commercial success, yet critical.There is one thing audiences need to know when going to see Dune. The film is labeled as part 1. The film only covers the first half of the book, so don't go into the film having all of your questions answered because they won't be. As of this writing, Warner Bros. Hasn't greenlit a sequel yet. Here's hoping it does. Also, I highly recommend seeing the film in IMAX. Due to Covid still lingering, I know some people are hesitant. HBO Max is a good alternative, but if you can, try to see it in theaters to support the filmmakers; it also gives Warner Bros. A reason to greenlight part 2.Although it's only half the story, Dune is an impressive technical achievement on all fronts and one that's worth seeing on the big screen.",Dune

3800,gtyreif,"Boring, lacking substance and plot.",3,24 October 2021,"I love Denis Villeneuve's work, but this? This was just boring. I finished the book no less than 13 hours ago in preparation for the movie and loved part 1 of it, which this movie covers. It had excellent world building and the author explained what was happening and the reasons to why they were happening. Had I not read the book, I would have zero idea what was going on in the movie. It completely skips out on the importance of water to the Fremen, Mentats, and context to literally everything else. All you know is that the Harkonnens are bad, Atreides good, Spice valuable, and worm big. Everything else is just... there. With zero explanation. Feyd isn't even in the movie, or mentioned. Leto's death scene is like a minute and a half long and most of that time is just a shot of the dinner table with no talking. It was a whole lot of nothing with minor dialogue and moments of poor fight choreography. I almost fell asleep twice.The CGI when it came to the landscapes was well done, but anything else looked average and even bad in a few scenes. The acting was just okay, most the characters seemed emotionally repressed but that's a trademark of a Villeneuve movie. The music was great but that's no surprise, Hans Zimmer is extremely talented.I really liked Blade Runner 2049 & Arrival so you could say I was surprised at how unsatisfying this movie turned out to be. Movie adaptations shouldn't require their audience to first read the book to understand what's going on, that defeats the point of an adaptation. Everything that made Dune great was taken from the story. Unless the idea of being bored and confused for two & a half hours intrigues you, I'd skip this one. Hopefully part 2 will be better.",Dune
3801,legoldeon,It's the best possible adaption.,10,15 September 2021,"The film is really near to the book, it manages to show us many of the things the book first told us. Of course, the film can't show everything but what we see is just incredible and most impressing. Not only the huge and beautifull images but also especially the acting. I couldn't really say which performance was best, because i think in every film that is not Dune every single actor could have carried the entire production. Still, the performances of Jessica and Paul are probably most impressive, the actors (and the director) really do get what dune is about and what role their caracter plays in it. The performance of Leto was also extremely well done, i think it's even the only role that has been explained for me through the movie, now i am also able to understand him better in the book. The music is something out of this world, it's almost impossible to describe. The special thing about the Hans Zimmer Soundtrack is that it is not as present as in other movies he made the score of. Still the music adds athmosphere to every scene. The setpieces and costumes are something i haven't seen before, they look so alien but somehow everything still feels really lifelike. I specially like the designs of the reverend mother, the imperial spaceship and Giedi Prime.I understand why some people think the end is disappointing because it feels like the end of a tv show episode. But i also think that nobody will care anymore once we (hopefully) get to see the second film. It personally didn't bother me at all but that might just be because i already know the story...
To all who haven't read the books: Just do it, or listen one of the, how i have heard, great audiobooks. If the next film will be as magnificent as this one it won't harm your film experience at all.",Dune

3804,benjbower,Visually amazing - storyline absent!,5,29 October 2021,Firstly to be clear I was very hyped for this film. I have read the book several times. This movie flattened the complexity of the story to the point that why things are occurring is never addressed. I kept waiting to feel some of the depth of the book but it moved from one visually beautiful scene to the next without covering any of the things that made the book wonderful.The characters were not explored at all. They were all portrayed in a flat one dimensional way. Dr Yueh was a perfect example. No mention of his suk conditioning. No exploration of the reasons his betrayal was so unexpected. Baron Harkonnen was reduced to caricature. Sure he looked evil but where was the brilliant mind? Where was his subtlety?I do understand that it is next to impossible to fit the complexity of something like Dune into a movie or set of movies. My criticism is that this movie does not even try.,Dune
3805,jnbvstuff,WTF,5,31 October 2021,I can't believe I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life on a boring story that I couldn't even see much of because of the sand and darkness. Can't wait for part 2. Maybe that's where the entertainment will be.,Dune

The elaborate explanation in the dialogue about what's going on was boring and a bit too much for my liking. Also, this is part 1 of a multisequal series of movies I guess.

The movie is like someone vaguely remembered part of the first book and described it to someone. There are modifications and additions to memorable scenes that ruin the experience for me. I like a true and accurate adaption when possible. Frank Herbert's Dune is a book with a world that is more than rich enough to not need anyone to try to add to it or make it better. Visually it is stunning, however I am having to watch it at home and it was never meant for home viewing, the sound bounces between whispering to hurting my ears being so loud and that also detracts from the experience.

The point of adaptation is to take an 8 hour long read and squash it into 2 hours of watch time. Somehow, this felt like 8 hours and still wasn't a good adaptation of a somewhat uneventful book.

3814,pkapty,Dune - the drab boring celebrity stuffed version!,4,22 October 2021,"One of the things that I liked about the David Lynch version of Dune, and the TV miniseries version as well, is that most of the actors were little or unknown to me at the time, and therefore more believable to me in the roles of characters that I had spent much time with over the years in book form. The new Dune is stuffed with celebrity actors that carry too much baggage from previous films in my imagination, particularly Timothy Chalamet, and just aren't believable to me. I know that for most people this won't matter, but it is the very first reason I was sceptical about this movie even before I saw it.My all time favorite character in the Lynch version was the evil Baron. Although I like Skarsgard generally (much more than his children), he was disappointing in the role. I am not sure if this is his fault, or the fault of the director who seems hell-bent on making Dune as drab tedious and boring as possible.The Lynch version was grand and epic and full of opulent sets, characters and costumes. This new version is monochromatic (beige, my least favorite color) and lacks the epic scale and grandeur of the original film version.The one thing I like about the new version is the actress playing Chani, Zendaya. She can act. Sean Young (Chani in the Lynch version) was always nothing but set decoration on legs. Like Schwarzenegger, she is best at playing a machine as she did in Blade Runner.Overall, I am disappointed with this new version, and particularly after sitting for two and a half hours through it just to find that I will have to wait a year or more to see the second half of it. Which I probably will do but while wearing rose-tinted glasses to give it some color!",Dune

About 1/2 way through I was about to just turn it off, but decided if I was going to write a review I should at least suffer through to the end.Maybe the age of good movies is dead and shallow garbage like this is all we can expect now. Its single redeeming quality is the work that Hans Zimmer and his people put in. Otherwise (aside from Jason Momoa) it's 2 hours and 35 minutes of bad acting, shallow scripting, and bad directing. It's all just a sad affair really.Maybe they spent their whole budget on CGI and this was the best they could do with what was left over. Who ever casted this mess shouldn't get any more work either.In ending, this film should be preserved and played in film schools after the 1984 version is played as an example of how to fail at remaking movies.

The sequels not so muchThe 1984 movie had the same problem the book did: Tons of exposition, and a basically boring plot.Sorry, that was not well stated. The plot is awesome. The problem is that the plot cannot be understood without lots of exposition to expose the deep, rich background.In the 1984 movie, they did this with voice-overs. Lots and lots of voice-overs. Also, they did it with narrative in the character's heads.This movie did not include the voice-overs. So when Jessica hesitates outside the chamber where Paul is to be tested with the Gom Jabbar, you have no idea why she is hesitating, unless you read the book.I am concerned that those who have not read this book are going to hate the movie.The movie is not bad. Jason Momoa is awesome as Duncan.

3835,cezarmihalcea,"Good adaptation, fantastic film",9,22 October 2021,"I should preface this with the fact that I'm a big fan of the books, which has come to shape up my view of the film.Dune is, for all intents and purposes, a good adaptation of roughly 40% of the first book in the series. I say this with a very clear intention: this film is not complete, and that fact is very much part of the context when evaluating this film.That being said, even in its incompleteness, Dune is absolutely stunning. Every single shot produces intense sensory shock, every scene is awe-inducing. The film maintains that sense of scale and the mystical feeling that the books portray. Particular praise should go to the design of the planets, with Geidi Prime (the Harkonnen homeworld) being this rough, bio-mechanical hellhole reminiscent of Geiger, or Salusa Secundus and its eerie chanting... dudes (the introduction of the Sardaukar is one of the best scenes in the film). The sandworms look glorious, the Fremen are incredibly well thought out, and their actors' performances are amazing - their portrayal being perhaps my favourite aspect of the film.While it succeeds in its depiction of the source material, Dune does lack some detail in terms of the backing narrative. There is no mention of the butlerian jihad, and the only hint we get of the mentat's abilities are the fact that they just sort of phase out and roll their eyes backwards every now and then. It's not as jarring when you've read the books, but I imagine that the average movie enthusiast might get lost at stages.Which brings me to my last point. The 'success' of this film very much hinges on whether its second part gets released, and that's in itself conditioned by whether the first film does well in the box office. Dune is, however, not your average cinema flick, and I imagine that its rather slow pacing and its somewhat 'weird' narrative devices might alienate the average viewer. I am, however, hopeful that this film will do well, and that the second part will be approved for filming in the near future.",Dune

3837,Hoenirvii,Just watch !! You don't have to read the book to enjoy this movie,9,26 October 2021,"Dune (2021) is a movie adaptation that is completely worthy of the cinema lover's experience. At the beginning of the movie, for those who have not read the novel, it will be overwhelming and difficult to keep up with events, planets as well as clans and the variety of characters in the movie, Dune (2021) can creating a sense of confusion, but with Denis Villeneuve's vision, the leadership and presentation of the film helped viewers get a harmony and keep up with the film in the best way. The movie takes the audience to breathtaking scenes in landscape, dunes and giant sandworms, every image is very well rendered, bringing to scenes of a vast world, help viewers easily visualize what is in the novel by Fank Herbert. The cultures are harmonized by Denis by the costumes and decorations in the movie in a very unique way. Not only the epic scenes, Dune also brings action scenes filled with reality, the camera angles clearly embrace the action scenes to create an attractive, eye-catching. Dune's investment in action sequences has made it more realistic, filled with logic, not unlike the virtual action scenes like Hollywood movies when the character 1 vs 5. Besides. Meanwhile, the film's music composed by the talented composer Hans Zimmer is a mesmerizing thing, it creates an ""epic"" for the movie, enhances the value of the scenes, makes the movie becomes more and more alluring.Dune's investment is on par with top blockbusters when there are famous and talented cast such as Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Issac, Jason Monoa, Josh Brolin ... and many other actors, the film can considered to have succeeded in conveying to a vast universe, full of extraordinary things based on Dune novel. You don't have to read the book to enjoy Dune, and even if you've read it, Dune (2021) offers an enjoyable cinematic experience. The biggest regret is still coming from Warner Bros., they release a blockbuster without caring about how disappointed people who love it will feel when they only do half of the story, the fate of Dune Part 2 will be forever a mystery that makes the audience consider because they do not want to see a movie without an ending. If you decide to see Dune (2021), watch it in theaters if you can, as it deserves to be a satisfying movie on the big screen.Sorry for my bad English :(",Dune

A ruler and a planet and his concubine should convey this in looks and manner, and here the absolutely do not. And that's just one example.And for fans of the book hoping for a faithful adaption - If you didn't get the hint with the random and unnecessary sexchange of a major character - let me rephrase it: this is not a movie for you!",Dune

3842,EMAX-II,"'M' is for ""Meh""",2,20 October 2021,"From the opening voice-over, Villeneuve creates a brooding, soul-less world that adds nothing but mediocrity to an already stereotyped genre.Boiling down Herbert's 'Dune' into digestible fodder is no small undertaking - just ask 1984's 'Mr. Lynch'. It is a novel that either revered or loathed. Is it grandiose and far-reaching or pretentious and self-serving? This reviewer cannot decide.So it comes to the Blade Runner's newest chef to dice up something palatable (with spice) that sears the taste-buds of the latest movie patrons: 2-minute Noodler's with ""beattitude"". Can it be done with the sword of Warner B' hovering overhead? No, it cannot. Not at least without making a 2hr:35m MTV trailer that ticks every box on the corporate ROI checklist, and this is EXACTLY what it accomplishes: in spades.Dune redux is bland and humourless. It neither makes any statement nor objects to any. It takes no sides, makes no deliberate choices and refuses to break from current offerings. It is, in fact, predictable, foreseeable and, unfortunately: forgettable. Like most serial space epic additions (save 'Rogue One'), Villeneuve's Dune assumes its audience are illiterate and creates a film where one must be one to enjoy it .2 Stars **",Dune

A true genius taking on one of the toughest books to adapt and made it all the better, exciting and suspenseful. The storytelling elements in the film are something we rarely see, it was absolutely masterful.The music from Hans Zimmer is extraordinary, truthful and unique.The cinematography for me was in my honest opinion, the best I have ever witnessed in all my +40 years of going to the movies, true eye candy.The acting and performances were very very good, especially from Timothée Chalamet and it will definitely grant him an Oscar nomination and I wouldn't be surprised at all if he wins the Oscar. He put on a truly unique and captivating performance that I felt deep in my soul and never stopped thinking about for days after the film.The overall experience made me share my first honest review.

It is exactly how I pictured it when I read Dune, and I cannot give higher praise than that!!",Dune

It didn't even seem to get to 1/3 of the book, and just ends. Did they run out of money?Structure, direction, but also acting let it down - Timothée Chalamet is too scrawny, innocent and doesn't have the gravitas needed to play Paul Atreides.Such a pity as the director Dennis Villenueve was immaculate until now with his Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Sicario. This is his first doozy.I guess the saying is true, Dune the book is near impossible to film as its so psychdelic also. I don't think this version adds anything to the other cinematic visions of Dune before (by Lynch, and the mini series). Plus, is quite forgettable after those spectacular ""Perfume ad shots in the desert"" fade from memory. Yes it looks good, like an ad does.Big disappointment for me cosidering the director is one of my favourites, plus I like the book (read it twice).",Dune
3851,huhogobagoly,The silver screen as an uncredited actor.,10,29 October 2021,"I have not read the books and am not familiar with the story, I went to see this because I am a big fan of Denis Villeneuve. (and now I want to read the books as well, sharpish)The experience blew me away. The acting, the soundscape, the photography, the set and costume design are all amazing. Beyond words, really, you have to see it to understand how powerful this thing is.BUT you have to see this on the big screen - you need to EXPERIENCE it, not simply WATCH it, preferably on the biggest screen available in your area (that's what I did). Watching this at home on a TV or god forbid, a laptop, would be like erasing one of the main characters from one of your favorite flicks. Think Fight Club without Brad Pitt, Toy Story without Buzz Lightyear. It just would not work.The storytelling is almost not even important: the ambience, the audiovisual force, the acting, are all so powerful, it could be a two-hour long Coke Zero advertisement and it would still be worth your time and money (but of course the story is good as well, certainly good enough to give the scenes a meaning and tie them together nicely).I guess I am trying to say this is more in the ""audiovisual art""-category rather than in the ""run-of-the-mill CGI rubbish"" you would expect these days from expensive Hollywood productions (cough*MCU*cough).Downsides?1, Too damn short, I want more! It hurts that it ended in less than 3 hours. I would have watched it for 6 hours straight, no issue.2, In a month or so it will start to get hard to catch in cinemas, which is a pity, as I cannot see myself watching it at home.",Dune
3852,amycgoodall,I love Dune,10,1 November 2021,I love the six book series by Frank Herbert. I reread them at least once a year. I was excited for this adaptation after learning of the director's love of the books! I had very high hopes! As the trailers started coming out- I noticed some changes and began to be more and more nervous that the movie would stray too far from Frank Herbert's vision! After watching this stunning movie- I can say that there are changes to compensate for time- but the vision remains!I love this movie! I cannot wait to watch it with my grandsons! I highly recommend this to you! I hope the movie inspires to read the Dune Series!,Dune

We are introduced to so many characters that are not used again, they just appear do something small that does not impact the story at all and they never appear again in the movie. This movie had no story at all, just new scenes, nothing that happens in this movie impacted the story. It's just pointless to watch..The Positive:

Sure, there were moments of action but these were brief and fleeting and with little tension at all.The visuals were well executed, but none of them felt new or exciting, aside from the dragonfly ships the architecture of ships and buildings alike were more or less simple geometric shapes. We've seen these things done elsewhere already, and executed much better. Dune looks like the space versions of medieval movies where everything is brown and dirty.Sound-wise the movie did alright, the design overall was good, but musically it had nothing unique, iconic or noteworthy.The story might have been fresh and exciting 60 years ago, but today it just brings elements we've seen a thousand times by now, and we've seen them executed better elsewhere.I had really looked forward for this movie, I had invited friends and family, some I knew were big Lord of the Rings and Star Wars fans, and hoped this would be right up their ally. Dune could have engaged us, at least entertained us. Instead we left the movie disappointed by a pretentious and vapid affair.",Dune
3858,michaelday-74984,Average to say the least,5,24 October 2021,I've read the series of books and this movie was more of an adaption on the 1994 Lynch movie which was less than average. Like the 1994 version that didn't really launch any careers this will unfortunately be the same for Timothée Chalamet who is so terribly cast it's rediculous. The support of some massive stars did nothing to help either. This movie is way too long and way too slow. It gets 5 for it's stunning cinematography.,Dune

3860,rappman-29189,A masterpiece on every level,10,19 September 2021,"As far as I remember, this is the first review I've EVER done in IMDB. I'm a critical judge - and my two sons aged 16 and 22 are even tougher critics. We just saw the film in IMAX and all agreed: 10/10. I've personally been waiting 40 years for this film, ever since I first read Dune as a teenager in the early 1980s.This is definitely one of the best film adaptations from a book that I've ever seen. The comparisons to LOTR are appropriate - they (the original three LOTR films) held the Film Adaptation crown in my book until now, and remain gold standard. Until now. That said, it's really important not to compare the FILMS - this is a very different story than LOTR, with different speeds and different character development. You aren't supposed to develop a strong emotional attachment to the various characters in Dune in the same way as in LOTR. That isn't the point. This film is a phenomenal adaptation of arguably the best science fiction novel of all time, an adaptation that I'd accepted as impossible years ago after all the failed attempts. For me the bar on this film was so high that it was off the charts. And they nailed it.When I learned that Villeneuve was taking a shot at this one, I was hopeful - I was so impressed with the story and visuals of Arrival (on my Top 10 list of films across all genres), and I thought he succeeded well with a daunting task in attacking the next step in Blade Runner - which has been (was) my favourite SF film since, well, 1982. I was hopeful, and now I'm relieved.This film isn't just about Villeneuve, his adaptation and the insanely beautiful cinematography, of course. Zimmer's music, in IMAX, just pulled us into the world that Villeneuve created. And every actor in the film nailed it. EVERY actor (for those taking cheap shots at Momoa). The casting is brilliant. In many films these days I think the push for cast diversity (while needed) sometimes overshadows the story. It just works here, for example with the brilliant gender-swap of Kynes. Sure, there isn't complete consistency in the various accents across the characters. But it just doesn't matter. The actors all shine - I can't imagine re-casting any of the roles. This film succeeds at all levels.Yes, Part I is about setting the stage. No, it doesn't have a conclusion. But that's the whole point - Villeneuve broke it into two parts in order to keep as much fidelity as possibly. And he succeeded. I really, really, really hope that, even if the box office doesn't overwhelm in these crazy days, they don't hesitate to let Villeneuve finish this story. That would be a crime on so many levels that I don't even want to think about it.I don't write this text lightly. It's hard for me to express the important role Dune has played in my literary life, in a way that overflowed into the rest of my life. I read the first three books so many times as a teenager that - when I did my first year in France as an exchange student in the 80s and was just learning the language - I bought all three books translated into French and read them, in French, with a dictionary, word for word - because I knew the stories so well that I could grasp the storyline. And I kept those French versions until this year because of what they symbolised for me. Crazy as it sounds, Dune helped me learn French, and was part of impacting the trajectory of my life. As we watched the film yesterday, my sons kept looking over at me, grinning, to see how I was reacting. I was grinning back.",Dune

There's not a single aspect of this film that isn't at least great if not phenomenal. When I did see this in theatres I was sitting there thinking this is in my top 5 movies of all time but two people sitting in front of me walked out halfway through viewing. So I can understand this film is not for everyone. But this is one of the greatest ""first part"" films I have ever seen. The way the movie shows you the politics, social and religious conditions of this universe it is unmatched. I honestly believe this film has better worldbuilding than A New Hope does.

3872,stacytg,An experience rather than a traditional film,6,27 October 2021,"This film was always going to be difficult and for me doesn't quite succeed. It feels more like a series of large scale animated postcards from Arrakis instead of a continuous film. Beautifully done but with a limited, dark palette and the now so common bass sound we seem to get from modern sci-fi.Somehow the pacing is slow without imparting much of the story clearly. I don't feel the role of the mentats was explained, though I did like the way it was shown them rolling their eyes but was insufficient for the job. The role of Piter as Baron Harkonnens mentat was barely their at all and Feyd Rautha is massively underdeveloped. Also underexplained are the Landsraad and the Navigators guild but just enough is done to impart the importance of the spice. Similarly Shadout Mapes is barely there and the Liet Kynes I'd like to have seen more of as one of the better acted and conveyed characters.On the rest of the characters
Duke Leto - Empathetically played by Oscar Issac but lacked the regal authority, I don't recall him actually being called Duke
Paul Atreides - Timothée Chalamet is spot on for the role, conveying both the youth and physical skill of Paul.Lady Jessica - Strong and vunerable like in the book, I personally liked the performance though I can see how some might see her as a slightly weakened version
Gurney and Duncan - both good but I think I would have cast them the other way around as Jason Mamoa seems to have more chemistry with Timothée Chalamet.Dr Yueh - another underdeveloped character whose wife isn't mentioned until after his betrayal. Without creating the sympathy for this character the betrayal is less impactful.Baron Harkonnen - Mumbling and menacing in a way that reminded me of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse now. It certainly works better than the over the top caricature in the original film.Overall it looked and sounded epic, but lacked the emotional feel and pace to be much more than mediocre. I couldn't quite bring myself to give it 7/10 but it was close.",Dune

3874,ajbatra,Lacking in Imagination and Insight,3,23 October 2021,"A visually bland telling of Part 1 of Dune the book. Superficial and lacking insight. In fact Villeneuve has taken the Fank Herbert out of Dune. In the book, the background is that humanity has succeeded in defeating the Thinking Machines in the Butlerian Jihad. There is a prohibition on AI and large networked systems (thinking machines).....and atomic weapons . This results in the development of a range of bio-physical technologies. The Bene Gesserit in genetics, manipulation of people and populations, and the control of mind and breathing (prana yoga); the Bene Tleilax in genetics, cloning, prosthetics and bio-chemistry, the Suk specialising in medicine, the Mentats as masters of logic and reasoning and the Spacing Guild Navigators drug ehanced mutants that can manipulate space in time. All human technologies. The great houses and their politics are a sideshow and insignificant in the broad sweep of Frank Herberts world. Arrakis as a planet is the site of a huge geoforming and ecological event. In Part 1, we learnt nothing about sand trouts and their relation with water. There is not even an attempt at world building. The movie glosses over space travel, suk conditioning, the Emperor, Princess Irulan, and the warfare is basically Marines against Marines. The sets are bland, as if the only precious thing in the universe is melange surely there could be colour and jewels and finery and wonderful things at the Emperors court. The Fremen are austere, but if every one else is also austere then what sets the Fremen apart. The feared Sardaukar are a joke. Their ferocity and their cruelty are not established. They have very little by way of tactical weaponry. Subsequently the achievement of the Fremen in defeating the Sardaukar, albeit with the aid of wierding ways, will not ring true. Frank Herberts Dune was enormous in scope and detail and at its heart a celebration of humans and the power of the mind. Mr. Villeneuve does not get it. Atleast David Lynch got it and made a good fist of presenting Frank Herbert's vision.",Dune

In general, I find that many current sci-fi films are not able to give me the feeling of really being part of the world. In other sci-fi movies the battles are often very ""martial-arts""-like, here exactly these moments are incredibly realistic. It's been a long time since I've been able to turn off my artist brain that constantly sees flaws in the execution of movies, and instead just enjoy it. Especially to have the feeling that it was worth it to watch the film in the cinema I found great. I haven't read the Dune books and could just watch a wonderful sci-fi masterpiece. Thank you so much for this! I hope this movie sets new standards for other franchises.",Dune

The movie does a good job explaining the complicated world for those unfamiliar. The only negative thing I can say about this movie was that it was released on HBO Max at the same time.

3887,wirednights,Boring movie & characters,3,24 October 2021,"Tim Chalamet as Paul, he just looks too weak and boyish. Centering the story around whether he's really ""The One"" has been done to death in cinema. The scene where Paul puts his hand in a box was so dumb & lazily written. He barely shows any pain, instead the director focuses on Paul's mother outside the door having a bizarre monologue that's supposed to be deep and though-provoking, but comes off as vapid and portentous. The first 30 minutes of this film drags, it's so boring. The characters aren't interesting or memorable. All the men speak in a very low register because this movie takes itself too seriously. The women whisper or are crying and hysterical. The dialogue was difficult to hear. There was a short, enjoyable scene of brotherly camaraderie between Duncan and Paul, but it never lead anywhere. The dialogue is so unrealistic, I was rolling my eyes. None of it feels organic but more like exposition with a British accent. What happened to ""show, don't tell""?Weak fight scenes, most of them are in darkness. The shield CGI effect was disorienting and hard to see what was happening between all the camera cuts. Duncan Idaho, the undefeatable alpha-male warrior of this universe, is dead 15 seconds into his fight scene. Really?! C'mon! The thopter scenes were impressive, as were the wide outdoor shots showcasing this massive desert world. This was a nice contrast to the many dark, drably-lit indoor scenes. The sandworm scene consuming the mining tractor was the only captivating scene in the whole movie.The music was lots of long, bending brass notes like Zimmer did in Blade Runner 2016. There's no discernible theme. It has atmospheric qualities and occasionally rich textures that blend well with on-screen events. But it comes at the expense of harmony & melodies, making for an ultimately forgettable soundtrack. Considering how alien and unfamiliar this world appears on screen, why did they choose such a mainstream composer?All in all, a visually-impressive CGI spectacle devoid of any playfulness or likeable characters, you'll forget as soon as it's over. I'll be skipping Part II.",Dune

Even when I turn my volume all the way up, I couldn't hear a lot of what they were saying. So, I missed a bunch of what was going on. Luckily I read the book (albeit, a long time ago) so I pieced most of it together. On the flip side, when their were explosions, music etc. It was so loud I had to turn my volume down to 25%. I wish the sounds were more even, and I especially wish I could have heard everything for that. Plus, some of the scenes were to dark to see what was happening. If not for that, I would have given the movie a solid 9. The movie was very well cast and the actors were awesome.",Dune

3891,justindauzat,Bluh blah snooze,2,27 October 2021,I never write these but I had to on this movie. I was so bored through this entire 2 and 1/2 hour movie. It seemed like every scene was from its own separate movie. I could not care less about the characters nor story. It took 1 hour 15 minutes just to get to engaging part in the movie. Im a big fan of long movies if done right but this movie was not done right. It could have been better cutting it in half or more. I will say though the music was atmospheric and the shotsets were pretty but that's about it.,Dune

3895,shikikainin,A visually stunning example of bad storytelling.,3,24 October 2021,"My expectations were incredibly high for Dune after having looked at the cast, director, composer and IMDB rating for this film. It is now safe to say that I have never been more let down by a film for as far back as I can remember. There was quite literally nothing on the character development front, which is a damn shame considering the people playing them can do wonders if only they were given better material to work with. Unfortunately however, you find yourself not caring about any of the characters in this film, not even a bit. The dialogue is about as generic as that of a Marvel film with all the quips taken out. The story is predictable at every turn. On top of that, it offered nothing new to the table when it comes to sci-fi/action/epic films. You can literally watch Star Wars, LOTR or GOT and be more entertained and satisfied in every single way. Overall, Dune doesn't have enough action to be entertaining and isn't thought provoking or original enough to be worshipped by ""pretentious film goers"" such as myself, putting it in this middle area that simply doesn't work.",Dune
3896,sahnchob,"Great prophecy, magnificent cinematography",9,28 October 2021,"Completely different from the current Hollywood commercial blockbusters, especially the superhero movies of Marvel and DC series, Villeneuve did a subtraction in Dune: abandoned the most commonly used three-stage structure of commercial blockbusters; do not rely on stories' ups and downs of the plot attract the audience; the climax of the scene is not the last to let the audience get stimulating pleasure... This version of ""Dune"" is an immersive experience that allows the audience to enter the desert world of Arrakis. In Villeneuve's Dune, its form is the content, atmosphere is the theme, style is the expression and the environment is the story.The character is fighting to the death with the enemy for a crown, an honour and an idea, but unexpectedly still becomes a chess piece of fate, driven by fate. Paul doesn't want to be the saviour and the leader of the family to avenge the family, but he has no choice.Although the characterisation space in the film is slightly limited due to the magnificence of the world view, Paul still shows his confusion and the confusion-in the exiled desert, he seems to wake up from dreams and hallucinations, saying that he saw countless people shouting his name, killing, conquering and blaming his mother in his name. The sisterhood turned him into a monster with superpowers, as Roman Roland said, ""There is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it."" Paul's confusion about his identity and resistance to the fate imposed on him are also what I really want to see in the second and subsequent stories.",Dune

When I saw the original movie, I had a lot of questions about some of the missing details in the storytelling. So, I ended up reading 3 of the Dune books to help me understand. Like imperial conditioning that Huey went through. We didn't see enough of the perverted Baron. Did I miss seeing the Emperor? What about the evolved navigators and how they are able to fold space. In 2:35 there should have been more details especially, if a sequel is planned. I should not have to wait 2 years to see how the details to this storyline is handled.A BIG disappointment.

3905,flaviusglamfenix,Visually awesome and half empty inside,6,19 September 2021,"I waited for the movie from the time I've heard it will be produced. By the time I've already read the book (like it) and watched Lynch's Dune (1984) movie (I think it is not so bad). So I understood what this film should be about and knew who are the Bene Gesserit sisters, what does Kwisatz Haderach means and why the spice is important in the universe of Dune.From the very beginning I felt that movie was epic. Great plans of Caladan and Arrakis are huge and immersive. Film tries to build an atmosphere and Dennis Villeneuve is famous about it. He can create an immerse film with some fill. Music and visual does just the right thing. What can go wrong then?Movie lacks dialogs, motivation and world building. I don't want to say that book was better. The film must be an art work by itself. There are two houses in conflict probably (Why don't Harkonnens like Atreides?). Both of them quite powerful I guess. And there are galactic emperor that orders Atreides to take control over the Arrakis. Just like in the book. But there we get to understand more about the conflict and the world, about power of the families and it status and by the time action comes to Arrakis objectives is understood. Movie does not give any answers to the question. We get something like good family of main hero and bad family with nameless (seriously somebody got a name of the Baron Harkonnen?) ugly Baron in charge. According to film it is just some militaristic family with no honor (in sense that we don't want to identify ourselves with them).Personalities of Duncan and Gurney are completely off. Maybe it is just subjective and I imagined them differently, but here they are just empty. Both brave. One of them can play some instrument. Both loyal to Atreides. That is basically all character building we get for them.Main ideas of the book were not present in the file neither. One sentence about colonialism and one scene that might bring question about ecology is just not enough for the book that famous by these topics.I wish film did more more immerse plot that allowed me to like that characters, to know them and remember them. Currently I see that movie should be watched home with the book somewhere close by. One should watch a brilliant scene, listen to the great sounds and then read a chapter from the book.",Dune

3907,walker-01626,What a waste,1,24 October 2021,Sad to see one of the greatest science fiction books ever reduced to such a complete piece of garbage. I don't know how anyone who has never read the novel could possibly understand what was hopelessly trying to be conveyed. Ideas such as the voice were somewhat explained. The scene with the gom jabbar made no sense. Almost nothing was explained. I'm assuming things were were introduced with the conception the viewer would somehow be able to extrapolate their meaning out of thin air. I admit I am a purist. Why take an excellent story and pervert it to something barely recognizable. When Liet Kynes' character was introduced I lost all interest. I was so looking forward to the film and was extremely disappointed. Will definitely not watch part 2.,Dune
