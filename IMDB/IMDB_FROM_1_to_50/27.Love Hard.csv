0,ops-52535,a x.mas movie...,7,6 November 2021,"For all the lonely ones out there searching for a soulmate and lovemate, try this plot of love and you will be matched for sure.A decent christmas romantic comedy with loads of lights and props that gives a rush of x-mas, a story that you will hang on to due to its abnormalities, and last but not least the great and funny acting by the two mains, but also the rest of the cast. Its the chinese kidnapped victim from ''patriots day'' and the little sister of the balded boss of ''need for speed 1'' that recieves the price from the grumpy old man as some of the sweetest youve seen for years.Yes its sweet, and a little sad too, it has a good screenplay, and the editing gives you quite a few surprises that is so hilarious that i lolled my way through this all on my own.And that is not an award that i give away so easily, so try it if youre curious, you wont be dissapointed, here theyve hit the target very well.",Love Hard
1,lisafordeay,A catfish story with a Xmas setting,6,6 November 2021,"Love Hard is a 2021 Netflix Original starring Nina Dobrev. A young woman named Nataile can't find love at all and decides to try online dating only to be catfished. However when she sees a profile of a guy named Josh, she is instantly smitten with him. So she does the unthinkable and travels across the globe to surprise Josh. When she does see Josh,she is shocked to discover that Josh isnt the guy on the profile as his Asian. The real guy on the profile was Josh's former friend Tag( who Nataile is smitten with). Josh asks Nataile to pretend to be his girlfriend during the Xmas period only to pretend that they are engaged.Will Josh and Nataile get together or Nataile and Tag.Overall its a predictable film yet enjoyable at the same time. If you liked While You Were Sleeping, You've Got Mail then check it out.",Love Hard
2,aidanratesmovies,"Could've been better, could've been worse",6,9 November 2021,"Fit with charging leads and atmosphere- but lacking a fitting narrative- Love Hard is more good than bad- but it also could have been a lot more. For a while now I have been a huge fan of comedian Jimmy O. Yang and i'm so glad he finally got the leading man role he deserves. The guy just radiates charisa, along with his charismatic co-star Nina Dobrev who plays our lead character- both with perfect chemistry along the way. The film is well paced and entertaining all the way through, but the script suffers some major issues throughout and doesn't seem to know what to do with its interesting premise. There are a handful of corny moments, predictable moments, and it follows a pretty standard formula in the end. But overall, its charm and lead actors make the film better than the sum of its parts, and make it worth at the very least a one time watch. In the end, I hope to see both Dobrev and Yang in more films of this type in the future, and i'm optimistic for what the future holds for both of their blossoming careers. Its a romantic film with some subpar moments, and maybe that's all it needs to be.My Rating: 6.2/10.",Love Hard

4,brookenichole-98054,I really liked it!,9,6 November 2021,"Love Hard is amazing! I love Catfish: The show so I assumed I would enjoy this. Surprisingly, I almost loved it! This movie had gorgeous Christmas decorations, a beautiful story, and hilarious jokes. Also, I did not know Nina Dobrev could sing? The singing in the movie was something added I never knew I needed. I don't understand why they used a different voice for Harry Shum Jr. When he was on Glee, but I think it was a joke.I will watch this every year!",Love Hard
5,Movi3DO,Thanksgiving who?,7,8 November 2021,"Wow I wish this is real I wish this is real so hard.A Christmas romcom added to Netflix. A girl from LA got catfished by an Asian guy, but she agreed to pretend to date him until Christmas as long as he helped her dating the guy she wanted.Make no mistake, this was a cheese fest. There ain't anything that will surprise anyone who watch a bit of romcom, so it would be a waste of time to talk about them. However, to my own surprise I actually enjoyed this movie. Only some of the jokes were cringe, and the rest did make me laugh. The cast was decent throughout and there wasn't a particular performance that I hated.I somehow mistaken the main actress, Nina Dobrev, as the beautiful red witch Elizabeth Olsen when I watched the trailer, but I didn't complain because Dobrev is also a quarter.Overall, Thanksgiving is a myth. Time for Christmas. 6.5/10.",Love Hard
6,legobuilderpro,Catfished love,5,7 November 2021,"Something like this has been done before, but there is some different things in it and the chemistry of the characters was ok.The acting was pretty good for the type of romantic comedy that this movie is, also the locations that they go to can at times feel like the Holidays.I didn't find it really funny. I did snicker a bit at certain scenes, but I wish it was funnier to watch when they gave their lines.I will say that the ending was a little cute and heartwarming, but I did want the main characters to have a little more chemistry with each other than the amount we got.I'm going to say that this is at least worth checking out or if you don't like it then I understand, this isn't for everyone.",Love Hard
7,jakethesnake-42007,Cute but nothing special,5,6 November 2021,It's a cute Xmas movie that's above the hallmark films tho it's been done and there's really nothing special about the film. There's moments but not enough to make it good film but enough to make an ok one.,Love Hard
8,laragi,Well...,5,5 November 2021,Nina looks like she has no eyelashes. The film was not quite believable but what Christmas film is? I liked it. A couple of hilarious moments.Super sappy at the end but definitely worth watching.,Love Hard
9,spasek,Lack of Chemistry Between the Leads Prevents This From Being a True Hit,6,7 November 2021,"For the most part, the movie is a good one. It's not entirely your typical Christmas movie, although it does borrow a number of overused cliches, there are a few twists to them that aren't typical.Nina Dobrev is supposed to sell us her character and make us believe--in the end--she prefers Josh to Tag. She doesn't succeed. You can see her eyes and chemistry take in Tag while it's forced and completely wooden in regard to Josh. While the end is a nice idea, we're unable to buy it because Dobrev is unable to sell it.Still, the movie's premise is actually a very good one. Many people who suffer from a low self-esteem, or those caught up in a very superficial ideal about what a ""perfect mate"" is supposed to look like, find themselves invariably thrown a curveball. The person suffering from low self-esteem can never truly believe that they are worthy enough. And the person caught up in an unrealistic ideal will always be disappointed by the outcome. Enter Josh and Natalie, each representing these all-too common aspects.Josh is able to swoon Natalie by creating a real online dating profile with fake photos. Natalie is completely enamored with the whole package, until she realizes that the wrapping isn't what she thought it was.We get a very typical and overused plot line in which--after finding the real Tag--Josh agrees to help her land him. On the other side, Josh asks Natalie to pose as his girlfriend for the sake of his family. Sound familiar? I thought Hallmark had a copyright on these things.As you might easily guess, the ""plan"" falls apart. However, the way in which the reveal happens as well as the confession, are actually done quite differently from what you might have expected.The performances are very good across the board. What ultimately prevents this move from really working is the lack of chemistry between Dobrev and Yang. Dobrev treats him more like a kid brother than a love interest. We are unable to buy for a second, that her character has any romantic or loving feelings for Yang's character, which unfortunately, makes us not believe in the contrived ending at all.In the end, we get a very wasted effort in which we are given a very bland and vanilla ending to what should have been something far more profound. However, the film's ultimate message about learning to just be yourself, is the true winner here.The movie gets points for its message as well as not using the entire Hallmark playbook that so many Christmas films utilize. It does have some uniqueness to it. It's just so unfortunate that--in the end--the romance is as lacking as a Christmas cookie without any sugar and spice.",Love Hard
10,ThomasColquith,A Pleasant Film,7,7 November 2021,"I watched ""Love Hard"" today and it was just what I was looking for, something light and fun. This film has a nice Christmas vibe and doesn't strain any brain cells, but it is an enjoyable even if predictable ride. Though I didn't like her taking the Baby Jesus statue. Why most films always include such jibes? But other than that nothing offensive. In summary, I give it a 7/10.",Love Hard
11,royhectorkabanlit,A bit to unbelievable in the End,6,6 November 2021,"A mainly Formulaic Rom-Com, right down to the perky Best Friend for the Female Lead. However, it does have enough Twists of its own to make it interesting, like Nina's Karaoke Scene, for example.However, in the end (Spoilers) I just thought that Jimmy Yang and Nina Dobrev are just too far apart to be believable as a Couple, unless they turned him into a Billionaire or something, which they didn't.Watchable enough for me, if nothing better is around, which it is since the other Netflix Movie that premiered, ""The Harder They Fall"" was an absolute Piece of Crap.",Love Hard
12,yongkang-27205,"Run of the mill, but a great one at that",7,8 November 2021,"Using the backstory of getting catfished, it sets the scene for yet another Christmas feel good romance. Suffice to say, it was nothing special, after the countless Christmas feel good romance that have come out over the years, it isn't much that sets it apart. But what can be seen as a bane is in fact a boon. This trope is a classic, and hey, for a Christmas feel good romance, it still does the trick, giving that flutter in your heart, the dreaminess in your head, and a warmth you feel in your bones, making yourself smile like a fool. Unlike the title, Love Hard, is not a title that is hard to love.",Love Hard
13,toddsgraham,Entertaining but lacking in chemistry between the leads...,6,5 November 2021,"It is no Richard Curtis film, but it is entertaining nonetheless. The storyline revolves around Natalie (played by Nina Dobrev), a Los Angeles journalist, whose column chronicles her unlucky dating encounters. When she falls for her dream guy (from Lake Placid, NY) on a dating app, Tag (played by Darren Barnet), she decides to surprise him for the holidays. Things are not as they seem, as she soon finds out that she has been catfished by Josh (played by Jimmy Yang). And so, the romantic comedy begins as we follow Natalie's attempts to find real love. The film is a light-hearted exploration of the pitfalls of online dating and stresses how focusing on the physical misses the point of love (with some digs at the popular Christmas film 'Love Actually'). The writers draw on a popular plot device: deception/mistaken identity. Though in this film, this has multiple layers. There were several funny scenes and good dialogue between Natalie and Josh throughout the film. You will no doubt have a few laughing-out-loud moments as you watch. Indeed, the storyline kept me entertained and engaged throughout. The acting too was very strong. As a fan of the 'Vampire Diaries', I was looking forward to seeing Nina Dobrev on screen. Her performance did not disappoint. That is, she had a very convincing performance. Jimmy Yang had a decent performance as well (pulling off several funny one-liners). However, one of the weaknesses of the film was the lack of chemistry between the two (Natalie and Josh). Put simply, it was not convincing. As a result, the ending did not land, unfortunately. To be fair, I could feel this develop in Dobrev's performance as the film progressed, but felt no reciprocity here in Yang's performance. He was funny but not very convincing when it came to a romantic connection. Finally, the film had a nice Christmas vibe to it, and the soundtrack was pretty good as well. If you enjoy the romantic comedy Christmas movie genre, then this one is worth checking out.",Love Hard
14,Chrispearce2,I've seen worse,6,8 November 2021,"Not a bad Christmas movie, there will be no surprises but also no disappointments. Give it a go for a warm fuzzy feeling if not a little cheesey queesy.",Love Hard
15,zendatrim,Finding true love mixed with christmas,10,7 November 2021,"Well i loved this. I wasnt sure but it hooked me in minutes. Totally different xmas movie. It was about finding love the real love not make believe. People hiding behind false identies because they dont think they are worthy of anything else. Just be yourself is the morale of the story.Only thing i struggled with was the male lead I thought he couldnt be more then 18 lol. Anyway it was funny, had its moments, no smut just a good honest clean family movie for christmas. It covered different things including sibling jealousy, falling in love out of your ethnic group, learning about families and tradition.Yep it made me laugh in places. The movie didnt take itself too seriously.All the actors were good. I was sad when it ended, i would love to see a part 2.I loved the ending.",Love Hard
16,jared-25331,One of the biggest surprises of 2021!,10,7 November 2021,"I'm not the biggest fan of this Christmas Romantic Comedies, espeically the ones on Hallmark, but what drew me to watching this film was that McG was the producer on the film, & I'm a fan of McG & his owrk in both film & TV, especially the Charlie's Angels films, Babysitter films, & Supernatural.Love Hard (2021) was fantatsic from start to finish. Does it have the traditional Christmas Movie Cliches? Yes, but McG takes those cliches & does something different with them. Throughout the film, I had a big smile on my face. Nina Dobrev & Jimmy O. Yang have fantastic chemistry with each other. Also as an added bonus, I love the spot where Nina Dobrev say that Die Hard is the greatest Christams Movie of All Time, which it is.Overall, Love Hard (2021) is fantastic. I was smiling throughout the 100 minutes of this film. I higlhy recommend that you watch this film, especially if you're a fan of McG.",Love Hard
17,knedb,Yeah... right...,4,8 November 2021,"It was a somewhat entertaining movie, but totally unrealistic. We live in too much of a superficial world. No way Natalie would ever get together with Josh in real life. The movie talks about being honest, but yet it's a big lie.",Love Hard
18,durham100,If Anna faris...,6,8 November 2021,"And katherine mcphee had a baby she would look like Nina Dobrev. This is a rom com with an edge and is at time really funny and also very christmassy. A perfectly well acted, well written time passer. I enjoyed it a lot.",Love Hard
19,Healing_Process,Potential that missed the mark,4,6 November 2021,"Lovehard is a Christmas movie where Nina Dobrev's character falls in love with an online persona on a dating app after increasing her search range. Later she finds out that she was catfished but the man in the pictures that the catfish was using was also a real person that lives near the catfish. This is where the drama ensues and the movies really takes place. You can mostly guess where the movie will go and it does have all of the typical Christmas ideas thrown into the movie. The only reason I didn't personally like it was that Nina Dobrev's character was just there, not completely likable and the catfish was almost like a placeholder for a better actor to take his place. The chemistry just didn't make it feel like a romance movie. Only a film that was making fun of itself. Nothing else to really bring about in this film, but if you like your cookie cutter Christmas Romance movies, give it a try.",Love Hard
20,boboceaelena,Really enjoyed this movie,9,6 November 2021,I didn't gave it too much credit but I have said why not? It was really entertaining with a lot of actual funny moments and jokes. I really enjoyed this movie.,Love Hard
21,AristarchosTheArchivist,"Very understated, wholesome and honest Christmas movie. Heartwarmingly recommended.",8,5 November 2021,"I don't usually like Christmas movies, but this one is pretty great. It has something that is lacking in many other movies:
Honest feelings, no kitsch, good-hearted humor. It's not a romp and there's no gross-out stuff, just a beautiful romance. The story has been done in numerous ways, but to do something like ""Love Hard"" deserves merit.Highly recommeded for cuddling into a blanket with hot cocoa.",Love Hard
22,tlharrison-59546,Eh.. was hoping it'd be better,3,8 November 2021,"Predictable movie. Main character is impossible to root for as they wrote her to be shallow, selfish, and oblivious. If this were compared to a typical Hallmark Christmas movie, I'd say the acting is better but the plot is just as bad. I didn't feel the main characters had any chemistry at all. I would have preferred to see another female play the lead. Lots of cringy elements, such as Die Hard - Baby, it's Cold Outside - theme from The Breakfast Club. The writers just plucked out common pieces of pop culture to assign the main character a personality... and it was awful. Best part of the movie was probably the Lin family or Kerry. There were some enjoyable moments in the movie, but doubt I'll watch it again.",Love Hard
23,gatorgus48,Quite enjoyable.,8,9 November 2021,"I laughed out loud several times, eyes watered a bit at one point. While a couple characters were a bit much at first, good characters overall. Well acted by the leads.Nice to see it end the way it did.",Love Hard
24,melodyso,I truly enjoyed it!,10,7 November 2021,"It checked all the boxes. Festive, romantic, funny. Obviously there's some chessy part. But overall they are very creative with the storyline. I'm entertained and touched at times. I love the sincerity in the characters. It's a hopeful delightful watch and also down to earth and relatable:)",Love Hard
25,alandeza,I enjoyed it,9,8 November 2021,"Im a sucker for a schmaltzy romantic comedy, and this film is right up my alley. The whole cast were great and I would love to see where the story goes next. Also, as an Asian American this made me very happy.",Love Hard
26,heno-45762,BEST MOVIE,9,8 November 2021,"First am a Guy and I found this movie more funny than anything. It is a romantic comedy but more comedy. Netflix did a show with no political correctness involved which should be done more often. I also noticed that this movie is funny cause, comments from the guy and how the main women acts in this film is fairly true. Sometimes you don't see what is straight in-front of you. An women seem to always change themselves to suit that guy. Anyway Yippi-Ki-Ah.",Love Hard
27,mps_animaxfriends,I know there were some negative reviews,7,7 November 2021,"There was a lot of discourse about ""Asian representation"" in this movie. Specifically Jimmy's ""nerd"" look.But honestly, this was a great movie.She is a selfish and shallow person.Josh isn't. Though he is who we all want in a partner. And honestly it's true. There's more to a person than their looks.",Love Hard
28,DVK1234,Cute Christmas Movie,8,8 November 2021,"I wasn't expecting much from Netflix but I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the actors did a good job, and unlike other reviews I did see chemistry between Josh and Natalie. Friends first, then lovers. I thought that the scene where she kissed Tag after their date and she was completely underwhelmed was where she realized that Tag was not the ""happy ending"" she was looking for. It was a little while after that where she realized who she truly wanted was there all along.Also loved the supporting cast, especially Josh' dad and the friend from the airport.",Love Hard
29,11ovz11,Sierra burgess an Asian,5,8 November 2021,"This is exactly like ""Sierra burgess a loser"" but with an Asian guy instead of the white girl and with no unconsent kisses.Seriously when do Netflix stop remaking the same flicks over and over again? There has to be better ways for a guy and a girl who are opposites to meet and fall in love. Catfishing should not be romanticized. It can lead to serious harm.Anyway, this is a sappy cheesy very predictable Christmas romcom. You'll predict the movie in 3 minutes. Also, the trailer shows the entire plot anyway, so you can save the time by just watching the trailer.You're welcome.",Love Hard
30,shirlone,good movie,8,6 November 2021,"I was going to turn this off in the beginning and decided to keep going with it. Glad I did. It is kind of like your typical fake girlfriend, fake fiancee. Just to come out with the truth- that it was all made up. The ending was really good. This is worth watching if you give it a chance.",Love Hard
31,rehana-s-kazi,Top Tier Xmas Movie,9,10 November 2021,"I have seen hundreds Christmas Rom Cons and wasn't expecting much from another Christmas movie. Of course, they are all predictable snd heartwarming but that why we love them.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the characters were all likable. The movie references were cute. I really enjoyed this movie and it left me with a smile and happy tears.So far this is my too Christmas Rom Com of the year so far and I'm sure I'll be watching it again sometime.",Love Hard
32,starcraftbw88,"A cringy, cute story with a good message",7,8 November 2021,"The two MC's didn't have the greatest chemistry, Dobrev was miscast in my opinion. There were some cringy CRINGY moments and times where you need to suspend belief, the greatest one being that a Tinderella would have such a deep and expansive character change over some slight adversity. I really appreciate how the writers didn't just take the easy route and make Tag an asshole, because I was more than half expecting it. I thought it was an overall cute story some good messages (forgiveness, acceptance) that is especially relevant now more than ever.",Love Hard
33,cjmoviebuff,Great little Christmas Movie!,8,8 November 2021,"Really enjoyed this, much more than I thought I would! Sweet story and all the usual expected elements of your usual Christmas movie.I particularly enjoyed the updated version of 'Baby it's cold outside' very well done.Enjoyable Festive flick!",Love Hard
34,burgerman93,"Too long, cheesy, and predictable. But still watchable.",5,6 November 2021,"I typically am not a fan of Christmas movies, but I occasionally go for rom-coms. While Nina Dobrev is beautiful, she's kind of flat in this role. It's hard to be nit-picky on the plot itself, but a computer and phone savvy woman should know to video call her love interest before flying 3000 miles (especially since her character had been ghosted and misled by men in the past). They sort of portrayed the female lead as ditzy, easily affected by alcohol, and naive.I will admit there were some humorous scenes, especially the Christmas caroling. There's also so many cliche plot points (the fear a son has of disappointing his father, a younger brother being in the shadows of his successful older brother, having an unattractive person be a catfish, and a woman going to ridiculous lengths to please someone by pretending to have his hobbies). So in all, a cheesy flick - but still generated some laughs.",Love Hard
35,danielbrown-47106,It got me,6,8 November 2021,"At first I was cringing at this movie so bad I was ready to write a review straight away, ""Yuk - People actually live like this?"", incidentally, just like the premise of the movie, I was judging too shallow and by my giving it some time it revealed itself a gem.I think it deserves 6 stars because it got me in the end, the story struck quite a few chords because of how relevant it is to today and the characters grew on me nicely too. The family and the main actress/actor are really lovable. I ended up liking the boss too, but he wasn't that bad from the start I guess.I saw the end coming of course, but it still made me tear up ..so the movie was successful in moving me *thumbs up*",Love Hard
36,info-90701,"Cute, light, uplifting!",8,6 November 2021,"This movie was a romance movie well done. To try to make it more than what it actually is, will be setting one's self up for disappointment. But if you accept it for what it is, and roll with it, it is fun. The plot is current, in keeping with the times and the concerns of young people in the dating arena. If that is of interest to you, then this little Christmas film is right up your alley!It was also very nice to see an interracial family deal with issues other than being interracial!The lead actors are very talented, excellent, with solid comic delivery.Well done.",Love Hard
37,aimtrain1021,Cute and fun minus the chemistry,5,6 November 2021,"I usually like all these Netflix Christmas rom-coms, even if they're cliche and predictable.

They had more of a friend vibe than romantic.",Love Hard
38,Applecrumbless,Cute Christmas movie,7,8 November 2021,"Nina Dobrev and Darren Barnet are the main reason why I wanna watch this movie. Well, everything is cute there. It's very light and easy to enjoy. I think it's just very entertaining Christmas movie.But somehow there is a bit rush for the ending.

40,TheOtherMovieGuy,Meh,3,6 November 2021,Netflix goes all-out Hallmark with a Christmas movie. Cute story but without soul. You will finish this movie and tomorrow you won't even remember that you watched it.I think that's all that needs to be said.,Love Hard
41,kristi_ocampo,A movie that is not hard to love!,8,9 November 2021,"For someone who mainly watches thriller or horror movies, I don't know what possessed me to press play... But, I have no regrets. This movie is oddly refreshing. I wanted to hate on the stereotype portrayal of the Asian man (awkward, wearing glasses, considered unattractive but somehow seems good at everything that doesn't include sports)... And thought it would end up as a shallow, borderline-racist rom-com but there is depth in this movie.Seriously, it tackles the great debate whether Die Hard can be considered a Christmas movie or not. How much deeper can a movie get?",Love Hard
42,kosminuskosminus,Zero chemistry and nina dobrev sucked without Ian Somerhalder big time,1,5 November 2021,"First half of the movie i just wondered how old nina dobrev got and then something was missing from something that shoulded have been a good movie and then you see it : zero chemistry & so much nothing but even more then this the full cast was acting great and you can see 2 teams : team 1 is nina dobrev and team 2 the rest of the cast . TEAM 1 DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH TEAM 2.Funny thing about it was the mention of Die Hard the last good movie of bruce wills and then he started to this type of crap movies that nobody wants to watch anymore .This movie woulded been a blockbuster if it did not have nina dobrev and it had another actrice .This movie only shows haw great was Ian Somerhalder and that Nina drobrev is nothing without him .... sadThis movie fails in the christmas spirit , love chimestry and all other aspects on all levels ....Afther watching this movie a vampire diares fan can only think about how old Nina dobrev got and how trash she was without Damon (Ian Somerhalder-the true ideal vampire above them all)1 star for the amazing cast suporting a fallen vampire star and 0 stars for everything alse.",Love Hard

45,blr-btc,"Hard Sell, Soft Love.",4,10 November 2021,"Tried really hard to be contemporary and relevant but the acting team couldn't quite sell it. Many cringe moments littered this piece.No hard feelings, getting any movie made is a miracle but a catfish story with a happy ending is very fanciful as a starting point.The only great part was the build up of tension in the engagement party scene, besides that the couples had no real time to escalate or de-escalate their love triangle.Not a comedy and that's ok, it shouldn't have been labelled that to begin. That may be subjective but those around me agreed.The homage to Love Actually was on the nose in consideration of how easily the co protagonist changed her mind and feelings for her love interest.The debate about Die Hard feels straight out of Reddit and an old topic of conversation. Just one of many lil additions that made this feel like it was a first time writer.Might have liked to have seen how the huge emphasis on appearance causes young people to make many mistakes in their life.The nursing home scene was a great idea but should have been reshot with other material. Having something that reads well often can churn out as a fail.The family home and basement felt authentic.Overall seeing two people come together in love is always good, even when its bad, more romcoms should be made. Its a tragedy that there are not more to choose from in the film industry anymore.",Love Hard
46,debbbbi,Lack of chemistry,6,8 November 2021,"It is a fun movie and I really enjoyed it. But it is hard to believe the 2 leads are in love... there is no sparkle between them, no chemistry at all!! They seem they could be good friends, but not romantically involved.",Love Hard

The movie centers an asian guy, which is probably very underrepresented or mostly very stereotyped in Hollywood movies. Therefore it is actually nice to see that for a change.Yeah some weak plots here and there, the character building is not good enough and it seems that there is not enough chemistry between the main characters.But more than ever, the world needs a little bit of silliness and most importantly, LOVE!",Love Hard

57,Themina,Corny and predictable but I loved the Asian representation,8,7 November 2021,"Not your stereotypical cheesy movie where white guy meets white girl, things go well in the beginning, bad in the middle and they make up in the end. Yes, it's still cheesy (it's a Christmas romcom, come on!) but I think it's GREAT that this movie portrays the stereotypes around Asian men and dating and fights the outdated view of the ""Asian geeky guy who cannot get a girl"". Important for young Asian men to be represented.",Love Hard

I'm no longer a child, so I needed something romantic is quite realistic.The movie is funny, maybe it never wants to be a Christmas classic and it doesn't even want to try to become one, but it works.The characters are interesting, even if not too developed. The Christmas theme is a background and never seems intrusive in the plot. I smiled, but I never really laughed.The film managed to make me relax and that was what I wanted: to relax.",Love Hard

63,emilyjmalbon,Cute movie but lacked chemistry,5,7 November 2021,"The premise of the movie and the way it unfolds was fine. I expected it, and wanted it, to be cheesy. Unfortunately the lack of chemistry between the two main characters spoils it. I know that Josh wasn't what Natalie expected looks-wise, but nothing seems to develop from that point on. It would have been nice to have had a moment where she sees him in a different light and where you feel that she is attracted to him, but instead you truly only get friend-zone vibes. I feel they made him a little too awkward and it would have played out better if there had been more moments where you felt a connection between the two of them (which should have been easy to do considering how well they got on over the phone). We needed a moment where they nearly kiss or something!Just a shame as that would have made an okay movie great.",Love Hard
64,haranatsutsmdiaa,I actually liked it!,8,7 November 2021,"I actually liked it!I picked this movie to see because of Jimmy O. But it was more than that! Befor I saw this movie, I was easily thinking that "" ok Natalie will end up with dating with Josh"". Yes, she did but I like the way she did!Talking about the title, when I saw a title in the movie, I thought that it looked like a ""love actually"" and they had a love actually scene!!! I LOVED IT!! I laughed so hard and made me smile!!Title is connected to ""love actually""
And I think also connected to ""die hard""It's good to remind me that it's important to be who I am, not pretending who I want to be for someone else!PS. I'm happy that Hollywood start casting Asian.PS. I'm learning English so maybe some sentences don't make sense.",Love Hard

The actors are good, all the characters are very well flashed out, the movie never gets boring, I laughed hard a few times, felt warm feelings the other times.

I would recommend.",Love Hard

70,omega-metim,Genuinely quite surprised...,6,7 November 2021,"I went into this movie expecting it to just be white noise while I computer surfed like I've done with most recent Netflix movie releases. I was enthralled pretty early on. There were some witty lines and great comedic moments that let me know that this wasn't just another mediocre internet release. However, it was quite predictable, and I found myself hoping that it wouldn't take that route. That maybe Josh would help her and she would help him, and then a strong friendship would come along that would turn romantic years down the line, if at all. I wanted something different... i was not looking forward to seeing the cat fisher get the girl... but i guess it's true, Catfishes be human too. This could've easily been a 7 or 8 rating- but the ending killed that shot.",Love Hard
71,b0r3dg1rl,Feel good without being too corny.,8,7 November 2021,"6.5 overall, but a solid 8 as far as holiday romance movies go. I fully expected this to be super corny and stuffed with bad music and cliches but it wasn't too bad at all, it was very warming.I actually got a bit tired of Nina Dobrev after watching Degrassi: The Next Generation and The Vampire Diaries but I can see she toned her acting down a bit and she is doing very well. Some people never mature in their acting skills.Jimmy O. Yang was an instant lovable actor for me. His Josh played a great parallel to Nina's Natalie.I don't normally say this, but I think I'll end up throwing this one back on next year closer to the holiday seasons. It doesn't lose all watchability after one view.Check it out if you're a fan of the genre. Don't expect a lot of comedy, by the way.",Love Hard
72,jlhebden-03668,Seriously,3,8 November 2021,I made it halfway and turned it off. Predictable and ridiculous. There is no way someone with Nina's looks would fall for the dorky Asian guy especially after he catfishes her. Seriously.... Nina pick better movies!,Love Hard

75,not_a_daisy,So cute,10,6 November 2021,"Honestly loved it, I know it's not the masterpiece, but watching it made me reaally happy and that matters the most in the end. There were barely any cheap jokes and no toilet kind humor which I can't stand. Very glad I watched it!",Love Hard
76,amtoft-2,Catfished,1,5 November 2021,"I feel completely catfished watching this movie.I like romantic movies and at first I though it's another predictable movie with a beautiful couple, a little boring but funny. I was partly right. The movie suddenly had a twist, the lead woman being catfished. She is around 30, super attractive and was getting catfished by an unattractive and lazy teen, even though he turned more attractive, because inside he was a good person. Ok interesting twist, but the rest of the movie, I was crossing my fingers that both learned a good lesson about life, friendship and honesty, but would not end up together, because I felt absolutely no physical or romantic chemistry at all, friendship yes, but not more. So to my big disappointment they end up together in a really cheesy way and I feel totally catfished by the storyline. This movie deserve just one star.",Love Hard
77,chantalvanderende-465-646091,rather watchable,7,10 November 2021,"So... do people actually want dishonest, cheesy Christmas films with fake snow, fake trees and fake props? Because this is NOT one of those (well, bit cheesy, sure) and that's why I thought the rating would be higher (it's at a 6.0 as I write this). I get that some people think the chemistry is lacking, but other than that... let's not forget what a wonderful exception to many other Christmas movies this is when it comes to fakery.Think about it.Remember 'Christmas made to order'? That film has snow, street lighting and christmassy garden ornaments edited in (yes, visibly, clumsily edited in) and after they go to a tree farm with actual trees you see them carrying a fake one into the house (you can see the metal pole). In 'A Christmas Prince: the royal wedding', the sleigh riding scenes are cgi - quite unnecessary and of a quality reminiscent of quidditch in the first HP film (which was made eighteen years before this). In the recent 'Father Christmas is back', the trees are green, the shrubs are in bloom and basically nothing is done to hide it. I see this fakery more and more in recent Christmas movies, especially the cheesy, Hallmark-y kind.In THIS film however, the trees are actually bare or brown and there's not a blooming shrub in sight. It was filmed in Canada in October and November, so only slightly too much leaves still on the trees but that's it. There's actual (or at least very believable) snow, instead of sprayed plants and streets full of bath foam. The street decorations are a lot but still real (or at least real looking). The same goes for the interior decorations, which are very believable and 'natural' - i.e. It feels like a real house, not a studio full of props. For that alone I'd give any film at least a 6, no matter how bad the rest is...And in this case, the rest isn't so bad. I thought it was pretty original, contemporary and even relatable here and there.My only problem with this film is that, after things get honest, nobody tells Josh he was wrong too. It's the girl that has to do the walk (and talk) of shame, not the guy. Which is a bit odd, because all parties are in the wrong here and him more than her, in my opinion.Still - rather watchable!(and a fun title - but you'll have to watch it to get it)",Love Hard
78,jclove-69014,Funny and romantic,7,6 November 2021,It is actually a funny and romantic movie. That's what I expected from this movie. There are a few really funny moments in the movie like the girl dancing at the bar. :) It is a unique movie that a white girl eventually fall in love with the not-good-looking Asian guy because she realized at the end what she was really looking for. I don't know if that's really possible in the real life but it was good to watch as an Asian dude. I guess many white girls and boys wouldn't like it because the main character is actually not the hot white guy. Sorry. :),Love Hard

The scenes where it paid loving tribute to the movie Love Actually work really well for us. In fact we screamed/laughed hard on one scene that I won't spoil it for you.I normally don't like giving a movie 10/10 rating but since it is currently only rated at way too low 6.5 (average of 2.3K rating), I gave it a 10/10 in hope more people will watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.P. S. I was analyzing the movie as I watched it and was quite picky at places and not just blindly liking it. For me, it worked, and my better half and I loved it.

First of all, the whole 'I'm paid to write stories about my dating life' thing has been recycled so many times it's just pointless to use it at this day and age.

She ended up with the CATFISH who proposed to a girl he catfished who felt pressured to yes to the proposal just because he was jealous of his brother's attention? What?The whole thing could've been avoided by a video chat (always video chat within the first couple of days of talking to someone online, easier to get to know them and tell if you like them or not) Also, if this girl is looking for a high value guy, why would the she fly all the way (Cali to New York!) to the guy? And then she ends up at the airport and has to take an UBER as opposed to the guy picking her up? Then, the guy who catfished her apparently knows about her luggage situation, texts her about it and said that he didn't think she was serious about visiting him? And if he was so surprised, why did he give her his address? So many holes in this movie--to many to mention. So many red flags this catfish guy has. And after being deceived and used throughout the movie, she dares to stay at his place and call him a ""good guy?!""To all the people saying that this is ""cute??"" Really?!?!?!?! He's a catfish. He did so many immoral and selfish things in the movie and then ends up with the sincerely-looking-for-love--albeit naive, probably-used-to-very toxic-relationships girl. How is that cute?!

96,patricia756161,How disappointing,3,7 November 2021,"I wasn't aspecting much, Christmas romantic movies are usually shallow, clichè, and all the same. But the presence of Nina Dobrev made me want to watch it and it was much worse than the usual Christmas romantic banality. I see that there are lots of cast's friends rating this 10, which is kind of something in between of riculous and tender.The major problem was the total absence of chemistry between any cast members. The friendship could have been believable, the love story hell no, oh my, so no no no!! The kiss at the end was so unconfortable to watch, like a very forced woodden kiss betwen two people that looked like would rather have a spoon full of castol oil in their mouth than each other tongue.What is wrong with the romance film lately? Do they cast people randomly without doing any checking if there is chemitry among the cast members that are supposed to deliver romance?I've rate this 3 because I feel sorry for Nina, that I adore and I know is capable to act and deliver chemitry, but in all honesty 3 to this film is a very benevolent rate. It is not even kitsch enough to use it as a joke to laugh at. Just plain bad.",Love Hard

Yes.Is it predictable? Yes.But most importantly.Is it funny? Yes.Is it entertaining? Yes.It uses the traditional simple concepts to its strengths and the fact that it's not held back by a PG rating allows it to push the envelope.Personally, the fact it combines two of the most iconic and probably opposite Christmas movies....oh and let's not forget controversial Christmas song into the plot, was genius.I highly recommend, and will watch again and again for many Christmas to come without complaint.",Love Hard

Not great - i would have given it a six but i added a star bc i'm in love with jimmy yang.It had a decent script - the acting wasn't bad either, i just don't think there were enough moments where the audience is supposed to see their relationship grow. I could tell Josh was falling for her but the abrupt ending of Natalie realizing it seemed a bit forced and out of place, they focused too much on her relationship with Darrens character. The ending inspired by love actually and die hard was pretty cute, but I wish the two leads had more developed chemistry.Solid romcom, probably the best one ive seen in recent years so i really cant rate it too harshly.

This is exactly what I got.Although the two lead characters didn't have any romantic chemistry, I like the fact that Nathalie (Nina Dobrev) doesn't end up with the ""hot guy"" (Darren Barnet) who doesn't share her values and the personality she's looking for. Too often in the movies the girl falls in love with the bad boy, the toxic guy, the guy she has to convince to love her, etc. This is one of the few times that the main character chooses the guy for his personality rather than his physique. For once, the good, albeit unpopular guy has a happy ending.",Love Hard

I think a lovable, maybe a little shallow, but hot mess could've been played by someone a lot stronger and it would've played a lot better with Yang, because I was very impressed with his acting and very much enjoyed his character.

112,fedoramirez,"Not, Hard to Love this movie!",10,6 November 2021,"Jimmy O. Yang stars in this Christmas gift of a movie he's not only a great comedian but an equally great actor. This movie is definitely for the ""Agro- Hip"" viewer and if your an online dater, you will be swiping right for Love Hard this Christmas!Well done, production, cast and crew!!!",Love Hard

114,terryrgilchrist,I normally hate these types of movies.,8,6 November 2021,I watched this out of curiosity because on social media it was getting terrible reviews. I was fully expecting to find it cheesy and stupid but I ended up really liking it. It had its cheesy moments- it's a Christmas rom com after all- but there is some substance there that I didn't expect. I also found myself laughing out loud at parts too. I think this will be a Christmas classic.,Love Hard
115,nikosforthewin,An above average sweet christmass movie.,7,8 November 2021,The story is interesting throughout and the sittuations often quite hilarious. All in all its a good movie with good actors and a fun plot.Unfortunately the two main leads have 0 chemistry between them. Especially the male one who only really shows a semblance of emotion at one single scene.,Love Hard
116,lazuardiadnan1983,It could be great,7,7 November 2021,"I do wanna it to be great honestly, the script is superb, they are not boring at all like most of rom com, unfortunately I think Nina and Jimmy did not really caught the chemistry, something just not click, even though as personally they both are great cast, they did their job amazingly attractive to watch, however as a romantic couple, its just not in it, sorry..",Love Hard
117,cblackfire,I really enjoyed watching Love Hard with my wife and daughter,9,7 November 2021,"There are many things to say about the movie, but I'd justify the score around a single fact: it was good for filling our emotional tanks.This is a simple story, no big surprises, no hyper-idealized romantic plot. But it doesn't need that kind of argument. A solid simple story that delivers in the department of putting all the elements together to make your heart warm. This is a story that made me feel closer to my wife (as there might have been some similarities in the plot to our story), and the kind of story that will teach a valuable lesson or two to my teenage daughter who is just starting to learn about love.",Love Hard
118,sharonegp,Predictably Unpredictable.,8,6 November 2021,"Kinda predictable but so are all other Christmas romance movies. Pretty fun and overall great acting. Singing ""Baby, it's cold outside"" was my fav part, unexpected and cute.",Love Hard
119,gabyf_moreno,Yippee ki yay...,6,6 November 2021,"They had me at ""Die Hard is the best Christmas movie ever"", I've been saying that for years, although the second one is my favourite. Now, the rest of the movie is just as any other of these Christmas-love movies are, but it does have some witty dialogue. It's ok to have a bit of a laugh and it sends a positive message.",Love Hard
120,awleonard,A way to pass the time,4,9 November 2021,"I guess I'm not terribly experienced with the genre of romantic comedies, but I thought it would be a good way to pass the time when I scrolled past it in Netflix. I suppose I was entertained in the sense that I was scoffing and laughing most of the way through the film.Given the different elements casting a wide net over the Netflix audience -- technology, musicality, stereotype challenges, etc. -- it's easy to see why this could easily rise to the top of popularity lists. It's easy to digest, doesn't require a lot of thought, and has a happy ending.Throughout the film, you kind of wonder who you should be rooting for. On the one hand, you have an overly trusting young woman who ignores warning signs from her friends. She flies 3,000 miles to meet someone who, conveniently, she has never once video chatted with. (Technology is used as such a crutch in the movie that there's a plot hole: FaceTime doesn't exist?) On the other hand, you have the lead male character who deceives a young woman and then can't let go of his family hangups -- further enabling deception, albeit out of self preservation.Never mind the young columnist living in an insanely nice LA house, and all the rest of the tired TV tropes that make no sense in television or film.Overall, there were moments of cringe, moments of decent acting, and a couple genuinely funny moments here and there. Romance didn't make up a very large part of the film, and the areas where you think romance will happen never surface until the very end.I'll end with this: This film reinforces as many negative stereotypes as it attempts to break. Those who praise it for its ""values"" and ""lessons"" are selective about what they think this film teaches.",Love Hard
121,kapuscem,"Cringey script, cringey dialogues, the two leads have zero chemistry.",2,8 November 2021,"The dialogue is really forced and the majority of the jokes are just not funny. So many cliches in this film, none of the characters are really too interesting. Overall it's a typical bad Christmas love movie that you can watch just because you have nothing better to do with your time.",Love Hard
122,stwicky,Super cute!,8,8 November 2021,"Nice little love story. Yeah, it's predictable, but it's a clean, refreshing, and I guess, Christmasy, love story. Funny and witty. It's not academy award stuff but definitely worth a watch. Funny enough that on a cozy night your guy might like it too.",Love Hard
123,jabusllam,This is awesome!,8,5 November 2021,Nina Dobrev was really stunning in this movie I loved her character on it so much she is so talented and also the movie is so good I didn't feel the time while I was watching anyways tbh this is the best Christmas movie I've ever seen!,Love Hard

126,terrylowe-91054,Nearly Bailed out at 10 minutes...,8,9 November 2021,"I'm not really into Chick Flicks with Pretty Women as the worst movie ever made in my opinion. Love Hard was #1 movie on Netflix in Australia so on a boring Monday night flicking through 100s of movie choices settled on this.It's more or less a predictable girl meets a couple of boys...ones her type in looks and the others a nice guy but a bit ugly. Anyway I enjoyed how cheesy it was throughout the movie and made I it to the end.It no Notebook, but definitely worth watch for boys and girls.",Love Hard
127,writeshreyaa,Here for Nina,7,6 November 2021,"I normally don't like these kind of films. I do like romantic films but not these kind if that makes sense. Nina is a spectacular actor and has sooo much potential. She should definitely try acting in more drama and intense films imo.And quite honestly, I did not see any chemistry in the protagonists. But nevertheless, i rated it a 7 for Nina Dobrev.",Love Hard

130,elisabethkisek,Fun and light hearted,7,5 November 2021,The movie is a feel good movie for a cozy evening. It's definitely not lacking character depth or development - which is wonderful to see in a comedy. The cast was amazing too.,Love Hard

132,nemocensetur,I created an account on imdb just for this,10,5 November 2021,"This movie made me smile - and I realized while watching it I was really smiling - not laughing out loud but genuinely smiling. Sure it's a ""feel good movie"", but you really feel good. Also it's realistic about online dating.

Was it cheesey and somewhat predictable at times, yes! But isn't that the reason we watch Christmas movies to begin with lol! No the chemistry wasn't over the top, but I don't think that was the point. It was just an all around feel good holiday movie, with a pretty decent story line that kept your attention. If you're in the mood for that, definitely worth the watch.",Love Hard
135,jehannamasivayam,Underated and heartwarming,8,6 November 2021,"My wife passed out early. And it helps if you're drinking, but I enjoyed this, a lot. Nina has a charm about her that makes you keep watching. Early Christmas miracle!",Love Hard

137,ntgbrgpz,The film that finally gets it right,10,6 November 2021,"Have you ever watched stories and fallen in love with the supporting second? You know the one... that person that is loving without any expectation of return, offering compassion and guidance when the main character needs it most? The one you just want to see happy, but the story never seems to be about them?This is finally a movie about them.Have you ever struggled with the misogyny of the main love interest archetypes and surrounding tropes which are intentionally hurtful and lack emotional intelligence. Or rolled your eyes when somehow it was accepted?This is finally a movie about the actual emotional pitfalls, fears, and self doubt of dating.For those of you who grew up hating romance movies for 1,000 reasons, give this one a chance.Much like dating in real life, for every one good love story there are endless others that fall short. An all too real disappointment that causes many love stories to resonate for all the wrong reasons. A reminder that love, even when it comes to finding a real love story, is always a game of chance that is never guaranteed. There is no promised 1,001 night at the end.This movie is Scheherazade'a 1,001 night. It manages to touch on the heart of what trying to put yourself out there, meet people, and find love feels like while somehow being wrapped in a light hearted and sweet package.There are some uncomfortable embarrassment based moments, and of course the tropes. However they are all outweighed by the clever quips, integrity of the characters from the get go, and the evolution of it all into a very sweet, healthy, and believable love story.The writers clearly don't take their own tropes too seriously, which just adds to the beauty of it all. And it has the absolute best rewrite of ""Baby it's Cold Outside,"" which I'm still trying to find on Spotify. I look forward to the 2021 Holidays when this version playing in all the stores.This movie is worthy of your interest and stars.I hope to see more like it!",Love Hard
138,steady-03214,Movie Poster tells it All,6,6 November 2021,"Cute movie, worth a watch for this type of movie. Love Nina; good actors, very appropriate for whole family love story. Not a deeply romantic movie, but cute and funny, nothing to get to serious about. If you are like me, and like some reality in the endings, then don't be too surprised not to get totally what you may need to put that stick in the landing. Very educational for young online daters. Predictable, could do without the last 10 minutes.",Love Hard
139,aleinad-81954,"Finally, not a cheesy live movie for xmas!",10,7 November 2021,"I really loved how they did bring to the present the real single online dating experience and how they showed to the public the real connection thing with another person over any beauty ""standars"".

140,heyhailan,A heartwarming story,9,7 November 2021,"In a society that your appearance is constantly being judged, everyone is seeking for perfection or pretend to be perfect, this movie is like a breath of fresh air breeze taught me what really matters in life and in a romantic relationship.I don't usually like chick flicks (thought it was) or Christmas movies, but this one made my heart feel so warm.

143,rlpfree,Stop normalizing men being rewarded for being lying manipulators.,1,9 November 2021,"Conventionally attractive girl falls for conventionally unattractive guy because ""it's what on the inside that counts"", right? Except let's not hold our breath for the roles to be reversed and women to be valued for anything other than their looks. (Seirra Burgess is a terrible example though bc she straight up lied and kissed someone without their consent). I'm SO tired of Hollywood guilting women into feeling like they have to date the ""ugly"" guy because he's the underdog. Women would NEVER be given that opportunity, and a conventionally attractive man would never date an ugly woman OR be guilted into it. Not to speak of Hollywood completely ignoring conventionally unattractive women, and only casting them as comedic or gross.Secondly, why does Hollywood continue to reward men for lying, being selfish, and manipulating women to get what they want? Josh lied about who he was and he forced Natalie into an extremely uncomfortable position by Josh (again, selfishly) proposing to her to get back at his brother (especially when she explicitly said she wanted things to work out with Tag). Excuse me? Just bc this movie portrays Josh as this ""ho hum"" guy does not mean his behaviors are anywhere near acceptable.This is a huge contributor to why women feel they 1. Have to be conventionally attractive (because not even the ""ugly"" men in movies would DARE try to date an ""ugly"" girl right?) and 2. That they should bend themselves into whatever shape and situation that any guy who pays attention to them puts them in because those ""poor, ugly, lonely men"" ""deserve love"", right? But only at the expense of a woman, and only if she's attractive.This plot in 2021??? Especially when so much focus is spent on how much Natalie hates the song ""Baby it's Cold Outside"" because it's sexist and manipulative! The man in the song IGNORES what the woman wants and manipulates her into staying, even when she repeatedly tells him what she wants. Excuse me?? That's literally what Josh did to her the entire movie!!!!Women should not be manipulated or gaslit into dating men who lie to them and treat them selfishly. And this ""only pretty women deserve love, and they should be so happy to fall for the ""good guy"" even though he's ugly"" trope is SO TIRED. Disgusting and dehumanizing. I literally can't believe this was made in 2021. Do BETTER.",Love Hard
144,lindsaylovett,Cute,7,9 November 2021,"This movie is exactly what you think it is. No surprises, but cute and an easy watch on a weekday night while you're gearing up for Christmas.

148,chenut-1,A surprisingly excellent Christmas Movie,10,8 November 2021,"I must admit I was looking forward to this romantic comedy and it actually turned out better than I expected. The trailers for the movie looked fabulous. I was curious how the chemistry between. Nina Dobrev and Jimmy O Yang would be. Turns out that they were excellent together.Nina Bobrev stars as Natalie Bauer, who woman who writes a blog on her disastrous dating life. One day on a dating website she founds Josh Lin, who Natalie believes is this hunky Asian American guy. So she decides on a whim to fly to Josh's place and finds out he was not the man she saw in the photoes!!Natalie finds out the man in the photos she saw was another guy so Josh offers to set her up with him.I don't want to get too much into it but I found it a wonderful sweet movie. One of the my favorite scenes is the duet they sing together. It's wonderful and I thought it was better than the duet scene in the movie Elf.I think this movie will be a Christmas Classic.",Love Hard
