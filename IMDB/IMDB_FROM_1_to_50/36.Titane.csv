0,SnoopyStyle,getting some strange,7,22 October 2021,"Erotic performer Alexia (Agathe Rousselle) has a head scar from a childhood car accident. She is hounded by her male fans. One get especially pushy and she stabs him to death. She has sex in a mysterious car. She continues to kill. She gets pregnant somewhere along the way. She masquerades as a missing boy and reunites with the boy's father Vincent (Vincent Lindon) who takes her in as the boy.This is one strange film. It's a French body horror. It starts like a damaged girl gone bad. It has a bit of Crash, the good Cronenberg movie not the other one. It gets surreal and then it gets weird. It gets confused. It gets weirder and then it gets extremely weird with the body horror. It's doing stuff with toxic masculinity and body image and sexuality and self-denial and... and... and... I was at the edge of my seat with the baby reveal. Quite frankly, it's a little bit of a letdown. I was expecting something weirder like a Demon Seed. This is a must-see for people who loves weird. It is challenging at times but it's never boring.",Titane
1,boblipton,Then A Sentimental Passion Of A Vegetable Fashion Must Excite Your Languid Spleen,3,16 October 2021,"As a child, Agathe Rousselle was in a traffic accident and has a titanium plate in her head. Now a dancer at an auto-themed night club, she is heavily gravid with the offspring of a Cadillac Sedan Deville she has been having an affair with, and the police are looking for her, having caught wind of her murder spree. So she breaks her nose to disguise herself as the grown-up, disappeared son of firefighter Vincent Lindon. His brigade realizes something weird is going on, but he's the fire chief.It's a highly relatable situation. Who among us has not been in that very predicament and chosen that particular solution? All right, yes, it clearly works, or tries to, in the ""body horror"" genre of Franju and David Cronenberg, but it lacks even the dream logic of those works; while Lindon's motivation is clear -- he's out of his mind with grief after living in the same quarters for the past twenty years, with his missing son's toys and posters still about -- Mlle Rousselle is not someone I wish to spend a couple of hours with. Which I just did.",Titane
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Not a titanic movie, but a trunk filled with appeal that comes through its strangeness, a bit like a 21st-century Christine",6,4 November 2021,"France's Oscar sumbission ""Titane"" is a pretty new French/Belgian movie in the French language that was released here not too long ago. What got me curious about it mostly except my francophilia and that I am always curious about new French films was that this won the prestigious Palme d'Or in Cannes this year. Now after watching I wonder why though. I mean it's not a bad film or anything, but also not too great and I don't know maybe it helped them that a female filmmaker was in charge, that a woman was posing as a guy for large parts of the film and also simply how strange it all was. I mean the one thing that this film certainly is is different. The director is Julia Ducournau and she is also the writer here, actually the only writer if we do not count the two consultants. According to imdb, Ducournau has been making films now for a decade and it's maybe gonna be a close fight between this one and Grave when it comes to the question what film of hers is most famous. We will have to wait and see how much people will be going for these almost 110 minutes. In Grave, the lead actress is Garance Marillier and Ducournau has worked with her a few times already, so no surprise that Marillier is also in here, even if not in the lead this time, but instead playing a character that does not have a huge amount of screen time and is not featured in the second half at all. Well, I guess Ducournau thought that lead actress Agathe Rousselle (surprised she received zero awards recognition) was more fitting for the part here, especially in terms of being able to portray cold-blooded, but also with pretty much the entire second half, they also needed a lead that could be mistaken for a young man to some extent. So Rousselle got the part eventually and to me personally she looked a bit like the young Uma Thurman (and August Diehl) and there was definitely a touch of Tarantino to this film in the first hour, especially in these scenes that mixed violence with music.The second half was completely different though. A few words on the key plot now: We have a young girl in the prologue or something and she is in a terrible car accident with her father after she annoys him and he looks briefly away from the street to make her stop. Daddy is unharmed, but little Alexia's blood we see from afar and there is emergency surgery and we find out she has to carry a piece of metal now in her head. And that makes something with her. By the way, after the surgery we see them ask a few questions to a doctor and said doctor is also the only one to mention titanium in this movie by saying the exact word. Or saying ""titane"" in the original version of course, even if this title is as much of a reference to what you could call the protagonist as it is to the metal. The scene that follows when they leave the hospital for my liking could have needed some more subtlety perhaps. I mean I would have believed the girl to be really confused and in pain maybe as it was not a long time after the surgery, but her running out and hugging the car, even kissing it was of course some foreshadowing, but still too much in-your-face I thought. Then again, this film was in-your-face on many other occasions as well, but there it usually worked better. This of course refers very much to the scenes that I mentioned earlier already, very violent scenes at times. The first killing is still somewhat justified because she really was harrassed and attacked by the stalker and sexual assault could have followed this molestation, even if it was still very bloody what she did with the needle in her hair. This needle also becomes a bit of her weapon as the film moves on and she is genuinely worried when somebody took it from her early in the second half.But before we move to that, a few more words on the second killing: That was a bit of an orgy already. She kills her (potential) girlfriend first, then several other people show up and she takes pretty much care of them one-by-one. Only one girl somehow manages to find a way to run. That girl was not the one played by Marillier. She is the first victim in this scene. With the music running. Music that does not evoke tragedy, but is almost playful and joyful. And as tragic as this scene may have been, there was also some dark comedy to it when she moans and complains about how many more there are that she has to kill, so they cannot identify her or something. One of really not many comedic moments at all. The one other slightly funny scene that comes to mind was pretty brief too, namely when we find out about a male character talking about how he is God to a group of young men and how that makes the title character Jesus. That was funny because of how exaggerated it was. So now we are in the middle of the second half already. This half includes less violence for sure. Nobody is really killed, we only see two very minor characters struggling with their health and there the title character is more of a savior even than a murderer. This scene also made something with her and made her bond with Lindon's character even stronger. Yep, Vincent Lindon is in this film. People from France who love movies will recognize him immediately. He is always easy to identify. He is even first credit here on imdb, but he shouldn't be. I mean his presence in the second half of the film makes it possible to consider him a co-lead, even if it's a really close call. Alexia is 100% number one. He plays a character whose son disappeared many years ago and our title character decides to pose as said son and pretend he has returned. Of course also because she must make sure to get away from police and find a safe haven somewhere. I must say this general idea how he really accepts her as his son and she kinda knew he would seemed a bit much and not too realistic, even if it is easy to understand he was so desperate that he would have accepted anybody probably slightly resembling what his son would look like in the now.So the introduction and general idea behind this twist did not make too much sense to me, but all that followed was better. This includes the way how she is treated disrespectfully by one younger character especially because he quickly realizes something's wrong and also calls her ""she"" during the final stages of the movie. But it also includes the relationship between Alexia and Lindon's character. How at some point he just cannot close his eyes anymore to the fact that she is not his son and also tells others to not talk about this alleged son anymore. When he sees that she is a woman at the very end, he is not surprised. It seems as if he takes whatever he can to be close to his son. Even if it just an illusion. This was nicely handled overall and among the film's better aspects. It was also telling how the movie kept playing with us in terms of how Lindon's character could be about to die. Be it from an overdose. Be it when he catches fire. Be it when the music plays, but he started it. Be it when he is unconscious and Titane thinks she is ready to kill him. In fact she isn't because she knows that his love for his child is infinite and that he is a good father and also that she enjoys being taken care of like this from her dad. From her ""dad"". Because her real father, the man we see on several occasions early on, also in the car, was the opposite of loving when it comes to how he treated his daughter. And in Lindon's character, she found this paternal love she would have loved to receive from her biological dad. So it is also a family drama to some extent, even if she does not kill her father or anything.Now, I shall elaborate a little more on the metal aspects here. I already mentioned the car hugging almost at the beginning, but there is way more in fact. Our protagonist gets pregnant at some point and we could have guessed that it happened during the sex scene she had inside a car. With the automobile. Yep! The father of her unborn is really the car. This may sound absurd and gimmicky, but the way it was portrayed, it somehow felt credible. Still this makes it a fantasy film or science fiction film or whatever and this idea is really where the film cannot be called realistic whatsoever anymore. Especially if you take into account that she was bleeding occasionally because of the pregnancy, but it was not blood that came out. It was motor oil if I was not mistaken. At least, it was really dark, black pretty much. We could not smell it in the theater of course to be sure, but it looked like motor oil. In the end, there is the birth scene and that I did not like too much again. Or the scene was okay, but the outcome well with a human baby that has lots of metal in its back. Looked like a zip (fastener) pretty much instead of a spine or something and there was metal on the baby's head too. Well, daddy was an automotive, so what can you say? The moment with Lindon holding the baby and him alive and her gone, which you really could not expect, was pretty good again though. Maybe I liked the way the circle closes there also because of his own vanished son and now he holds a ""new"" son in his hands. So the last shot leaves an impression . Other than that, maybe because of how much I like Marillier, I must also mention all the nude scenes in the first half, no matter if we are talking showering or erotic affection, but yeah with the protagonist's soft spot for metal, a nipple piercing is maybe nothing you would want to show her. Otherwise, things could get a bit painful. And they do here and there when the oral nuzzling becomes a bit too wild. Watch for yourself. And if you are a girl, be prepared to scream like one female in my showing because she could feel Marillier's pain in two scenes. In general, not only lots of violence, but lots of nudity here. This is a film for adult audiences. Mostly enjoyable, but real greatness I don't see with it. The fascination really comes mostly from how bizarre it all is. (tt10944760)",Titane
3,kosmasp,Relentless,10,13 October 2021,"I was going to give this a 9 out of 10, but then I thought ... why not go all the way. Something the movie does occasionally. Something that takes the term ""car lover"" to a whole new level. And it has things that you cannot possibly explain ... in the real world. With a main character who has quite the issues. Her introduction alone is ... well more than note-worthy. She is being annoying to say the least - poor father.And then you feel sorry for her ... until you realize ... maybe you shouldn't. Or maybe you should - because for every broken character, there is another broken character who might be the piece of the puzzle that is missing, to make them complete.There are many things here that are not spoken out aloud. But we know ... we know because while you could say they are subtle ... we know! And the characters know too! We know what happened to a boy that is ""missing"" for 10 years ... we are shown what happened to him. It is not said - and it is not necessary for anyone to actually spell it out.We know that in the scene in the woods/forest ... well actually we do not know if or to what degree that was ""planned"" ... an accident. But we know or rather expect it to happen. Not much is being said in the aftermath about it.There is so much to unpack here ... and I haven't even touched the surface - no pun intended. You know what I mean if you've seen the movie. Touching that subject of service: a lot of nudity in this one. And a lot of scenes that may cause you to feel sick. The scenes are sick, they are meant to provoke a reaction out of you. But they are also always topped off with a touch of comedy (relief).Now you may think I'm mad saying that, considering certain things that happen - and in the real world I would agree that it would be hard to see any ""fun"" in things that happen here ... but this is a movie. And our main character is not a heroine! No the movie makes it clear - she is almost derived of a moral compass.This is a crazy movie for sure - the question is, if you are up for it. If you can dig the broken characters in this - and stay detached but also invested in the fate of those involved ... I know, but if you go with the flow ... well what a great movie to see.",Titane
4,BandSAboutMovies,Car shaking wildness,7,27 October 2021,"Coming five years after Raw, Julia Ducournau's Titante (Titanium) is also Croenenberg-inspired but goes in its own direction. Or plenty of directions, to be perfectly honest.When she was a child, Alexia was in a car accident that she caused by distracting her father. After years of painful surgeries, she's grown into a woman (Agathe Rousselle) who wants nothing to do with her parents - despite living with them - and makes her living as a motor show salesgirl, writhing provocatively atop a car that us so moved by the experience that it makes love to her after she's killed a man with her hatpin.Yes, you read that right.Alexia is also a serial killer who has a history of wiping out her human lovers. But the one thing she can't kill is the new life inside her. After a victim escapes, she sets her parents house ablaze with them inside and reacts to being a wanted woman by assuming the identity of Adrien, a lost boy, by repeatedly breaking her nose and transforming her body by duct tape to take on a male appearance.The boy's father Vincent (Vincent Lindon), a steroid-addicted firefighter, doesn't need a DNA test. Obviously, this is his son, returned from wherever he was, and he will now protect him as he didn't before. Let the other firefighters discuss the mute and androgynous and obvious damaged ""son"" that is part of their crew; the captain is respected enough that everyone understands the loss he's endured. Even his ex-wife, later in the film, who discovers that Adrien is Alexia.Despite all evidence to the contrary, Vincent still believes that this is his son, even after he begins dripping motor oil and displaying a mechanical endoskeleton and bursting from whatever is growing within him or her.The winner of the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Titane won't be for everyone. Just like the titanium structure holding together its protagonist's skull, it threatens to break at any time but holds together by sheer force of will and the tenacity of lead Agathe Rousselle, who plays her as the most seductive and most frightening woman of all time seemingly in the same scene, appearing to be heartbreakingly gorgeous and near-death also within seconds of one another.This is a film of juxtaposition, of the real and unreal. Beyond becoming a fake person, its lead is a horror movie cipher, a mechanical woman willing to become a man but to never stop seducing and destroying because that's all she or he knows, the only tenderness to be found in the backseats of cars all alone as they jump and flash their lights into the too dark night. Meanwhile, Vincent is a very real character, a man whose strength has defined his life but is escaping him, a person who would rather accept the fake story that his son has returned than to accept that what he loves - and has recreated numerous times through the firemen who are the missing child's surrogates - is gone forever.Also: puke, black oil coming out of orifices, hatpin murders and dancing atop firetrucks.",Titane
5,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Titane (2021) 7.5/10,8,22 October 2021,"""But the catch is, Alexia finds out she is pregnant after the weird sex with the automobile, her belly grows bigger every day, black liquids oozing from her nipples and vagina. Eventually she has to pay the price of her killing by bring a new life to the world before pegging out, which fortuitously can fill Vincent's void. This arrangement, conceived by Ducournau to tone down her provocation, is self-defeating. When all is said and done, Alexia cannot escape her biological function as a mother (even dies for it) and Vincent is richly rewarded for his compassion and liberality. Neither his steroids-injecting attempt to defy age nor his abortive attempt to make Alessia man up is spurned, the impression is that, Vincent is represented as the role model of a middle-aged, traditionally masculine, defeated white male, and TITANE shows how he should react according to today's changed ethos. But Ducournau doesn't seem to understand, seldom a film works with such loud, tailored exhortation. This gender partiality undercuts her credential as a provocateur engagé, nonetheless, it successfully casts its magic spell on Cannes' jury headed by Spike Lee this year.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",Titane
6,ops-52535,its a mjaa vetkje! from a grumpy old man...,5,23 October 2021,"Who isnt going to delve into a freudianic psychoanalytical elaboration on the thin red line of titane. But with a brain and body made of titanium, you are really led into the hardships of an add'rs selfdestructive behavioural issues, and thats just a minor description of the story.French neonoir thrillerdrama is meant to be heavily graphic, weird and shocking, everyone who has seen ''climax'' and liked it will really find their comfort zone here , but its a weird ariadne they have found . It so utterly raw on sadness and desperation that youll either loose it and walk away wishing youd never started watching or you may stay for a nightmare of tsunamiwave heights of afterthoughts. There are really no sense in what happens it just developes in selfdestructive selfdetructiveness.Its technically a good production, cut and audioed with a steady hand, score made to feel that armageddon might evolve any minute, and the actor doing the main does it with bravour, but the grumpy old man is not begging for a dacapo, its far to too naked ,greasy and mindboggeling for a man at my age. It could be a cult classic, cause it shows things that youve never seen on the silverscreen before.",Titane
7,UniqueParticle,Easily among of the weirdest movies ever,10,7 October 2021,"I don't know what to say about Titane except I absolutely loved it and I was highly disturbed! I'm so glad I was able to see in the theater. Titane is riveting, beautifully filmed, unnerving, and incredibly well acted! Vincent Lindon and Garance Marillier are spellbinding throughout. I'm so happy IMDb has the rating at 7.1 that's very well deserved! I'd see anything by Julia Ducournau her visionary morbid stories are worth watching!",Titane
8,paul-allaer,"Beyond the shock and gore, a unique love story",8,5 October 2021,"""Titane"" (2021 release from France; 108 min.) brings the story of Alexia. As the movie opens, Alexia as a very young girl is involved in a car crash, requiring a titanium plate in her head. We then move to today, and grown-up Alexia is dancing in a club featuring slick cars and where ""touching is done with the eyes only"". Late one night, Alexia gets into that sleek Cadillac, where she is twisted and twirled, naked. It's not long before she finds out that somehow she is pregnant... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature-length film from French writer-director Julia Ducourneau, who seduced us a couple of years ago with ""Raw"". Here she examines the impossible, namely what if a car somehow impregnates a women? It is the beginning of a long, strange journey into the fantastical. The less I say about the plot, the better. I will simply comment that the movie's ultimate direction is completely unexpected. To be clear: yes, there are a LOT of shocking scenes (I covered my eyes on a number of occasions) but look beyond all of the shock and gore, and it turns out this movie is about a love story unlike any you have ever seen, I am quite certain. I will readily admit that this movie pushed me out of my comfort zone, in the best possible way. None of this would be possible without the originality of director Julia Ducourneau. Where she dreams this stuff up, I have no idea. But the movie industry should be very thankful for someone like her. Kudos as well to Agathe Rousselle, who brings an amazing and bold lead performance as Alexia. Veteran French actor Vincent Lindon does quite well too. (Please note: there is a LOT of nudity in the film, so if that would bother you, please stay away from this film.)""Titane"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, where it promptly won THE top price (Palme d'Or). The movie was released in select US theaters this past weekend, and i couldn't wait to see it. The early Monday evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was not attended well (4 people in total including myself). It's very obvious that this movie isn't for everyone. But if you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign film that may well push you out of your comfort zone, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theatre (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Titane

10,andrewchristianjr,WHAT JUST HAPPENED?,8,25 October 2021,It's very dark and weirder than I was expecting. All the roles were well acted but it would have been nice to get a little more back story on main character's motivations.,Titane
11,Agent10,"A bold and twisted ""French"" film",8,3 October 2021,"American cinema can be a bore. As a society, we tend to overly focus on logic, writing, and pacing when it comes to great film. When it comes to the awful films, we focus on lousy production value, plot holes, incoherent writing and poorly realized characters. Everything is handed to us on a plate to pick and choose. We can delight in the simple nacho bowl of never ending sequels and franchises or indulge in the charcuterie board of an occasional Oscar contender. And then you have a film like Titane.Titane is like a wheel that just spilled its ball bearings all over the floor. You have to reach in certain places to find the balls and even pontificate where they might have rolled to. It's time consuming, difficult and makes you want to say ""to heck with this"" and get a new wheel at ACE Hardware. Such is the twisted mastery that is this vivid and outlandish film.Julia Ducournau continues to make the statement that we should give women more projects in the film world. Her version of France feels dirtier and grimier than most, even when it is bathed in neon lights. It's a statement toward the current trends, that she will twist them with more perverse and dangerous themes.We start the story with Alexia, who is on the run due to being a serial killer. She decides to impersonate a man that has been missing for years, but little does she know the father of the lost boy is as damaged as she is. If anything, Alexia's relationship with Vincent is a culmination of stress reaction to trauma. Alexia fetishizes and ""makes love"" to vehicles due to an accident she has in her youth. This leaves her with brain damage and possibly the source of her violence. Vincent lost his son after he apparently ran away, most likely due to the controlling and egomaniacal tendencies Vincent displays. Vincent battles time and a slowly dying body with testosterone in hopes he can reclaim his manhood that he lost when his son ran away and his wife unceremoniously left him.There is a lot to unpack. The film takes on complicated subjects like gender fluidity, possibly gender dysphoria, sexual fluidity, the male ego, homoeroticism in hyper masculine professions, technological encroachment and the dissipation of the traditional family unit. And then there is that ending. Phew.This is not an easy watch, even for people exposed to this cinema. If you like the neatly packaged and arranged simplicity of the common American cinema, this will not be for you. If you do like being challenged, then check this out.",Titane
12,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Follow-up Film for Ducournau,8,26 October 2021,"This was a movie that when I saw it was coming to the Gateway Film Center, I was intrigued. I enjoyed the director's previous film of Raw and this one was getting buzz from groups I'm a part of on social media. Figured since this is a 2021 film, I'd give this a go. The synopsis is following a series of unexplained crimes, a father is reunited with the son who has been missing for 10 years.We start this movie off Alexia (Adèle Guigue) when she is age 7. Her father is driving, played by Bertrand Bonello, and he is annoyed with Alexia. She is mimicking the sound of the engine. To ignore her, the father turns up the radio, but this causes Alexia to get louder. She then takes off her seatbelt and her father tries to stop her, causing an accident. Alexia has a metal plate put in her head and a brace she had to wear as a result.The movie then shifts into the present where Alexia is now portrayed by Agathe Rousselle. She works as a model at a car show. These women here show off their bodies and men can be a bit touchy. Alexia is dancing in front of a Cadillac with painted flames on it. After the show ends she makes friends with another woman in the shower, Justine (Garance Marillier). Alexia heads to her car and is chased by a fan. He wants an autograph, which she agrees to in order to get him to leave. When he asks for a kiss, she obliges and stabs him in the ear with her hairpin.She goes back inside to shower again and she hears loud banging coming from the showroom. She is naked and dripping wet when gets into the car she modeled on. Alexia is turned on and gets off while in the backseat. We are seeing the car bouncing up and down as she does.From here we get the idea that Alexia is a bit off. She lounges about the house most of the day. Her father doesn't seem to like to be around her and her mother, Céline Carrère, loves her. We see some horrific events though that causes her to flee. The police are looking for her and she decides to disguise herself as Adrien, a missing boy we heard about on the news. This boy's father comes, Vincent (Vincent Lindon), believing she is his son.There are some deep seeded issues there. It is a rough go at first, but Alexia settles into who she is pretending to be. Those around Vincent don't believe she is Adrien though. Alexia has a much bigger problem that is growing in her stomach.That is where I'm going to leave my recap as I did leave out some important aspects as to not spoil them for anyone reading this. Where I'll start is that I came in with as much of a blank slate as I could for this movie. I knew that I loved Raw and that people I follow had seen this movie. It was getting high praise. I was excited, but I also didn't know what to expect.Where I want to start then would be the character of Alexia. I'm thinking there must be autism or some sort of personality disorder here. As a child, she is annoying on purpose. This could be that she is a sociopath as well. She wants to aggravate her dad. Needing to have the plate in her head and the scar on the side of her head that it caused, I think has a profound effect on her and for what happens later. I did hear some people stating that this is a take on David Cronenberg's Crash. I don't feel that is the case aside from Alexia having a fetish for this car, machinery and being body horror.That is where I'm going to go next, the body horror aspects. For some reason in my head, I wasn't expecting. I've brought up writer/director Ducournau's previous film so I should have been ready. There were multiple scenes that made me cringe with how realistic they look. I was joined by around ten other people. I could see many of them with the same reaction as myself. The effects are something that I should give credit to here. It is interesting that this is being compared to Crash, because I'd put both of Ducournau's films on par with Cronenberg for grounded body horror. The effects looked practical and were great. There was some CGI as well, but I didn't have problems there.Getting back to the story, there is an aspect of this movie I haven't covered. There is a serial killer that is killing in the area. It appears there have been four bodies found over the course of a year. This is a slight spoiler, but it shouldn't come as a shock, Alexia is this killer. What I like though is that we aren't given a motive. She is a sociopath that is crazy and kills people. She enjoys inflicting pain on others. I was pulled in as she feels like Henry or Patrick Bateman. She also doesn't feel bad about the turmoil she puts her family or Vincent through. Alexia is dealing with issues of her own of trying to hide something else and the physical toll it is taking on her.That is about the extent of what I can go into there, but I'm going to do a spoiler section at the end. I'll take this then to the acting for the movie. I thought that Rousselle was great here. She plays this broken character so well. I like that it establishes her as a child and how it has shaped the adult that she is. I also liked Lindon as this broken father. He misses his son and he's getting older so he is losing it at work. His wife left him, I'm assuming over the disappearance of Adrien. He doesn't have much going for him so when he thinks his son is home, he clings to that idea and will do whatever he can to protect it. These two are our leads so I'd also say that Marillier, Laïs Salameh, Myriem Akheddiou, Bonello, Carrère, Guigue and the rest of the cast also rounded this out for what was needed.Then the last parts to go into here would be the cinematography and soundtrack. I think we get some amazing shots here. The opening credits are done by showing us an engine as it is driving. We get a great establishing sequence to kick off the movie. Alexia goes through some traumatic moments with her condition and how the attacks are filmed. I was impressed. The soundtrack also fits for what was needed and help to set the atmosphere.So then in conclusion here, I'm glad that I saw this movie. It has an interesting enough premise and story that is equal parts grounded with fantasy. The performances from Lindon and Rousselle drive this movie with the rest of the cast there in support. This movie can be brutal with some of the body horror, so if you're squeamish, I'd avoid this. The effects, soundtrack and cinematography all help to build the atmosphere needed here. I'll also warn you, this is an arthouse type film, but if you can get past that style, I think we have a solid film here.My Rating: 8 out of 10SPOILERSWhat I was dancing around here is that somehow, Alexia becomes pregnant. I'm wondering if we are getting a commentary on pro-choice vs. Pro-life. The only time something sexual is done to her is when she masturbates in the car, but it also seems like it is having sex with her. I do wonder if there is commentary here with the fan chasing her, that possible she was raped, but we do not see it. This could explain why she doesn't seem to like men as well. Alexia realizes she is pregnant when she is with Justine. We get a horrific scene where she tries to perform an abortion on herself with a hairpin. It fails though. This seems like the movie is stating that abortions should be done by an expert, not in the 'back alley'.Alexia does carry this baby to full term. She has these recurring problems where she thinks she is leaking motor oil and that her baby is part machine. This goes back to the car, but also because she has a plate in her head. I took this as really meaning that she was raped, carrying a child she doesn't want to. It is a monster growing within her that she eventually gives birth to. It is causing her physical pain and taking its toll on her as well.",Titane

14,gedikreverdi,Raw has a script and this has shock value,7,22 October 2021,"If you expect to watch a horror film, it'll definitely disappoint you. I like the actor who plays Alexia but overall I didn't like it as much as I do Raw which is another French body horror film by the same director but I appreciate this one equally since it is different and disturbing. But here comes the ultimate question: what's horror? I'd say horror-adjacent drama and it's definitely more drama than horror.The first half is really mysterious and gory. Alexia had an accident when she was a child and she had a platinum plate in her skull. She killed the guy who hit on her in the parking lot and the woman to whom she made love and she also had to kill everybody else in the house (this was dark and funny). Then she set fire to her parents' house (and locked their bedroom door, too) and walked away. She cut her hair and broke her nose so that the police wouldn't identify her (I couldn't look at the nose scene even though I'm very tolerant with gory scenes). Then she became an impostor. The man in denial of his son having gone missing and a mother who can't grieve her missing son because of this and their impostor son Alexia. At this point the film didn't make any progress. They had firemen dance parties, they worked and the father tried to kill himself several times. Then she gave birth to a child with a titanium spine in the man's bed and died and the man hugged the baby as if he finally found his missing son.",Titane

Maybe Titane will be appreciate better by female audience as the director/writer also is.Like a revewer said, the ridiculous dancing scene without the belly prostetic is done without care.I have see many movies in horror genre, some done much better story and execution wise.

18,abisio,Some things might be difficult to understand but it will be in your mind for a long time,9,4 October 2021,"Define this movie as Art Cinema is not correct; making a movie is art; good or bad, commercial or not but still art.Titane could be better define as experimental but still commercial and still very good.Instead of going for the standard dysfunctional family drama, Julia Ducournau (the director) uses music, colors, lights and extreme (sometimes shocking situations) as a metaphor for common and ordinary situations. Going for the melodrama could be easier; but the messages will be quickly forgotten; with this way of storytelling it will be in your memory for a long long time.Explaining too much could simplify its greatness. Let's just said that important subjects of parenting failure, communication, chauvinism and loneliness are the main core.The story is intriguing; Alexia as a kid had an accident in her father's car; so a Titanium plaque was fixed in her head.Some years later she is a dancer on a particular type of club. Attempts of human intimacy makes her becomes a sadistic, cold killer. However she has sex with cars (not in but WITH the vehicle itself) and becomes pregnant.After a few deaths and shocking situations; she usurps the identity of a missing (for 17 years) kid and is accepted by the kids father a bomber captain (outstanding Vincent Lindon) as his own; but living with the man is not that easy; particularly as a pregnant woman passing as a male young adult.The second act is a little less shocking than the first; however is still strong and very realistic in some scenes.Just to clarify; there is almost not gore in the movie but the violence (suggested) is clearly present.Agathe Rousselle (is her first movie) put everything and succeeds in creating a character pure madness but ultimately empathetic.The far more experienced Vincent Lindon is even better; transmitting his many pains almost without words. His scenes fighting his age are difficult to forget.In brief; really worth your time and if something is not understood just ask.",Titane

This gotta be the most messed up movie that I have ever seen this year. The French really knows how to mess with you eyes. This is the type of movie that you go ""I had no idea what was going on, but I kinda liked it."" An extremely experimental film, this is not going to be for everyone.There were stomach-churning self-harm scenes that made me look away, and that's rare. Very gory, it made itself clear as a body horror that does not care too much about the plot. I questioned myself constantly what I was sitting through, sometimes laughed at silly lines. I don't know why but it was such a unique experience.Not gonna lie, I had to read an interview from the director to understand the message from her experimental film. It eventually made sense, but in such an extreme way. I felt a bit creeped out at how the director was inspired to make this movie. Some people really do have interesting imaginations.The only problem I had was that I would like to have a more coherent plot. But I guess this worked in making the movie incredibly unpredictable. The ending scene was just as crazy as the movie as a whole.Overall, do not underestimate the minds of the French. They really do create some crazy stuff. 8.5/10.",Titane

She has a titanium plate in her skull from causing a catastrophic accident as a child. She only grows worse with age. Titane's impulsive rage soon puts her on the wrong side of the law. She runs into many freaks such as herself including a macho, steroid abusing firefighter with a vulnerability that she exploits to the hilt.Nothing can prepare you for the level of violence, abuse, and shocking behavior encountered in Titane.

But after watching it twice and think again about it I must surrender to this shocking, surrealistic masterpiece of crime and love. French films are the most risky and meaningful nowadays. They are fearless. 'Titane' would never be greenlit by any Big studio. That's why I am so thankful to the french culture and its movies. 'Titane' starts as a surrealist erotic and dark crime thriller that becomes an engaging drama wrapped in a love story that owns multiple meanings. The performances, the direction and the story are flawless. The more you watch it, the more you just can't fight back. A shocking surprise! Better watch it knowing almost nothing from the plot. Awaiting its release in Blu Ray!!",Titane
23,sweidman-28016,Brilliant!,9,14 October 2021,"Titane. I have no words how to describe this. For that reason I will cease to add a brief synopsis in this. All the ones I've read are either too revealing, have barely enough information, or are misleading. The most I will say is it's absolutely wild and lingers long after. I believe that you should go in completely blind. Most everybody has gone in blind just expecting some strange film. If you watch the trailer it doesn't give plot details away and contains no dialogue. Since it's release we've gotten more of those synopses like I mentioned before, so I'd just say go in knowing nothing. Julia Ducournau shocked audiences with her bold, skin-crawling horror flick Raw back in 2017 (2016 if you count all the fall festivals it attended). I revisited it for the first time in 4 years after watching Titane and you can see her style in both. Titane is just dripping with direction. Every scene is flawlessly made. There are scenes that are uncomfortably hard to watch, but it's so hard to even close your eyes because of how exceptionally made it is, and to see what's to come. Her writing is also really strong. There's not a ton of dialogue, but when it's used even the shortest and normal sentences have meaning to it. It's full of beautifully haunting symbolism and metaphors.Going to the story, this is basically two separate movies put into one. You have a strange horror aspect happening and a heavy drama about needing someone and human connection. My one complaint is sometimes the meshing of these can be awkward. Going into the second act it doesn't quite make a whole lot of sense where it's going. I guess that's good to see something entirely new, though I think that transition phase left a little confusion. Somewhere leaning into the ladder half of the film we're so invested in this emotional story that we forget about the other stakes. We don't go back to it for a little bit and I think some reminder would've helped. Not everything will be answered and we have to accept that. But by the end of the third act, everything goes off the rails and the way it mixes together is so incredibly captivating it's hard to take a breath.Our two actors are phenomenal! Agathe Rousselle has her acting debut (she was found on Instagram) in the leading roll and oh my god is it amazing! She completely transforms throughout physically and emotionally. It's hard to tell who she is at the beginning and even though we may be left in the dark at times, she leaves a mark. Most of the film she doesn't even talk but through her acting, story, and direction we can feel everything she's feeling. Definitely one of the best of the year! And Vincent Lindon has a real meaty role. Much like his counterpart, he's hard to make out. He's deeply troubled and this new window that's opened up in his life has caused both a downward spiral in this high point. It's very difficult to portray. When these two come together, their chemistry is amazing. I want to see them do something together again someday. The final scene is just fantastic with what they do together.Since this is such a strange film, Ducournau pokes fun at it as well. Lindon has more of the comedic parts and he's great with that. Rousselle also has a few scenes. There are some hilarious sequences. One at the beginning is horrific to watch but with the incredible music choice and a few good one-liners is completely mesmerizing. The music in here is really good. Besides that one song, there are a few others used that pair up perfectly. And Jim Williams score is magnificent and something I wouldn't expect for the genre it's going for. He has a really good ear for horror movies. The look, like I did earlier, has everything in its right place and looks great. I think I'm starting to run out of synonyms for great, perfect, amazing, etc.Titane just blew my mind. My first watch I was incredibly tired and didn't catch everything, including one main plot point. I saw it for a second time only a few days later impulsively and I can guarantee you'll catch so much more. Now, I saw this at the Music Box Theatre in Chicago so both times were filled with cinephiles watching. There were so many different reactions through our. Some were laughing, some getting emotional at points. My favorite part was when the credits started because each time at least 3 people said ""what the actual f**k"" each time. I don't think this will be for everyone. I wouldn't show it to everyone, because you need to be prepared when it comes to genre and it's emotional impact, and have the stomach to watch. It's incredibly violent and at the auditorium and concession stand they had that warning. I can't wait to watch this again because it's become one of my favorites of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and for good reason!",Titane
24,PedroPires90,"Great first act, but after that...a lesser film.",6,6 November 2021,"I really don't know what to say...maybe underwhelmed is the right word?After a great and crazy first act, I was totally on board for something more, for even more craziness. Unfortunately, I didn't love the direction the film chose. The relationship between Vincent and Alexia is kind of interesting to analyse but it's not exactly what I wanted to see and I feel that story/development a so much lesser film than I was expecting to see. So much less crazy. So much less absurd. So much less interesting. So repetitive after a while.In the end, it's just about acceptance and feeling good even if living a lie. Fine.

25,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"A wild, wild ride - not for the squeamish",9,3 October 2021,"Like a French brutalist version of the masterpiece that is The Skin I Live In, but way more pulpy, even more absurdist, and in my opinion, less emotive - but, with tons of it's own character. Though it's themes are very psychologically heavy, the movie plays quite a bit more ""arcade style"" than I expected - it just took me until the movie was over to look back and see it that way. Much like Gaspar Noe's CLIMAX, if you have a personal taste for extreme cinema, this movie will likely be a lot of fun for you, and primarily just that.Lead Agathe Rousselle has a colossal presence, playing a character that goes multiple places I was not expecting, and unless she chooses not to, I can pretty much guarantee she will have a promising career ahead of her. It was wonderful to see Garance Marillier (the lead in RAW) again - their scenes together are some of the most charming in the entire film. Co-star Vincent Lindon also puts in a fantastic performance, somehow equal parts comforting and disturbing.The only real downfall for me was that I couldn't find the metaphor in a couple of the key plot points - like, you know, what the whole movie is based around. Hard for me to view a film as some kind of masterpiece if certain things about it make no sense to me. But aside from those, I thoroughly loved every single thing about this movie. Though I loved Ducournau's debut RAW, this film is far more intense, and leaves a much bigger stain on the psyche. If you're easily disturbed or queasy, you might want to avoid, but otherwise this is a wild ride worth taking.",Titane
26,thenolanfan,Review - Titane,8,18 October 2021,"Those who liked it, those who disliked it, horror fans, everybody gets out of the theater shaken and ""ill-at-ease"".Titane is a big hyperbole, of which the bizarreness of its synopsis is one instrument out of many. When it screams: ""Listen what I got to say"", it forces you to listen attentively. The viewer's reaction is an integral part of the experience in the sinister vision of feminism, paternity, gender identity that Julia Ducourneau proposes.Without restraint or complacency, it will crush your prejudices, shake your vision of the world. That is why the bizarreness is at once essential to itself and the themes. It is at once, the bizarreness to shock, to catch the attention, and the hyperbole to make the themes understood.In substance, most of the film deals with unconditional love, more precisely with son-father unconditional love. Or, conversely on how the two protagonists, Alexia and Vincent, needed respectively to be given endearment and to give it.Julia Ducourneau seems to demand a lot of commitment on her actor's part, but it pays off. Both actors, Agathe Rousselle - in her first role for cinema, a role of physicality, nuance, and duality of genders - and Vincent Lindon - also a very physical role - are incredible.I think lastly, in Titane, we can feel a love for experimental/edgy cinema. Lots of people have cited Cronenberg and body horror as an influence. And, indeed, it is an important part of Ducourneau's artistic style, especially regarding how she deals with gender identity. But, I also see in the opening sequence references to Kenneth Anger's Kustom Kar Kommandos. Anyway, it's a nice bonus that I appreciate.",Titane
27,darkreignn,An auto-erotic film for the ages,7,1 October 2021,"I've never seen a movie as simultaneously sexy and nauseating as ""Titane."" For your sake I hope you won't be watching this movie in November, because the beginning features some of the most erotic dancing I've ever seen on film - dancing that just happens to take place on the hood of a Cadillac at some bizarre, surrealistic motorshow. Yes, at first glance, you may think ""Titane"" is the latest ""Fast and Furious"" entry, but it soon transforms into something much more sinister.Our heroine, Alexia, played marvelously by Agathe Rousselle, is a woman who is clearly very troubled, in numerous ways. From a car accident as a child that left her with a metal plate in the left side of her skull to her unhealthy obsession with vehicles of all shapes and sizes, there can be no doubt that Alexia is unwell. However, if at any point, and for some reason, you find yourself unconvinced of Alexia's mental illness, you'll be sure to be immediately convinced of it when you see her brutally massacre a house full of people.""Titane"" features some of the most unflinchingly graphic violence I've ever seen put to film - violence so extreme that I had to watch the first 45 minutes of this movie through my fingers. People are stabbed to death, mutilated, and horribly disfigured in ways that will make even the most hardened horror veterans cringe at the sight. And this first 45 minutes will likely be the make or break period for a lot of people - ""Titane's"" violence is uncompromisingly nihilistic, seemingly without point or purpose. Make no mistake: it's disgusting to watch. That said, the first act is integral in setting up character and in building tension for everything that occurs in the last half of the film.This movie starts to become surprisingly sweet when Vincent, played by Vincent Lindon, enters the picture. The horrific nature of the first half gets put on the back burner, and suddenly ""Titane"" becomes a touching drama, one that is however no less disturbing. Both in content and in implication, ""Titane"" becomes no easier to watch - which is what makes it so engrossing. This is one unpredictable movie, if one that is moderately straightforward. Well, as straightforward as a movie that features a woman getting impregnated by a vehicle can be.Director Julia Ducournau is no stranger to body horror, and her love of the genre is clear as day in ""Titane."" As Alexia makes sweet, passionate love with a vehicle, and then finds herself pregnant with its offspring, the movie revels in the weirdness of a woman who starts to fall apart and leak motor oil. Is this pregnancy meant to be taken literally? Is it a metaphor for assault and an unwanted pregnancy? However you want to look at it, the body horror works both literally and metaphorically.""Titane"" is a strange film, but it's one I very much enjoyed. Julia's previous movie, ""Raw"" may be a touch better, but ""Titane"" is sure to thrill you in some places, and warm your heart in others.",Titane
28,tccandler,The film has very little to say at all...,3,19 October 2021,"I am a fan of arthouse cinema. I enjoy weird and strange. Anything non-standard and original intrigues me. I have seen virtually every film ever made that has been labelled as shocking or controversial. ""Titane"" purports to be all those things... but it fails on all levels. I found the film slow and empty. I thought it was shock over substance... and the shock was timid and pointless. It is the kind of cinema that thinks it is deep and meaningful, but has very little to say at all.",Titane
29,Avwillfan89,"Insane, strange and off-putting",6,4 November 2021,"This film just isn't as good as Raw, Julie Ducourneau's last movie. In that film, despite the effed up things the main character does, at least we could sympathise with her and relate to her on a certain level.Alexia, the protagonist is no such character. She's a psychopathic serial killer who was annoying and dangerous as a child and even more dangerous as an adult.The things that put me off in this movie was not the violence or even the fact that Alexia is unsympathetic and completely crazy (I read the director's explanation of Alexia's psychopathy, and it makes perfect sense). It's the reaction that other characters have towards situations that was alienating to me.Alexia being impregnated by a car - yes I said a car - isn't the weirdest thing that happens. It's the fact that Vincent, the father with the missing child, completely accepts Alexia, who has disguised herself as Adrien, his long lost son, despite all the red flags that she blatantly displays: Not talking, not acting affectionate towards Vincent, and many other things.There is also a scene near the end where a group of male firefighters have a huge party after one of their men is tragically killed in an accident. As if his death didn't matter in the slightest to them. That to me was far stranger than anything to do with Alexia's ultra strange pregnancy (apart from the fact that bandages would not cover her swollen belly)Raw at least offered context and explanations to the strange and unorthodox events that happen in the movie.",Titane

31,hunter-friesen,The most digustingly beautiful film ever made,7,17 September 2021,"*Watched at Cannes 2021*Containing some of the most disgusting and in-your-face grisliness that has ever graced the silver screen, Julia Ducournau's ""Titane"" holds you like a vice grip from minute one, refusing to let you go no matter how much you squirm. The experience of watching the film can borderline on torture, as violent punishment is enacted in ways that can only be seen to believe. The screening of the film at the Cannes Film Festival resulted in several walkouts within the first fifteen minutes, of which I do not blame certain viewers who are squeamish. Those that can stomach the film will be rewarded with an exhilarating story about acceptance and companionship told by one of the most original emerging filmmakers.A newcomer to the film scene, the French auteur (a status she has achieved in my books) Julia Ducournau is the complete opposite of the stereotype of the woman director. She made her debut feature in 2016 with ""Raw,"" a story about womanhood and repression that just so happened to contain the element of cannibalism. Like David Lynch and David Cronenberg, Ducournau confidently confounded her audiences with her bold take on a story as old as cinema itself. ""Titane"" is proof that ""Raw"" was not a stroke of beginner's luck and that she is the real deal.Translated from the French word for titanium, ""Titane"" follows the life of Alexia, who immediately causes a severe car crash within her first few minutes on screen. This leaves the girl with a metal plate implanted within her head (which is gruesomely illustrated) and a twisted attraction to the vehicle involved in the accident. Like the characters within Cronenberg's ""Crash,"" Alexia can't seem to help herself from being allured by vehicular and sexual violence.After physically recovering from her injuries over the years, Alexia (now played by the self-assured newcomer Agathe Rousselle) now works as an exotic dancer at a car show (very fitting). Through a nearly seven-minute long take, Ducournau traverses the show filled with neon lighting and an electric score. Cinematographer Ruben Impens, reteaming with Ducournau after ""Raw,"" shoots the film in harshly contrasting light, often blinding the viewer with lens flares. From this car show, Alexia quickly succumbs to her violent tendencies, forcing her to go on the run, but not without horrifically mangling her face so it would be harder to identify her. This brings her in contact with the local fire chief (a steroid-infused Vincent Lindon), who later turns out to be just as demented as she is, making them a match made in hell.Throughout several instances within ""Titane,"" audiences have to give themselves over to Ducournau's vision and accept the logical fallacies, which nitpickers could have a field day with. To be fair, a literal Cadillac becomes sexually involved with a human in the first fifteen minutes, so the laws of reality (and anatomy) were thrown out the window from the get-go.Like ""Raw,"" Ducournau is able to relay a positive message that sticks with you just as much as the gore. Through their interactions, Alexia and the chief find a common emotional ground that brings them together through both lies and deceit.However, a problem that occasionally appears is what exactly Ducournau wants you to feel as too many elements come crashing together at odd times. The film wants you to focus on several different storylines at the same time, some of which don't amount to much and could be classified as red herrings. Still, once you cut through the clutter, there's enough treasure to reward your patience.""Titane"" requires a lot from the viewer, such as mental fortitude and an iron gut. It's an uncompromising vision that bites off more than it can chew from time to time but still sticks the landing due to the duo performances from Rousselle and Lindon, and the boldness by Ducournau to go where no one would dare. Just make sure to watch it on an empty stomach.",Titane
32,Come-and-Review,Resist the urge of walking out,7,11 October 2021,"Due to the will power needed to resist the urge of walk out during the first thirty minutes, viewing Titane is a demanding experience. The choice of remaining seated however is rewarded by a more afffordable continuation, and the final impression left by the film is in all cases that it was an unique experience, even if not entirely enjoyable.It would be tempting to deem the film an inherently incoherent mscallaneous of events. Truthfully, the film resists to be abscribed to any genre - body horror, thriller, even dark comedy - it rather borrows elements from all of these. The best way to interpret Titane is as a surreal film, with atmospheric similarities to Leos Carax or Nicholas Winding Refn, with which it shares the pleasure for divisive sequences.Although surrealism does not demand any thematisation or coherent storytelling, Titane does in fact have a coherent theme. A good way to describe the film is as a gender and sexuality bending fantasy focused on a woman that penetrates a masculine world. The varied events provide a series of supernatural metaphors to various states of womanhood, unwanted pregnancy, inter-familial apathy, fetishisation, missed fatherhood.It is not unconceivable that this film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Nonetheless, it is a dense, challenging viewing experience, definitely not a film that everyone can equally appreciate.(Excerpt from my full review on comeandreview)",Titane

It was nothing you will expect it to be, the trailer and description is so misleading, but it is still an amazing watch, if your one for a weird movie. This movie is not afraid to be different, which is probably why it has so many bad reviews, it definitely is not for everyone though, its brutal, violent, and a beautiful movie, very entertaining.

35,PotassiumMan,Howlingly ridiculous and pathetically unstylish,2,29 October 2021,"A vicious female serial killer on the run finds refuge under the care of a lonely fire captain who wants to believe her to be his son. It's like a French cross between ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Frequency"". How original that is, I will leave to the experts.Unfortunately, there are limits on how far off the deep end I'm willing to go in order to run with a film's bizarre or inexplicable premise. This film tested and very quickly reached those limits. There is a fine line between challenging and implausible, between stylish and just plain stupid. The fire captain is probably the most dumbfoundingly absurd character in any film I've seen in recent memory, and seems somewhat homoerotic in his paternal mindset. The film has no problem showing his rumpled naked body but cannot be bothered to give an explanation for his behavior or any real background to his character. The female protagonist, meanwhile, shrivels into something of a caricature, never evolving or showing anything in the way of a true character arc. As for her backstory, forget it. It's an inch-deep.At first, it was the film's violence that made me want to walk out, but then my patience got tested exponentially more so with a storyline that becomes ragingly ludicrous. In one scene, I felt I was in the same boat as the firefighters wondering to myself what unholy nonsense I was watching. Do the critics think I'm going to just sit through this ridiculous mess and remain dutifully quiet? On the contrary, sitting through this film gives me license to bash it for the overpraised dreck that it is.I appreciate foreign films but I don't believe they have a special right to abandon basic rules of filmmaking such as plot credibility and character development, especially when it has to be commensurate with absurdist storytelling. If this were an American film, it would likely be ridiculed as trash, but since it's a foreign film it garners praise as ""art"". The theater cautioned us about the film's level of sickening violence. At the end of the day, that is the least of the film's problems. Anyone who calls this film ""sexy"" should go seek help right away. Not recommended to a damn soul.",Titane

39,theredsky,Titane Review,9,24 October 2021,"A massively uncomfortable film that is still powerful with its emotions. The subject matter and visuals the film shows are internationally EXTREMLY uncomfortable. I felt myself squirming and not feeling right after watching this film which has not happened in a long time but the way the film uses it's stellar sound design to make you uncomfortable adds to this story of family and accepting others even though our protagonist is a horrible person. The performances and direction here are some of the best of the year with Vincent Lindon being the standout here. He gives an Oscar worthy performances. His wide range of emotions and how his character interacts with our protagonist is powerful and terrifying to watch. I really hope he isn't snubbed during this year's award season. The cinematography is pretty great at points with several shots looking absolutely phenomenal. The shots add to this powerful story and even add to the sense of uneasiness especially the final shot. The music while definitely being a weak aspect is still pretty great towards the ending with the final piece sealing the deal with the emotion of it. As much as I would like to recommend this, it's hard to with how uncomfortable in makes you and I could definitely see some getting physically sick after watching it.",Titane

In fact the only thing that could have saved this vapid mess was humour ... Unfortunately the director is obviously incapable of seeing how ludicrous this thing is ... I laughed a few times, but at the director, for thinking anyone would take this arrogant over confidence in their abilities and seriously stupid ideas seriously ...

What you witness is an amalgam of surreal, rom/com, gore, and suspense. The music and cinematography were truly on point and the performances by the leads were extraordinary. Great job was done at editing, too.What I find most admirable and at times enviable in movies like this is the courage and diligence taken in executing an idea, telling one's story, no matter how silly and pointless it may sound to others. I strive to achieve that some day.",Titane
42,cappiethadog,I feel safest of all,10,22 October 2021,"Julia Ducournau is a student of ""body horror"", a David Cronenberg acolyte who transforms grindhouse into high art, like a Quentin Tarantino unhindered by the trappings of commercial instincts that entails from working in Hollywood. Julia Ducournau is from Paris. This Belgian filmmaker hails from the new school of New French Extremism. ""Titane"" will make a Tarantino film buff blush. Ducournau reimagines Cronenberg's ""The Brood"" as an action-thriller. She matches Tarantino's flare for pastiche. Alexia(Agatha Rouselle), you could say, is ""The Bride"" of ""The Brood"", a stand-in for both Uma Thurman's assassin and Nola Craveth(Samantha Egger), freed from the trappings of a partriarchal construct, the Somafree Institute, a mental hospital where Dr. Hal Raglan(Oliver Reed), her megalomaniacal psychotherapist, has absolute control over her. Or so it seems. Alexia, an exotic dancer, works at a club for fetishists, a club where scantily-dressed women dance provocatively next to cars, a reference to ""Crash"", also directed by David Cronenberg, adapted from the J. G. Ballard novel. ""Crash"", a meditation on ***********, shocked audiences with its audacious premise: James Ballard(James Spader), a filmmaker, and Catherine Ballard(Deborah Kara Unger), his wife, belong to a subculture, whose members share the same kink; they're aroused by twisted metal and broken bodies, an underground proclivity that involves attending invitation-only car crash recreations of the rich and famous, and monitoring police radios for real accidents. The influence of ""Crash"" is even more explicit in ""Raw"", Ducournau's 2016 debut feature about two sisters, cannibals both; one aware, the other unaware that it runs in the family and is coming of age. ""Raw"" begins with a car crash, whereas the Cronenberg film ends with one. Rather than being a stage for matrimonial love, a consummation in which Catherine's death reaffirms James' love for her, both body and soul, the victims of a one-car accident that Alexia(Ella Rumph) creates by dashing in the driver's way, consummates the older girl's hunger for the most exotic of meats; the human animal. ""Titane"", on the other hand, advances the theme of *** and machinery in ""Crash"" to its logical conclusion. But arguably, Julia Ducournau isn't the first filmmaker to get there.It's an alternate universe, right? Instead of people, the world in John Lasseter's ""Cars"" is populated by anthropomorphized cars. These automobiles have eyes and a mouth; they have genders. ""Cars"" opens with a race, the Piston Cup. Cars aren't only on the track, they're in the stands, as well, without a human or animal in sight. Nothing is alive, in the biological sense. Lightning McQueen(voiced by Owen Wilson), the four-wheeled protagonist, so close to making Piston Cup history by becoming its first rookie winner, approaches a serious pile-up. Rather than drive around the wreckage, McQueen leaps over the indisposed competition, and startingly sticks out his tongue like a professional basketball player, in admiration of his own hang time before the dunk. But ""Cars"" is just another post-modernist movie, right? No different than its ilk, contemporary films aimed at young adults who can identify with the parodic renaming of popular culture figures(for instance, Bob Costas plays Bob Cutlass), a practice that goes all the way back to ""The Flintstones"", when Ann Margaret played Ann Margrock. In most, if not all cases, the filmic world parallels the corporeal world, not situate it on the same astral plane. Accident or not, the world of ""Cars"" becomes our world, the moment when Filmore(George Carlin) a stoner van in Radiator Springs, blasts Jimi Hendrix's version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", annoying his neighbor, Sarge(Paul Dooley), an army-issued Jeep with an adverse reaction to counterculture gestures. Quite pointedly, Filmore doesn't modify Hendrix's name. ""Respect the classics,"" he admonishes Sarge. It's a variation of a theme, made more explicit in Andrew Stanton's ""WALL-E"", earth as dystopia, when the little robot watches ""Hello, Dolly"" on a planet designated for the detritus of our consumer culture. In ""Cars"", the people never left; they don't live out their days and nights on spaceships as big as luxury cruisers, instead they merged with heavy metal(Hendrix, get it?) and became hybrids(get it?).Alexia is done for the night. Outside the club, groupies wait for her, gushing female form aficionados who seek autographs, desperate to make a connection with their dream girl. One male fan is persistent; he follows Alexia to her personal car, and won't leave until he makes his case as a potential beau. The exotic dancer rolls down her driver-side window, low enough so the fan, thinking his words of love got through to Alexia, can lean in for a deep kiss. That's when she reaches for her hairpin and plunges the sharp instrument in his neck. After Alexia hides the body in the trunk, she returns to the club. She showers. It was self-defense, right? Blood circles down the drain. So far, the audience is on the fence, unsure if Alexia was potential victim or predator. A good proportion of moviegoers will side with the exotic dancer, as moviegoers are prone to do; we sympathize with the female. The prologue, still fresh in our minds, in which Alexia, as a young girl, survives a near-fatal car accident when the father momentarily takes his eyes off the road to discipline her in the backseat, keeps us rooting for her. Alexia, we remember, is outfitted with a metal plate near her brain. But then she returns to the showroom; returns to the scene of her last performance, next to the Cadillac. This car, without any explanation, is alive; its headlights go on by itself, like a greeting, as does the hydraulic system when Alexia enters the vehicle. The exotic dance is like Dr. Doolittle. Instead of talking to animals, she talks to cars, and more. The Cadillac, to our surprise, has a gender. To make a case for her humanity, to prove that she's compatible with people, Alexia starts a relationship with Justine(Garance Marillier), another dancer. It doesn't pan out. Soon after, Alexia starts to show. The Cadillac was male. It's a shock to the moviegoer's system when Alexia uses her hairpin on Justine. As it turns out, Alexia is a serial killer. Her first victim, the aggressive groupie, was never the predator, always the prey, unknowingly lured. Male or female, black or white, Alexia kills indiscriminately, like a car without a conscious.Think of the face as a wheel. The nose, when broken, is covered. In car terms, Alexia modifies her face. A wanted woman, Alexia emerges from a public bathroom with a new nose. She needs a bandage, or rather, a rim. Next to the ""wanted"" flyers are missing children posters. Alexia impersonates a boy named Adrien, missing since he was seven. She fools Vincent(Vincent Lindon), the boy's father, who is so damaged inside, the fire captain wills himself to believe anything, even after the truth comes out. Being around men, his subordinates 24/7, Vincent must sense his alleged son's female energy from day one. Does he sense Alexia's vehicular side, too? The exotic dancer bleeds oil, a fluid, a metaphor, perhaps, for gender fluidity; masculine/feminine, which doesn't just apply to Alexia/Adrien, but Vincent and his men, as well. Julia Ducournau, without a doubt, has seen Claire Denis' ""Beau Travail"", as well. Vincent is modeled after Adjuant-Chef Galoup(Denis Lavant), a heterosexual male who nevertheless seems at ease, like the fire captain, in the company of men. It's no conincidence that the firemen dance to Future Islands' ""Lighthouse"". ""Beau Travail"", set in Djibouti, uses Goubet Al-Kharab, one of the East African country's satellite of islands, as a backdrop during the Foreign Legion training sequence. Like Galoup, who reveals an unbeknownst feminine side in the film's dramatic last scene, a solo dance to the Corona song ""Rhythm of the Night"", likewise, Adrien confuses Vincent's squad when he/she recreates his/her nightly routine at the strip club.In ""The Brood"", the wife, equipped with an external womb, gives birth to another in a series of dwarf-children while Frank(Art Hindle) watches, beside himself at the spectacle. Nola recognizes her husband's disgust as she licks the blood off the newborn, Conversely, in ""Raw"", pere(Laurent Lucas), the lone male in a household of women, took over the role of mere(Joana Preiss) after she gave birth. This brood, pere's daughters, were passed down the cannibal gene from their mother. The family secret gets revealed in the final shot. Pere unbuttons his shirt, inviting Justine, the younger daughter, to fed on him, like mere and Alexia before her. Being female and French, it's practically the filmmaker's duty to subvert the masculine/feminine binary. In ""Titaine"", Alexia(Ducournau recycles the name) during childbirth. Vincent delivers the baby, but that's expected; he has EMT training. The baby is a monster. Vincent knows that. He plainly sees the exposed titanium running up the infant's spine. The baby should be destroyed. He should track down the father, the Cadillac, and send it to the scrap yard. But the masculine/feminine binary which informs ""Titaine"", dictates that the film has room for one killer, and that's Alexia. Vincent is a nurturer. He brings people back to life. Besides, this hybrid junior is an extension of his ""son"". Last seen, Vincent holds the baby gently against his chest, like a mother. Ducournau, once again, like secreting motor oil, plays around with the fluidity of gender. Vincent's masculine side doesn't stand a chance against his feminine instincts to protect the baby from science. The baby is another imperfect surrogate for Adrien, his dead son, but the man needs somebody, or something, anything, to love.Arguably, ""Titane"" is the origin story that ""Cars"" needed.",Titane
43,BijeshNagesh,Bizarre & Visceral Originality,8,22 October 2021,"As realistic as it was erotic, as weird as it was shocking, ""Titane"" is one of those rare French films that open your eyes to a whole new style of cinematic storytelling with elements of Sci-Fi and Fantasy thrown in.Julia Ducournau's direction and her co-role as scriptwriter along with writing consultants Jacques Akchoti, Simonetta Greggio, and Jean-Christophe Bouzy rendered this movie a shockingly bold and revealing take on character-centric filmmaking. Original music by Jim Williams and cinematography by Ruben Impens further added to the unique storytelling value of ""Titane"".Vincent Lindon as Vincent and Myriem Akheddiou as Adrien's mother both gave remarkable performances. VFX and stunts did amazing work on this project, as well as Art and Prod-Design. Makeup, Hair, and Costume did neat work too.The film featured Agathe Rousselle as Alexia, a character at once multi-layered and distinct, open-to-interpretation and exceptional. You won't soon forget her even after this movie has concluded. Possessing a metal plate surgically implanted in her head following a car accident, the titular Titane goes on one heck of a weird adventure - misadventure, rather, involving multiple grisly murders
Titane carried the film, and quite admirably. The sexuality that pervaded this movie was not crass, far from it. The film communicated an embracing of one's body and sexuality irrespective of stereotypes.Alexia later went incognito and made herself appear as a man, impersonating a lost boy named Adrien, all to evade police attention, which was a result of the trail of bloody murders she left behind. Her motive for those killings could have been prompted by anything, making me surmise that her head injury and titanium-plate implant might have had something to do with altering the fundamental way her brain worked.What followed after was even more bizarre and incredulous, which somehow her character (and others) ideally communicated as realistic. It was stunning how simple yet fantastic it all was. The story felt raw and immediate, particularly the sequences where Alexia had sex with a car and seemed to have become pregnant (!). The birthing at the end of the movie was unnervingly mindblowing.I, for one, enjoyed every second of this insanely different and rather risqué French film. There is no simple or linear way to describe it, to be honest. Director Julia Ducournau managed to braid several genres into a neat weave of plotlines and plot-twists. The way Alexia made you feel, made you relate, made you desire, made you want...There's little wonder in my mind how the film cinched the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. Not everyone will finding sitting through this movie easy - it has more than a few discomfiting scenes. That said, ""Titane"" was 'movie magic' material, and it has to be seen to be appreciated.",Titane

45,Criticalstaff,Weird abstract cursed nonsense,4,5 November 2021,"At its core, Titane is an exploration of the notion of kinship. On the surface it plays like a gory horror film. The movie can be viewed either as a thoughtful drama, an over the top comedy, or a reflexion on social issues like womanhood, fatherhood and so on. Or, it can be all of it at the same time.I have to admit it was difficult to be engaged with it. Especially, when plot shifts create forces that are pulling in opposite directions.We follow Alexia, who is an avatar of the modern woman. She is sexy, liberated and full of bravado, but also vulnerable and fragile. The film adds on the layer that she is a bonafide psychopath.The first part of the film is strange and the plot is very contorted. It is almost off-putting. In addition, you'll realize early on that there is an absence of narrative voice. Purposefully or not, it means that nothing is explained verbally. So you have to figure out what people are doing and thinking only by their actions. There is also a distinct possibility that things and events are presented to play on the audience sensibilities. There are scenes that seem to function only for shock-value.The movie becomes better when Vincent Lindon's character enters the plot, as a firefighter captain that becomes a substitute father figure. The whole movie shifts into this social drama with the life of a firefighter as a backdrop. It is good stuff, the characters bond and grow through experiences they have risking their lives and saving lives. It just doesn't gel with anything that came before. There is a jarring disconnect with Alexia's journey and Commander Vincent's. They are together and share experiences with each other, but they have nothing in common. There no underlying element that links these characters. Vincent is looking for a son while Alexia is merely looking for shelter. Throughout the movie, they discover each other and who the other person truly is. Vincent looks for a son, although his junior firemen could already fulfill that role. Alexia, whose first instinct is to kill and flee, recognizes a father figure unlike her own, so she stays and becomes accustomed to the firefighter life.But the tension that could have been is muted by the wacky surreal moments. On the one hand it's hyper realistic, on the other there is an element of abstract disturbing weird randomness. The relationship that emerges doesn't really ring true, because it hinges on something uncomfortably unreal.The story is good, but the plot and the filmmaking are at odds with it. Because the movie attempts to play or subvert the audiences' reactions, you're unsure how to feel in a given scene.In many ways, this film is reminiscent of other modern French films. It has the surreal nature of a Quentin Dupieux film (and the humour that comes with it), with the hyper violent sensibility of Gaspard Noé. As with these, the edge is interesting, but the sum of its parts is underwhelming.",Titane

49,avenuesf,Ridiculous,2,5 October 2021,"""Titane"" has been hyped as a bizarre and original entry into the horror genre but its premise is nothing new (think of a messy mash-up of David Cronenberg's 'Crash' and 1977's ""Demon Seed""). Anyone who has followed horror or science fiction films for the last five or ten years will find nothing unique or unsettling here. The film seems desperate to try and shock viewers by portraying excessive scenes of violence but it frequently goes wayover the top; as an example, there was one segment of the film I actually found myself laughing at in which the character repeatedly attempts to break her nose in order to change her appearance. Like many of the scenes in ""Titane,"" it's taken to such extremes that it eventually just becomes absurd.During the first 30 minutes or so of the film we're introduced to a dancer, Alexia (Agathe Rousselle) who seems to physically identify with cars and we're led to believe she might actually be partly mechanical herself. For reasons that are never explained, she often kills a series of lovers using a large large metallic knitting needle-type instrument after having sex with them. After setting fire to a house to murder several people inside (including her father), she decides to change her appearance to a male in order to avoid being apprehended by the authorities.At this point the filmmakers' original plot seems to have run out of steam and ""Titane"" becomes a completely different film altogether. It segues into the story of an older paramedic/fireman who takes Alexia under his wing as he's convinced she's the son he's been grieving over for years. The character is beautifully played by Vincent London and his very poignant performance is by far the best thing in the film. We learn at this point that Alexia is also pregnant with what appears to be something mechanical; she begins to excrete motor oil rather than blood or bodily fluids. Other visual effects lead us to believe that her unborn baby is not human. As her pregnancy progresses it becomes more and more difficult for her to bind her breasts and protruding belly in order to pass as a believable male (although she was never really very convincing in the first place). During these scenes ""Titane"" seems to relish in not only showing the character in various stages of physical pain, but one tedious shot after another of her naked and scarred body.MAJOR SPOILERS HERE: After the film's lengthy build-up, the ending totally cheats the audience. Vincent delivers the infant while our character is bleeding a gallon of motor oil, which for some reason he doesn't seem to find particularly unusual. We're shown only the back of the infant for about three seconds, and it appears to have a metallic spine. Vincent cradles the child and tells it he will be its father. The end credits roll.Is the conclusion meant to be surreal after we've watched a film that seems to have been graphically literate? Is there a message here? At this point I really didn't care, as I was just glad it was over so I could leave the theater.""Titane"" could have made a fascinating short film at 15-20 minutes long, but there's just not enough material here to fill up the demands of a feature. There are too many needless scenes that are clearly just padding to fill up the film's almost interminable 108 minute running time. Besides not bringing anything particularly different to the table, it doesn't provide a satisfying conclusion after shamelessly baiting its audience for two-thirds of its running time.",Titane
50,Megan_Shida,Don't Expect Answers,6,4 November 2021,"This was a very purposeful and powerfully directed film. There are provocative moments, and even some very human ones with some nice humor mixed in. It was, at times, difficult to watch with some very disturbing violent and sexual scenes. Without a narrative thread, such scenes can come off as gratuitous, as I believe they do in this film. Very little is explained in the story and instead we get a first act very derivative of Cronenberg's Crash and a second act that was very profound at times, exploring familial relationships and loss. The film really did feel like two films and without explanation given to bring them together, they remained separate. Agathe Rousselle in her first acting role should really be credited for a compelling performance. Ultimately, I would recommend the director's previous film ""Raw"" over this one, as it does a better job balancing style with substance.",Titane

55,frank-liesenborgs,Drive safe and do not forget to change your motor oil!,8,28 October 2021,"""Titane"" follows 32-year serial-killing girl Alexia (Agathe Rousselle) and a missing boy´s (Adrian) father Vincent (Vincent Lindon). They both struggle with their identity and the plot makes this very clear. However the plot line is not that important here, just the rollercoaster of twists, turns and characters is what makes this a great movie.Vincent is sad and lonely and overflowing with steroid-addled machismo and having a ""son"" onto whom to project all that is a good enough proposition after ten long years.Regarding Alexia, she has to cope in a world that is reluctant to take her sexual preference seriously. She tests herself in a lesbian affair but is no more satisfied with a human woman than with a human man. Hence she tries a car. In the beginning of the movie you can see that she was involved in a car crash and carries a titanium plate in her head. And ever since this childhood car crash Alexia lost her identity. Kind of in the same way as Vincent lost his when losing his son 10 years ago.But before the pair crosses paths and Alexia becomes Adrien, we get to experience her murderous touch first-hand. She discovers that the car has changed as we find out later in the movie. As she is wanted for murder, she goes on the run, and takes the identity of the teen-age boy Adrien (who went missing a decade earlier and is Vincent´s son).The plot is crazy, the acting is outstanding and the twist at the end will even surprise seasoned movie viewers. My recommendation is simple. Before changing your motor oil in your car, go and watch this movie. And if you regret it (but you will not), just change the motor oil of your car....",Titane

However, underneath that confusion, there will be a sense of emotional enlightenment that transcends the conventional moviegoing experience. While this film is certainly weird and foreign, its core is oddly simple: unconditional love can transform even the most monstrous hearts. The fact that this message is packaged in such an uncomfortable narrative makes it all the more powerful. The uglier the situation gets, the more beautiful that love becomes. Through extreme juxtaposition, Titane is both disturbing and tender.Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Titane is absolutely stunning. Every image is cinematic, filled with intentional colors and spacing that create a visceral experience. The sound design is ominous and vivid. The soundtrack is energized, whimsical, and atmospheric without being overpowering. Yet it is the acting of Agathe Rousselle and Vincent Lindon that grounds the production. Both actors bring immense complexity to their roles while remaining subtle and understated. Lindon's longing performance, in particular, is sure to evoke deep emotion.

62,JoelAlexanderr,Comes off as pretentious and unnecessarily disturbing despite serious talent involved,4,19 October 2021,"The worst feeling when walking out of a film is when disliking something that every other filmgoer seems to love. I had that feeling very strongly when I finished TITANE, the new film from critically-acclaimed independent filmmaker Julia Ducournau. Her only film thus far is a movie called Raw, and TITANE follows in the tradition of her previous film in that it contains extreme body horror and gruesome sequences that will disturb even the most seasoned veterans of horror. This movie is easily one of the most uncomfortable and difficult-to-stomach viewing experiences in recent memory, which many will view as a major compliment to the effectiveness of the narrative. However, I felt myself pondering the point of the film while I was watching, and once I began to realize that the jarring nature of the events was the whole intention, I found myself unable to appreciate the narrative in the way many others have.Describing the plot of TITANE in detail would be a disservice to the experience Ducournau wants audience members to have when viewing, and even though I cannot say I was a fan, I still very much respect Ducournau as a filmmaker and an artist. Despite all of the gore and gross imagery, Ducournau directs the film with the expertise of an auteur and the precision of an artist who knows exactly how to manipulate each scene while behind the camera. When adding the beautiful cinematography on top of the direction, TITANE is a truly beautiful movie to look at while also being a disturbing experience. This was clearly the intention behind both the story and the style of the film -- TITANE starts out almost like an art-house slasher horror, yet as it continues it reveals itself to be something far more tender and heartfelt.Ducournau embarks on an admirable endeavour at times, but the movie never seemed to reconcile being both a gross horror movie and a tender love story. Because both elements are relied on so heavily, neither seems to fully hit home due to the other's presence. Sure the movie is successfully disturbing, but it never does so in a way that I found emotionally or intellectually compelling, but only in a way that made me want to leave the theater (and I like horror films). Once the story becomes about love between two lonely, outcast individuals who could never find where they belong, it never takes off on an emotional level due to the constant reminder of the horror that exists in the background of the narrative. When the ending reaches the emotional climax and the credits roll, I only found myself feeling slight confusion and relief that I could move on with my night instead of a lasting emotional response.To go even further, much of the movie felt so odd and random that it never emotionally impacted me in the way I wish it would have. The film could have perhaps been a fascinating character study of a disturbed and isolated individual who doesn't feel at home anywhere in society, but Ducournau includes so many scenes that specifically exist to evoke a physical response from the audience that the movie feels confused as to what kind of story it wants to tell. The main emotion I felt during the movie was a disgusted confusion that eventually gave way to boredom as I realized the narrative was not going to give me any meanings that justified the aggressive content. What could have saved TITANE from being a pretentious oddity, even though it still may have its problems, is a thematic purpose beyond a weak relationship between two troubled characters. I constantly searched for a metaphor that explained the constant inclusion of titanium and cars in the film, or even some themes or messages that gave the audience a social commentary regarding any aspect of the human experience. Instead, viewers are just given a deluge of weird events that never add up to a meaningful conclusion, and a narrative that comes off as pretentious instead of the artistic breakthrough that Ducournau seems to deserve.While TITANE is very much not for me, next time Ducournau releases a film, my attention will not be hard to gain. Ducournau clearly has immense talent and contains the potential for some great and horrifying material in the future, which makes TITANE all the more infuriating, because that material never quite takes off here. I understand why many love it, and it is true that I have never viewed a film quite like it, but in the end nothing seems to come together in a manner that the average moviegoer will deem meaningful or worth viewing. The movie is trying harder to challenge the audience with its unorthodox and physical narrative than it is creating something meaningful for a vast majority of audience members, and for that I found TITANE to be close to unwatchable for much of its runtime.C.",Titane

If you start handing out Palm d' Ors to films like this, then you might as well give Troma a chance.Any summary of this film is a strong candidate for the most stupid thing you have ever heard. I can't imagine how anyone could read the entire script and ever believe a good film can come out of it.A chick with a metal plate in her head kills people with a chopstick and gets knocked up by a car. She doesn't want to get arrested so she changes her appearance to look like a boy. Believing she is a missing person, the cops pick her up and return her to her firefighter dad. After this point, there is a strong resemblance between this film and the documentary about the impostor who goes to live with a family pretending he is their long lost son, despite not looking like him.Her tummy gets larger but most people fail to notice. There is a scene with some dramatic weight when the impostor comes face to face with the ex-wife of the fireman but it's only a couple minutes long. Instead of good quality cinema the director prefers to shoot weird dancing scenes. If you got a dancing firemen fetish thingy this is definitely the film for you. If you want a good quality French film then you better bring some razor blades to the cinema with you because most likely you will want to slit your wrists. What other options do you have with scenes like the one where the protagonist is dancing on the roof of a bus and seems to have forgotten to put on her prosthetic belly?The ending is supposed to be shocking but only if you have not seen a real French shocker, something like Baby Blood or L'Interieur. It's the exact opposite of Raw, where the director made a good horror film with a lame ending. This time she attempted to make an ending in the vein of Demon Seed and XTRO. The problem is that the rest of the film is a letdown in terms of horror.The people behind this film need to realize that a Golden Palm ain't much nowadays.

You go from watching a thriller, to body horror, to something that has a lot to say about what it means to be family. Specifically, what it means to be family in action, not just by blood or oil. Titane somehow addresses gender fluidity, the role of parents to support and accept, the male ego slipping as bodies and testosterone age away, and the opportunity to choose a family not given to you by birth all while bombarding the screen with gore and squirm inducing violence. You find you cannot look away from these disturbing images partly because of how beautifully Titane presents them and partly because they all have something to say.

84,MrJustRight,Another Statement on Gender,5,1 October 2021,"I watched this film as I was a fan of the director's previous film Raw (2016) and noticed a familiar face by the way!I was expecting... Well, at least hoping for, graphic hardcore stuff I suppose. Whilst some of that was present, we are taken on a pointless detour wherein a still-grieving father becomes the star of the show and two tales intertwine.It is obvious to me that this film, above all, is a statement on gender. We see the star swap gender roles back and forth, and the ""father"" negates the true gender of the ""child"" in favor of hope or blind love. Obviously the film points toward a whole new idea of ""gender"" which of course is why we came to see this movie. A combination of woman and machine. But this idea took a back seat throughout the majority of the film, becoming almost an afterthought, forgotten due to the aforementioned pointless detour of a mourning father.Only at the end of the film do we see this birth, and quite honestly it was disappointing. It wasn't clear to me what this film was trying to achieve. Am I supposed to be interested in this cyborg or the grieving father?What started off as an intriguing film and concept ended up as a film that simply made me go, ""Meh,"" by the end. That said, the best moments of this film were in its gender constructions or perhaps deconstructions. Particularly the scene of the ""girl"" dancing as a ""boy"" in the manner of a ""girl"" - Watch it then this'll make sense.EDIT: Obviously, SPOILERS, the absolute best moment in this film was the apparent intercourse between the star and the car. But then... What the heck? It goes nowhere 🤷It was an EPIC moment, but sadly the film just went on that nonsensical detour as mentioned above. Such a shame 😔FINAL EDIT: I just wanted to add some thoughts on the idea of gender in this film. The main character (cyborg) was seemingly unloved by her father. She needed a father. The grieving father whom assumed her as his ""son"" needed a son. Her giving birth to a ""son"" seems to me now to be an act of martyrdom. She sacrifices herself, even if unwillingly, to provide a ""son"" for this grieving father. It seems the message here is possibly a feminist one, or one that points to the negation of woman to child. That is, the misogynistic notion that women are here solely to reproduce, and the film seems to point to this in perhaps a critical way. But it just doesn't work for me. We even had this cyborg kill both men and women previously, including ""her"" paramour from ""her"" ephemeral lesbian affair. But ""she"" could not bring herself to slaughter ""her"" ""father."" And the ""father"" could not bring himself to accept the reality that his ""son"" was a strange ""woman."" But where this cyborgism comes into play is a tad unclear to me at the moment. There is a sense of shame emanating from the cyborg when ""her"" ""father"" sees ""her"" breasts, indicating this suppression of female identity. But then ""she"" gives birth, uncontrollably unleashing ""her"" true nature. Perhaps I'm reading more into it? Anyway, regardless, the film was a letdown.FINAL FINAL EDIT: THE FILM WAS A LETDOWN BECAUSE I DID NOT COME TO SEE A STATEMENT ON GENDER. I CAME TO SEE A DIVERSION. FOR THOSE INTERESTED ON THIS IDEA OF GENDER OR SEX AND HOW IT RELATES TO CYBORGISM I RECOMMEND READING DONNA HARAWAY's (I believe that's the name) WRITINGS ON THE MATTER (I believe her writings are from the eighties). I WROTE A PAPER ON HARAWAY's NOTION OF CYBORGISM AND HOW IT POINTS TO THE EMASCULATION OF MAN VIA MACHINE THROUGH ABNEGATION (self-abnegation). I would be surprised to learn that the director of this film was not influenced by Haraway. We even see the birth as a form of emasculation as the supposed ""male"" reverts back to ""female"" before giving birth.Another note: In the bus scene we see a sort of silent understanding between the two ""women"" as the lot of oligophrenic men talk about sticking it in any hole. Obviously this film is a statement on gender/sex.Enough is enough in my opinion!5/10.",Titane

102,figueroafernando,Would the adjective pretentious be worth it?,6,7 November 2021,"Someone recommended me to watch it because they know I love the cinema of Cronenberg and his son, and that of Carax, as well as the literature of Ballard. But Titane de Ducournau seen for the third time, does not pass my humble and subjective avant-garde exam because it looks pretentious (an adjective that in thousands of reviews I have not even used 3 times); it subverts different logical areas to provoke a reaction of public opinion and not as an organic proposal that transgresses pre-established narratives. The scenes of sexual exhibition of a markedly commercial tone would seem to support this hypothesis, as well as the passages of violence subsequent to lesbian foreplay and even gore. Would the adjective pretentious be worth it? Let's see other legitimately avant-garde specimens for me: Leos Carax, for example in Holy motors, desecrates human-machine logic with that ineffable delimitation of his work and the limos in frank bonhomie after leading us to believe all the work that it could well be about entertainment fictions financed for capricious clients that avoid illegality; Yoshida's cinema thrashes the standards of logical sense by incorporating oedipal and incestuous panoramas, not to mention exploitation. Titane proposes all together. Will Adrien give birth to a child from the vehicle, or is her pregnancy contrary to the traditional gender discourse and for the sake of versatility does she make a nod to the incubation or the neutrality of the pregnancy itself, regardless of whether it is female exclusivity by opting for a vehicle? But on the other hand, how to avoid an Elektra complex, yet another logical refutation, father-daughter, when she kisses her protective father? Transmitting any type of dystopia or post-apocalyptic scenario requires ""basic conceptual articulations"", that is, scenes that provide plot context, whether in the form of discursive language (elliptical or not), or cinematic, which I call permformative; I mean that either the psychology of the characters or the sociology of the environment (time and place) of the narrative should give simple clues and denotations to understand the ineffable complex; instead with Titane, the opening scene of Adrien, as a child causing the accident with her father? Driving rather helps to confuse the plot more strongly; Is it a girl who has suffered a disorder since childhood, because in fact her outbursts precede surgery and brain plaques, or was it rebellion due to the girl's extreme situation (divorce, sexual abuse, etc. ) and its subsequent maturation into a self-destructive and violent tendency? I will not deny my emotion in more than two scenes, for example in the close up to the bursting belly and full of ulcers and mortuary plasticity, so in the end I gave it the third star that I had originally thought to reserve for myself. 3 stars and hope in Ducournau is open.",Titane

He plays a lonely disillusioned old fireman on steroids, completely adrift after losing his young son several years ago. The other lead, Agathe Rousselle, plays a disturbed young female, also very lonely and about to experience an unprecedented metamorphosis.I don't think the soundtrack is the strong point of this film.

Then again, Cannes also gave 'The Square' the Palme d'Or and that was a total waste of a film so I guess it's no surprise that the film with the strangest plot, most shocking content and word of mouth would win.When I say this movie has shocking content, it is pretty shocking at times. There are a few scenes of violence that surprised me with how brutal they were. Where the movie really shines is when it explores its body horror moments; motor oil comes out of orifices and the main character binding her stomach was effectively cringe-inducing with how genuinely painful it looked.Really, my issue is with the amount of how much I cared about what was happening; nothing substantial happened to make me go ""Oh man, I really hope these characters find peace"" or something like that. The lead is a murderous psychopath who has sex with cars (which is shown in one of the funniest scenes I've watched all year), and the dad, while sympathetic, is kind of a weirdo. It's hard to feel bad for him trying to connect with the lead when you're given absolutely no reason to care about her. Their connection doesn't feel earned by the time the ending rolls around, which has a climax so hilariously ridiculous the rest of the theater was laughing with me for the final five minutes before the credits rolled.There was just nothing here that wowed me. I was more baffled by a lot of the choices made than anything else. 'Raw' was an okay film, and this is another okay film. There are aspects to appreciate but the whole package itself was kinda just meh.

The premise alone can tell you we're about to travel into some Cronenberg-type territory and boy does it deliver. Anyone familiar with Ducournau's first film Raw already know her penchant highly realistic and confrontational violence - Titane is no exception. The walkouts in my theatre were a strong indicator of how not-for-everyone this is. This movie is off the chain. It's a brutal patchwork of metal, blood, oil and sweat that contains some of the more bonkers scenes in recent memory. For horror fans looking for an effed-up-psycho-sexual-mechanized-nightmare-freakout, you've come to the right place.What took me by surprise was how tender it also was. Rouselle and Lindon have a beautiful dynamic that develops so subtly and naturally that, to my total surprise, I was nearly moved to tears in the second half of the film.Titane has much more to offer than you'd initially expect. Yes, it primarily functions as nightmare cyber-body-horror, but beneath all the candy paint and viscera is a shockingly touching and sensitive exploration of parenthood and identity. Julia Decournau has proved with Titane that not only is she here to stay, but that she's currently one of the most twisted, interesting and singularly creative directors.",Titane

130,AyrtonMenezes,The Biggest Collective Madness of 2021,7,30 October 2021,"Titane is the craziest movie of 2021. With a wonderful first act (maybe the biggest cinematic event of the year), the film wrap the viewer in a story that mixes bodily horror with the psychological madness of human beings. Through the various breaks in expectations, Ducournau seems to play with the viewer's intellect because when think they're understanding which way the story is heading, everything gets more confused, leading him to ask himself: What the f... is going on?However, the first act is so attractive that it works like a main course, from a spectacular menu, at the beginning of the meal and having difficulty keeping up the pace from the second act until the end of the feature. But don't kid yourself! The film doesn't keeps boring, never, because the director bets on the psychological thriller that belongs a possible revelation of the protagonist and making the climate increasingly cold and dangerous.Guided by the brilliant Agathe Rousselle's performance, Titane envelops the viewer in a psychotic wildness together with the characters, delivering even more madness as a climax. I still can't say if I liked the movie (there are many eccentric elements thrown on top of each other), but I can say: Titane is not a bad movie and deserves to be watched, even though it is often unavoidable to turn your face so you don't see what goes on in the screen. I'm serious: Some scenes are simply disturbing, in the most varied contexts.So Titane does not make the profile that pleases the Academy and should not win the Best International Film's category. However, it would be absurd for Titane not to be awarded whit a nomination. Ducournau's work also deserves attention too: It would not be unfair to imagine that she can also be contemplated with this visibility in the Best Director's category of the Oscars. And I don't need to talk about Agatha's acting, she is the heart of this movie with brilliance! What an actress!",Titane

132,spencerooni,"Bizarre, Confusing, and Very Surface-Level",2,3 October 2021,"I had pretty high expectations for this movie, given the acclaim it's been getting in the media. When I went and saw the movie, I was disappointed by its awkward pacing and direction, as well as it's one-sided or empty characters.It takes the film too long, in my opinion, to arrive at the story's first conflict: the main character needs to go into hiding since one of her victims escapes and her face is drawn up for her arrest (by the way, you'd be fine if you forgot that the main character was a serial killer because it only come up once later on and it's just a device to get rid of a total nothing-character. Additionally, the main character had no defined reason to kill any of the people she kills, so the whole serial killer thing makes no sense). The direction of the film only begins to makes more sense when a missing people plot line converges with the story of our car-shagging main character, as she takes on the identity of a fire chief's missing son.What follows once these plots converge is a mess of non-sensical events that contribute very little to the development of the characters and just serve to confuse the audience until they're unprepared for the squirm-inducing body horror that feels like the only thing that develops throughout the film. I'm glad that so many people have enjoyed this film, but it was just really not for me. 2 stars go to the film, at least, for its soundtrack, which I found to be quite enjoyable.

134,fkrull,"Identity. Faking it, changing it, escaping it, and suffering from and for it.",8,19 October 2021,"After a ripening period of three days, time enough for the shock, disbelief and indeed horror to subside, French director Julia Ducournau's Titane continues to reverberate in my daydreams. The plot centers around Adrienne, who after receiving a titanium plate in her head following a car accident, in adulthood becomes a deadly accessorized exotic dancer with a penchant for steel, a will of iron, and the bravery to see it all through. But this film is not about any of that, actually. It's about identity, it's about the roles that come with identities, and the pain of carrying the weight of ill-fitting identities. This is the only consistent lens I see through which to view the film, as literal readings are immediately thwarted via confusing unreality of the plot, the characters, and the delivery.Initially, however, the viewer sets sail, tethered to reality. When Adrienne initially scuds a hair-chopstick into the earhole of a suitor, one is led to think that she will easily be able to explain this course of action given her sex, occupation, and circumstances. She does not. The aftermath of this act is barely followed up on, gusting us further from the shores of ""buying it"". Seeing coverage of her crime on television, Adrienne views it aloofly, more concerned with her stomachache. Our reality boat is assaulted then by the maelstrom of the sex party murder scene, and then finally capsized by the torching of her parents in their home. By the time she is visibly pregnant though pretending to be the son of a beefy fire captain whilst not uttering a word, the viewer is simply hugging driftwood.Identity. Faking it, changing it, escaping it, and suffering from and for it. Adrienne's character unbelievably inhabits several identities simultaneously, straining under the expectations of each. What she feels does not conform to nearly any box we the viewers or the other characters want her to be in. She will not be your daughter, not your lover, not your lesbian, not your son, not your fireman. In each twist of the plot, she kills (either literally or figuratively, actively or passively) anyone who tries to fence her in. Only her ""adopted"" father survives to tell the tale.Vincent, her adopted father, or the one whose long-since vanished son she poses as, is the second swan in this dance, possibly the true hero. The beefy 50+ year old fire chief shows an unwavering will to believe that Adrienne is indeed his long lost son, despite what is for the viewer, and for at least one of his fire station lackeys (who may or may not also have been his lover), quite clearly a farce. Vincent finds himself frozen in time, still struggling to be a jock, stay young, stay what he was. The man he was when and for whom? While it's unclear to what extent the Vincent we see post-prodigal son arrival is the same as the one prior, but he does appear to undergo a psychological and emotional transformation. This cringe-worthy and fremdschämend though somehow endearing in its helplessness solo dance scene shows Vincent struggling to connect with his ""son"", simultaneously triggering the viewer's suspicions further about Vincent's sexuality and perhaps even his motives.Back to Adrienne, she grows into the role (no puns intended) as the son, seems to actually identify with it, but not with the idea of what the others expect her/him to be. She is most happy, most daring, most endearing on the firetruck, feeling herself, being herself for the first time in the film since the opening scene, doing exactly the same dance for exactly the same type of people ---- but in a different identity and to different effect. She is cast out of heaven thereafter and only at the end, does she find solace, empathy, and freedom.Cinematographically, the viewer is never quite allowed to let go of the rope of reality, but the astonishing and inexplicable plot development also keeps the viewer in the judgment seat -- anyone would see she's a woman, what happened to the second girl, no way she could hide that belly -- judging what Adrienne could and could not be.Titane is experimental, unapologetic and will shock, arouse and scandalize you -- just don't try to fit it into a box.",Titane

138,thefrench1796,Not taking advantage of your hold over the audience,4,24 July 2021,"Since there are not any other reviews yet, I will leave this one free of spoilers.Having enjoyed the director's previous film Raw/Grave (2017), I was anticipating the release of Titane but was ultimately disappointed by the experience. As a fan of horror movies old and new, Grave managed to shock me during its more extreme scenes by having me engrossed in its story and characters. Titane has plenty of these kind of disturbing elements but is far less engaging.The film is hard to fault on a technical or execution level. The weak link is the distracting, if restrained, use of below-average CGI for some effects. The performances are believable and mostly consistent given the outlandish material, at least in the French version. The most realized aspect of the movie is the cinematography, which is an blend of the colors of Nicolas Winding Refn and intense images of Michael Bay.The similarities with Bay are reinforced by the content first few scenes, which led me to believe the movie would try to subvert the elements or vulgarity usually present his films. However it quickly falls out of this story-line and setting, leaving me to ponder what the goal of Titane actually is.The movie simultaneously follows two story-lines which seem to belong to two different genres. The first one is highly fantastical and horrific, but is treated very seriously. This is where the influence of David Cronenberg's early body horror films is felt. The second one is dramatic and grounded in reality, yet requires a big suspension of disbelief from the audience. Essentially the movie uses the disturbing content of one story-line to distract from the least believable aspects of the other: this would be fine if the unlikely setting was used to reach interesting or strange situations and ideas.During the viewing, I was most entertained with the film's few jabs at dark humor. My favorite scene in this vein actually occurs right before the main plot gets started, and from then on most of the humor disappears. I did not get much entertainment from the horrific content, which was not taken far enough and became obnoxious and numbing after a few scenes because of my lack of involvement in the story.Overall, this movie mixes elements from Under the Skin (2013), Enki Bilal's work, Conenberg's Crash (1996) and France's own Martyrs (2008). I did not enjoy those last two either, because I did not care for what they were trying to accomplish. I am not sure what Titane is trying to accomplish, but maybe someone else can have some use from it.",Titane

140,philip-ber-ln,Terrible film -- I have lost faith,2,11 October 2021,"This film is terrible. It uses sex and violence in the most gratuitous ways possible as a means to make up for the lack of plot. The premise was barely discernable. Even if I was on acid there would be no way I could suspend disbelief to the point that I could believe anything in this movie. It was really painful to watch, even when trying to think of it as an indie or ""art"" film.My favorite part about the movie was when I left the theater.Normally I try to find a few good things to say in a review. All I can come up with is that the acting, cinematography, and direction were OK; it's just a screenplay that should never have made it into a movie.",Titane
141,orangepie-chiken,Probably never gonna watch this again but 10 stars,10,10 October 2021,Yall. French movies are already weird. This French movie won the top prize at Cannes so I figured it'd be good. And I was. VERY GOOD. However. This movie was weird as hell. I won't give spoilers but just go into this with an (wide) open mind and heart and you should be ok. If you have a weak stomach cover your eyes at some parts and if you don't want to see nudity then same thing. Just stick with it until the end. It doesn't get less weird in fact it gets even more weird but it's ok don't worry about it. You'll be fine. Text your friends about the weird ass movie you just saw then come here and rate it 10s across the board because it deserves it.,Titane
142,SBGuiltySpark,"Titane: tough, disturbing but also stunning",8,5 September 2021,"Ducournau doesn't shy away from anything in Titane, which results in a very original, bizarre and disturbing movie. Less accessible then her previous movie Raw/Grave, Titane is definitely not suitable for everyone. I experienced most of the movie as unsettling and tough to watch, but at the same time fascinating and admirable, because of the amazing cinematography, top-notch acting and great use of music. It wasn't easy to watch, but it was definitely worth it. Deserved winner of the Palme d'Or.",Titane
143,mayya-izmaylova,So bad I had to leave a review,1,4 September 2021,Don't waste your time or money watching this garbage. It made no sense. There are 2 types of edgy: the good one and the one that a 12 year old with a million dollars can make. This is the latter. It was so bad it was just funny. I spent most of the film laughing.,Titane
144,demonizer84,i just watched this movie.... please dont ever do the same.,1,21 October 2021,"Iv watched many movies over my time, some good , some bad, some are so bad they are good..... yes street fighter im looking at you...some are like marmite you love them or hate them, hereditary and the likes seemed to be loved by many, i thought it was trash , its all opinion, however........please never watch this movie, how on earth anybody is giving this anything over a 1 star review is beyond me.I went in blind, with it being french i expected some weirdness but im not even sure what i just experienced.Do yourself a favour, never ever darken your doorstep with what has to be one of if not THE worse movie i have ever seen in my life.",Titane
145,djukic-77888,"Weird,different and inteligence provoking but memorable.",5,7 October 2021,"This movie messed me up, i was angry at the end and it couldn't be more weird of a movie. I had to do a meditation at the end so i can get my sanity back lol.",Titane
146,alevedoya,surprisinly enjoyable love story,7,28 October 2021,Whached on a thursday morning and is enjoyable.Strange but very good and original film. Some gore that then gets an explanation and sense for the story. Kind of non binary non species movie. Loved it.,Titane
147,almiro,Unbelievably bad,1,7 November 2021,Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm only writing this to try to help some people not to waste 2 hours of their lives. This movie is absolutely garbage.,Titane
