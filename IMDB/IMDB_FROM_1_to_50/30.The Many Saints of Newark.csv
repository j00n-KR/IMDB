1,kosmasp,A great addition to the Sopranos ... Saga,10,26 September 2021,"Having the son of Gandolfini play a young version of Tony Soprano ... I don't think this can get any more meta than that. And while I was not aware while I watched the movie of that fact, it felt eerie how he looked a lot like James Gandolfini. Well now I know why ... and while some may cry nepotism, I urge you to not do that - because it is not just the looks that work here! His acting abilities seems to match that of his father - well after one movie, I should not judge prematurely of course. The likelihood is there that he can also become at least a good actor.But it is not just the son of Gandolfini here ... while the opening shot plays during the run of the Sopranos show (and I seriously have to rewatch the movie and the tv show together), the movie itself plays way in the past. And it plays way differently than the tv show did. So if you just expect this to be a longer Sopranos episode ... you may dissapointed. But I have a feeling that anyone who loves the Sopranos, will understand that this is a different beast ... or beasts! No pun intended.So many good actors in this and a lot of hints to things to come ... in the tv show. In fact so many that I am likely to have missed at least half of them. If the shows creator was able to do this and bring this to life, he is the one who will know every single one of them.Really well created, acted, shot, edited and whatever else you can think of. Only thing I'm not entirely sure of: should you watch this first if you haven't seen the tv show or the Sopranos first and then the movie? But there are issues that one might not have a problem with having ... I say you decide ... hearing some in the sneak preview I was in talk about this being based on a tv show was almost comical. But also goes to show you that the Sopranos are still in everyones mind .. even the people who've never seen it ...",The Many Saints of Newark
2,CinemaSerf,An amalgam of television episodes loosely knitted together for the big screen.,6,26 September 2021,"Two things really marked this down for me - firstly, I didn't watch the ""Sopranos"" and secondly I had just watched ""Goodfellas"" (1990) so this, in that context, proved to be a really unremarkable mobster flick with precious little action, some really mediocre acting and, well - it just isn't much good. Told by way of a retrospective narrative from the young"" Tony"" (Michael Gandolfini for the latter part), we see the beginnings of the ""Moltisanti"" family's evolution into those we see on the small screen years later. The story centres around his uncle ""Dickie"" (Alessandro Nivola) and of his turbulent juggle between his lively personal life and his business aspirations to take on the powerful (but very rarely seen) DiMeo family that pretty much run the place. It touches on issues of corruption, racism, family ""loyalty"" and domestic violence but not in any way that is remotely innovative; the story flows like treacle and the delivery just isn't really up to much at all. Sorry - there are way better films out there that depict the mafia at it's more venal, visceral and engaging. This is just part one of what I am sure will be more, designed to capitalise on the success of an award winning television series, but without the class of many of it's cinematographic forebears. I'm afraid, it's just all a bit too weakly characterised to make for a strong piece of cinema. Fans of the series will doubtless disagree, but as a standalone piece of work, this is nothing to write home about.",The Many Saints of Newark

4,mm-39,"Disappointment, and a let down.",6,4 October 2021,"I like the Sopranos and T M S o N is a disappoint, and a let down. I liberally give a 6 because I liked young Tony, and a few characters actors. Tony had no healthy parental influence made for the making of Tony S story line. Tony and the family part of the movie I gave a 8. There is few dysfunctional family moments, and bad characters which resonates with the past series. Regrettable, many characters and story lines had nothing to do with the Sopranos, or the mob. I don't know if the makers tried to be woke, artistic, or just preachy! Bad enough movie one guy left. Disjointed, badly written, another silly woke movie just using the Soprano name. So silly half the film had nothing to with the story. I thought parts of the film are just random. More like a film about a messed up Dickie character , which gets boring. Random, crazy which I thought would turn into a story, but no. 6 stars should be 4 but I am sentimental for the series.",The Many Saints of Newark
5,blanbrn,Pretty good turn back the clock prequel that tells a coming of age story.,7,12 October 2021,"Was a big watcher of ""HBO's"" series ""The Sopranos"" never missed an episode of it, so I for sure checked out this movie prequel from creator David Chase called ""The Many Saints of Newark"". Here it goes back in time to the 60's in Newark when Tony was a little boy and this origin story shows how Tony was developed into a crime lord king with help and being guided by his mentor Dickie Moltisanti(the good Alessandro Nivola) the film borders on drama and Greek tragedy as Tony deals with pain and power struggle as you see the past and how the characters were made and connected. Uncle Jr., Paulie, and Silvio are all shown in their early crime days, plus stubborn and hard headed Livia Soprano(Vera Farmiga) is shown belittling life and trying to wrap her son down. As Tony(in a fine performance from the late James Gandolfini's son Michael) grows it's interesting to see how crime and family drama is all around him with his life and times including gang wars and riots call it what you want mob drama or origin tale this is a must watch for any ""Sopranos"" fan as it sheds insights into the past and the start of how the iconic Tony Soprano came about.",The Many Saints of Newark
6,Cineanalyst,A TV-Like Movie Based on a Cinematic TV Series,4,1 October 2021,"""The Sopranos"" is probably still the best TV series ever made because it was uniquely cinematic. Indeed, its premiere was followed shortly by a theatrically-released movie that came across as its pastiche, ""Analyze This"" (1999), which merely played the mobster-shrink angle for laughs. It wasn't so much the writing, either, that set ""The Sopranos"" apart, which while fine, was still necessarily serialized, but the camerawork, production values and acting were worthy of feature films at a time when that wasn't the case with anything else on TV. Heck, they kept ineptly giving out Emmys to ""The West Wing,"" and as much as that politically-idealistic sap has been a guilty pleasure of mine, the show looks tacky by comparison (especially that poor TV lighting masquerading as dark and important cinema). Moreover, ""The Sopranos"" ended perfectly. I won't say it was ambiguous when it cut to black, as I think it was pretty obvious what happened, and one can easily find it explained in interviews since, but there was none of the episodic junk of the cast patronizingly saying their goodbyes to viewers that you see with most such planned finales.Then, this comes along. ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" a theatrically-released (albeit simultaneously streamed, too, as with all Warner movies this pandemic year) prequel. It's almost pure cash-grab fan servicing. It's not nearly as bad as the utterly redundant ""El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie"" (2019), but it's about as superfluous as ""Downton Abbey"" (2019), which is shame because ""The Sopranos"" was far better than that show, which I never even finished it was so dully anachronistic and melodramatic. I'm not saying this movie ruins the legacy of the TV show or anything, either, as I don't believe in that sort of thing, but it is mostly pointless artistically. I suppose to make a good movie based on a TV show, one has to make a break from the series, to become its own thing. The formats really are different in important ways, and that should be recognized. Here, it's not.There's occasional narration from a character who died in the show for no other purpose than to play on our nostalgia, as the character only appears as an infant in one scene, which includes an atrocious bit of spiritualist explanation as retroactive foreshadowing--after-the-fact-foreshadowing, or I guess that's merely shadowing--that Tony Soprano will murder him one day. Moreover, Tony is hardly a character here, either. He has no real character arch. There's a scene with a school guidance counselor in lieu of a psychiatrist session. For all the regular characters who would be in ""The Sopranos,"" the interest in them here hardly goes beyond other actors doing impressions of their younger selves. Slightly amusing at best, or a sympathetic ode to his late father in the case of Michael Gandolfini. Otherwise, it's as if the characters are just here because they'll be important in future episodes--like in a TV show. I will say, though, that casting Ray Liotta, most famous for ""Goodfellas"" (1990), one of those gangster movie precedents for the cinematics of ""The Sopranos,"" is a nice touch, as is having him play twin roles. I'd give this the edge over that ""Downton Abbey"" movie just for this.The actual narrative here, though, involves Tony's uncle Dickie (Alessandro Nivola) and his racial gang turf feud, his Italian mafia versus that of African-American rivals, led by Harold (Leslie Odom Jr.), over who runs the illicit local lottery, or ""numbers,"" in crime speak. All of that is ho-hum, generic gangster movie stuff played against the background of a race riot over police brutality and with the Vietnam War receding ever farther in the background. A bit more interesting, especially given the show's tendency for psychobabble, is that Dickie essentially plays out an Oedipus complex over his step-mother and all the while being blind to the ultimate threat against his life.",The Many Saints of Newark
7,ops-52535,"a grasp for air, or....?",9,3 October 2021,"Anyway, apart from being slow, some lack of cronological continuity, while skipping several years of a teenagers personality development, and the missing fictional actual timeline, this is a great start of a triology( i guess) of the gangster empire of tony soprano. There are no outstanding acting , but the choice of cast is brilliant. The score chosen is good, the set and location preppin is phenomenal, as also the small use of special effects and very well done filmo and edit's.There are lots of sex and adultery, profanity and killings, and vendettas done the good old italian way, so roll out the pepperoni and wrap yourself in it, its spicy and strong.Why they made this, well they cant make further soprano episodes cause mr gandolfini is passed away, and a new actor as stand in would be like profanity in church. Its also meant to give soprano lovers some fodder and to start a new barrage of speculations and possible plotdirections for the next features to come. I have seen some but never followed the soprano tv serie, due to running at late night hours here in norway but i think this was pretty good.So as the grumpy old man i'm that have seen alot, i will look forward to the next chapter, it doesnt deserve most of the bad reviews, even though its not perfect.

9,Thanos_Alfie,Different than what I expected...,7,25 October 2021,"""The Many Saints of Newark"" is a Crime - Drama movie and a prequel of ""The Sopranos"" series, in which we watch the influence tha Dickie Moltisanti had on Tony Soprano and how he started thinking about getting involved to mob life.Since I had already watched and enjoyed ""The Sopranos"" series I had high expectations from this prequel and I was a bit disappointed by it. I was expecting more information about Tony Soprano and his family, the relationship with his father and his sister Janice but instead of that there was plenty of information for Dickie Moltisanti, his life and his actions. The narration by Michael Imperioli who played as Christopher Moltisanti in the series, was an excellent choice and it gave a beautiful touch in the movie. The interpretations of Alessandro Nivola who played as Dickie Moltisanti, Vera Farmiga who played as Livia Soprano and Michael Gandolfini who played as Teenage Tony Soprano were very good and saved the movie. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Many Saints of Newark"" is a different movie than what I expected to watch but I enjoyed it so, if you are a fan of ""The Sopranos"" series I suggest you to lower your expectations otherwise you will be disappointed.",The Many Saints of Newark
10,cruise01,Great performances but nothing special.,6,19 October 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Great performances. Thin and forgettable script and plot makes this prequel to Sopranos okay. It is an interesting premise of showing Tony Sopranos uncle and his teen years.,The Many Saints of Newark
11,southdavid,An offer you could refuse.,6,27 September 2021,"I think I'm right in saying that this is another one of the films that is going to open on ""HBO Max"" in the States, rather than widely at the cinema. Here in the UK, we have had a cinematic release and as a fan of ""The Sopranos"" I jumped at the chance go. Though I wouldn't go as far as to say I was disappointed, I came away unsure as to the point of what I'd seen.Richard Moltisanti (Allesandro Nivola) is a gangster, running numbers and trafficking stolen goods in Newark. Initially struggling to conceive a child of his own, he acts like a second father to the son of his friend Johnny Boy Soprano (Jon Bernthal). Young Tony (William Ludwig/Michael Gandolfini) has an unstable homelife and is beginning to act out at school. Dickie Moltisanti has other issues though, such as the rise of black gangs in the neighbourhood following the riots of 1967 and his attraction to his father's young new wife, Giuseppina (Michela De Rossi).It's not that this is bad. By no means is it bad. The performances are excellent, the impressions of established characters are nicely done, the recreation of the 1960's and 1970's is really well done. It's that I felt like I was watching what should have been at least three seasons of television, with the fast forward button on. It's interesting to see that this is being sold as ""The formative years of Tony Soprano"" when really that's quite a small part of the overall film, barely even a third of it, I'd say. It's very much the Dickie Moltisanti story, narrated from beyond the grave, by his son. It's his relations that make up the bulk of the story and not just his relationship with Tony, but also with his father played by Ray Liotta, his new step mother, a low level runner called Harold McBrayer, played by Leslie Odom Jr and with the rest of the family - both actual and metaphorical.There are quite a few different plot points to the film, but all are shallowly dealt with as they only have two hours to play out, rather than thirty. It's like watching a wrap up film for a cancelled TV show where the writers say, ""this is where we would have gone"". None of the betrayals or murders play that heavy as we don't spend enough time with the characters to get more than a basic feel about who they are.Again, I don't want to bang on as if what's here isn't good. It is, and I really hope if finally allows Allesandro Nivola to get some meatier roles again, and, on the smaller screen, it might seem more fitting than it does at the Cinema. But I came away wishing I could have the rest of this, rather than just the tiny taster menu that was on offer.",The Many Saints of Newark
12,paul-allaer,Sopranos prequel hits and misses the mark,6,2 October 2021,"""The Many Saints of Newark"" (2021 release; 120 min.) brings the story of Dickie Moltisanti and his cohorts. As the movie opens, the voice-over reminds us that it's ""1966"", and Dickie and his nephew Tony Soprano are welcoming Dickie's dad and his new young bride from Italy at the dock in New York. Pretty soon thereafter the Moltisanti (""many saints"") family are scheming up more ways to generate revenue. Then one evening, racial tensions boil over after a black cabdriver is assaulted by two white police men... At this point we are 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the long-awaited prequel to the long-running HBO TV series ""The Sopranos"", which last aired in 2007, yes almost a decade and a half ago, but that hasn't diminished the allure of the series, on the contrary. ""The Sopranos"" creator David Chase dreams up a prequel in which we get to watch teenage Tony Soprano (played by Michael Gandolfini, son of James), admiring his uncle Dickie Moltisanti as Dickie goes about his business. To be clear: the movie is NOT a young Tony Soprano movie, but instead centers around the Moltisanti family. At times it feels like the movie is lacking an overall arch or theme, as we don't understand what really is driving the story. But at times the movie is also very much on point, just watch the racial tension and riots that took place in Newark in 1967 yet feel as though they could've happened (and in fact did) just last year. The cast is quite good. It is uncanny how much Michael Gandolfini looks like his dad. Ray Liotta looks creepy playing 2 roles (twin brothers, including Dickie's dad). Newcomer Michela De Rossi (as the new bride from Italy) is stunningly beautiful. The production set is exquisite. And yet, when you all sum it up, the movie feels quite uneven, sometimes hitting the mark, sometimes missing the mark. As if all of the pieces together don't quite add up to the total. Is ""The Many Saints of Newark"" a 'bad' movie? Of course not. Is it as good as ""The Sopranos""? Certainly not.""The Many Saints of Newark"" was scheduled to be released in theaters in September, 2020. Then a little thing called COVID-19 had different ideas. Now a year later, the film was finally released in theaters this weekend, while also being streamed on HBO Max, where I caught it. If you loved ""The Sopranos"" (and who doesn't?), this movie is a must-see, but be prepared for a slight letdown as it is NOT at the same level as ""The Sopranos"". But hey, don't take my word for it. I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on HBO Max, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion. (Early internet buzz is that a sequel to ""The Many Saints of Newark"" is all but a certain thing.)",The Many Saints of Newark
13,jtindahouse,"Don't expect it to compete with the series, just enjoy it as an add-on",7,6 October 2021,"I'm a big fan of 'The Sopranos'. I think the most important thing to note about 'The Many Saints of Newark' is that you're going enjoy it a lot more if you are a fan of the series. There's an awful lot of fan-service here and not a huge deal of plot for the casual viewer to enjoy. For that reason I was able to enjoy it a great deal, but I can understand those who did not's point of view.The film throws in more references than you can poke a stick at. A lot of them went over my head I'm certain, but the ones I did pick up on were throughly enjoyable. The film is also not afraid to give us some revelations, and they have some pretty major influence on the series in retrospect when you think about it.The cast are decent for the most part. There a lot of characters and almost all are impersonating someone who did a brilliant job in the series. Far from an easy job and a pretty thankless one I'd imagine. The standout though is Vera Farmiga. She is incredible. She not only channels the character she is playing perfectly, but also throws a lot 'Carmela' into the performance implying Tony grew up to marry a version of his own mother.David Chase is a genius plain and simple. The minute he was involved in this it was always going to be very smart and then clean. The people who aren't enjoying it I suspect had far too higher expectations. They wanted a two hour movie to compete with six seasons of television from one of the best shows ever made. It's not perfect, but it was pretty darn enjoyable. 7/10.",The Many Saints of Newark
14,Turfseer,Decent enough tribute but cannot stand on its own without reference to original TV Series,5,8 October 2021,"The main question that first arises when attempting to review David Chase's Sopranos prequel is whether it can stand on its own without pre-knowledge of the original series. The answer is decidedly no. The Many Saints of Newark is strictly designed as a tribute to the HBO series and you cannot really appreciate it without having some knowledge of the beloved original.So let's judge it on those terms. One notes right away that ""Many Saints"" has a meandering plot-what looks like a series of disparate episodes haphazardly strung together. The worst plot offender is the tangential story about how the 1967 Newark riots relate to Chase's origin exploration of the DiMeo crime family.Too much time is devoted in the early part of the picture to developing this subplot. The riots are mainly introduced as a pretext for the main character in the film, Uncle ""Dickie"" Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola) to find a way of disposing the body of his father, ""Hollywood Dick"" Moltisanti (Ray Liotta), whom he has just murdered in the usual Sopranos ""fit of rage"" (Dickie drags his dad to a drainage supply building where the riots are taking place and burns it down to make it look like his father was a victim of the escalating violence in the neighborhood).Indeed it's these ""over-the-top"" moments of violence that Sopranos' fans live for. Usually this involves a completely inappropriate response to a small slight that sets these mobsters off and into a frenzy. In addition to Dickie murdering his father, he also murders his stepmother Giueppina Moltisanti (Michela de Rossi) by drowning her at the beach while on a vacation after she confesses to having an affair with Harold McBrayer (Leslie Odom Jr.), the African-American Newark resident and one of Dickie's workers who ends up starting his own numbers racket in opposition to Dickie's operation.The film ends with another one of these typical Sopranos' explosions of violence. This time Dickie is the one who meets his maker not at the hands of the usual suspects-the fledgling African-American gang now muscling in on the Dimeo crime family's territory-but by Uncle Junior (Corey Stoll) himself, another ""victim"" of one of those absurd slights (Junior felt humiliated when Dickie laughed at him after falling down on church steps hurting his back).Nivola has the best role here as Uncle Dickie, a stand-in for the older Tony Soprano from the original TV series. Chase attempts to humanize the character by depicting his generous side (he attempts to make amends after murdering his father by doing good deeds such as sponsoring a baseball team for blind kids).One must appreciate the performance of Michael Gandolfini, son of the late James Gandolfini who played the adult Tony Soprano. As the young Tony, Michael not only looks like his father but manages to capture his mannerisms. The idea is to show Michael as a teenager before he commits to a life of violence-we see signs of his future misconduct in his commission of misdemeanors such as stealing the answers to a geometry test at school.Despite Chase's accurate vision of the teenage Michael, not enough happens with him of much consequence. His best moments occur when he interacts with his mother Livia (Vera Farmiga), who does a great job in conveying how she contributed to Tony's eventual decision to embrace a life of violence and amorality.The depictions of the rest of the main Soprano characters in their early incarnations prove to be a mixed bag. I don't see much being done with Johnny Soprano (Tony's father) who is released after four years in prison along with Paulie Walnuts (so colorful in the original series but totally insignificant here) along with Silvio, the devoted confederate (a mere caricature this time around).Better is Stoll as Uncle Junior and Liotta in a dual role of Hollywood Dick and his twin brother Sally, the wise convict who gives Dickie good advice, despite being incarcerated in the penitentiary for life.The best Sopranos' episodes kept you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Here there are only flashes of brilliance with little organic connection between one plot point and another. I also found it a bit disappointing that the Harold character gets away with the pain he inflicts on the DiMeo family. In the original series the gang would have found a way to retaliate to maximum effect.The Many Saints of Newark is a decent enough tribute to the original TV series and has its bright moments. But not all the characters are drawn cleverly enough to prompt us to heap accolades upon it ad infinitum.",The Many Saints of Newark
15,jadavix,David Chase should have trusted his instinct,4,15 October 2021,"Remember when ""The Sopranos"" took the television show to new narrative heights? Remember when each new episode was more anxiously awaited than any new movie? Remember when you wished more movies could be told as TV series or miniseries on HBO or Showtime, so that they could go into more detail, take their time developing.It is ironic that the show that surpassed film would then go back to that form, and all the more ironic that the resultant film doesn't hold a candle to the TV show. We hung on every moment of ""Sopranos"". People watch and rewatch scenes noticing tell-tale placement of actors in similar positions to where the actors were in prior scenes. They go over dialogue, building profiles of characters who never even appear on the show, but we get to know them better than most on-screen characters in other shows.The legendary Dickie Moltisanti was oft mentioned in the show, and here we finally get to see him, played by one of few Italian-American actors who aren't famous for mob roles, Alessandro Nivola. For such a revered figure, he turns out to be a dead end, not emerging with any discernible personality. That should be okay though, because of course this movie shows us younger versions we all know and oddly love, such as Silvio Dante, Paulie Walnuts, Uncle Junior. Except - wait a minute. None of them say or do anything interesting here. The guy who plays Silvio particularly just seems to be trying as hard as he can to ape Steve Van Zandt. You can never take him seriously as the character. And how is Billy Magnussen's Paulie Walnuts so boring? He stole every scene on ""The Sopranos"". Here he does nothing.""The Sopranos"". So many great lines. So many great scenes. You can watch YouTubes of them for hours without getting bored.

I do not have HBO so I have never seen an episode of The Sopranos-I know, shocking-so I'm sure that fans of the tv show will enjoy this movie more than I did. Here is what I understood: Michael Imperioli-Christopher Moltisanti-narrates the movie from the grave, literally. He died in the tv show and this takes place in the 1960's & 1970's and is more about his father, Alessandro/Dickie Moltisanti. The name Moltisanti translates into many saints and the Moltisantis are cousins to the Sopranos. Jon plays Johnny Soprano, the father of Michael/Tony Soprano-FYI: Michael is the actual son of James Gandolfini, in case you missed the name connection-and Vera plays Livia Soprano, Michael/Tony's mother. Ray plays Alessandro's father & uncle-yep, he plays twins. There are murders among the family members, as well as the wacking of other people-some people have volatile tempers-and there are incestuous situations. It also covers some turf wars with the Black community-this was the 60's-so there is language and attitudes that are inappropriate for the present day.It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours.It's not one that I would buy on DVD-remember, I've never seen an episode-but if you are a fan, it would probably be a good rental.",The Many Saints of Newark

20,snoozejonc,"Thoroughly enjoyed it but recommend rewatching episodes 'Down Neck', and 'For All Debts Public and Private' beforehand",9,23 September 2021,"'The Many Saints of Newark' (for me) is an excellent piece of Sopranos fan service with strong character moments and some quite memorable scenes.The plot is reasonably good as it covers a lot of ground in the lives of Dickie Moltisanti, Harold McBrayer, Giuseppina Bruno, the young Tony Soprano, Johnny Soprano Junior Soprano and Livia. The narrative is quite loose as it focuses key parts of Dickie's life, some influential moments on Tony's, plus the racial tensions of the time. There is enough material to cover several episodes of a series and putting it all into one movie feels like I've only had a glimpse of several larger stories.I think it is important to have watched the series beforehand to have a full appreciation for everything. Episodes like the ones mentioned above, plus 'Kennedy and Heidi' from the final series were essential for my own enjoyment.There is a lot of strong character focus, particularly with the influence certain relationships and events have on future events depicted in the series. Most actors have the parts previously played by other actors nailed. I particularly enjoyed the performances of Vera Famiga and Corey Stoll as Livia and Junior.All the cast are superb and Alessandro Nivola leads it well. The presence of Michael Gandolfini does give it that extra edge of plausibility that you are actually seeing a young Tony because of that resemblance.I found it quite reminiscent of Scorsese movies. The use of a voiceover narrator for one (the identity of whom is brilliant), plus the character of Dickie reminded me a bit of Charlie from Mean Streets with his explicitly stated desire to do some good things whilst living a life of crime.As a lead character Dickie is written similarly to Tony as a complex individual finding his way through a brutal world. He is aware of right and wrong which is a source of conflict addressed in multiple scenes of dialogue much like The Sopranos.Visually it is very strong as it tells a story with great cinematography and editing. The opening and ending are absolutely fantastic. The music, narration, and imagery combine perfectly. There are also some incredibly well crafted moments of violence that stick with you long after.My favourite scenes are the ones that involve the family together, such as the dinner table sequence with Christopher as a baby and Johnny's homecoming. I also love every scene that involves Livia.Not everything works for me. There are one or two key moments I personally find a bit contrived to push the plot in a certain direction. I won't spoil, but they involve a situation that eventually provokes violence from a character. They are not badly made in any way, just for me a bit out of left field.I'll be honest and admit to being a biased fan of the show and find it tough to rate. As a stand-alone-alone movie I put it at 8/10. As an episode of the Sopranos I think it would be a 9/10. I'll go in the middle with an 8.5.I hope David Chase writes and produces another movie because he has wet the appetite with a glimpse of the characters at this stage of life, but not really given enough to fully satisfy. I guess a lot may come down to the financial success of this movie.",The Many Saints of Newark
21,kluseba,Clashing emotions in a changing world,7,14 October 2021,"The Many Saints of Newark is a crime drama serving as a prequel to the series The Sopranos. Even if you aren't familiar with the series, this film is certainly worth a try for genre fans.The movie revolves around the childhood and adolescence of Tony Soprano, the child of an American-Italian crime family. He explores betrayal and loyalty, doubts and trust, joy and sorrow, embitterment and reconciliation, life and death among family members and friends.This film convinces on many levels. First of all, the soundtrack, settings and clothings bring the sixties and seventies back to life in authentic fashion and provide atmospheric depth.Up next, the different characters are very distinctive and profound. We observe innocent children looking up to their family members, frustrated mobsters who are attempting to gain freedom, influence and reputation and old-fashioned gangsters who don't make any compromises and don't take any prisoners.The movie features several subplots which add much diversity. It follows the complicated relationship of an Italian immigrant with her violent husband, a mobster who has to go to prison and leave his family behind for four years and a family man who makes many enemies while trying to become the leader of the mobsters.However, there are also a few elements that could have been improved. Some characters could have been given some additional background information in form of flashbacks.Up next, the movie mostly focuses on dialogues but a few more explosive scenes might have added some action and tension at appropriate times.Still, The Many Saints of Newark is a good to very good gangster movie that can compete with other recent releases such as The Irishman. The atmosphere, characters and subplots are certainly the highlights and leave room for potential sequels. Newcomers might be interested in watching the television series as well after discovering this film while fans of the series might think that the movie is at times lacking depth and precision. If you like this kind of movie, let me warmly recommend you the similar Mafia Inc. Released two years ago in Quebec.",The Many Saints of Newark
22,valleyjohn,The film doesn't do the TV show justiice,7,9 October 2021,"I loved the Sopranos . I watched it religiously and followed the exploits of Tony Soprano and his friends and family religiously, so when the trailer for The Many Saints of Newark popped up , I was really excited but did the movie live up to my expectations?Not really .The film reveals the humanity behind Tony's struggles and the influence his family - especially his uncle, Dickie Moltisanti - had over him becoming the most iconic TV mob boss of all time.Don't get me wrong , I enjoyed this film but for me , it never really took off.It actually feels like the Prequel to a prequel.What I mean by that is , it sets the viewer up for what it to come in Anthony Sopranos life and maybe we will see that in the next film .This is all about Tony's Uncle Dickie Moltisanti .A man who will kill family members without thinking. He oozes charisma and that has an affect on Tony .It's good to see some characters from the TV show as younger people and it's done very well . Especially Vera Farmiga who plays Livia Soprano. She gets her personality spot on.Ray Liota is great too .Michael Gandolfini who plays Tony Soprano ( James Gandolfini's actual son ) isn't convincing enough in the role and at no time did I feel he was the Tony from the TV show .The main problem is the story isn't interesting enough. It's a typical gangster style film with the cliched set pieces and that's fine but I wanted a little bit more .All in all the film had great characters and cast but the story felt flat .Let's hope the next one is more dynamic.",The Many Saints of Newark

24,rgkarim,The Many Elements Of Newark Make It Not A Bad Prequel,7,1 October 2021,"LIKES:The Story:
I'm not the best person to engage in this story accuracy to the series as I have to watch more of the show given how young I was when it was on. Still, from the movie alone, the story is not so bad and feels very much like a mafia drama fitting to match with the other movies I've seen. There is the shady business dealings, the rat finks/traitors mixing stuff up in a climb for power, the effects on the family, and even the love affairs that all get wrapped up into the these types of tales. The Saints of Newark is not afraid to get its hands dirty to give you the horror of the life in the mob and the pressures that come with running the family, which I did like. Even more appreciative is the multiple angles that we got to see the chaos unfold, not just from the aspect of future Tony. It's that element that sort of immerses you into film and does a nice job of helping connect pieces for newcomers like me.The Character usage:
Again, cannot comment on the accuracy or matching of the younger counterparts to their older selves, but I nod my hat at using many of the characters in a meaningful way. Newark's cast is quite large for a movie, but within it are plenty of well used moments, time, and interactions that draw up the pasts of our future leading characters. Tony's dances with the devil of crime and power are dashed throughout the entirety of the movie, giving you a taste of the conflicting mindset that comes with such pressures. Dickie's ever changing mindset and lifestyle is given lots of time on screen, acting as large foundational pillars for him to support the other elements of the film. You want rival gangs and the pawns who get used, Harold is there to give you that aspect intertwining with the rising power of the 70s. You've got a full immersive property presented in this film and again for newcomers it's nice to have so many characters with meaning.The Costume and Setting:
I'm a sucker for bringing me back to the past and totally immersing me into the world. Newark's team of set pieces, filming, and costumes again brought the decades of the 60s and 70s back to life and embedded the spirit of the times into the film. You felt like you were a part of the history in the making during some events on profile, while on the other side you get to just enjoy the fashions that were a big part of the world we knew back then. Other elements from the car models to the television designs were given their moments to shine and helped again bring the family traditions back from the dead for just that moment. It's a nice world that was crafted and perhaps the high point for me in this film.The Music:
It fits with the setting piece mentioned above, but plenty of music to bathe your ears in and appreciate the talents of artists past. Jazz and the Big Bands are all ready for you to dive into during the family celebrations and personal jumps. As the times change and the public opens up, we get hit with the songs of the decades and the power they bestowed. Sure, it's a bit cheesy, but you know what... it works to give you the emotional heat of the situation.The Action:
It's not the most run and gun, or kung fu fighting I like, but... it again fits in the setting of the movie. The Many Saints of Newark has a few fights that hold the same atmosphere of the Mafia battles that are famously noted in history. Vicious, merciless, and careless who is in the crossfire, these dances of shot guns and hand guns have a realistic air to them. Grounded fights of using cover stick to how these fights probably played out, as family vs. Family tried to take one another down. There is some anguish in those souls who take the gun, and that added bit of humanity, alongside the lack of safety for any character, is a nice element to stick to the hush hush nature of the crime family.Acting:
I can't comment on how well they capture the essence of the characters, and to that you'll need to find other fans to explain. However, the movie does get nods for some good performances in the Mafia family business. I don't want to call out any names, but most of the group nails the vantage point of a mafia family. From the exceptional mobsters who taunt death with their bold moves for money, to the crushed spirits of the family members ingrained in the darkness, they all hit their marks quite well for this reviewer. Several of the female actresses really captivated how miserable life as a mob wife could do, while Odom Jr's animosity towards the abusers holds its own nature. Anyway, there are some weaker performances, but even these feel diluted by the quality acting of the main cast.DISLIKES:
Many Plots feel like teasers:
Perhaps it's due to my inexperience with the series, or perhaps it's something more. I'm not sure, but this movie felt like it only gave us glimpses of the bigger tale and fully fleshing out the values. You might say, ""No kidding, but in a movie you only have so much time!"" I agree, which is why I understand the Sopranos were a series as opposed to one solid movie. That is very evident in this film, as many other of those supporting elements feel they are in need of more time, more detail, and intertwining to really pop out and reach full potential. Sure, there is enough to give you the gist, but for full on storytelling in this caliber, episodes were needed not just movies.A Bit Boring:
I'll come out and say it, The Sopranos to me is not the movie that moves to the quickest beat of the drum. Those episodes occurring weekly worked because you had time to take breaks and get the story, predicting and figuring out what factors were going to come to play next in that soap opera fashion. In this film, those factors are missing for me and that means slower pace and set up that need a few bouts of fighting, chasing, and snooping to get to the truth to help jazz things up.Side Stories That Might Not Have Been Needed:
The category explains itself, but I think there were small arcs, jokes, and pokes at the series that seemed irrelevant to casual viewers like me. Some of the tandems taken by this series feel like they are alluring to something, but due to time constraints again feel kind of off for me and in the way of other things that could have been exciting to see. In particular were the amount of time we found ourselves in the riots, which though has the elements needed and bring that culture factor in, did little for the story in the time we had for this film. Those tangents kind of felt just out of place and I would have liked more time with exploring the opportunities. This was especially true with Ray Liotta's character, who though has a bit more depth toward the moral ambiguity of Dickie's life, is done in an odd way that does not quite hit home for me.The VERDICT:
The Many Saints of Newark has a lot of good about it for this reviewer who is still a rookie in the world of the Sopranos. Straight up, it's a layered, immersive mob story where one dives back into the past to uncover the story of the well-known family. It's got the looks, the feel, and the music to trick your brain back to the past, with strong acting to further help force the bravado and persona of this very dark drama. The action works for the movie, thought it does need more, but fortunately the multiple aspects of the film work well for this reviewer. Yet, the movie shows why we had the Sopranos as a series, because it needs time to fully get the story right and help the pace not be as slow in this movie. In regards to the side stories, there are events they explain and introduce, but the time and number of deviations from the main plot takes away from the story and not adds on. Overall it's okay, but this one is more of a home view for me to be honest than at the theaters. My scores are:Crime/Drama: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.",The Many Saints of Newark

26,vengeance20,Below Mediocre,4,24 September 2021,"So... having not seen The Sopranos but have heard much about the TV Show I sort of went into this film blind, but technically this is a Prequel so I guess this is the first Film to that TV Show. I have however, seen bits & pieces of the TV Show, but that's it!The film basically tell the story of how Tony Soprano became who he was & sees the gangster life through the 60's to the 70's play out with multiple sub-plots.I found the film to be quite mediocre compared to the trailer which made the film seem better than what it was. While there was some viscous action scenes, they were sadly too few & far between & there was too many characters, sub plots & elements all to take in for 1 hour & 54 minutes. Remember, I've never seen the TV Show, but then again this is a prequel, either way, it's confusing & dare I say boring for the most part. Too many story arcs went nowhere & the plot itself was too all over the place to follow.Overall, it's not a great film & lacks actions even though there was some in it.4/10.",The Many Saints of Newark
27,elliotjeory,I watched for the Easter eggs,3,2 October 2021,"I liked some of the in joke references to the TV show but apart from that it was a waste. The only character I liked was Lyvia and young Tony.The story is wasted on a non existent character in the Soprano's universe called Harold. Apparently they had a war with The Soprano's in the 70's and killed a made guy but this is never discussed in The Soprano's TV show because it never happened.They had a war with New York I believe which would of been a whole lot better and more authentic.The actor who played Paulie Walnuts gave an underwhelming performance, but he had big shoes to fill. Also Ray Liotta playing two different characters could easily lead to confusion.Also the reveal of who was behind the Dickie hit wasn't believable given the trivial reason as shown in the film.Like other reviewers have said, this should of been a TV series, there are too many characters with little depth to them to make it convincing and likeable.I do however have to praise Vera Farmiga's role as Lyvia Soprano, it's the best one.",The Many Saints of Newark

Alessandro Nivola as Dickie was good but you don't need much range for brutal crime boss lol.Overall this is a weak 4 outta of 10, meaning total drivel!",The Many Saints of Newark
29,leftbanker-1,Did the Writers of this Bomb Ever Watch The Sopranos?,1,2 October 2021,"There was absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing to like in this film. Period.So, you make a movie to cash in on the popularity of a TV series about gangsters and you focus on a character who had nothing to do with the story in the series and then you focus on that guy's mistress? Who wrote this? Did they even watch The Sopranos? It seemed like a lay-up to make at least a watchable film about how Tony and his gang rose up through the ranks, but instead we are served a sloppy mess about a rival Black gang and a character who was barely mentioned in the series.Is the lesson we take away from this to never make a movie about a TV series? Or is the lesson not to take the least interesting thing about that series and make the movie about that? In this case, the least interesting thing was Tony's relationship with his mother. The truth is that I have no idea what this movie is about because it barely made any sense, and it was never worth watching.There wasn't one single scene or one bit of dialogue that was memorable, and forget about anything being iconic. The violence was boring and had no tension or menace attached to it. Young Tony highjacks an ice cream truck? Was that supposed to be an origin story? It was just stupid.",The Many Saints of Newark
30,Jeremy_Urquhart,"If you accept it's not going to be quite as good as the show, and know beforehand Michael Gandolfini isn't the main character, there's some good stuff here.",7,9 November 2021,"As far as films that extend the stories already told by critically acclaimed tv shows that are no longer running, I'd rank Many Saints of Newark over El Camino, but under The Deadwood Movie.As Australia has had to wait a while for this to come to cinemas, and seeing as we don't have HBO Max here either, I've already seen plenty of reviews and opinions on this movie, so don't really feel like I can add a lot. A common criticism has been how many references and callbacks there are to the show, which I don't fully feel the same way about- I thought they were kind of entertaining, in all honesty, even if they sometimes weren't very subtle.Another complaint has been that this could have or should have been a miniseries rather than a 2-hour movie, and I kind of agree. There's a lot of story here and it sometimes feels a tad rushed, and some characters - old and new - are really interesting and are played by very good actors, but aren't given heaps of time to shine.I will say, while not equal long the greatness of the show by any means, this is still a very engaging and entertaining crime movie. The world feels very authentic to the show, and while some may find all the younger versions of familiar characters gimmicky, I had a lot of fun with that aspect of the movie.Alessandro Nivola is really good in the lead role, creating, in under two hours, an interesting lead character who was only ever talked about a few times in the show. Vera Farmiga also nailed the role of Tony Soprano's mother.Add to all that a fantastic soundtrack and you've got a moderately satisfying crime film that while not amazing or anything entirely new, should provide a good deal of entertainment for most Sopranos fans. It leaves open the idea of future stories for David Chase and co, too, should they decide they have more of this world they want to explore.",The Many Saints of Newark
31,drjgardner,Awful with strokes of genius,2,9 October 2021,"Mid- way through the film, bored out of my skull, I began to wonder why this film was so bad. The acting was great and the subject as one I loved dearly - The Sopranos. What went wrong? First I think a man who takes 6 seasons to do a series probably isn't the best person to do a 2 hour film. Next, the film has no real focus and skips around, as did the series, but in the series there was time to circle back - here there isn't. Next, I was falsely led to believe the film was about Tony - it isn't. Tony is there, but he's hardly the focus. Kudos to little Tony, adolescent Tony, Vera Farmiga, Ray Liotta in jail (not the other one), and the guy who played little Stevie. And I admit there were about 4 or 5 scenes that were pure poetry. But a prequel to Sopranos - awful! Forget Sopranos, and lower my expectations and it's merely a bad film. That's how it got a 2. 1 for Sopranos, 3 as a film, and 2 is the middle.",The Many Saints of Newark
32,bankofmarquis,"The ""non-Sopranos"" parts work much better",7,12 October 2021,"The new Sopranos prequel film THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK is a review-proof film. Most people fall into 1 of 2 camps.The first, fans of the 1999-2007 landmark HBO series that some (including myself) call one of the best TV series of all time. The folks that fall into this camp will be checking this film out no matter what.The second are folks that either never saw the series or have only a passing knowledge of it - these folks are (more than likely) gonna take a pass at this film.And both camps would be right and wrong for THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK is a middle-of-the-road film that will be satisfying for SOPRANOS fans, but the part of this film that really, really works well has nothing to do with the series.Written by Sopranos creator David Chase, TMSON is set in the late 1960's-early 1970's and tells the tale of a young Tony Soprano and his introduction to the North Jersey mafia and the charismatic mob boss who he is drawn to.The first 15 minutes of this film were written specifically for SOPRANOS fans for it is here that you are introduced to younger versions of many of your favorite characters. From Tony to Uncle Junior to Livia (Tony's Mom) to Pauly Walnuts, Silvio and ""Big Pussy"" they are all there - along with a few others you don't know (and it is not a spoiler to say, there is a reason that they never made it to the TV series). You are also introduced to Tony's Father Johnny Soprano, Mob Boss ""Hollywood"" Dick Moltisanti and the center of this film, the son of the Boss ""Uncle"" Dickie Moltisanti (father of future TV Series character Christopher).It's an enjoyable enough introduction, but it is nothing new. The characters sit around, talk, act tough and eat. Something that we've seen in countless mob movies before. Chase and Director Alan Taylor (THOR: THE DARK WORLD) appear somewhat bored with this part of the film - almost as if they are saying ""here they all are, enjoy this for we have a more interesting story to tell"". This first 15 minutes of the film seem to go on forever.And then the movie - and Chase's ideas and Taylor's Direction - kick in.And this is where TMSON begins to escalate as the story splits into 2 parts - the first following Dickie (Alessandro Nivola) and the 2nd following one of his ""runners"" (Leslie Odom, Jr.) who is destined to become a powerful boss of the ""Black Mafia"".It's a smart juxtaposition of story, but unfortunately for SOPRANO's fans, the first story (following Dickie) and including most of the Soprano's characters is the less interesting of the 2 stories. It is the journey of Leslie Odom, Jr.'s character that makes for a more compelling story. It is as if Chase had an interesting idea for a mob film but knew he would not be able to get it made unless he tied it somewhat to a Sopranos story.Leslie Odom Jr. Is magnetic as Harold McBrayer, the former numbers runner for Dickie that has an awaking through the Black Power movement of the late '60's and becomes a formidable mob boss in his own right. This half of the movie/story is intriguing and interesting for you never know in what direction it is going to land. This ""B"" story is free to be whatever it wants/needs to be and this freedom elevates it.The same cannot be said for the ""A"" story - the journey of Dickie Moltisanti. Alessandro Nivola is charming enough as this sadistic, sociopathic mobster, but he is saddled with too much TV show baggage to become a character on his own. Specifically his mentorship and (ultimate) disassociation with the young Tony Soprano (played by Michael Gandolfini, the son of the late James Gandolfini who played Tony in the TV series). I felt like these characters were burdened with the weight of the TV show and the need to pay homage to what will be coming in their lives via the TV show and to shoehorn in each character along the way.Consequently some great actors like Vera Farmiga (Tony's mother Livia), Jon Bernthal (Tony's father), and Corey Stoll (as Uncle Junior) are all filming extended cameos. They do a good (enough) job bringing the essence of the characters from the TV Series to this film, but they just don't have enough to do. I would love for these 3 to spin-off on their own.The same can be said for Billy Magnussen (Pauly), John Magaro (Silvio) and Samson Moeakiola (Big Pussy). They all do a nice job bringing the younger versions of these characters to life (especailly Magaro) but they just don't have enough to do.And then there is Ray Liotta's over-the-top performance as Mob Boss ""Hollywood"" Dick Moltisanti. Ove-the-top doesn't even begin to describe the performance he is giving. I will give him credit, though, he does tone it down about 1/2 way through the film, but...geez...the first part...wow.Ultimately, the failure of the ""A"" story to captivate dooms this movie to mediocre status. I would have loved for Chase to really sink his teeth into the ""B"" story - and to let Leslie Odom Jr. Really fly as a character and and actor.But that would have defeated the purpose of making a Sopranos prequel - a prequel that, perhaps, shouldn't have been made in the first place.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Many Saints of Newark
33,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,HBO sunk below Netflix,1,3 October 2021,"I have appreciated HBO productions in the past. They are one of the oldest, if not the oldest quality adult oriented television producers. But this film sunk far below what I would have expected from even Netflix.All of the Italian mobsters in this film are cartoonish man babies acting out public tantrums. None of these characters have any class and finesse. None are remotely interesting. Character development is totally absent. I cannot see the slightest effort at a good screenplay. The pacing is off. Attention is taken away from the main characters with a black gangster side story.I am not blaming the actors because you do have amazing talents in this film. But it all goes to waste with overexaggerated portrayals.The Extras 3 minute clip is hilarious. The way they justify the director's decisions; it's cringe. This is truly an insult to the original show and it's cast members. This film should have never been made.",The Many Saints of Newark
34,bob-the-movie-man,Sopranos prequel that failed to hit the high note with this Sopranos virgin.,6,5 October 2021,"With Bond showing on virtually every screen of my local Cineworld, there were few other choices for movies to go see this week. So even though I've never seen ""The Sopranos"" TV series, I decided to give this movie prequel a shot.Positives:
Like any good mafia story, there's a nicely developed sense of place for the action. The film is set in the late 60's / early 70's, and the score and the production design nicely portray the period. The rise of black factions to challenge the white status quo, even in the crime world, make this a nice companion piece to ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" .Although he's been in films like ""American Hustle"" and ""Selma"", I wouldn't have been able to pick Alessandro Nivola out of a line-up. But he did a great job portraying the different sides of Dickie: both caring uncle and psychopathic gangster. And Odom Jnr is again impressive: I've not yet seen him deliver any role that's been sub-par.It's also impressive that they had Michael Gandolfini to play the younger self of his late father's role. Although I kept being distracted by how much he looks and acts like a young John Cusack!Negatives:
The story is told over many years and the script came across as quite uneven. There are regular cut-aways to Dickie visiting his uncle ""Hollywood Dick"" (Ray Liotta) in prison, which a lot of the time, to me, felt disconnected from the main plot.Whilst most of the ensemble cast do a good job, some of the portrayals felt like forced caricatures of ""Goodfellas"" characters.As a ""Sopranos"" virgin, I could tell that there were lots of Easter Eggs and in-jokes in the movie (e.g. The baby Christopher crying whenever Anthony talked to him). WIth ""Sopranos"" regulars Alan Taylor and David Chase in charge, that's not surprising. But I'm afraid all of these went right over my head.Summary Thoughts on ""The Many Saints of Newark"": This wasn't a complete bust for me, which it might have been if it had been a sequel rather than a prequel. Indeed there are the occasional flashes of brilliance with certain scenes. But neither did I find it so engrossing that it's going to trouble my top 20 for the year.I guess is that if you are a ""Sopranos"" fan, then you would get a lot more out of this than I did. But it's still an interesting way to spend a couple of hours.(For the full graphical review, please check out #oemannsmovies on the web, Facebook or Tiktok. Thanks.)",The Many Saints of Newark

After reading the mixed reviews of this movie, and based on the slate of actors in the movie, I decided I'd give it a watch and I did.I of course disagree with those who lambasted the movie. It wasn't long after the movie started that I felt it was going to be a good prequel movie. At the end I felt it was, and the closing tune that played as credits roll off the screen, was icing on the cake; I love Leonard Cohen's song 'Woke up this morning'.

But how many times can we stand up and cheer just because somebody murmurs ""there's Paulie!"" or ""How's it going, Sil?""The one thing this movie does not offer, ironically enough, is a coming of age story for Tony Soprano. He's a little kid for the first forty-five minutes. And when he does get mean and dangerous, it's usually childish showing off rather than a real sign of genius on the rise. (The ice-cream truck holdup actually reminded me of a much better scene in LAND OF THE LOST!) None of this is to dis Michael Gandolfini, who shows real acting ability in the quieter moments. I would say the best scene in the film was when young Tony is begging his mother to think about getting some help for her depression. And the second best scene was when young Janice it talking to young Tony at the funeral.But please, no more shout outs to Paulie and our gang. I know their names, fellas. I've seen the show!",The Many Saints of Newark

He does look and sound like his dad. I think he did a great job. He was very watchable and I was disappointed that he didn't get more screen time. I think he could do well as an actor if he chooses that path. For him never having watched The Sopranos and never acting before I was impressed at the performance he turned in. I think it's very touching that he was able to portray his dad in this movie. If James could have seen this I'm sure he would've been bursting with pride.

Michael Gandolfini had a really strong presence in THE DEUCE, which I recently watched all the way through - this made me think he'd have a really strong leading role in this film, but man, was I wrong - he barely has a role in this movie at all; a very minimal amount of dialogue and really no relevant scenes whatsoever.The main problem is that ALL of these characters are unmemorable and uninteresting, so naturally, the performances float in the same dull realm. This is the easiest way to make any movie or show bad.There are a few killing sequences that might stick with you, but compared to the entire history of mafia movies outside of this, you'll see nothing you haven't already seen done 10x better in the past.I really don't know what to say other than there is almost no redeeming value here - I can't think of any reason why anyone should watch this movie, unless, like, your homie was in it or something.",The Many Saints of Newark
44,Mike_Devine,Impossible to compare to its source material,5,2 November 2021,"Before there was the story of HBO's six-season Italian-American crime drama series there was the story of Dickie Moltisanti and 'The Many Saints of Newark.' The prequel film takes us back in time to the unfriendly streets of New Jersey's most populous city, where rival gangs stoked fear and animosity in their quest for power and dominance.While many have tried to compare 'Newark' with its original source material, it's virtually impossible to size up 86 episodes of one of television's most epic drama series with a two-hour theatrical (and streaming) release that barely has any overlap in the cast. For one, 'Newark' tries to pack a lot of details into a relatively short runtime, but somehow ends up feeling hollow and lifeless. Sure, it's unique that Michael Gandolfini (James' son) portrays young Tony here. And yes, it's cool to see familiar characters show up a few decades earlier. But even this A-list cast is not able to capture the magic that so many fans were expecting.If you separate yourself from the 'Sopranos' universe and look at this film in isolation, there may be more of a case to be made for it being a quality gangster drama. But it's impossible to do so, meaning 'Newark' is destined to become an afterthought in the saga's history.",The Many Saints of Newark

director: Alan Taylor
starring: Alessandro Nivola, Leslie Odom Jr, Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, Ray Liotta, Michela De Rossi, Michael Gandolfini, Vera FarmegaYoung Anthony Soprano is growing up in one of the most tumultuous eras in Newark's history, becoming a man just as rival gangsters begin to rise up and challenge the all-powerful DiMeo crime family's hold over the increasingly race-torn city. Caught up in the changing times is the uncle he idolizes, Dickie Moltisanti, who struggles to manage both his professional and personal responsibilities and whose influence over his nephew will help make the impressionable teenager into the all-powerful mob boss we'll later come to know Tony Soprano. This for me was a massive disappointment.My first few positives would be the cinematography and set pieces. As well as the chemistry between the cast, background into gang culture and the performances. This film was visually creative and really played around with contrasting almost peaceful and normal settings and then with the characters dying and the use of colour really adding a sharp contrast. There were some creative long and mid shots used very effectively within certain scenes as well. I also did like the set locations as well; they really bought the 60's and 70's aesthetic to life and it was charming and fascinating to see the culture and how everything looked in the past. I also liked the background into how different gang cultures worked and how the people interacted with each other. It was all about sustaining power and it was very private, and the film went into a good amount of detail into how gangsters and conflicting gangs interacted with each other at the time. I also thought the performances were strong from
the whole cast. Alessandro Nivola, vera Farmega and Michela Rossi. Who all delivered charming yet powerful and complex performances that really bought their characters to life. It also helped that the whole cast had fantastic chemistry and their relationships felt authentic and were fun to watch as the family dynamics were explored.My first few negatives would be the annoying voiceover, inconsistent pacing. As well as a lack of main character and lack of emotional connection, and unneeded conflict. For me the voiceover used was very annoying and unnecessary. It rushed over important information or was spoon feeding the audience information that could have been told in the present. I also thought the pacing was inconsistent and all over the place. There were parts that felt random and completely rushed over, and then a large chunk of the film completely dragged. I found myself losing interest on many occasions and the film struggled to win it back. For me as well there was an unclear main character. Yes, it was Dicky, but my point is the cast was way too big and the film would constantly jump between all these different characters it became difficult and just boring to keep up with it all. And considering its a film about Tony soprano he was hardly even in the film. I also felt a lot of the conflict felt unneeded and felt added for the sake of it. There was a lack of context and randomness to a lot of the arguments between the characters, it became tiring to keep up with and the lack of attention with the writing was on full display. I also had a complete emotional disconnect. I wasn't sure if the film was supposed to make you feel bad for the characters, but they achieved the complete opposite. The character deaths were sudden and executed in a strange and anticlimactic way that really didn't connect with me emotionally to the characters.My final few positives would be the dark and mysterious tone. Some good action, a solid script, and finally some decent character development. I liked how dark and shocking the film was. Especially with how it explored racial conflict at the time, there was a lot of scenes that were tough to watch and the film wasn't afraid to hold back, I also liked it had a classic gangster mysterious tone, it really hammed up all the accents and bought a lot of the genre tropes and made them fairly refreshing and they still worked. I also thought the action was good, it was hard hitting and shocking. And really provided a lot of impact to the scenes keeping the film entertaining. I also thought the script and the character development was solid. I think they crafted a good character study of Dicky and how he wanted to become a better man, but the pressures of his job and his family history got the better of him. As his influence on others became greater so did the tension between the gangs so his character was a bright spot for the film.My final few negatives would be the lack of depth to the themes, how predictable the film was and the unsatisfying ending. The film for me played it safe with its deeper themes. The themes on domestic abuse and racism for me felt more used for shock factor and should have had more of an integral purpose and depth. I also thought the film was predictable in a lot of places. The film made it obvious that some of the twists were going to happen therefore it took any form of surprise that the film was going for away, it made the film feel underwhelming and lacklustre. Finally, I thought the film ended in a very unsatisfactory way. It was very abrupt, and it killed off characters it didn't need to. Tony Soprano never really felt needed and therefore it the message the film was trying to convey fell flat.Overall, the many saints of Newark has a strong cast, plenty of style and a strong script. But if falls flat due to how messy and unfocused it was. Lacking the depth that was needed. The whole premise of the film was who made Tony Soprano? And in my opinion the film didn't answer that question.Overall score 57/100.",The Many Saints of Newark
48,solidabs,Just Bad,1,2 October 2021,Omg. I had so much hope for this. Any rating over a 3 is just plain idiotic. This was just a horrible movie. Whoever wrote this nonsense is garbage..,The Many Saints of Newark
49,EvanKevelson,Don't let marketing pull you in,3,1 October 2021,"Number 1 if there's no James Gandolfini RIP.... There's no Sopranos.Bringing younger versions of the ""Soprano Crew"" is an insult to the original ""Sylvio"" and other characters because there is minimal focus on them.Number 2: This movie is 100% about how and why Dickie Moltasanti coming home with TV trays.Even after it's shown, you're informed as to who gave the order...and maybe it's a long ""mystery"" as events surrounding Dickie unfold. Not clear 100% who pulled the trigger.Number 2 outside of Jr late 60s...
It's a prequel addressing the Dickie Moltasante story which is the prelude to Christopher (as something that weighted on the Christopher character from Season 1- till his demise....how much it impacted his fall to drug use as opposed to simply masking the horrific garbage he did as a gangster as a fan is irrelevant).Number 3 this takes place before ""Tony"" , Jackie, Sylvio, and Big Pussy even rip off the ""Feech"" poker game.It's a gangster movie that outside of character labels has nothing to do with the show.This is not the DeNiro scenes in GF II. This is brilliantly marketed garbage to sell tickets that will have a huge opening weekend and likely nosedive out of theaters very quickly.",The Many Saints of Newark
50,coombsstephen,A good film that stands on its own,7,24 September 2021,"Really enjoyed this film and, even though I liked the sopranos, I thought this film was enjoyable anyway.The story was good and the plot thick with the gangster theme you would expect. There are some gruesome parts but that's to be expected.Made me want to watch the series again.",The Many Saints of Newark
51,Darkjak007,You got yourself a gun,6,2 October 2021,"The Many Saints of Newark is The prequel to the TV series the Sopranos. It follows the story of how Tony soprano(Michael Gandolfini) was motivated into join the Dimeo crime family,his relationship with his uncle Richard Moltasanti(Alessandro Nivola)the father of Christopher Moltasanti from the series. It Worth noting that despite that description the movie it's not really much about Tony, but more or less the people in his life that shape him from his mother to his uncles and his father. It was poorly market that it's about Tony but it not. It more about his uncle. Which It's a good idea given how much these characters are brought up to Tony his life in the show. Everything unfolds Primarily through Richard as Tony has always idolize him and mentioned him multiple times. However while it does try to be it's own standalone it does feel like as though to appreciate it more you would have to have seen a fair amount of the show otherwise it feels like you wouldn't really care as much about most of his people. Such as Silvio and Paulie they don't really do much in the movie but they're there. Many the characters do a good job While Richard is essentially a mirror image of Tony of how he ends up from his affairs to his self hatred. You don't really get much more on his backstory then wants giving. Ray Liotta is also in the movie, always a plus to have a star like him in your gangster movie. Without getting much spoilers he essentially plays two rolls. At first I was wondering what was really the point other than they wanted Ray in the movie twice if you look closely there is actually something there, because he's one of the interesting highlights of the movies. It doesn't really seem like he's gonna do much. It's clearly meant to be a mirror comparison to the therapy sessions that Tony has in the show . Vera Farmiga is also good as Tony's mom it's up as a bitter sort of non-supportive and non-encouraging mother. Corey Stoll was a decent Junior. Of course have to talk about Tony himself when he is in the movie he is enjoyable. While you can see that well he's not really in the game yet, you can tell he's going down that path. Even if you don't know who's Tony soprano it really does help get that image from Michael as his dad he looks just like him and he does have a quite a few moments in the movie. However even if it being told in the eyes of his elders, it would be nice that with given the length of this movie just a couple more scenes were given to Tony. The sub plot with Harold(Leslie Odom Jr) this black guy who used to work for Richard in the 60s. Who looking to make it big It does introduce a conflict in the movie, but overall it doesn't feel like it gets resolved by the end of the movie. It just doesn't come full circle and what you probably would probably expect from it doesn't happen. The film it's leave you wanting more in away but it feels like it abruptly ends and still has something else to be told.",The Many Saints of Newark
52,ilovefoodcoma,Poor scripts & poor acting.,6,5 October 2021,Poor scripts & poor acting. The storyline is not interesting. And they are going to have sequel...?,The Many Saints of Newark
53,Screen_O_Genic,Mob Life,8,22 October 2021,"Promoted as featuring the origin of Tony Soprano ""The Many Saints of Newark"" is more about mob life and the times in the 1960s-1970s. Featuring the familiar cast of the hit TV series during their younger years the film is the regular tale of Italian-American life and the Mafia with good doses of crime, violence, murder, sex and what have you. The ads of the film are a misnomer as this is more about Dickie Moltisanti than young Anthony Soprano with the late James Gandolfini's son miscast as the latter. Good acting and a decent pace keep this watchable and save it from being a disappointment with its annoying pc/multicult eyesore and prosaic plot. Considering the myriad possibilities the story could have gone this would have been best as a TV series. While this won't be on your Top 10 gangster flicks it's worth the watch for film fans.",The Many Saints of Newark
54,darkreignn,Incomprehensible and narratively scatterbrained,3,25 October 2021,"Yeah, I didn't like this movie. Spurts of graphic violence throughout do make for some entertaining viewing (as always), but other than that ""The Many Saints of Newark"" is as incomprehensible a gangster film as any I've ever seen.The film moves from scene to scene, from plot thread to plot thread, seemingly without a narrative anchor to tie everything together. One scene shows a woman cheating on her boyfriend with a man you see her say one sentence to in the beginning of the film; when was further contact established between them? And how did this contact turn to romance? What were their motivations, and why were they willing to take such a risk? The movie never tells. Another scene shows young Tony Soprano stealing an ice cream truck to give free ice cream to children. Besides giving kids free ice cream, was there any other motivation behind this? And were there any repercussions? Your guess is as good as mine. In ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" scenes don't feel like they lead into each other - instead, things just happen.The movie stars Alessandro Nivola as Dickie Moltisanti. Truth be told, Alessandro is genuinely great as Dickie, and he is a legitimately compelling character - I only with the film had a more intriguing storyline to follow. Dickie loves his nephew, Tony Soprano, constantly showering him with gifts and praises. Perhaps this film will be an origin story of Tony, depicting how his uncle got him into the family business? Nope, that's not it. At some point Dickie finds himself in the crosshairs of a rival African-American gang. I got it! ""The Many Saints of Newark"" is going to be a high-octane drama film about racial tensions and gang warfare. Huh, that's not it either! So what is this movie about? Again, your guess is as good as mine.As random things happen in this movie, at the least you'll be treated to a handful of good performances. Jon Bernthal is good here, though I am biased as a huge fan of his. Michael Gandolfini is actually surprisingly good as Tony - he is very subdued and intentional in the role, and I really wish he had a bigger part to play than he does. Ray Liotta is very good here and steals every scene he's in, especially when he's in jail (you'll understand when you see it). He speaks with power and purpose, and again, I wish he had a much bigger part to play.There's some cool action here, but not nearly enough to keep you invested throughout the painfully slow two-hour running time. At points playing out more like a parody of an Italian mafia-film, ""The Many Saints of Newark"" tries to pull viewers in with its melodrama, but a scatterbrained, unfocused plot and a weak script only manage to hinder what should've been the next classic gangster film.",The Many Saints of Newark

But I liked most of the show, and this new movie seemed promising with its top cast.I think it did a good job of being a movie with its own stuff going on. The winks and nods to the series taking second place. The movie is more about the character Dickie moltisanti and the 60's race riots. But when some of those old characters appear as younger actors and everything they're pretty much bang on.Much like the series. The ending takes a sharp left turn that I'm not so sure about.

Plus the fact that jr took out dickie was pretty mind blowing
Goes along with him always being bitter and seeking revenge, crazy how at one point he wanted to take out Tony even, jr was a evil manI liked the dysfunctional side they show of Johnny and Livia.

59,helenahandbasket-93734,Very Much Meh....,2,6 October 2021,"This could have been so great- instead it feels more like a cash grab by Chase.Had this been developed into a miniseries I think it would have been so much better- but as it stands, there's too much character introduction, timeline holes from the series, lack of character introduction, and so many plots and storylines it's very hard to keep track.MOST of the main players are introduced- some barely at all- where was Jackie Aprile? His brother Richie, Tony's cousin Tony B, Hesch, etc.? There's a minuscule intro to Jackie, but this was someone who Tony grew up with, but he's barely seen.There's way too much falling back on nostalgia to be bothered with developing storylines that are consistent with what many of the strong Sopranos fans would expect for this. For some reason, Chase seems to think we'd be so tickled with his insanely unnecessary Easter Eggs that we'd completely overlook a lack of story development. But then again, this is the same guy who can't pat himself on the back enough for the end of the series he feels was just so clever. Still.I'll give a few accolades for some work that went well beyond anything we could have hoped for- Vera Farminga. My God, did she do her homework into Nancy Marchand's character or what? There were a few times that I had to rewind the movie to hear what was said after she made a comment because I was so taken aback by her uncanny portrayal that I burst into laughter. It really was like listening to Livia as a young woman. Also a warm round of applause for Corey Stoll as Coratto (uncle June) while the mannerisms and accents weren't as dead on as Farminga's, he absolutely nailed the portrayal by Chianese of neurotic, selfish and chip-on-his-shoulder ignorance. I felt like the sheer size of Corey was far too large and a bit distracting but he managed to make the character fit inside his too large frame.Michael does a decent job as his younger father, but I didn't get the feeling by look or act that there was no one else worthy of carrying out this part. It was nice to see him get the gig, but I saw nothing of the neurosis beginning to develop that led us to what Tony became later in life.And there's almost zero development of Johnny Soprano- this is the biggest absence felt, I feel of this movie. So much more could have been developed here, and there's absolutely no way you'll convince us that Johnny didn't have a bigger part in Anthony becoming the affable schmuck he did than some relationship cultivated poorly by Dickie.Not horrible, but definitely not the work we've come to expect from the Sopranos franchise- I'm sure there's many who will sing the praises and laud it as wonderful, but there's quite a few of us that felt disappointed and cheated out of a better movie.",The Many Saints of Newark
60,drunken_munki,Gandolfini would be ashamed of this,2,1 October 2021,"For me this hurts a lot to write, since 'The Sopranos' is my favorite show and something that I highly regard in terms of filmmaking, writing, and acting. I've seen the entire run maybe 10 times. I was excited when I heard this movie was in production.So how does it fare, in two words: It's terrible.Let's expand a little, some of the good parts. The casting is strong of many of the characters (but a let down for many others). The little winks and nods to the younger versions of characters we love and know are fun. The costumes and sets are great, and some of the period music too. The movie starts in the 60's and then skips forward.That's it, I'm sad to say; the rest is negative. The starting period feels like it is both too long in screen time, and then the time skip puts it all to waste. The 60's period is half filled with black people rioting and stealing crap, burning the city to the ground. The characters get one or two lines each, apart from Dicky (of the movie title) and his father.This plot closes out quickly and we see Tony Soprano's father get sentenced to jail time (they show a re-shot scene of the funfair arrest from the series); they didn't show the reasons and build up to why. This is also counter to the story in the show which shows Soprano coming home before the dinner was cold (i.e. No arrest). So this is mind boggling what kind of writing error this is and retcons the plot???We have some unknown black characters that take up a lot of screen time and have nothing to do with anything, I'm imagining this film was made to boot-strap a 5 part show on HBO about black gangs except without the subtlety and care to attention from 'The Wire', and make everything about race; I think I'll pass. What is worse is now the Italian mafia are now politically correct and aware of 2020's style racial politics. Black people freely walk into the headquarters of the Newark mafia above the pork store, fist bumping and hugging the Italian mobsters (they would have been violently racist and probably at least pulled their guns out on sight).This is as absurd as Electronic Arts making half the soldiers in their latest World War 2 first person shooter game from men into women. This is insulting to those who fought and lost their lives to fight the Nazis for our freedom. However in this movie, we have to sacrifice the characters for the sake of wokeness and PC nonsense that has nothing to do with a period drama. The believability of the characters goes out of the window.In Sopranos terms, with would be like taking the entire 'gay' plotline from Vito and deleting it because showing him being ostracised, and running/hiding, and later tortured and killed for being gay as 'too offensive'. Then instead, have him profess his love for Sil so they have a gay love affair; both divorse their wives; and then get married to each other with the blessings of Tony Soprano. The absurdity of this is self-evident if you know the characters. Fiction is a story told through the prism of the characters, not from political viewpoints of the publisher/network. Well if they didn't show the story how they did, we would have no idea how horrid it was in the Sopranos world; would we? Censoring plotlines, and muddying up the presentation does not make it better; it just makes it woke style virtue signalling, and factually incorrect, and breaks the delicate suspension of disbelief.Next up in my complaints; the time skip introduces nothing interesting. Some black people doing terrible poetry; Dicky was around the Soprano house while everyone waits for Johnny to come back from jail. More new black characters enter the film, no idea who they are and what this has to do with 'The Sopranos', a series about the Italian mafia.Some more irrelevant stuff happens, like teenage Tony Soprano stealing things. Goofing around. It's all very mundane. Can't say much about Michael Gandolfini, they didn't give him many lines; and half of the time when he does talk they edit so much gaudy music around it you can't hardly hear him say anything at all.One or two facts about Dicky make it out in the film, not very interesting really and not worth the wait. Especially since they sacrifice the integrity and memory of the series for it. Some other events happen such as the death of some important characters.The best segment of the movie is the Tony played by the young Galdolfini, guidance counselor and mother scenes in the school. This had shades of 'The Sopranos' in it. And here is the issue. The rest of the move is garbage with bad characters and no plot. BLM style stuff won't cut it for a gangster movie. So this is a missed opportunity where they should have based the entire piece around the teenage Tony Soprano, with the mafia world swallowing him into it, and taking us through all the influences to him via the characters we didn't see in the show (as well as the younger versions of those we know). With more screen time and a focussed story, I feel that Michael Gandolfini would be a breakaway star from this film. The plot about Dicky and the guy who plays him are very poor, but that's what we got.2/10 a disastrous watch for a 'Sopranos' fan; for anyone else who never cared for it, this might be a 1/10 as an irrelevant film about no period or group of people specifically, presented in an OK visual style but no story whatsoever.",The Many Saints of Newark
61,Lewis_Heather787,Meh,6,17 October 2021,"This film is the dictionary definition of an average/ok film. I'll add by saying this is coming from someone that never ever watched a single second of ""The Sopranos"", maybe thats a good thing or bad thing in this case.Alessandra Nivola is the best part of the film! If I'm being honest I'm not too sure if I've seen him in anything before but his face is sort of recognisable.... Mmmm.....anyway he is by far the best part of the film. It helps that he is also the centre piece / the glue of the film. Everything evolves around him and follows his journey as ""Dickie"". Fantastic performance, incredibly menacing when he has to be but can also be quite vulnerable and eerily calm in some very emotional scenes.Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll and Vera Farmiga are also great in their respect smaller roles within the film. Ohhhh also a shoutout definitely goes to Michela De Rossi, she was also great !!The directing and feel of the film is also well done by director Alan Taylor. Its definitely got that old ""Godfather"" esc mobster feel from the very first second of the film. Gritty, brutal at times and attempts to touch on some social issues of the time to.However even though there might be some good aspects to this film overall it is extremely bland, boring and dull in terms of story and character development/interactions. There were times during it where I got completely lost because certain details aren't explained well enough to fit into the film. It makes me think that they tried to squeeze in as much story/info as they could into the short 1hr 50 min runtime.Introductions to new characters that aren't explained, time jumps, multiple story threads that don't really go anywhere.....then the film ends with a bit of a whimper.I will admit though another reason why I found it hard to sometimes follow/understand is because I have absolutely no connection to the TV show. Maybe I don't need to have watched any of that to understand this film but maybe it would have helped. Who knows?60% out of 100 its ok/average, I have no intention of ever watching it again. Does it makes me want to now try the TV show......no not really. Its got a good central performance, some nice other characters but the story and character development is a bit all of the place.",The Many Saints of Newark

65,aleksanderk-95350,Messy false advertised film,3,2 October 2021,"This film was a complete mess from start to finish. It's basically a film about Dickie Moltisanti who is a terrible character. The film builds him up and expects and big climax with his death scene. I could care less he had no redeemable aspects and I see no explanation on how he influenced Tony Soprano. I was hoping to see more of Jon Bernthal as Johnny Boy Soprano. Unfortunately we barely get to see him throughout this whole film. Same goes for Ray Liotta he is barely in the film. He has this dumb twin brother storyline that is terrible. Also the Christopher narration made no sense and was very confusing throughout the film. Best part of this film was when it ended and we got to hear the Sopranos theme song. Young Sil, Paulie, and Pussy all looked horrible and reminded me nothing of the there original counterparts. Young Junior was the only one that felt alright.",The Many Saints of Newark

It's part is so stupid and shallow (let me use that word again) that I can barely connect him to the series' character besides the fact that he looks exactly the same!Following the line of resemblances, I can't understand how they thought that Jon Bernthal could do a good Tony's father, couldn't be more different, and his mother is also completely opposite looks (even though Vera Farmiga is probably one of the best performances in the movie).An absolute waste of potential, a boring, mediocre movie that doesn't do honor to the series and doesn't do good on it's own.",The Many Saints of Newark

70,arabnikita,Don't watch this if you love Sopranos,2,9 October 2021,"The Many Saints of Newark (2021)In order to understand this movie, it doesn't really matter if you have watched The Sopranos or not because nothing of essence really happens. This so called ""film"", or as I would call it two hours of nonsense, feels like a flat out desecration of the legendary TV Series. What's mind boggling is how are David Chase and Alan Taylor attached to this project that feels like a parody without any Italian Mafia style, familial substance or resemblance to the beloved show.The premise of the film was to portray the background of Tony Soprano but for some reason, he is in the movie for about 15 minutes. As it turns out, what actually made him become a crime boss was giving out some ice cream, having a phone call and throwing some speakers in the window. I was expecting to watch a strong prequel in the style of Goodfellas with some nuanced dialogue, strong characters and a genuine story that fits nicely into the theme of the series. Instead, the movie decided to focus on absolutely unrelated topics, pointless characters and a pathetic plot that literally carried no weight.I hold The Sopranos in the highest tiers of Television so this film was one of my most anticipated 2021 releases. Now, I think it was the worst thing that I have seen all year. Even if we do the impossible task of taking aside the lack of Tony in the film, the rest of the story is still a highly mediocre and boring affair. Yes, the actors are there and they can act so no disrespect there, but this barely feel like The Sopranos; maybe only on a microscopic level. I honestly couldn't believe what I was watching and couldn't stop wondering who was the target audience for this? If you love the show, stay far away; if you haven't seen the show, please don't judge it by this atrocity.Movies.shmovoes on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",The Many Saints of Newark

I loved the series and was looking very forward to this... does David Chase secretly hate Sopranos' fans? The series ending and now this...?Why are so many professional critics giving this below-average movie such high scores?

73,howboutthisone_huh,production design and cinematograpy is great,6,4 October 2021,"And that's about the only positive thing about this film. It has a lot of memory gems reflecting the period and tv series but missing everything else that made the sopranos great. For one, the sopranos was an original idea that diverted from the normal stereotypes you were used to being shown. Since almost the beginning of film there's been a demand for crime porn and franchises on different aspects of organized crime, and like most of life, the 2D version is often an unrealistic distortion. The sopranos however, reflected something different and unfortunately this film is a really poor homage to a great series and there are so many aspects that are done so poorly it's really disappointing. It's fun to watch though. They did a great job in design, matching the period and also the tv series but the writing is so bad, I wanted to turn off the sound. Yeah, I know david chase worked on this, but so what? How many great series have you seen just get run off a cliff towards the end as the fandom and money roll in? Or maybe the creativity and connection to viewers didn't have the mileage. Even the stones had to lay down at one point. But, What's next on the chopping block of exploitation, 'the wire'?So for example, the scene where this woman from tony's school starts talking about an intimate moment between tony and his mother that tony shared, they should have spliced in a chuck jones cartoon at that moment for all it did for the film. My head almost exploded during that scene because it wasn't just unrealistic but the direction it took reflected the whole movie. Having grown up with a psychotic bee from haides during almost the same period, that kind of incident would have thrown my mom into a rage that would have lasted months. The unwritten rule was, you don't talk about the family, and we weren't even italian mafioso. Again, I know david chase wrote this and created the characters, which makes it even more bizarre. And yeah, I think I am entitled to say that I know livia's character more than david chase because I lived with her for many years.",The Many Saints of Newark
74,patrickfilbeck,Should've been great,6,22 September 2021,"This prequel to the Sopranos has many good sides. The actors are almost all terrific, especially Nivola. Dickie is an interesting, multi-layered character and, in his ambivalent manner, an asset to the mafia cinema genre. Bernthal steals the show in almost every scene that shows him and Vera Farmiga is fantastic in her very own way of portraying an ambivalent Mafia wife. Otherwise, Ray Liotta plays as if Goodfellas had never stopped, even if the double cast sometimes seems a bit strange. Michael Gandolfini, the son of the main actor from the series, fits perfectly visually, of course, but also plays surprisingly well.The plot has ups and downs, but at least the atmosphere works most of the time in a phantastic way. The problems are truly mainly in the area of the script, which opens too many stories and does not tell them to the end. Also the focus isn't enough on the young Tony, even if more psychosocial factors come into part of the playin the end. We only get a small answer on how he became who we know from the legendary series. The main problem is the abrupt end of the story. The idea of the background narrator - i won't tell who it is - is great, but not used properly.In conclusion: Some great scenes will stick for a long time, but the weaks will stay also.",The Many Saints of Newark

Staring at everyone like he's on the spectrum and constantly looking like he's about to cry. How did that character become Tony Soprano? They constantly told us how smart he was and how he's a ""born leader"", how he had all this potential to be something but I didn't see any of that.

79,douglasmcbroom,Bada Bing Bada Fizzle,6,1 October 2021,"Let me start by saying that I think 'The Sopranos' (reviewed elsewhere) is the G. O. A. T. That includes 'The Wire' (reviewed elsewhere) and 'Breaking Bad (reviewed elsewhere). The movers and shakers are here; David Chase, who created The Sopranos and wrote many episodes and Alan Taylor, who directed many episodes. The beloved characters are back. So I really, really wanted to love this film, but 'The Many Saints Of Newark' is not 'The Sopranos.' Not even close.The intensity is gone. The side-splitting humor is absent. The mafia intrigue has been replaced by a turf battle with Black gangsters. The New York Crew doesn't enter the picture. At times it was more of a retrospective of the 60's. It lacked pace. It does not surprise.I guess Ray Liotta was along for the star power, because his powerful character is gone in an instant and replaced by a very uninteresting character. The film centers around 'Dickie Moltisanti', played very capably by Alessandro Nivola, who was 'Christopher's' (Michael Imperioli) father. He is often referred to in 'The Sopranos' but he was killed when Christopher was very young. In fact, the only intrigue in this film is finding out who was behind 'Dickie's' murder. Shocking! So let's look at the rest of the cast. In some ways these characters, from flashbacks in 'The Sopranos,' were better cast. 'Johnny Soprano' for one and, without a doubt, 'Junior.' Although most of the cast try and capture the idiosyncrasies of their well-established characters, Corey Stoll (Junior) couldn't be bothered. John Mangaro really captured 'Silvio.' Billy Magnuson did credit to 'Paulie Walnuts.' Michael Gandolfini, as 'Anthony' was fine playing his father (the late James Gandolfini). Vera Farmiga was excellent in capturing 'Livia.'I gave 'The Sopranos' my very carefully guarded rating of a 10. I give 'The Saints' a 6. As Silvio said in the original: ""You're only as good as your last envelope.""
David Chase's envelope herein, is light.",The Many Saints of Newark

The story is centered around Dickie Maltisanti and we find out who he really was. Not Tony's idealized memory of him. Alessandro Nivola was great as Dickie as was Michael Gondolfini as the young Tony. The entire cast was excellent and their chemistry is fantastic.

82,hughnwilliams,Sopranos Supplementary,7,3 October 2021,"As a bit of extra Sopranos it's entertaining and enjoyable. Fun to see the Sopranos characters as younger versions of themselves and all of the actors do a tremendous job representing the characters that were formed over 7 seasons of the best show on TV. Very nice to see Michael Gandolfini playing his father's character of Tony Soprano, and he does a great job. I just wish we saw a bit more of him. Dickie Moltisanti is the main character in the movie, and he does a good job with what is given to him.The problem here is that there really isn't a central plot. It's like they shrunk a season of the Sopranos down into 2 hours and played out various episode vignettes. So while entertaining, there isn't all that much tension in terms of a central plot building to a crisis point.What I would love to see from here is another TV series that continues Tony Soprano's journey into the mob and his rise up the ranks, starring Michael Gandolfini, and his relationship with the young Carmella.",The Many Saints of Newark

85,vonnoosh,Takes itself too seriously,2,10 October 2021,"Surprised to find this movie based on the Sopranos is missing alot of what made that show entertaining. Sopranos the show had a fair amount of humor in it. The humor blended with the drama and violence and you got a little of everything. This movie lacks the humor. There is one funny scene where Tony is in the family car while his parents are arguing but thats it. The movie lacks probably the one reason I ever bothered to watch the show at all. That often bizarre and dark humor.Another miserable thing about this movie is what we already know happened in Tony's past never happens in the movie. They must have already assumed this was going to spawn a sequel (a mistake) because the backstory never reaches late enough for things like the poker game getting held up or Tony having a panic attack resulting in his cousin going to prison. I assumed the obvious plot points from the series would be expanded on. They aren't. Not at all.Instead you get a mostly boring shadow of the former premise. A really unnecessary film, script and waste of my time. I admit I am biased against these manufactured expansions to old narratives. A viewer can fill in the gaps to the story themselves. If they are interested enough to sit through a prequel, then they were interested enough to assume how Tony got started and who took him under his wing long before this came out. Nothing wrong with imagining something more interesting and frankly, that wouldnt be too hard to do after watching this.",The Many Saints of Newark

The story could have been interesting and the performances are good but the film is so confusing. The narrative is all over the place, jumping between locations and years at breakneck speeds. Subplots are set-up but never go anywhere. I thought that maybe the reason I was confused was because of having never watched the show but after scouring other reviews online it seems that even Sopranos diehards were struggling. The story felt rushed and you never develop any connection to any characters so whenever anyone dies you're really just trying to remember why they were important to begin with. There were only two character I developed any kind of connection with and one of them the only reason I remembered him was because he had a funny accent and a bad toupee. The other one was a main character but we hardly saw her and she felt as if she were only there to progress the arc of of the protagonist. Also, talking about main characters what the hell was going on with Tony Soprano, correct me if I'm wrong but he's the main character of the Sopranos and was featured heavily in all the promotional material but he's playing more of a secondary character here? The role of main character is taken over by his uncle. The technical elements of this film are decent but really there is no reason to watch this rushed excuse of a movie.

They would overall treat their family members well, but then when they left the house they were all business. This dynamic is totally lost in this film. The whole thing is very unbelievable. They didn't do even the modicum of research.And why have so many actors that are obviously not even close to Italian play Italians? Whomever made this movie sees you, the audience members, as a cabbage head.And then the race thing. As predictable as any weak minded Hollywood movie, they got to push race narratives. Had to make so much of this movie about race, and how bad all those terrible ""white"" people are.And this movie is NOTHING of what made the Sopranos good. Not even close to the same spirit, intelligence, etc. Night and day difference.

95,BoomerDT,The Story Stinks,4,4 October 2021,"A generous 4 here...production values and acting are ok and very good in several cases. But the most consideration in any movie or play, unless it's porn or martial arts, is the quality of the story and TMSON is muddled and jumps all over the place. This is supposed to be a prequel to the ""Sopranos"" about the life in DiMeo Crime family, late 60's-early 70's and the evolution of Tony Soprano. Actually this was accomplished quite successfully in several Sopranos utilizing flashback sequences, showing Tony's father, Johnny Boy Soprano, a stone cold mobster who Tony idolized. Johnny Boy has been pushed to the side in the prequel, as Dickie Moltisanti, father of Chris, becomes Tony's supposed mentor. Dickie also becomes the center of the story, along with David Chase going woke with a subplot that takes at least 1/3 of the movie dealing with empowerment of black organized crime in Newark on the Mafia's turf.A few other notable discrepancies:
Silvio Dante, who in the series was a high school pal on Tony's and Jackie Aprile, is all of a sudden at least 10 years older and one of the DiMeo soldiers, about the same age as Paulie and Pussie Bompasario.Speaking of the DiMeo's, we never meet one. Not exactly sure who the Capo is supposed to be.No Hesh, who was Johnny and Junior's associate for their lucrative loan sharking business. They also left out Bobby Baccielieri Sr, Richie Aprile, Feech La Manna, Carmine Lupertazzi and Johhny Sacromoni, who according to the timeline would have been in their prime as career criminals.They also left out someone who would have been an important character during this timeline, Fran Felstein- Johhny Boy's goomar, played notably in an episode by Polly Bergen. Tony was intially fascinated by Fran, who had also slept with JFK, but becomes repulsed when he learns his dog had been given to her and that his father has been spending the night with her when his mother had been hospitalized with a miscarriage.Many other important omissions in a story that bounces all over the place.

This is nothing like The Sopranos and is just plain awful. James Gandolfini is undoubtedly turning over in his grave. I see most reviews are under 5 but it's currently rated at 7.1.

It's pretty terrible to be honest. It seems like a total HBO-Chase cash grab on The Sopranos name and nothing more. There's not much here worth adding to The Soprano's series at all. There are a few storylines from the Sopranos series/past that are tied up here, but they don't really seem worth the film. The Tony character himself seems to have only slightly more screen time in the film than he has in the theatrical trailer. The trailer was definitely far more interesting than the film was. Pretty much every one of the new characters we meet are extremely flat and boring. The film is topically trendy one could even say, which is both sort of sad and pathetic all at the same time. The film seems like it's trying to be a gritty Scorsese type mafia epic in a sense, but it fails quite badly in it's trying. There are a few reasonable parts, but really not much. Definitely the only thing in the film that reminded me of The Soprano's series at all were a few of the familiar characters and the general geographical area/buildings.

The make up wasn't great, I could tell where it was. The story wasn't great, but I didn't hate it.

100,waltermwilliams,One of the most anticipated movies for 2021,6,5 November 2021,"In case you were wondering why this Sopranos prequel is called, ""The Many Saints of Newark"" it's because the real star of this movie is not a young Tony Soprano, but instead his Uncle Dickie Moltisanti.It's his family name that translates from Italian to English as literally, ""many Saints"".Alessandro Nivola plays the lead role of Dickie in this slow 2 hour movie.That's not to say plenty doesn't happen because it does and the violence is typical Sopranos...but with very little nudity or sex scenes.The TV Show would have had a higher rating classification.It's just this movie could have been tight with a 30 minute edit.Gangster movies never seem to get this memo and go on forever.It's like some unwritten rule that if it's Mobster related it must be epic and run at least 2-3 hours.Meanwhile teenage Tony Soprano (who only appears in the last 1/2 hour) is actually played by the late James Gandolfini's son Michael.James of course played Tony in the HBO TV series.I would liked to have seen more of the making of Tony Soprano and less Dickie...so to speak.Dickie plays mentor to a young Tony trying to give him sage advice most of which is second hand through his jailed killer Uncle Salvatore ""Sally"" Moltisanti (also played by Ray Liotta).Tony witnesses the horrors of turf wars, drive by shootings and as a teen is too honest to sell stolen goods.The most daring thing he does is cheat on his high school exams and steal an Ice Cream Van (Mr Whippy style) for a joy ride with his mates and hand out free ice cream Robin Hood style to the neighbourhood children.He comes across more as a wannabe Jock (athlete/footballer) with a socialist mindset based on hours of reading Ivanhoe comics.Gandonlfinis real son had never even watched his dads show last decade because he was way too young for all that foul language, violence and titillation.But at least one question is answered in this movie, ""Who killed Dickie?""
I'll give you a clue it wasn't Hollywood Dick (Liottas other character).As always Ray Liotta is a true star playing two roles and ironically was meant to play Tony Soprano back in 1999, but didn't want to commit to a TV series.Veteran Sopranos Director, Alan Taylor, even references a scene from the gangster classic Goodfellas, which also starred Liotta.I don't know if this was intentional but Vera Farmiga who plays Tony's mum ""Livia Soprano"" is made to look a lot like Edie Falco...talk about Oedipus complex.Johnny is featured (played by Jon Bernthal ""The Punisher"") as part of this nefarious Mafia family...even though he spends 4 years behind bars after an arrest at a Carnival, which was also featured in flashbacks in the TV Series.There's a lot to like for die hard fans of the TV series including the locations eg. Holstens Ice Cream Shop.Where the film works well is setting the mood of the fiery Race Riots of the 1960's showing Black Americas struggle for recognition even in the gangster class system.Leslie Odom Jnr represents this ideal as ""Harold McBrayer"" who goes from working with the Spics to running his own numbers game with the help of a serious drug lord.Even though it's a Crime/Drama it manages to make you laugh at times with some black comedy.The film is narrated by Michael Imeriolo as ""Christopher Molisanti"" we even see his tombstone in the opening credits after he ""met his death on Route 23"".In this scene all the dead narrate their story briefly as the camera pans through a cemetery.A ghostly start to an engaging movie with a Jukebox Soundtrack.",The Many Saints of Newark

102,tpaladino,Absolute disaster of a film.,1,5 October 2021,"It was horrible. Aside from a few fan-service callbacks, it had absolutely none of the tone, mood, or wit of the series whatsoever. And even the callbacks were so obviously inserted purely for fan-service that they come off as cringey and anachronistic.Hopelessly miscast as well, full of people who look like actors and not gangsters -- one of the best things about Sopranos is that you actually believed these were just knockaround guys (and gals) from Jersey. The cast is so obviously just a bunch of primped actors doing bad Sopranos impressions that it's actually painful at times.And whoever was responsible for the cinematography and color grading should never work again, because the whole thing looks like it was shot by a first-year film student going through a goth phase. It's not just that it looks nothing like the series, it's that it looks TERRIBLE. And it completely disconnects the movie from the series. What good is using iconic Sopranos locations like Satriales if you make them basically unrecognizable from the show with?The only highlight was seeing Gandolfini's son play young Tony, but even he had such awful material to work with that he was completely wasted. Like, I could write a ten-page essay going through every single thing wrong with this movie in relation to the series, and still not even come close to expressing how bad it was.The shame of it is that the core story really isn't that bad. It was just told in the worst possible way. This should have been a six-part HBO miniseries shot in the exact same way the series was shot, and written by as many of the original writers as they could get their hands on. Then it would've had a chance. But as it stands, it's a confusing, anachronistic mess, full of characters you just don't care about and a story that has been so compressed and rushed that it's not only hard to follow, but even harder to invest in as a viewer.No time is devoted to exploring the motivations of all the people involved because there are like a half-dozen 'main' characters and it all had to fit into a two-hour movie, so you never feel invested in anything that's happening -- and when something DOES happen, it lacks any dramatic impact at all. It's a mess.Like, I cannot adequately explain how little you actually care about any of these characters. You never know anything about any of them other than the most superficial, surface-level trivialities, and even they are reduced to cliches. Dickie is the big-shot, Junior is in his shadow, the father is an asshole, the mistress is tough but pretty, the wife can't have kids (until she did), Johnny boy is an absentee father, Livia is annoying, Tony is a typical teenager (with such potential), Harold is the oppressed but noble black man, etc.Literally nothing about the WHY of their characters, zero exploration of their motivations. Just cliche. And it all adds up to a big fat nothing. I cannot stress enough that the reason Sopranos worked is because it took the time to explore each character, even relatively minor ones. They were all crafted with love, and the stories benefited tremendously for it. These characters... were not.And yes a big part of it could be blamed on the time limitation. But that's why this story should have either been a miniseries -- so the writers had time to develop the characters properly -- or a simple character study of young Tony with his father and uncles, without trying to cram in a morality play about the Newark riots AND introductions to the entire extended family, each with their own mini-stories to follow.I cannot believe David Chase allowed this. Was he behind on his mortgage or something, because it's obviously a cheap cash-grab. Very sad.",The Many Saints of Newark

Yes the show contains civil and racial unrest in the late 60s and early 70s but it was meant to show the world Tony Soprano lived in then. We are all effected by what surrounds us even if subconsciously. This however did not take away from the original goal which was to show how Tony Sopranos became who he is and the part his family played in it. It showed his world and his family since he was too young then to have much weight in the story. There was no dull moment in the movie and if it had come before the tv show, I think everybody would be raving about it. It's always difficult to follow something as great as the Sopranos because people will always try to compare. The same thing happened with the Hobbits which was a prequel to Lord Of the Rings.

109,pootc,A solid and befitting prequel to 'The Sopranos',8,23 October 2021,"The Many Saints of Newark is a solid and befitting prequel to 'The Soprano's' which tells the story of the oft-mentioned but never seen figure Dickie Moltisanti. Nobody knows The Soprano's world like David Chase who wrote this film too but with an average movie runtime of only two hours, it was never going to reach the epic depths of the beloved television series as far as characters are concerned.For all the critics of Many Saints, Soprano's was never a gangster series but a family drama with gangsters. Memorable characters and brutal hits are its hallmarks, but it was never an action series and sticks true to the formula, focusing on the characters against the backdrop of a race riot and a gang war.The characters Dickie Moltisanti, Johnny Soprano, Livia Soprano, Uncle Junior, Paulie, Silvio and Pussy are all here, albeit younger. Tony Soprano is back too and in the latter stages of the film is played by the late James Gandolfini's son, Michael. An inspired casting choice which works greatly as a tribute to his late father, whose legacy lives on as one of the vilest but beloved characters of all-time.As an outsider who has not seen the show I can totally understand the reluctance to hail this as a great standalone movie but if you did watch the show, enjoyed its characters and lore but didn't appreciate the details in Davis Chase's trip down memory lane ( not to mention and brilliance of the ending), you probably never really understood what 'The Soprano's' was actually about - or it's time for a re-watch.Your mother's $#%*!",The Many Saints of Newark
110,PeachesIR,Muddled plot and wasted opportunities,4,1 October 2021,"I was disappointed in ""The Many Saints of Newark."" It's purportedly an origin story for ""The Sopranos,"" and the storylines that focus on members of the Soprano family are the most compelling. However, there is too much focus on other characters and stories, and too little on Sopranos, including Uncle Junior, Johnny Boy, and Janice.This movie is almost entirely about handsome mafioso Dickie Moltisanti (Christopher's father) and Harold, a rising, ruthless black gangster angling to take over the local rackets. While using the Newark race riots and tension between the local Mafia and Black organized crime groups would be good as subplots, it feels like this film is mainly about racism, rather than Italian-American organized crime syndicates (the whole focus of ""The Sopranos""). There are almost too many minor characters in this movie, and some are thinly written and just seem like caricatures. Bada bing! It's a little stale. Watch ""Donnie Brasco"" instead, or just rewatch ""The Sopranos.""While some of the performances are very good, especially Michael Gandolfini as young Tony and Vera Farmiga as his mother Livia, the film seems muddled, with too many storylines that are not filled out. In my opinion, the tortured Tony/Livia relationship is the most interesting element of the Sopranos, and I'd like to have seen that explored more. Plus, Farmiga is terrific in this role! Corey Stoll as Junior too. Alessandro Nivola and Leslie Odom Jr. Are both very good actors, but I couldn't help feeling they were in the wrong movie.",The Many Saints of Newark

I cringed, literally.They have the great Jon Berenthal now playing Tony's dad and I love that guy but he was miscast. The original actor (who actually recently died) played the part of a 1960s gangster perfectly. He's not a tough guy but is a tough guy. Berenthal is the Punisher as his father, not the same character at all.Tony, for some reason, is about 5 years older in life than he was in the series. They literally do the same scene at the carnival where a young Tony sees his dad get pinched. In the series, Tony is about 7 and skinny, meaning he was born in 59-60 sometime. In the movie, he's around 12 now and chubby. He's a high school football player in 1971 rather than the mid 70s like he was in the series.The younger versions of the main characters of the series are one-dimensional card board cut outs except for Sil (they nailed that one).But the worst thing of all, besides the fact the whole thing was boring, is that Christopher's ghost, a guy who wasn't born when any of this was happening and was a baby at the end, is narrating the story of which he should have no knowledge of outside of what people told him.

The show started off brilliantly and went downhill as the seasons progressed. But, to be fair, many good show fall into the same trap. However, I was really excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was bored half-way through.I get that Dickie stepped in and became a pseudo uncle/father figure when Anthony's real father went to prison. I get the bond that formed. But in the movie, Dickie really didn't take Anthony under his wing to groom him into the mob boss that we know from the TV series.Other than the scene with Dickie and his dad in the car or Dickie and his stepmom/girlfriend at the beach, the movie mostly showed Dickie as a typical guy. Sure, he was in the ""power drill"" scene, but it wasn't Dickie doing the ""drilling."" Dickie wasn't a mentor for Anthony to become a mob boss at all.Young Anthony seemed more like a nice kid, who did a few stupid things as a kid. The stealing of the ice cream truck was stupid. If young Anthony would have stole the truck and sold ice cream to kids for half the normal price, then it would have been worth adding to the movie. Otherwise it was all risk for no gain.The movie, as it related to Dickie, seemed to focus more on the relationship between him and his stepmom. Was this suppose to be a romantic drama?Dickie seemed pretty weak in a lot of the movie. When he visited his uncle in prison, it seemed like Dickie was going to cry half the time. It seemed like Dickie spent too much time whining. (""I don't know what to do! What should I do? Why am I such a loser?...blah, blah, blah...or words to that effect). If Don Vito Corleone was in the movie, he would have slapped Dickie in the face and told him to be a man!Anthony didn't want to take speakers from Dickie because they were stolen. This movie makes *NO* transition from young Anthony to what would later become Tony Soprano.Towards the end of the movie, Dickie tried to push Anthony away (to prevent him from getting mixed up in the ""family business.""). Anthony gets frustrated with Dickie. Yet, when Dickie is killed, young Anthony suddenly sets a path towards becoming Tony Soprano. Getouttahere! Anthony was at a few funerals before Dickie's. Anthony was probably mad a Dickie just before Dickie was killed. Dickie's murder was a lame portrayal of Anthony becoming a mob boss.Too much time was spent on scenes that didn't matter. Too little time (or no time) was spent *REALLY* seeing how young Anthony became the guy that we know from the TV show.If you're thinking about spending money at the theatre to see this movie,,,fugetaboutit!

Pussy was another one that if you just watched the mannerisms you would think it was the original Pussy. Junior seemed just like his crotchy old back stabbing self taking offense over little things.This is not an action movie but more along the lines of a TV drama. The acting was well done and paid great homage to the original actors and their mannerisms and personalities. Think of this as an extended flashback from the Sopranos. Sometimes they would show flashbacks and now we got a full length version of how everyone got lined up to be where they were when the show started.

Silvio, Paulie, Pussy, Johnny and Dickie. Vera F. Was absolutely wonderful as Livia/ma. The actors were chosen extremely well. A+ in that area.But the story itself.... It felt to me like they tried to jam way too much into a movie. This would have been better suited for a limited series so we had time for greater character development.What ends up happening with Junior and Dickie (to me) felt like it came out of left field. The counter build up with Harold, felt like a wasted opportunity left untied.The story line behind Tony was so minimal I wasn't able to really fall in love with our soon-to-be main character or understand why he ended up where he did taking on the family business - though there was great failed effort to do so. The touching pinky promise scene with Dickie fell short in the end - and considering it WAS the end. Flat.I know many people were underwhelmed by this, and I don't mean to drag it in the mud.

However I will say that certain actors who portray characters like (Sil) were nearly spot on in their interpretation of the character they were playing.The actor playing Paulie Walnuts had his mannerisms down but was under utilized, and finally Michael Gandolfini did very well with capturing his fathers charisma and attitude as a Young Tony Soprano.Miscasting issues with Corey Stahl playing Uncle Junior was one of the most annoying things within the film.Now getting a backstory to the Sopranos is something nice to have but why did they not tell it from the perspective of Johnny Boy and Uncle June? Using the Dickie Moltisanti storyline could have run parallel but this is a Sopranos story so focusing on the Sopranos is what should have been important.Don't get me wrong Dickie's backstory is a good story but did not need to be the sole focus of the film. The Newark riots subplot also served no real purpose in the story.I just feel like if this is the best they could offer they should have waited for a better story or not bothered.So many opportunities wasted to tell a true TS backstory instead we get something we know nothing about from the original series other than passing remarks.Well, at least Uncle Junior did get to say The Varsity Line, but I was hoping for the Feech LaMana Card game heist.",The Many Saints of Newark

Now that's fine an all however I am not a fan that they pushed it to be a mob movie in the trailers.Now the moments with the character's from the tv series weren't easter eggs as some have put it but it was just a fan service which became annoying.It wouldn't surprise me if they used this movie to set up another tv series about Harold.Now the ending of this film was dumb, they used The Sopranos theme song when Tony was shown touching pinkie's with Dickie.

133,mistabobdobolina,They would have been better off making it a stand-alone,6,6 October 2021,"I'm not a Sopranos superfan or anything, but I know enough about at least bits of the lore to recognize some of the callouts here and to know about the role Dickie Moltisanti played as kind of mythic figure out of the past on the show. But I don't, ultimately, think the connection to that show added all that much here, and ultimately this would have been a lot more compelling as a stand-alone story.Don't get me wrong, Michael Gandolfini is very good as a young, pre-gangster Tony. Alessandro Nivoli, Vera Farmiga, Leslie Odom Jr. And Corey Stoll all do fine work: Stoll's evocation of a younger Junior is particularly on point. Michaela de Rossi is winning and charismatic in the role of Giuseppina, and Ray Liotta delivers to his usual iconic standard in a cleverly-conceived pair of roles as both Hollywood Dick and his long-imprisoned brother.But.First of all, the movie doesn't really have room to fully deliver as an origin story for Tony Soprano, which is one of its big selling points. I can see Sopranos fans being disappointed on that score. And ultimately, we don't really *need* an origin story for a character whose psyche already got explored in six full seasons of an epoch-making HBO drama.Secondly, by far the more interesting idea in the movie -- the journey of Dickie Moltisanti and Harold McBrayer from friendship (or at least business partnership) to deadly enmity -- is underserved, and the theme of racial tension that comes in with the Newark riots in particular is underused, ultimately having to play second fiddle to Sopranos fanservice.There's a solid effort at tying all this together through the unifying story of Dickie himself, and his doomed struggle to live up to an image of himself as being a better man than his father. The tragedy of Dickie, who has every bit of his own father's murderous temper and is perennially trying to atone for the deadly sins he commits with ""good deeds,"" would make for more interesting material given more room to breathe.If this had been a movie really centered around Dickie and Harold and their escalating vendetta, one that genuinely developed Harold as a deuteragonist with Dickie, explored both of characters' tragic flaws and especially made their conflict over Giuseppina's affections into the stuff of a focused final act, I think it could have been cracking stuff. But the further space taken up by trying to tie everything into the Sopranos and the story of Tony ultimately robs it of focus. It underperforms as a stand-alone film as a result, and I expect it won't satisfy the cravings of the Sopranos fanbase the tie-in was meant to appeal to.Still, even despite its lack of focus and its various moving parts never truly coming together, there's a lot of good material here. I liked it. I just wish I could have loved it.FRANZESE CREW EDIT: Yes, I saw the Mob Movie Monday review. Wasn't good. I don't mean that Michael's opinion of the movie wasn't good, that much is obvious. I mean the *review* wasn't good.*Authentic Mob Dialogue:* I won't venture to comment. I trust Michael to know more about that than I do. If it's not right, whatever. May they learn from that.*Dark Story Themes:* Dickie Moltisanti's story features dark themes that go back to Oedipus Rex and that speak of extremely violent parental abuse, sociopathy, adultery, things close to incest, and events that involve murder and deception and racism and fallacious virtue. Michael's responses to this are mostly about whether they're *necessary,* and he tells us that they're impugning Italian-Americans. The story isn't specific to Italian-Americans and it treats themes that were part of general American life at the time. That includes the Newark Riots. There's nothing genuinely unbelievable about Dickie Moltisanti: Michael's just pissed that he's there and is a depressing and villainous character. Not really a convincing objection.*Harold vs. Dickie.* Apparently, fiction is okay until it involves race relations. Funny, that, and also not a convincing objection. The Harold-v-Dickie story is pretty obviously a version of Bumpy Johnson vs. Dutch Schultz transported to the Newark Riots period, and shortly thereafter, for fictional person. It's unfortunate for Michael's credibility as a commentator, honestly, that this is so offensive to him, as is the deflection he engages in about the fact that Italian-American racism is portrayed as part of the story. Usually, when people start trying to deflect and distract attention by saying ""everyone did it,"" you're on to something. Advantage: Chase.""Abuse, murder, and treachery."" Again, I can't speak to how often mobsters or Italian-Americans or anyone else abused or murdered family members. I *can* tell you that the spectacle of abuse we see with Hollywood Dick (Ray Liotta) and his Italian wife Giuseppina is pretty tame as this kind of thing goes: I've known social workers, I've known people who deal with domestic abuse, objecting to this kind of thing as ""not necessary"" is basically demanding it be swept under the rug. No. And, frankly, shame on Michael for framing it that way. The same goes for family members murdering or betraying each other or framing up the Blacks for their doing so. None of these things are that unusual, horrific though they are, and Chase has better of the argument here. Michael is pissed that he didn't have sign-off, basically. That's what it is.I think the movie is imperfect. I'm not here for Michael Franzese's review, I'm sorry. He didn't even notice there was four-year gap between Act Two and Act Three.

I don't think you can really do what you want in a two-hour film. (And, by the way, ""Better Call Saul"" has been restrained enough not to even touch yet on Walter's backstory.)And if you want to make an engaging film about racist Italian gangsters in Newark in the 1960's committing various crimes against their own family members and also facing rebellions both from the Black community and their former Black subordinates - that can be done! Although even that's pretty ambitious for two hours, you might want three!But in that case if you want to make it ALSO a series prequel you are only going to end up cluttering it up with distractions involving the self-imposed necessity of showing the 1960's versions of 15 or 20 people (I didn't count) who later on become characters in a TV show set much later, starting with a Sunset Boulevard style narration to the present-day audience from within his grave complaining about the child Tony Soprano who later murders him, from the cadaverous lips of Christopher Moltesanti who, mind you, is either unborn or *an infant* throughout the action of ""Many Saints"".I mean, you have all this other action going on, and meanwhile you have dead adult Christopher's voice reminding you that all that stuff isn't the real point, ""the real point is to show how that kid Tony gets turned into the kind of jerk who would murder sweet little baby me.""I mean, that's distracting.",The Many Saints of Newark

This is just a series of barely-connected scenes pieced together into an incoherent film and if it wasn't for the Sopranos connection then this would be nothing at all. There's a very questionable shoe-horning in of race-related riots and some black characters but this was never really a big thing in The Sopranos as far as I can remember and so seems there more so to appease modern day sensibilities than provide any meaningful back-drop to David Chase's series from the 2000s. Actually, I use the word characters loosely as what we have here are 1-dimensional hints at characters. Junior, Sil and Paulie are all here with others but there's never much insight into where they've come from or what's going on with them and the motivations for some of their actions seem a little unlikely. Even with Tony himself, we're only getting snatched glimpses and fleeting visions of young Carmela and Arty that add nothing. For me this was a clumsy, inept effort and it's difficult to believe that David Chase was involved at all but there you go. The cast do their best but they're working with a shambles of a screenplay and a director of questionable movie pedigree. I wasn't expecting a huge amount from this but it actually bored, disappointed and confused me to the point of angered frustration.

137,yoyopa,A movie about nothing.,3,27 October 2021,"I wanted to like this. I really like - won't say love - but really like The Sopranos. I was pretty young when it was on TV but I remember my mom loved it. I finally got around to binging it myself recently. James Gandolfini was The Sopranos. He was quite literally like the sun... everything revolves around his performance. Even in scenes he wasn't in.This movie though... wasn't just missing the James Gandolfini but it was hard to believe David Chase who penned the original series actually wrote this crap. Many Saints isn't about anything. It's just a collection of situations, familiars names, places and characters. Seriously, I went to two screenings of this film - one of which was with the cast. They did a discussion afterwards and I swear listening to them answer questions from the moderator it was like they knew this movie sucked. They sort of knew how hallow and empty it was. I felt embarrassed for them.The marketing for the film is bizarrely out of step with the film itself - Who Made Tony Soprano?- well I've seen it twice and I have no clue. We never see any hints of transformation in Tony. There's no moment. Just this unbelievably cheesy ending that's supposed to be a throwback to an unbelievably cheesy moment in the film. It was so awkward being in the audience... it wasn't a large amount of people. No one clapped at the end. Everyone just sort of sat there. We all knew it was bad and so did the cast.The Italian girl? No idea what her purpose was in this movie. No clue. She was just there. I think maybe to cause problems? I guess?Also, the film strangely tried to incorporate race relations... I'm black and I can tell you it wasn't necessary. It did nothing for the story. I've heard people say that The Sopranos was a super racist show. I couldn't disagree with that sentiment more... I thought was Chase did with the racism of his characters was incredibly intelligent. Everything Tony for example would accuse black people of being he quite literally was himself. He would accuse them of stealing as though he wasn't an irredeemable thief, murderer, abuser himself. It was hilarious actually. But it was never woke. There were never any characters in scenes or episodes just for the sake of being there.Also, young Paulie, Silvio, and Puss... jeez it was like watching a terrible cosplay. I wanted to see this movie primarily because I'm a big fan of Stoll and Bernthal... both of which had nothing to do in this movie and more often than not looked and sounded like they were doing impressions not giving performances and I blame the writing.",The Many Saints of Newark

139,huntersmithx,The cast and direction excels for a disappointing prequel.,7,4 October 2021,"David Chase has made an astronomical career for himself off of one show- The Sopranos. The beloved HBO series was one to put its own spin on the tone of Martin Scorsese's mob movies from the 70's-90's and usher in what is now considered the golden age of TV and streaming. May James Gandolfini rest in peace for he created one of the most beloved villain protagonists of this generation. With that in mind, a movie was bound to happen, and rightfully so. The problem though is that it became striken with a moderate case of prequelitis- this affected the likes of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Give credit where credit is due- David Chase stuck to his ground and has likely obtained what he wanted; he doesn't owe the fans one singular product. Aiding him is the direction of Sopranos veteran Alan Taylor, who makes the aesthetic of the series translate to cinema and the desaturated color palette all the watchable. The 1970's nostalgia will be easy to digest and is mostly organic. The cast of characters, much like the series, are colorful and stand out in spite of varying screentimes. The Sopranos' evocation of Scorsese's Goodfellas comes full circle here in that its lead Ray Liotta plays not one, but two roles as twin brothers Hollywood and Sally Moltisanti. He excels, as well as our headliner Alessandro Nivola in the role of Tony Soprano's uncle. Leslie Odom Jr, Jon Bernthal and Corey Stoll were also delightful to see on screen; not to mention Vera Farmiga as Tony Soprano's overbearing, toxic mother Livia. Michael Gandolfini had quite the shoes to fill coming into his father's throne as a young Tony, and setting aside the possibility of a sequel he was mesmerizing and you await whenever he'd come back on screen.The Many Saints of Newark can leave one in a conundrum because it's one of the more engaging films to come out of the gangster movie revival of the 2010's/2020's (especially compared to somnolent fests like Black Mass), yet it also fizzles out in the third act and a lot of the events that transpire beforehand don't have much impact due to a lack of clear direction. Multiple storylines can be a compelling thing in cinema, and they're utilized here to convey the environment that makes Tony who he comes to be in the series. For people who haven't watched the series or were mislead by the marketing to believe this is Tony Soprano's Godfather Part II, disappointment is unavoidable. I'm an advocate for Cinemascore, and the C+ that audiences gave this film isn't out of line despite what disgruntled fans and critics might say.For the most superfans of Sopranos fans or Sunday HBO viewers, The Many Saints of Newark should compel you and leave you wanting more. For those who weren't pre-initiated like myself or are in need of a more punctuated screenplay, this wasn't worth all the rave.RATING: 2.5 out of 4 stars.",The Many Saints of Newark

148,greg-goremykin,"I really tried to like this, but...",5,1 October 2021,"NOTE: English is not my first language, so I apologize now for any grammatical errors or mispelled of misused words.The plot was weak, some plot points felt very forced as well, shoehorned in to move the story in a certain direction but not really making sense. The death and/or other serious events that occurred to end certain characters lacked emotional gravitas.It could be argued fairly that that's hard to muster when we know which characters would die ahead of time from the series, but there was a noticeable dearth of character development (everything in this film felt sooo rushed) that when someone died it was hard to feel anything other than *meh* about it.I've read a lot of praise about it, but Tony being played by the late actor's son feels like stunt casting to me, and just not worth it for the resemblance factor. Although you can tell Gandolfini the Younger gave it his best, and despite the many critics praising his performance to me it felt very stilted, stiff, and unsure. Looks aside I think it was a poor choice, he just didn't have the acting chops needed for what I thought was going to be the lead character in this film, but turned out to be just one of many, many different little subplots going on (half of them feeling like blatant fanservice).Generally the highlight of the film was the acting, which was pretty superb across the board. Though at times the imitation of original cast actors went from flattery to something boarding on the impressions done on a comedy variety show (the performance of the actor that played Silvio was particular bad for that... it was like an intentionally over-the-top SNL sketch; having the same mannerisms is one thing, but the Sil character was hammy AF, just way too much in the way of trying to be a Steven Van Zandt character).This was advertised as being something it just wasn't. One of the officially bylines for ""The Many Saints of Newark"" (a clever title, a reference to all the spirits lurking around the graves of the people who have passed on from whence Chris narrates... and the sparse narration was well-done, not overly expository) was something along the lines that it centered around ""a vicious gang war""...um, what?!? One hit each constitutes a vicious gang war??? For a major synopsis of what the film was to be about how could they have had something so misrepresentative? Was there a lot more gangland ""action"" left on the editing-room floor?That could be another overall criticism of the film; it was wayyy too light on the peek-behind-the-curtain feel of seeing the inner workings of a Mafia family, a hallmark of every episode of the original series...it showed much more of how an organization like that operates. There was barely *any* of that, and historical impossibilities, like Bumpy Johnson wanting to take on a mafia family without any backing from any of the other 5 NYC Families? I think I get it, that this was all focused much more on the character interaction than that peek behind the curtain that was not to be with this one, but again, it feels like the film's promotion misrepresented what the focus would be, so if I'm feeling disappointed it was only because I was so very much set up with false expectations.There were characters that I would have loved to seen more of, Johnny Soprano especially... this would maybe have worked well as an opening film for a new series perhaps... a non-linear format that shows the watchers what this one-off promised to be and really didn't deliver on, that of being the ""origin story"" of Tony Soprano: how a bright if uninspired teenage boy who doesn't at all want to be part of the ""family business"" becomes the crime lord we saw in ""The Sopranos"".I can't give this more than a 5 all things considered, even with some truly stellar performances. Yes, the high quality of the series maybe gave me unrealistic expectations, and I'll give this another watch in maybe a year from now. To zoom in on the main overarching problem with this film, the pacing was wayyy too fast, which didn't allow for any character development, and hence no empathy for the characters. ""The Sopranos"" main hook was showing a man who was by all rights a complete sociopathic monster, but having seen what created him still allowing for the audience to empathize and even cheer for this character. That just didn't happen with the lead character this film followed the most...it felt like the writing tried to fit half a season's worth of the TV shows plotting into one standard-length film, which just didn't work very well. Maybe the switch from TV writing to film writing was just much too far a leap, they really are like apples and oranges vis-as-vis plot & pacing.Tl;dr5/10If the purpose of the film was to dip a toe in the water to feel if there would be enough interest in a new series based on this format I'd have ranked it higher, but as a fully stand-alone piece, despite stellar acting for the most part, (i) the plot was much too contrived, too rushed, and too thin, (iii) the advertising leading up to the release promised the audience thing it just didn't deliver (e.g. A brutal gang war, Tony's ""origin story""), and (iii) the impersonations of the original cast bordered on over-the-top parody at times which reinforced rather than helping to break down the fourth wall (eg.the Steven Van Zandt impersonation by the actor playing Silvio was way, wayyyyy over the top!).",The Many Saints of Newark

I'm pretty sure all the hate comes from thinking this movie was going to focus on the characters we all know and love from The original Sopranos series. It's definitely not that. It's a prequel about Christopher's father Dickie. If most of the viewers went in with that mindset I think people would have a different view about it.If you're a real Sopranos nut, I think you should appreciate some of the little Easter eggs in this film amd all the small references to the show.

They needed more time. The movie tries to give us the entire development of Dickie Maltisanti in 2 hours where as we were given 6 seasons for Tony.

It kept switching from dickey moltisanti to Tony soprano to Harold. If it is written right it shouldn't be a problem but it wasn't written correctly or they edited it in such a way as it didn't flow right.

These are all hallmarks of long form television, where all of that works just fine because there is time to develop. There is no cinematic construct here and it's the sort of film where you can wander to the toilet at any moment, come back and feel safe that nothing of note has been missed (unless it was the shootout, which was well staged). Whenever you think the story is about to shift up a gear just calm yourself: it isn't going to.The acting is fine and there's nothing to object to in the whole runtime, it just doesn't do anything, so the bitterness and 5 rating come from that emptiness I felt at the end having basically wasted an evening.Watch it on TV.

It's a nice stroll down memory lane for me---maybe because it aired so long ago. As I remember it used to be months and sometimes years between seasons. I laugh at how some fans want to reinvent The Sopranos as the Godfather of television. The Sopranos wasn't all gangster stuff. It was about some seriously messed up people who we grew to know and love despite their immorality. That said, I kept asking myself when do we get to the good part? As a stand alone movie with no ties to the Sopranos I guess it works. I was entertained; but the whole story arc about Dickie Moltisanti and his father's wife could and should have been eliminated.",The Many Saints of Newark
164,kangarooconnor,What did y'all expect to happen?,7,7 October 2021,"This film holds a weird place in my mind, on one hand I can't stop thinking about how much more I was craving but also the extreme satisfaction I had. I feel that this movie is doing bad box office wise and ratings wise because people built this movies hype up way too much. They expected a riveting masterpiece with callbacks, Easter eggs and a plot that could rival The Godfather. However, what we got was in fact great, and a lot of the people's criticism is in fact unfounded and untrue.To begin with let's start with Dickie, lots of people were disappointed that he wasn't the hardened gangster they were ""led"" to believe. However, what we got was essentially what we were told he was like (excluding the junkie part). He was a low level gangster that was friends with Johnny Boy. Tony idolized him because he never actually got to know who he was, not some hardened gangster but a sociopath with issues that appeared to be a good guy. Tony always was shielded from his true vices and crimes and instead was allowed to see the ""cool"" side. The constant support, the jokes, the free speaker, but never the ""I killed my father and began to sleep with his former wife. I harm others for fun and drink excessively."" Tony hated his father because his father was honest to him, told him of the harsh life and actively brought him into it whereas Dickie supported Tony's wants and dreams. Tony gets angry at those who call Dickie a junkie because only he knows it's not true and that leaves him in a tight place.Secondly, the plot, I do agree that perhaps if this movie was a lot longer and or was a small mini series it would have benefited but as a single 2 hour film it was fine. The acting in this movie was fantastic, every actor spot on perfected the mannerisms and charisma of each character. Especially Vera Farmiga as Olivia, she nailed it and even made some scary connections to Carmela's mannerism that would make Freud happy. Michael Gandolfini did a great job portraying his father and was allowed some Lee way since Tony wasn't fully developed yet. Jon Bernthal played himself really but that was how Johnny boy was, and Corey Stoll was great as Junior.This movie was always meant to be a period piece that showed a few key moments in the childhood of Tony Soprano and the life of Dickie Soprano. It was never going to be a full blown master work of story and it be impossible to show everything mentioned in the show.However there still are a few complaints I have with the overall film, majority the lack of and odd use of Ray Liotta. He was there as two people, twin brothers, one the father of Dickie and the other the incarcerated uncle. I felt that the uncle wasn't used as much as possible and was overall a waste of time to visit. Secondly I hated, absolutely hated the use of Christopher as a narrator, he didn't need to be in the movie, didn't need to say or do anything. Him saying ""that's the guy I went to hell for"" was just a major piece of fan service that felt out of left field. Finally, the last thing I didn't like was how half and half the movie was, half of the film being in the 60s and half being in the 70s. I felt that the movie should have been mostly in the 70s and had clips back to the 60s.Overall the movie was good and I feel is getting a bad review from uptight purist fans.",The Many Saints of Newark

I expected, and wanted this movie to be about the rise of Tony into the upper echelons of organized crime, but it instead told a story that I wasn't really interested or invested in.

The civil rights era cross story and look at the 1960's-70's was authentic and interesting. The strength is the acting and the characters. Ray Liotta and Vera Famiga steal this film. Michael Gandolfini is terrific as a young Tony. Anthony Nivola was tasked with heading this all star cast and he is masterful. Jon Bernthal was great to watch. The other characters capture the essence of their namesakes. Joey Diaz was a pleasant surprise. I will say, without giving too much away, that the ending was a little unsatisfying.

If it wasn't calling itself a Sopranos prequel, made by it's creator, it would be totally unwatchable/unreleaseable. It's borderline unwatchable as it is. Written by the, er, 76 yr old David Chase, there's hardly any story, just one disjointed scene, then another. The director's background is mostly tv, and it shows, there's just not the quality that you see in something made by a good feature movie director.Who'd imagine in something calling itself a Sopranos movie that the only protagonists are an African American gang, and it would be about the level of success they had (ok, in this woke era, of course you can imagine that). Not that it would be any better if it focused more exclusively on the Italian gang, because across the board they are so unlikable and unappealing that you don't care what happens to them (and some good actors here, they're just stuck with bad material).

This feature length prequel to the series is based mostly on Dickie Moltisante ( Christopher's father ) who we hear a lot about in the series. If you are thinking the films all about Tony Soprano, then you will be left disappointed. Of course Tony soprano features in it, played brilliantly by James Gandolfni's real son in his teen yesrs, but this is the rise of Tony soprano and where he got his influence from. You hear him mention Dickie as a legend in the series and this feature length film shows the backdrop to that story. What I loved the most was the younger versions of the characters we adore in the series. Silvio and Uncle Junior in particular played to perfection with all the mannerisms and phrases acted out brilliantly. Pauline , Big Pussy etc all make appearances. References to the series and certain relevant scenes which only Sopranos fans would truly appreciate are also implemented brilliantly. The 2 hours flew by for me, as I was in awe the whole time.

The characters are forced, almost caricatures of the actual Sopranos in the series.The ridiculousness that is young Silvio Dante, young Anthony Soprano, young Paulie Walnuts, etc. Is insulting. Young Anthony doesn't want a set of stolen speakers because its wrong and he wants to go to college, after several stupid scenes of him doing things like stealing an ice cream truck, throwing the driver out the door while its moving down the road.If you are a film student, and you wish to know how not to make a prequel, watch this film and take notes.

180,devojonesy1977,Chase could have kept THIS!!,4,2 October 2021,"Finally saw the ""prequel"" to The Sopranos- The Many Saints of Newark. After a year of anticipation for this film, I was especially excited to hear the voice of Christopher Moltisanti (voiced by the original actor Michael Imperioli) during the opening, narrating from the grave.After that, it was ALL DOWNHILL.Being a fan of The Sopranos, there are a few things that I remembered from the show and the characters backgrounds. This film seemed to ignore these facts. Firstly, I remember from the series that Tony had a young crew that consisted of Ralph Ciffaretto, Giacomo (Jackie) Aprile and Silvio Dante to name a few, so how was it that in this movie, Silvio was older than Tony and already in the Johnny Boy Soprano crew while Tony and Jackie were robbing ice cream trucks? Didn't add up. It was inconsistencies like these (and other factors) that ruined The Many Saints of Newark for me.Another of the things that ruined this film was the very idea that an entire film about a basically nonexistent character from the series could fly on it's own. Who thought that an entire film about Dickie Moltisanti was a great idea? How about a film about Johnny Boy or Junior Soprano or even the origins of the Dimeo crime family?Honestly, when I saw that Ray Liotta was involved, I thought that perhaps he would play Ercoli Dimeo or a younger Feech Lamanna, but instead Liotta plays the father AND uncle who just happen to be identical twins. REALLY? Even fictional Chrissy Moltisanti wouldn't have approved of a script this awful
And why the whole racial strife aspect of 1968 Newark? Why even include this aspect of history into a film about the mafia? Why is THAT in the film at all? This was NOT what Sopranos fans were waiting for for two years. Did David Chase lose a bet? Did he owe someone money?Onto the acting? Well all that I saw were actors imitating characters from the series notably Silvio, Sal (Big Pussy) and Paulie. I didn't really see any acting from these actors, just imitations. And sadly, Michael Gandolfini (other than resembling his dad in certain scenes) didn't really capture the fire or mannerisms that you would imagine a young Tony Soprano having at 16 years old. Again, THAT didn't measure up either. Overall I could have waited ANOTHER year for the writers to rethink/recast/rewrite this whole movie idea before releasing it.

It's a okay movie at best, and that's being fair- with that said, the story and premise itself is hit or miss, and it seems to be too jam packed into one film for it to be conclusive enough. I wouldn't really even bother to consider this noteworthy of The Sopranos. There's just too much stuff to point out to say what could've made this movie better, and it all just fell flat.The actors were great, and I loved each one. It was really awesome seeing them young, not to mention portraying the original characters to a tee. The rest of the movie however was just okay.

It just gets worse dragging on and on, scene after scene, up to the point there's no point at all in all that mess.

The actors playing the younger versions of the Sopranos characters do a pretty good job looking like them and capturing their mannerisms, especially Sil. He had his mannerisms down. However there is something shallow about them. Paule they could have done a better job with. Livia was a little too nice, why? Too much woke crap. She's a victim here. She could be a good mother, but caught in a bad life. Let's face it that was not the case in the Sopranos. She was the antagonist cheering Johnny on and driving him to do worse, never satisfied. She relished being his wife, the power he wielded and yet never allowed him peace. She was almost a prelude to Carmela, but so much worse. In general in the Sopranos the women were often worse then the men in that they were willing participants who built the support structures for these thugs and relished in the power they possessed and the stature it gave them all while acting as if they did not own or share in the culpability of their husbands crimes. Here they come off more as passive victims, victims of the times and their circumstances and fairly blind to what is going on. As for the black sub plot, while it was well done it's completely out of place. It holds much too large a role in this movie and is clearly added as more woke empowerment. That's all well and good, but it changes the back story for the Sopranos and I guess the writers don't care so long as they can feed the woke beast and check the box. Save it for another movie, on its own it could have been awesome, but here well just stop messing with an already good formula, because it turns the Sopranos into something it was not, causing it to lose its authenticity. If that isn't enough still the biggest problem with the movie though is the timing. It feels off, making the movie feel shallow and not authentic. The actors come off like they are parroting the original cast and do not feel like real people. This makes the movie feel low budget, like a pilot used to sell a show. Maybe that's what it is designed to do, to get a new series going. Watch goodfellas and there is a comedic edgy feel, almost like you have a window into a private world. Same with the Godfather, they feel real. This feels like watching a low budget play it just does not feel authentic. Overall it was nice too see some of the things spoken about in the Sopranos played out. The sub plot with Dicky was interesting, but still felt out of place overall for the Sopranos. Also as I recall Johnny was release the same day from jail after the amusement park and they bragged about it. Here he goes to prison for 2-5. I don't recall that and even so as presented changes the impact of the original story as told in the Sopranos, at least to me.

I wanted nothing more than a well written and gripping film on the mystery behind Dickie Moltisanti's murder and the rise of Tony Soprano to head of the Dimeo Family. How can a 2 hour movie be this rushed?Right. This film defines how not to make a prequel:-Focus on things completely irrelevant to the main character (filler)-Develop almost nothing and make everything very rushed-Have almost no tension or suspense as the characters are barely given time to grow or create context.-Everything is just...badly written.Everything is just bland. I didn't care about what Dickie was doing because his character has as much character as a cardboard box.I am allowed to compare this film to the Sopranos because the same guy wrote and directed both of these. It is clear that if the Sopranos can develop more character/intrigue in about 15 minutes than a 2 hour movie can in its whole run time, you're better off just watching better mobster media like the Godfather or of course the Sopranos.Very solid thumbs down, don't waste your time.",The Many Saints of Newark

The Many Saints of Newark had too many characters and not enough time to develop them for the story. Of course, we already knew many of the characters... but only Tony & Uncle Jun were fully developed in this story. They tried with Livia but it was only superficially.

And why so much focus on the racial tension of the early 70's... how did those events impact these Italian/American gangsters? It seemed forced and out of place.

189,DragonFodder185,David Chase goes woke,4,1 October 2021,"Hollywood can't make anything good anymore without the lens of wokeness. It's tiresome and annoying. I think I speak for 80% of people when I say we're sick the death of the wokeness. When will this woke era be over?!The injection of so much race politics drags this movie down to the pits. I wanted to see more of Dicky Moltasanti and the story of the old New Jersey crew. But no, we don't get that instead we get hosed down with race riots and a guy named Harold who I had zero interest in. In fact his character was repulsive. Some of these storylines are just too unbelievable especially involving Harold. What was David Chase thinking? Oh that's right ..all these Hollywood rich elitists see is color in everything even when it's not there.On a better note, I did enjoy Michael Gandolfini. I disagree with those who say he can't act, he most certainly can. He would of made his father proud. The young Anthony Soprano scenes were the best part of the movie. Alessandro Nivola was pretty good, I enjoyed him too. They are the only reasons I'm giving this a rating of 4.I was so excited for this movie, I am one of the biggest Soprano fans to ever breathe. But unfortunately I was very disappointed. Especially with the revelation that Junior was responsible for Dicky Maltasante's death. Big stinker right there. Junior is one of my favorite characters in the show, this movie made him a bumbling joke which he was not.David Chase let us down.",The Many Saints of Newark

195,Fiercesome_Fool,Should have been a mini series,5,2 October 2021,"This movie is quite underwhelming to watch. The trailers made this look like a movie about Tony and his growth into becoming part of the mafia inspired by his uncle Dickie. Well the trailer is quite misleading because there is a plot line needlessly shoved into the movie revolving around a new character called Harold McBrayer. His character provides little to nothing of value to the movie and was clearly shoved in for certain reasons.The movie primarily focuses on Dickie who is the one that made Tony want to become a boss. However the movie does not in any convincing way make me believe that Tony would want to become a boss. More of the movie is focused on the drama of Dickie with his uncle, Harold and mistress. Tony is secondary and of course the useless Harold plot line.The movie itself has no central plot, it is a collection of character plots interacting with one another in their daily lives.The movie ends with the Harold character's storyline having no conclusion. We don't even see Tony start his mob career, nor do we see his relationship with Sil, Paulie or Pussy. The way this movie ends will have you saying ""what? That is it? Is there supposed to be a part two?"".This movie should have been a mini series that way the messy collection of character plots could be more fleshed out. Also it would allow for relationships to be better developed. Such as Johnny Soprano just sort of being there but doing nothing.The performances of Dickie, Livia and Tony were good. Everyone else was decent. The playing Sil was awful, he over exaggerated. Overall just a disappointing film, especially for Sopranos fans.

Michael Gandolfini did an awesome job at playing a young Tony, but we only got to see him a handful of times, which was a shame. What the heck was up with the Frank Lucas scene too?

210,lp-27434,Missed Opportunity,5,8 October 2021,The public narrative of this movie was we were to see how Dicky Moltosanti influenced Tony Soprano's life and eventually Dicky's son Christopher. Instead they tried to vaguely introduce the main Sopranos character into a sloppy story with no character development. They should've kept the majority of the story on Dicky and Tony and not add in tid bits of characters.The acting overall was very good but the directing and script left a lot to be desired.

How is this co written by the creator of the Sopranos?If this movie had nothing to do with the Sopranos it would be mediocre with an overly abrupt ending. Compared to a similar movie like A Bronx tale it has no soul.But as a prequel to the Sopranos it is badly written, paced, and at times boring.Some of the performances were good, and you can tell the actors really tried their best to portray their older counterpart. But ultimately most come off as caricatures (especially Silvio). Michael Gandolfini is just too young an actor to pull off Tony, but he does try.The black characters subplot was completely unnecessary, only really planting a seed where someone does something unbelievably stupid at a beach (you'll see what I mean). Where does he fit in the Sopranos tale? What the hell is Frank Lucas doing here? Did I just watch beat poetry in a Sopranos movie?I admit I haven't seen the show in a few years, but have watched it several times start to finish.

212,sdavid-41660,The Prequel Pales in Comparison,2,2 October 2021,"""The Many Saints of Newark"" was supposed to be a prequel to The Sopranos, showing how a teenaged Tony was mentored by Dickie Moltisanti, who influenced him into a life of crime.Fans of The Sopranos know that Dickie was Christopher Moltisanti's father, that Christopher found and killed the former cop who he thought had killed his father, and that in perhaps the most stunning scene in the series, Tony killed Christopher.But instead, The Many Saints was a film about racial tensions in Newark in the late 1960's and the rise of a black gangster named Harold. Dickie's relationship with the young Tony was a subordinate story not explored enough for us to understand how and why Tony was inspired by a character as uncharismatic and as uninteresting as Dickie. Nor were we prepared for a now ""woke"" David Chase, the creative force behind the series and this film, to show the blacks intimidating his Italian crime family. I mean, seriously?Finally, the actors in the film were given the impossible task to create younger versions of Chase's iconic characters; especially the actor playing Silvio Dante, who looked and acted like a grotesque parody of his later self. He prances around like he's constipated.And with all due respect to selecting James Gandolfini's son to play Tony Soprano in his younger years, he is not a professional actor, and despite being the sentimental choice for the role, we can't see his character developing into the narcissistic and fascinating adult Tony we came to know and love in the television series.In fact, this film was a painful reminder of how well James Gandolfini had developed the character of Tony Soprano, and how lucky we were to have an actor of his caliber supported by an outstanding cast to give us arguably the greatest dramatic show in the history of television.Unfortunately this disappointing prequel pales in comparison.",The Many Saints of Newark
213,decarloj,What did I just watch??,2,2 October 2021,"Did the writers even watch the whole series? It's almost as if they just watched youtube clips. 75% of the movie was about Dickie, his lover, his uncle in prison who had no backstory, and a black guy named Harold. None of which had anything to do with the series.Michael Gandolfini had five very short scenes, and there was zero explanation as to why Tony went down the path he did.And the movie had absolutely no plot whatsoever, just a bunch of random scenes that didn't connect.

If you are a true Sopranos fan & have seen the entire series (at least once), you know black people have always been in it. The movie is showing a particular time and that time was during the race riots. In season one, many references are made about racial tensions, and there are often black ""gangstas"", although often two-bit. The difference is that in the movie there is a successful one.The Sopranos was an amazing series so I was surprised this prequel starring James Gandolfini's son could be worthy. It is. How fun to see a story about how Tony became who he was and also the other characters. Great fun. Alessandro Nivola and Vira Farmiga were superb!

Also, a chance to see how Tony made his way into the business from the start was intriguing.A lot of the characters were well played as younger versions from the series. Livia was a nasty codger even as a young mother. And Silvio's rug was perfect, although I always thought he was closer to Tony's age.The two things I found most disappointing were:1) An over reliance on the whole black experience. Yes, I know that the Newark riots and the racial tensions as a result were pretty bad. My hometown got a champion boxer (Marvelous Marvin Hagler) as a result of his family's wish to escape the area. Still, Moltisanti and his gang seemed to pay nothing more than lip service to the problem, except when they were taking their money.2) A noted lack of information about HOW Tony went from football hopeful to gang boss. Uncle Dickie was always there for him, especially when his father went to prison. But there was nothing on how Dickie or others influenced young Tony to ""turn"".Maybe there's a second movie in the works from Dickie's murder to Tony's rise?",The Many Saints of Newark

This film lacked the richness and depth of characters that six plus seasons of ""The Sopranos"" was allowed to develop. The characters from the series that appear in the film are so unrecognizable in appearance and personality that it is as if no one involved in the series was associated with this film. Worst of these was the casting of Johnny Boy Soprano. I cringed every time the actor appeared on screen. The only saving grace was seeing Michael Gandolfini slip into the mantle of the young Anthony Soprano. Though the story line faltered his portrayal of a younger version of the beloved Tony rang true. Seeing how badly the overall film played out i wonder if this would have fared better as a mini-series.

240,susierox,Why?,3,17 October 2021,"We all - every single reviewer here and every single person who went out of there way to watch this movie had such high expectations. You really let us down. Its a wonderful period piece that was touted as Tony's relationship with Dicky, but what this really is, is 6-10 episodes squeezed into 2:30. We miss all the arch's, we miss all the story lines as they are just smashed together for an end result. In this day and age - why couldn't you just make another season of the Sopranos and just call it everyone's backstory? Its not against the rules ... they have taken what seems to be a huge budget, all the time to get a period piece correct and bunch of well cast actors and instead of telling us 1 story, decided to tell us many. I don't know about you, but I was online looking up character names trying to figure out who was who 3x by 15 minutes in. What a confusing clustercrap.",The Many Saints of Newark

It was more like a parody of The Sopranos. The younger version of Sil and Paulie were done so poorly it seemed as if the actors portraying them were doing a parody of them or mocking them. Then there was the fire at Atta Boys. It didn't even look real. It looked like cartoon. Liotta was also typical Liotta. Why can't he ever present a character with more than one dimension and must he always use that fake forced laugh? He shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near the set of this movie, which was a disaster anyway. So disappointed in this and I waited to see if for so long.

Even if America wasn't jacked to see this and the overwhelming disappointment, this movie would still stink.If David Chase actually tried to make a quality film then he should get his head examined. The script, which was so great in the HBO series, was the absolute worst and seemed like it was written in an afternoon by a Jersey Tollbooth Operator during his lunch break.This series, that was not just groundbreaking and kicked off the new type of TV which brought us Breaking Bad, The Wire and many others, but was a work of art and should have been left alone...",The Many Saints of Newark

I really think some of the wheezers and geezers who seem to have appropriated the word ""woke"" as their own should get a grip - it's only a movie.To expand on my opinion just a little - it may have been a simple and perhaps clumsily executed plot device, but the role of Harold was key, in that it put Dickie in an impossible situation when Giuseppina confessed her infidelity to him. Had it been a white guy, or maybe a made guy, the outcome might have been different, but in Dickie's world, what Giuseppina did was absolutely unforgivable, shaming and diminishing him.

I wasn't expecting a masterpiece like The Irishman, but I had hoped it would be at least as good as an average Sopranos episode. This just ain't it.A lot of it feels rushed. There's not much of a plot that you feel invested in. Last but not least is that Tony is barely in it.After all this time they could have done so much better with a mini series than whatever this is. I can't imagine I'll ever revisit this film because it adds nothing to the backstory of the Sopranos series. What a shame.",The Many Saints of Newark
249,nicktusk-95591,Dickie steals the show,8,7 October 2021,After watching this I genuinely enjoyed it. Michael Gandolfini has potential. Alessandro Nivola stole the show ! It was refreshing to see really Yoda in a gangster role movie. The references to the old characters was remarkably funny. The shooting of the beehive. He never had the makings of a varsity athlete. And uncle Junior falling down the stairs. The strong roles in this movie were Dickie Multi Santi. His father. The Ghoomar. Joey D played a pretty good character. Oh no I said very good for a prequel standards I don't expect too much from these films however I enjoyed it with the same vigor as watching the Sopranos is very interesting and surprisingly good to watch from that perspective. Not sure how it bodes well on the national spectrum movie critics . As a sopranos fan I appreciated the movie. I liked it. Like I said Michael Gandolfini sort of resembles his old man. Couple years more in acting he could probably get there. I know they're going to make more of these I'm sure I'll watch them. Kind of like the Star Wars LOL. The first one to always be the best but it's enjoyable to watch the prequel's.,The Many Saints of Newark

253,ronn214,Reminds me of a recap of a season not yet aired.,5,2 October 2021,"What we have here is an introduction of most of the characters we met in the TV series. It was somewhat interesting but it reminded me of the first prequel to the Alien franchise, Prometheus. OK. Let me be clear. It is 5 stars out of 10. Regular, average, nothing to shout about.In my opinion, the next one should be much better. It should show the rise of Tony Soprano in the organization. This movie just set the tone. We learned a few things we didn't know but it mostly filled in a few gaps and gave us answers to questions we may have had from the series.One thing I really did appreciate was the performance by Vera Farmiga for her performance of Livia, Tony's mother. She nailed it. She truly reminded me of. Nancy Marchand. The mannerisms, the voice inflection, perfect. I can see why the Soprano kids are nutty. Barb was smart to get as far away from those folks as possible. I am looking forward to another 'prequel', hopefully it will be better than this one. One thing I keep seeing in other reviews are people objecting to the African American characters and their storyline. I guess they think they didn't exist in their world, but if any of these people actually paid any attention to the series, it was mentioned many times how the numbers played a big part of the mob back in those days. Tony's first hit was an African American bookie who had a conflict with the crime family. This was all mentioned in the TV series.",The Many Saints of Newark

255,dmoorejr,Split Personality. Another Sequel?,7,2 October 2021,"Is this The Sopranos prequel we've been waiting for? Yes, and no. This film has somewhat of an identity crisis. It doesn't know if it wants to be a Tony Soprano origin movie, or a Moltisanti story. The script tries to juggle both characters within a 2 hr runtime, and by the end I was left wanting to see more. As I felt we never truly get to see Tony become what he turns into in The Sopranos. They cast James Gandolfini's son Michael, and he seemed a bit underutilized. Some of Tony's crew was miscast. The cinematography was great. Editing was fair. Could've tightened things up, I think the back half of the flick flowed better. I really want to see another movie that takes place maybe 5-10 years later. An actual prequel to The Sopranos.",The Many Saints of Newark

259,SnowThatBlows,Never was going to be as good as 'The Sopranos',4,11 October 2021,"'The Sopranos' is one of my favorite television shows of all time, being a timeless masterpiece with outstanding writing and a phenomenal cast; so, I already knew this movie wasn't going to be on par or even near the league of this legendary TV show, but that didn't mean they couldn't have made it better or at least tried.I'm sorry, but I absolutely hate what they did adding the riots in a mafia movie. Not only does it make the movie incredibly messy and sloppy, but it has NOTHING to do with 'The Sopranos'. It's like this movie had nothing to do with 'The Sopranos' and only used references from it to gain attention. I think this could've been much better if it was a mini series, rather than a movie.The acting was really mediocre and let's be honest, we knew none of the actors were going to be as good as the original cast. Alessandro played a pretty meh Dickie Moltisanti where he shines in one scene, and is below average in others. Michael Gandolfini, unfortunately, was the actor I had my hopes up the most thinking he'll make a great Tony Soprano, but he can't act...Not only that, but he is barely in the movie. I'll say he's probably on screen at a maximum of 30m which is disappointing, but he wasn't as good as an actor to really be unfortunate to why he wasn't utilized well. The rest of the cast were pretty meh, John Magaro plays a bad Silvio IMO, he just over-exaggerates the character.The writing and directing here is just plain bad. You can't really put two completely DIFFERENT plots together and expect it to be a well-made movie. The cinematography is somewhat WAY worse than the original TV show, which is sad considering it came out 21 years ago. However, it isn't surprising. 'The Sopranos' has one of the best cinematography i've seen in a long time!I loved Christopher Moltisanti's narration though, it fits him well and he isn't that bad of an narrator; but I do miss him a lot! Good thing we had a entire scene with baby Christopher and Tony.Overall, it's a bad prequel. It does little things right, and many things wrong. I wouldn't say this is a ""pointless"" prequel which most people say because I believe we needed this, but that doesn't make it a good one. It's an necessary film that's unfortunately terrible.",The Many Saints of Newark
260,MrChe,Just an add on to the great TV series,6,7 October 2021,"As the title says, think of it like an addition to the already great TV series which me all loved watching.Well, this story is about young Tony Soprano and his endeavors. This movie is trying to show how Tony Soprano became to be while confusing us with part stories about this future entourage. I did not see this movie as a whole, more like part story written for every character, while not going full depth at least for Tony Soprano for whom I came here to see. Don't get me wrong it's nice to see him as a youngster it just doesn't have that depth. Basically story revolves around his uncle and his anger rather than the mobster story that you expect to see.I don't know if this story is going to get a sequel or maybe a TV show but non the less there should be some closure or similar, just to see how Tony Soprano came to be, because I did not see it in this movie.",The Many Saints of Newark

Alessandro Nivola was convincing, as was Michael Gandolfini and a few others, but it felt like a few strong performances with no purpose, no direction waiting for a good scene.It will tie together a few things from original show, but it seemed only out of obligation to original show.If you were a fan of original show, you will be disappointed.",The Many Saints of Newark

It's dull, it contains lots of current day politics, it clearly has an agenda, and it's woke. This is not what I expected, maybe more fool me. '90s classic gangster movies put this to absolute shame, off the top of my head ""Donnie Brasco"". This is more like some garbage straight-to-streaming movie. On the plus side, a couple of scenes were well shot and looked good, and Alessandro Nivola is still a charismatic performer.

267,iceman-johnson,should have just made cleaver instead,3,3 October 2021,"All that build up ....all the time they had to fine tune this film and make it a masterpiece. What the hell happened ?Was it the terrible cheap cgi backgrounds ,cigarette smoke and fire ?Was it the bad acting?Was the writing ?Was it the plot ?Or was it all of the above?I was expecting a riveting story about a serious gangster battling a drug problem taking his nephew under his wing and showing him the ropes and schooling him on how the mob life really is. Giving him tips on how to be a real leader of men and showing him tricks of the trade and how to outsmart his rivals in the dark underworld of the mob in the race torn streets of newark.What did we get:
a guy with the personality of a potato doing a jimmy the gent impression kills his own dad then starts sleeping with his stepmom, begins to school his nephew in the art of cheek pulling and head rubbing and calling him a gagootz and sealing it with a pinky promise. After a few years of this he gives tony some speakers he's stolen then completely cuts him off after taking advice from a guy in prison who he hardly knows .....all the while has a falling out with a man who used to work for him because this man killed one of his guys trying to get his own gang going and in the end he's taken out for laughing at a throwback gag that was added to story to please the sopranos fans that was honestly funnier in the tv show....im being serious....In the tv series dickie moltisanti was referred to as a straight up OG but he was also known for being a degenerate junkie but in this film he is neither. They make out at the end that he's known for being a junkie because he had antidepressants/antipsychotics in his pockets when they found him dead. Tony had asked dickie to get the drugs to give to livia to stop her being all mean and salty but he never made it so now people assume the pills were his ....oh please..
the guy was supposed to be a gangster, just because they found him with drugs on him didn't make him a junkie,he could have been selling them for all they knew. Its not mentioned once in any of this that anyone thinks he is a junkie or has an addictive personality to anything . I can't even remember him drinking in this tbh. But in the tv series its mentioned a few times that he was a drinker and degenerate drug user and had addiction problems. They really hit a low trying to rewrite him as some sort misunderstood loveable rogue. I was hoping to see a real mean and ruthless mobster unhinged by his drug abuse but he just comes across as a normal wise guy who doesn't really do anything.I hated the nods to the tv show, i'm not talking about the story but the little nods like quotes and such ...uncle june in this is just embarrassing and he's made out to be stupid and a bit thick.they even have him quoting famous quotes from the tv series thinking they are doing the fans justice but it just came across as stupid. A one off quote as a nod, yeah, but pretty much all that came out of this guys mouth was lines from the tv show. It was like something out of a terrible comedy sketch. Also in the series uncle june was only the way he was due to being old and eventually getting alzheimer's. It was said in the tv show he was a man to be feared in his day and was sharp as an arrow in this he's a bumbling idiot who nobody respects. Also in this he reminds me more of eddie hitler from the tv show ""bottom"" more the uncle juniorthe nattration at the beginning is cheesy and not needed. Why is chris moltisanti narrating his dad's story? Is it because he's dead he now knows everything ?shouldn't it be dickie narrating his life story now he's dead ? Or is this movie just chris's version of his dad's story who makes his dad out to be a great guy who was misunderstood and tony out to be a complete monster ?There's really no need for him to be in this other than they can attach michael imperioli's name to the film. All he does as a narrator is complain how tony is going to choke him to death later on and how tony only gave his widow his pocket change and then called him soft for moving to the the burbs. The more i think about it now it really does just seem we are being told a story by a bitter ghost whos just making it up as he goes along , i mean, the film starts off in a graveyard showing his grave so this might be the case. Hopefully it is and the real sopranos movie will come out soon and this will have been a red herring or something.We should have had paulie (Tony Sirico )as narrator if they insisted on having one. Would have been far more entertaining listening to him talk about his Ma and prostate problems than most of the crummy dialogue in this.Over all the movie is pretty bad, it's boring, nothing really eventful happens that we haven't seen before a million times ,ray liotta plays ray liotta, then plays a calm ray liotta in prison. The guy who plays sil does a great impression of a guy with no acting skills pretending to be sil. The only saving grace in the film were the actual sopranos family. Jon Bernthal who plays johnny boy absolutely nails it. You really do feel uneasy when he's on screen and he actually came across as a believable gangster with a temper. Vera Farmiga is also great in this film and did an amazing job playing livia. And i gotta give Michael Gandolfini his due i think he did a great job playing his dad he does look out of place in some scenes but really shined in this movie the the phone box part where he lost his temper you can definitely see his dads eyes in that scene . I did think he was completely underused but so were most of the characters i wanted to see.Hardcore soprano fans might wanna give this a miss, its over hyped and the magic that's in the original tv show isn't here , the fanservice they shove into it feels forced and not funny or clever. There's a part where baby chris cries whenever he goes near young tony and it would have been quite clever if it would have been kept short, could have seen if it was noticed by viewers, kinda a is it isnt it moment but it goes on for way to long and young tony even states it that he cries EVERYTIME he goes near him then some random old women who we never see again pipes up and explains it could be because babies remember stuff from the spiritual world before they are born so i guess baby chris saw tony killing him 30 odd years into the future before he was born.and was scared of him ???....riggggght.The subtle nods in the tv show that made you think outside the box or that get fans talking, taking guesses on what it might mean are not here, you are spoon fed them instead like you are slow and wouldn't get themQuite disappointing after waiting all them years but hollywood is trying to relate to everybody instead of a movies intended audience. This could have been an amazing film if they stuck strictly to story and had time to thrash it all out properly but just like the rest of the films they brought out these last few years they have to cram some civil rights message into it or political statement. The days of making films for entertainment purposes seem to be over. It's either that or david chase has lost his touch after years of people praising him and he believes no matter what he puts on screen it will be loved.....
I honestly wish they never bothered now, some things should just be left alone. The sopranos was one of them.",The Many Saints of Newark

270,travisbickle86,Dissapointing,3,23 September 2021,"As someone who has watched the entire Sopranos series at least five times it pains me to say that Many Saints of Newark is a big disappointment. There are a few strong scenes but they are few and far between. The film just feels like a rip-off greatest hits of past Sopranos moments without the clever writing and dry humour simply isn't there. The casting choices are bizarre. Worst of all, and I hate to use this word, it's boring.Nivola is a good actor but he's not convincing as Dickie Moltisanti. None of the characters in Many Saints get an arc or proper development, and as a result, there's no real emotional pay-off in key moments.One of the best cinematic moments is when Dickie kills his Goomar by the beach, which is promptly diminished by an inappropriate, Zach Snyder-esque, needle drop. Why?The only positive take-away is Michael Gandolfini, who lights up the screen. He has a different intensity and charisma than his father, but he definitely has the makings of a varsity actor.Frankly I'm depressed and ashamed, not even Quasimodo could have predicted this.",The Many Saints of Newark

It does however bring back that nostalgia feeling. It was never going to live up to sopranos. Gandolfini's son was good and if they make a sequel in a couple years hopefully he'll be even better. I rate this a 10 because it deserves higher than a 6 and the the love I hold for the sopranos.The only thing that really bugged me is in the show syllabus Tony and pussy look more or less the same age but in the movie Tony is much younger.,The Many Saints of Newark

This is a major part of the whole Mafia folklore in this time period.Yes, some of the actors play the known characters weirdly and over the top while others hit the mark perfectly (Silvio for instance.)
I genuinely think there's a follow up to be had from this story and Michael Gandolfini while teasingly used is brilliant and you can see he's watched his father carefully for Tony's nuances.I loved it, you might not but don't expect 9 years of phenomenal writing and storytelling to be rammed into 2 hours, it's a different animal entirely.",The Many Saints of Newark

Spent the last 2 months re-watching the entire series of The Sopranos to build me up for this film. It was so boring that I kept getting distracted and couldn't really focus on it...it took me a full 6 hours to complete it. I would lose interest so much and have to rewind it to see if I'd missed anything. Spoiler alert.. I didn't miss anything. You can't be woke enough these days...when are they going to realize that woke isn't for the masses and it's certainly not for Sopranos fans.,The Many Saints of Newark
283,jimsweezey,Does Everything Have To Be A Masterpiece?,10,3 October 2021,"Does everything have to be a masterpiece for people to enjoy it? Could the film have been better? Sure. Most movies could. A couple years ago when I read about David Chase doing this movie I read it was going to be mainly about the race riots with the early Sopranos characters in it. Obviously he made it more about Dickie, showed some Tony and glimpses of his crew and family but come on. I don't see how a die hard Sopranos fan doesn't enjoy the ride.All the nods to episodes and Easter eggs were great for me. I think it shows that legends are just that. Legend. Stories. Tony built up who's Dickie was probably the same as his father. Same as Christopher did to Tony and look how that turned out. I think it brought even more realness to the show as showing they were normal human beings not movie star gangsters. Some of the stories from
The show clearly weren't remembered correctly or were embellished when told so when we see what really happened we're supposed to be disappointed? No thanks.I don't want to leave any spoilers so I won't go on but the Sopranos is my single favorite show of all time and I watch everything. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Gave it a 10 to try to weigh against the IMDB professional movie critics that love to explain why something with so much hype was no good.-SweeZ-",The Many Saints of Newark

All the main reviews and studio media said it works as a stand alone film and easily watched by non sopranos viewers, but I would suggest anyone who hasn't seen the sopranos would be a little confused and wondering about some of the character portrayals.I'm guessing this is one of a series of planned films as it didn't really go very far into the soprano family involvement in 'this thing'.Definitely a fan movie, but worth watching.",The Many Saints of Newark
285,joe-cope-74-826665,A love letter to fans,7,2 October 2021,"I laughed all the way through this film as I did with sopranos. It's really hard not to compare the two but with the many references it was hard not to. I want to see more back to/history to the characters and felt that this could have been done with a mini series. Even though he cracked me up Corey stoll playing junior was too old and big. Awesome little sayings here and there but overall didn't believe. Sorry for negatives... overall I loved it... definitely has the DNA of the series. Great music. Michael Gandolfini is great, so is Nivola and liotta! Bring on a mini series for Tony's 20s I say!",The Many Saints of Newark
286,RedrumNeddy,Could have been more,7,2 October 2021,"After so much time, it is finally here. Many Saints of Newark.First, my opinion is that this is first and foremost a story about the Newark Riots that happened in 1967. I read multiple times that David Chase wanted to make a movie or something about that, but, he did not have the backing to do so. He just decided that he would make a movie about that, and throw in some Sopranos into it to sell tickets.What confuses me, is that the Riots are not really a major focus in this movie. Instead, it primarily focuses on Dickie Moltisanti, Christophers father. Alessandro Nivola does a pretty good job. I have no complaints about this casting choice. Characters that have great actors behind them are definitely Lidia, Silvio, Johnny and Junior. Paulie and Puss were okay.Michael Gandolfini did a solid job, however, the enormous shadow of his father is pretty much impossible to step out of, and he will forever be compared and ultimately fail to match his father in this specific role. He did try his best however, and i cannot imagine how much of a burden this role was to him. I think he was used pretty well.What irks me about this movie is the way they used Johnny, Hollywood Dick and his brother. Seeing Ray Liotta portray two characters that look absolutely the same was slightly confusing to be honest. The whole plot with Dickie killing his father and then seeking advice from his brother was really strange. We saw almost nothing from Johnny Boy, which is a shame, since Jon Bernthal is a fantastic actor and he found his footing easily in this role. I also love the fact that Michael Imperioli is the narrator.And we come to the biggest problem of this movie: It basically has no coherent plot. It tries to tell so many stories and gives us some hilarious moments and answers a couple questions from the show, but it ultimately falls flat on its ass when it comes to telling a coherent and precise story that we didnt see or hear about before. I do not know what to think about this Riots storyline and the Harold character is just thrown in there for no apparent reason. I really wish that this was made into a 10 episode mini-series, where Chase could explore Tony Soprano as a kid, Tony Soprano as a teen, and also explore the Riots storyline and Dickie Moltisanti.The movie as it stands right now, is a convoluted mess from a storyline perspective, but it delivers in everything else. You honestly should not watch this if you are not a hardcore fan of the show. You WILL be disappointed.",The Many Saints of Newark
287,manny9906,Solid Prequel!,7,30 October 2021,I enjoyed everything about this prequel. Left me wanting to see more of all of these great TV icons created by Chase. They always talked about Dickie Moltisanti on the show. Here's his tale. Worth the watch for any true sopranos fans. The gangs all here in younger versions. Makes we want to hope for a prequel series.,The Many Saints of Newark
288,danstevon,This Thing Of Ours...,7,22 September 2021,"The rating of 8.9 will fall right down once a good amount of people have viewed TMSON and left a review. Is it a gangster film? Yes. Is it a good film? Yes.The problem is it's not really the Soprano's prequel we were led to believe we were going to get. Or was I wrong in thinking this was the story of Tony Soprano's formative years? Most of the promotion for this film seemed to give us that impression, when in truth Tony Soprano is pretty much a character on the fringes of the story that seems shoehorned in to make it a ""Soprano"" story.Yes it's got a good few characters from the series in it, but for me I just felt a little misled. The film focuses on, for the main part Tony's uncle, who along with his brother and a few others seem to be more low level hoods than actual ""made"" men.There was no Tony Soprano kind of earning his stripes, working his way up to be Capo and eventually the boss.Maybe I'll feel differently after another viewing but I felt I came out the cinema feeling I hadn't watched a Soprano movie, just another 60/70's set gangster movie. It also felt like it was a remake of Goodfellas in places too.There's a lot to like, the acting is great, soundtrack great, it looks great too but unless you're a massive Soprano's fan you can probably wait for it to hit Netflix. Would've made a brilliant series though. Wasted opportunity in some respects.",The Many Saints of Newark

But I enjoyed the many saints of Newark, it answers many questions about the origins of many of the characters. And I watched the entire series, not once but 3 times, and yes I was disappointed with that last episode like many others. Waiting for more sopranos for many years , just like the many years waiting for Twin Peaks the return. Another great tv show. The cast in many saints does very good but my only complaint is it should've been a longer movie. And hopefully they will do another movie covering a young adult Tony Soprano. I thought Micheal Gandofini does a great job playing his real life Father. And many props to Vera Farmica as his very cold hearted mother.

The plot line is so random at times and the dialogue is very confusing. The acting was good, but could not make up for the horrible plot line and unnatural dialogue.As a huge Sopranos fan, this movie didn't feel the same at all and Tony's character development is extremely poor when compared to the TV show.

297,KahlilHerring,Perfect extenstion of the Sopranos (ignore 1&2 stars),9,2 October 2021,"""Felt like 2 top-notch episodes in a row"" were my thoughts as soon as the movie finished.You can tell everyone really wanted to do this name justice, it felt like I was watching the legit younger versions of our beloveds, then add in the continuity of the direction, (alan/chase) it was like I was right at home binging the show.To start and end with the only negative I have. It should've been a 3 or 4 part mini-series for sure. I was really warming up to Dickie in all honesty right before the movie's last moments. Other than that I have no complaints. Everyone did better than great. Especially to be transported back into a 20+ year old world w/o a hitch, that's gotta count for something in itself, to the actors specifically. Like a natural extension.I was skeptical because of the low score here, but glad I went. It's either a lot of new comers expecting a gangster tony soprano prequel, or ""fans"" who may have to rewatch again and understand why you enjoy the show in the first place.All the actors were able to sit in the characters comfortably and a lot of subtle characteristics from the 1st gen shined through them easily.I wouldn't mind more stories from the past that unlock more keys to the show's questions. Just don't milk it and keep the same continuity. I really couldn't have asked for a better prequel to the greatest show of all time.Also Harold was a very welcomed addition. An extra 30min would've gave everyone more breathing room to do their thing. But I get why David kept it right at 2.(really an 8, but evening out the reveiewbombing)",The Many Saints of Newark

But even there it doesn't add much since the almost entire focus is on a character I don't even recall in any way from the series.

Yes, he features in it but he is no way the main character, instead it's his much idolised uncle.Overall, the limited thread of plot that exists is interesting, the cinematography is gorgeous, the narrative is very interesting and somewhat touching in nature, the acting for the most part excellent (although there are some bad imitations of younger characters from the series among the way) but the real stand out is the writing... An excellent script and actually by the end, at least in my opinion, deeply thought provoking and profound...Very pleased.",The Many Saints of Newark

We went in thinking this was going to show us how Tony soprano became who he was in the show. It was quite the letdown. He focused more on Christophers father and Toni was more of an outlier. Way too many questions are still left after watching it. When Johnny got home from prison there was three kids. In the shower there was only two.

307,thompson12001,Probably Not Chases's Full Vision,6,2 October 2021,"This movie was pretty meh. It would've been a lot better if all the time they spent on Harold was deleted and used for scenes with Tony and Dickie as well as actually building up real tension between Junior and Dickie.There is absolutely no point in Harold's character or adding in Frank Lucas. Seems like some mandates were made by studio executives to add some prominent African American characters. This movie was supposed to be fan service for the show but adding in racial strife and taking away time from mafioso characters in a two hour movie doesn't make sense.Furthermore there's no way that they're going to let Harold live after the drive-by he pulled, regardless of Dickie. Not a chance in the Sopranos universe.Major plot points felt forced and rushed: no bonding between Tony and Dickie, no buildup for Josefina sleeping with Harold, no tension between Junior and Dickie to justify a hit, no reason for Dickie to attack another made guy he just ate with.Lastly Dickie's and Josefina's tragic final day together was way too reminiscent of Noodles and Deborah's ill fated date from Once Upon a Time in America.

While I wouldn't consider The Sopranos to be one of my favorite shows, I was still looking forward to The Many Saints of Newark. Now that I watched it, I'd say it was a decent prequel to the TV show.Right off the bat, the best aspect about The Many Saints of Newark was the relationship between Dickie Moltisanti and Tony Soprano. Their scenes together serve as the heart of the movie. I know some people may be bothered by the fact that the movie is more about Dickie than Tony, but I didn't mind that. I actually thought Dickie was an interesting protagonist. His actor, Aleesandro Nivola, delivered a great performance.While I enjoyed The Many Saints of Newark, there were still some aspects I didn't like. The biggest issue I had was its ending. It felt like the entire movie was building up to a final confrontation between Dickie and Harold, but instead Dickie gets killed off by Junior. Well, technically he was killed off by one of Junior's goons. What was the point of having Harold in the movie if he wasn't going to be Dickie's killer? Was this to subvert expectations? I didn't really care about Harold, but at least his character would've had a purpose if he was the one who killed Dickie. Now Harold's scenes just feel like filler.Overall, The Many Saints of Newark was a decent prequel to a good show. While the movie had good performances and an interesting story, the ending would've been a lot better if Harold was the one who killed Dickie.

331,cmdown-50506,Great acting terrible writing,7,4 October 2021,"This should have been a series, it was too crammed up for a two hour film. The worst part is how they decided to end it if they haven't even committed to a sequel. Loved the callbacks to the show and the acting was great but it felt like somewhere down the line they forgot they were writing a sopranos prequel.Now if they actually are planning sequels it makes sense to build the other characters up so you know who Tony is going up against but apparently they don't even know if one is happening so a lot are scenes are wasted if no sequel is on the books.The character development is a little ambiguous and not so in your face that you can easily miss it if you're not paying attention, the main character reflects the older Tony Soprano we all know and love in many ways and I liked how they were subtle with the cues. I loved how Christopher was the narrator as it connected you instantly to the sopranos world.Overall its an enjoyable watch but I can also see why this has received negative reviews. If they decide not to make a sequel I'd probably knock it down to a 4.",The Many Saints of Newark

334,filoppi,A fine movie,7,3 October 2021,"An enjoyable watch.People seemed to expect something that this movie was clearly not going to be.I've seen people complaining about the plot not being strong, I'm guessing because there is no major threat in the movie, but that just wasn't its point. We have plenty of good Mafia movies and this one was meant to flash out Dickie and a young Tony. Putting the focus on an actual Mafia story would have taken away from that. This solely lives in function of being a prequel to the TV show, and I'm fine with that.Others complained about the characters not being flashed out. But how can you flesh out 20 characters in 2 hours?A minority complained about the woke messages (black community) and plot points left hanging, but while these are good points, I felt like they belonged and added to the atmosphere of the 60s/70s, plus the story will probably continue in some way.The acting was mostly great, especially Dickie and Livia, but some young versions of Sopranos characters felt like caricatures.Dickie is a great and likable character, and while he's not as fleshed out as Tony, because there simply wasn't enough time, I felt like there was a lot more to him.I wasn't too happy with the exaggerated fan service references, but I didn't hate them, and some were fun. Some dark humor is there but probably not as much as the Sopranos.Overall, sure it's got some defects, as it feels like a crammed pilot for a 10 episode show that would have probably been better as a 3 hour movie, but it hooked me and I was genuinely interested in the world and the story.I wanna see more of it, even if I'm not expecting anything on the level of the Sopranos, especially after the last major event of the movie, which though understandable, it let me down.",The Many Saints of Newark

Much of what keeps the film going is subtle fan service, and if you don't pick up on it I can easily see how things would be boring. Otherwise, the movie is acted brilliantly and if there was an Oscar for casting this deserves it. Almost every actor plays their character to a tee in comparison to the show. There is a lot of interesting context going on between these characters that only exists given the backstory of what happens to them or their children, so the show is essential here. I enjoyed it overall but there were definitely some pacing issues towards the last act. Even then, it's a worthy contribution to the series and adds some serious context that allows it to stand on its own significance.",The Many Saints of Newark
337,theord,David Chase Should Be Ashamed of Himself,1,3 October 2021,"There are two plausible explanations for the existence of this film. The generous one is that it is somehow intended to be an homage to the late, great James Gandolfini, and indeed his son puts in a near pitch-perfect performance, absolutely nailing his father's physical demeanor and gestures. The other is that somebody needed the money. The writing of this thing is so bad it would be laughable if it were not degrading the memory of the original series. I won't give anything away here, but suffice it to say that there's a lack of continuity in the story line, which itself deviates massively from the original, and at least two scenes so lacking in motivation and credibility that we should have turned it off then and there, and mainly stayed with it to the end just to see now very bad it would get, and, brother, let me tell you, the end was as bad as they come. The framing device of having Chris Moltisanti speak from the grave (no real spoler there; it starts from frame one) seems to have been an afterthought, as a way of trying to make this pile of disparate nonsense hold together.

The storyline and its links to the show work very well, and it keeps you on your toes with the usual sopranos shock events .

340,geekhead,Sadly dissapointing - Not Enough Sopranos,5,1 October 2021,"Unfortunately while I wanted to love this movie, I found it never got on track and seemed to lumber alongside where it belonged. I was expecting it to focus on younger versions of the characters we came to know and love in the Sopranos. Instead, there was too little of that, and what was there of the characters was disjointed without any compelling main theme tying their scenes/stories together so that their appearances felt downright anecdotal.Vera was great as Livia, and had more scenes than the rest of them (or made the most of the scenes she had), and the actor who played Sil had his walk and mannerisms down, but we barely heard from him.In the series what made it so compelling (along with the storylines) was the characters were compelling. In this case, the script did not allow any to shine because they weren't given anything to work with.I read that Chase was interested in exploring the racial tensions in Newark in the 60s. Maybe he should have made a separate movie about that, and dedicated The Many Saints of Newark to being a true sequel to The Sopranos. Not a hodgepodge that couldn't do the sequel justice.",The Many Saints of Newark

I think that we all went into this KNOWING it wasn't going to be perfect, it's hard to follow up the greatest TV series of all time.I honestly don't see why everyone is complaining about the setting amongst the race riots. I don't think they put the emphasis on the racial tension to be ""woke"" I think it was more so a way to implement Harold as a Character, who I believe was only a character of importance to throw us off in the end when we find out it was Junior who killed Dickie. (sorry if you didn't know, you were warned about the spoilers)Some of the characters were certainly a little goofy, but once again it's hard to follow up the best TV show of all time. I thought most of the cast selection was really good. Although I'm not too sure about Liotta having two characters, was that laziness or were they trying to be quirky? I especially enjoyed watching Farmiga, Gandolfini, Stoll, Magnussen, and Nivola. I felt they fit really good into their roles, despite going into this movie nervous about Magnussen as Paulie; he really surprised me.With all that said I believe this was a really good movie. I'm not sure if a person who hasn't watched the series would really understand in full what's going on, but who cares; you knew it was a follow up to the show.",The Many Saints of Newark

What stood out to me more than anything was the actual film work. The Cinematography and editing were superb. They explored different camera angles and lighting and put together a score that transported me out of 2021. The costume and make up team and set designers will definitely be nominated for an Oscar.All the little intangibles that really go into making the movie were executed flawlessly. 8.7/10Original: Ignore the poor ratings and reviews. This film is absolutely amazing. The camera work, the score, sound & video editing and all behind the scenes work is breathtaking. The acting of the cast is superb and every actor became their role.

348,grinningelvis,You get out of it what you put into it...,9,1 October 2021,"The movie Christopher wanted to write? As a standalone Sopranos addendum, there isn't a wasted moment in this 2 hour plus film. If there's any fair criticism of it, ""The Many Saints"" is probably completely alienating and dull to Sopranos newcomers and a huge disappointment to casual fans. But you get the sense early on that Chase isn't particularly interested in fan service or in breaking new ground. ""Saints"" is a contained story packed with easter eggs, sidenotes, and surprises, and for Sopranos devotees, it's a riveting supplement to Chase's universe. More than anything, the film hammers home the idea of perspective. The film frequently revisits scenes from the series, sometimes revealing alternate narratives and lies and exposing deeply guarded secrets. It also adds a layer to the ""other side of the tracks"" victimization narrative that Tony and his crew so often resort to when justifying any violence and wrongdoing. The film isn't interested in big moments or filling in gaps, but rather highlighting patterns and parallels, transforming a rote gangster flick into something cooly meta. The resulting story is hardly an original one, but it nonetheless brings certain moments from the series into laser focus - Vera Farmiga's uncanny resemblance to Edie Falco, Uncle Junior's suspicious impotence, Christopher's mother's ""addiction"", the bid motif...the film leans on the series and simultaneously creates new mysteries and conspiracies.No doubt, many people will be disappointed. It's a compact story living in a universe that was made extraordinary by its slow, meditative pace and nuance. But I found myself in awe, eager to just push play again.",The Many Saints of Newark
349,mattpope384,It was.....Cinematic,6,3 October 2021,"To paraphrase one of Patsy Parisi's more famous lines from the series: The Many Saints of Newark IS cinematic....and that's where it's going to disappoint fans.The film is well shot and directed, the cast does a good job of playing young versions of the series' main cast, and there is saga-like ambition in the use of the Newark race riots to backdrop the action, but The Many Saints of Newark ends up feeling grim and somber, lacking much of the series' dark humor and use of everyday banality as a relatable plot device.We don't gain insights into why Dickie Moltisanti was such a legendary figure, nor do we come to really understand his influence on young Tony Soprano. Mostly we're just shown that Dickie and Tony's relationship would be the model for Tony and Christopher's.A storyline focusing on black gangs organizing to take control of the numbers action in their communities, and away from the Italian mob, would make more sense if this had been a two-part opener for a new series. But in the context of a one-off movie it doesn't payoff in any meaningful way other than as an historical insight into what was going on in the Newark underworld at that time (and maybe, obliquely, to the Willie Overalls plot point in the series).Similarly, and again in a callback to Patsy Parisi, this movie uses the Sopranos' technique of having one actor play a set of twins. In this case though, this subplot also doesn't seem to make much sense. Perhaps the jailhouse discussions between Dickie and Sally were meant to serve the same purpose as Tony's conversations with Dr. Melfi: a Greek Chorus into the protagonist's thought process, but except for one key bit of advice Sally gives at the end, it also seems like a lot of build up for no significant payoff.There are vignettes meant to indicate Tony's ultimate evolution into a crime boss but nothing really convincing. Perhaps the producers didn't want to be too on-the-nose with young Tony, but an onscreen depiction of something like the robbery of Feech LaManna's card game probably would have made more sense to audiences than the few petty crimes we do see.Ultimately this would have been a great opener for a new TV series- one that I would definitely want to watch- but as a movie it felt rushed and disjointed, without sufficient time to explore some potentially intriguing characters and themes. It was cinematic in its style and tone but ultimately too thin in its substance to stand alone as an attempt to contextualize the groundbreaking Sopranos series.",The Many Saints of Newark

Alessandro Nivola as Dickie is a character you kinda want to care about, but his story is so pedestrian, so meh, you ultimately feel why bother.The same could be said for Leslie Odom Jr. As Harold.

386,KinoCynic,"""David! Many Saints! I liked it!""",7,9 October 2021,"Many Saints of Newark is a really enjoyable film, even though it's a bit messy and seems unfinished.Where this film excels is the characters. We learn more about Tony, Junior, and Christopher through his father Dickie. Each character has their moment of excellence. Tony has a brilliant scene talking to Livia, played brilliantly by Michael Gandolfini and Vera Farmiga. Junior has a big moment that puts a storyline from the Sopranos in a new perspective. Dickie Moltisanti was a good choice to set the film around. He shows moments of altruistic benevolence and violent malevolence throughout, constantly conflicted by the two. Harold, a new character, is a pretty complex and bold character. The film shows race riots in Newark and how it leads him to black empowerment, yet shows him no sympathy, as he's still a murderous criminal no different from Dickie's crew. Chase and crew took a creative risk by portraying him this way, and it paid off well.Everyone's giving it their all with the acting as well. Vera Farmiga is brilliant in every scene she's in. I liked Billy Magnussen as Paulie. He doesn't have much screen time, but he was how I imagined Paulie in his 20s.What lets the film down is a pretty unfocused story, and scenes that really don't need to be there. Ray Liotta is great, but his character doesn't add anything to the film. There's a lot of recaps from the TV show, and as much as I like the character development, it adds to the show and not the film. Harold's storyline basically isn't finished, either. He has a small scene at the end that doesn't wrap anything up. It feels like the story was sacrificed for some scenes that were good, even brilliant, but ultimately don't add up to anything.Many Saints of Newark is good, but disappointing considering how the show it's based on remains one of the best TV shows ever. The film has all the components to be equally brilliant, but ends up feeling a little misjudged. I saw this with two friends who'd never seen the Sopranos, and they both enjoyed it too.Anyway, four dollars a pound.",The Many Saints of Newark

The distribution of the screentime was also very bad in that it was impeding the development and flow of the story. One of the good things about the movie was the acting, Especially Micheal Gandolfini. (If you are reading this right now, I want to say that you rocked in the movie :)On the whole, the movie was not able to make use of the acting talent of the great actors and the story kind of fell short.

389,darryl-johnson,"Pedestrian, boring and filled with bad acting",4,2 October 2021,"'Saints' is an unfocused, boring rudderless mess with some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time.There were too many plotlines running around without proper adult supervision along with a ridiculous Leslie Odom Jr character who should have been whacked within 30 minutes of his screen time.Apparently David Chase wanted to include Odom's character/plotline to say something about the turbulent times concerning African American during that era but I suspect this was a way to expand interest in the film to a broader audience. It fails because the things Odom's character gets away with in this film vs connected Italian mobsters is not believable.The acting in general is simply bad along with some of the makeup ideals (Silvio's hair is cringe worthy). John Magaro's Silvio was so awful I thought it was an intentional parody of Steven Van Zant's brilliant portrayal.Ray Liotta redeems himself with his portrayal of imprisoned Sal ""Sally"" Moltisanti because his acting was awfully bad as Aldo ""Hollywood Dick"" Moltisanti (he plays brothers in the film and it is never discussed whether the brothers were twins... Chase did nothing to make the characters look different).Michael Gandolfini looks like his dad and that's the best I can say about his participation in this project. His character (teenager Tony Soprano) is critical to the movie and he simply isn't up to it.This movie does little to enrich The Sopranos. If 'Saints' is an example of what to expect as a result of David Chase's recently announced development deal with HBO expect more disappointment.",The Many Saints of Newark

Why he loves him so much and all. Tony told Christopher that his father was a legend. Why? He did nothing different or greater than the others.

399,liberalareblowhacks,Yawn...,3,18 October 2021,"I'll keep it brief. SPOILERS AHEAD. This is not a movie about Tony Soprano's youth and transition into street hood. This was a woke clown act that tried to see how many stereotypical Italian phrases and gestures it could shove into one movie. Young Paulie, Sil, and Pussy make no impact and are easily forgettable. The main character, Dickie, doesn't have a single quality that allows the viewer to attach to him. He's a raging psycho with a temper problem and has no filter for anything that he does. I get that a lot of mob guys are psychopaths in their own way, but Dickie impulsively beating the crap out of his father and killing him in the car didn't seem authentic to me. It seemed like a forced, excessive way of getting a reaction from the viewer, which it certainly got, but not the one they were looking for. The little Italian actress playing Dickie's girlfriend was certainly cute to look at, but more annoying than anything. She repeats practically everything she hears and sounds like she's confused most of the time. I was relieved when Dickie finally drowned her and put her Chef Boyardee act to rest. If only Dickie would've drowned the entire production crew before this movie was finished...Gandolfini's son, Michael, was certainly the most hyped part of this movie. The guy does OKAY, as far as the material he was given to work with. I still struggle with believing that he becomes the same Tony we see on the Sopranos TV series. Something about it doesn't completely connect. Then again, it isn't so much Michael's fault as it is the morons who made this movie and decided to NOT focus on Tony's youth, like they had lied about in the marketing.Plainly speaking, you cannot ever create magic in a bottle the same way twice. Aside from the names used in the movie, this did not feel at all connected to the TV series, visually or thematically. They must've hired the very first group of actors that auditioned and called it a day. Others have already commented on the forced racial storyline (God forbid if we didn't have that, right woketards?), so I won't even bother. Save your good, entertaining memories of the Sopranos TV show and forget this crapfest ever existed. You won't bother ever rewatching it.",The Many Saints of Newark
400,conn-57441,The beginnings of a Soprano,8,22 September 2021,"Let me start off this review by saying I'm a big fan of The Sopranos, it is easily one of my most rewatched shows of all time!So when I first heard they were making a prequel I was a little skeptical. Even with David Chase on board I was nervous that this film could potentially tarnish the series legacy.However once the first trailer dropped, seeing Dickie Moltisanti running his crew, Micheal Gandolfini stepping into his fathers shoes and hearing that iconic theme song all my fears disappeared!Once I see the actual film though it was not entirely what I expected, and that is not necessarily a good or bad point.Let me start off with some of things I loved;
The casting in this film is outstanding, not only do all the actors manage to capture the younger versions of themselves so well, they convey everything down to their mannerisms with ease ( Young Tony being expertly played by James' son Micheal is a real emotional highlight).This film also contains much of the witty dialogue and dark humour the show was known for, this especially being the case whenever we see the young Silvio, Paulie and Pussy.Finally if you are a sopranos fan, there is plenty of references to enjoy and a few secrets revealed that will most definitely surprise. The film also gives more insight into why characters are the way they are in the show, and just put a massive smile seeing these characters we know so well given more backstory.This is where I start going into the possible negatives of the film however;
I do feel that if you are not a soprano fan / or never seen the show, you will not get as much out of this as a fan would. It is a good crime / gangster film, but most definitely made better if you know of the characters and history prior.My other main 'complaint' is the pacing / length of the film. At times certain story beats feel quite rushed especially after an extended first act laying the foundation for the rest of the film. To be honest I just wanted more, especially by the time the credits roll ( which I suppose isn't a bad thing).It must of been quite hard by David Chase to adapt from a 13 hour season to a two hour movie, however both he and Alan Taylor have done a great job with the runtime.All in all I really enjoyed The Many Saints of Newark, if anything I just want to see more of this era in the Sopranos universe, which in turn completely squashed my worries from the beginning!Here's hoping this isn't the end of Tony's Saga!",The Many Saints of Newark

This movie is about a different side of the story, and some people simply can't handle the fact that New Jersey isn't all pearly white.Second, unfortunately the movie itself isn't all that great, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the inclusion of minorities.The acting was dull and boring, and there was really no story except following along Christopher's father day by day. As much as the Soprano kid was applauded for filling his father's shoes, I have to say he was not right for the part. It seemed he always had this ot so subtle smirk screaming ""hey look look at me, I'm Tony and I'm on camera!"" The role needed someone who could bring toughness, a no nonsense guy destined to be a leader. Instead, we got a scrawny kid pulling school pranks with his friends.The most astounding thing to me is that it was actually written by series creator David Chase.

Everyone saw a young Tony Soprano and expected him to be the sociopath he was in show even thought he was ~15/16, but this movie was not about the Soprano Family it was about the Moltisanti family Dickie specifically family you know they guy who was ""Like a god"" to Tony.Lower your expectations you get a world further fleshed out some stories from the show are slightly expanded and enjoy it for what it is.A story about Dickie Moltisanti.",The Many Saints of Newark

There are a lot of character introductions at the beginning that become tiresome. Somehow, the Italian Mafia are portrayed as weak and insignificant in the 60s and 70s.

409,saolivaresm,A Service for fans,7,2 October 2021,"The Sopranos marked as one of the best mafia series with a Tony Soprano as a great reference for that. On this occasion David Chase offers us the prequel to the beginning of the great Tony. Although we have a nice and correct film about the soprano world, there is the feeling that we lacked something else to know about the young Anthony Soprano.Michael Galdonfini generates chills as a young Tony Soprano, the son of the late actor embodies with ease and elegance inheriting such a mythical character from his father. A cast that shines in this prequel where Alessandro Nivola shines as the great protagonist of a film that has all the trimmings of a mafia thriller that we expected to see.A story that goes from more to less and that as it is delivering small gifts to all the faithful followers of the Soprano world, in any case, the film does not finish giving us everything we need to get into Tony's beginnings.There remains the feeling that in its end everything was just beginning, I undoubtedly think that there something we lacked to know. It is an interesting addition to what this movie turns out to be, it returns to deliver what one loved so much about the series, crime, brutality, excesses and entanglements. The film knows how to handle with an intelligent staging all the conflicts and the beginnings of what will be the pure mafia in terms of what surrounds Tony Soprano.An interesting movie for lovers of crime and mafia movies.

And yes, we learn the truth about Dickie's fate...
Now the real disappointments;There was little point in the 60's stuff being so long, bar 1 big event, the Race Riots were too long & (that 1 big event aside again) totally pointless (we pandering here?).Michael Gandolfini is sadly poor. He can't really act, lacks charisma & his speech is weird & slurred.There's very little sign of Tony Soprano in his performance & there's not even any real arc for the character (there's a nice Melfi foreshadowing involving a Guidance Councillor though).Johnny Boy is sidelined & does very little.Janice is wasted too.And it all lacks focus, drive & energy. And simply isn't that entertaining.The biggest problem though is a massive chunk of the film is spent on Harold, an up & coming Black Gangster who means zero to the audience. We're here to see the World & characters of ""The Sopranos"", this ain't it.Why is an entire sequence spent on Black Power beat-poetry? What's with the final credits scene?Are BLM a big part of ""The Sopranos"" audience?We want ""The Sopranos"", this ain't it.So overall...A letdown.Good moments (some nice if brief action/violence too), a few nice backstory reveals, & character moments. But so much wasted time & potential. Most of those backstory moments we were hoping for...just aren't here.I sure wish that time had been spent on, you know, things to actually do with ""The Sopranos""!Harold is easily the second lead character.Find me one fan who heard about this film and was hoping the 2nd lead was a non-Mafia, non-Italian, NON-""SOPRANOS"", Black Gangster character who gets a good 3rd of the running time devoted to his backstory & rise to power (& Black Radical Beat-Poetry!)

Nothing ""woke"" to see here, this is raw as any period piece I have seen. They introduce the real gangster Frank Lucas in the film and actually depict him, not just mentioned in passing, that was very cool. I think if the film had been only about Tony Sopranos childhood, James Gandolfini would have rolled his eyes. James would say you complainers are unworthy to appreciate the craft of film and storytelling and have to politicize what you waste printing, a nothing burger review. Surprisingly for a 2 hour run time the pace is great and I as an adult love character and world building. The writers and filmmakers did a phenomenal job and I plan on seeing this on the big screen.

Dickie Moltisanti was a fine character as well, torn and unhappy. Movie did feel somewhat short though, maybe because I was into it or maybe because, well in the world where most movies now 2.5 hours , this one not hitting 2 hour mark is indeed short.

421,EShy,It doesn't work as a Sopranos story and it doesn't work as a mafia movie.,4,1 October 2021,"There's no mafia story in this movie and the plot is very weak, focusing on irrelevant characters for too long but failling to create any connection to these characters.We have a bunch of mafia guys with no actual enemies. A mistress we don't really care about, since the lead character doesn't seem to really. A ""business associate"" turned rival that only Dickie really interacts with and in the end doesn't seem relevant to anything.The Sopranos connection is weak at best, except for the Junior stuff, but even that is fan service done poorly. Here's that line from the show ""wink wink"".We do get to find out what happened to Dickie, but that would've meant more if it turned out Tony knew when he sent Christopher after his dad's killer in the show.Having Tony Soprano as a teenager wandering through the movie here and there but not really being a part of him was a waste.Prequels are hard, unless you go back far enough where none of the characters are really relevant, you end up winking at the audience and mentioning things that happened instead of focusing on the story.This movie made me appreciate what Better Call Saul does even more.Showing us events that we ""heard"" about, introducing characters we already knew and maybe know where they end up, showing what made a character act a certain way, how they got that scar, it's all fun and good fan service, but you need a story.

The actors they chose to represent the original characters are horrible. Then they bring in the racism. Did it exist, absolutely. Did they have to make the entire movie about it and with a political message, absolutely not. Once again the people at HBO feel the American public are stupid and felt they have to spell everything out.

In the Sopranos, Tony starts off around 40 years old.Pussy is Tony's best friend, and maybe a couple of years older at most. Silvio maybe 5 years older than Tony, and Paulie older again, 15 or so older.

You can't get past a couple of the storylines feeling like they didn't even belong.

429,KojakSlapheadTheThird,Better On A Second Viewing,7,24 October 2021,"The Sopranos is my favourite TV show of all time. It makes mafia films like The Godfather or Goodfellas seem almost superficial.What I didn't like:1. The DiMeo mob by the end of the movie seem to have all but forgetten about Harold. This is the same crime family who exacted revenge even against their own e.g Jackie Aprile Jr. To suggest Harold could take on the New Jersey mob with a small gang and come out unscathed is absurd.2. Dickie's new girlfriend sleeping with Harold wasn't explained and made no sense. He wasn't at all abusive towards her. It was incredibly forced and unrealistic. It also made her seem like a strumpet and Harold as a disloyal friend. I'm guessing we were supposed to feel sympathy when Dickie drowned her, but it was the most rewarding part of the film.What I liked:1. Michael Gandolfini nailed his part - he's basically the nervous teenage Tony we saw in the ""In Camelot"" episode. David Chase should re-brand this as a pilot and cast him in a new Sopranos show.2. Closure. When the teenager Tony is inside Holsten's, he finally stands up to leave and then stands at the entrance looking out before leaving. He seems to be standing in the exact spot Tony looks at in the finale before it fades to black. Dickie would have arrived and talked Tony out of a life of crime, but he didn't. It was a pivotal moment. The same place his journey started is the same place it ended (?).3. There's some of the psychology of the TV series. It's what made The Sopranos transcend the mafia genre. The Sopranos was a meticulously crafted tapestry of the human psyche. There's the moment when Dickie has an existentialist crisis and says ""nothing"" just as Livia Sopranos once said from her deathbed, ""it's all a big nothing"".UPDATE: The film is better on a second viewing. Much like ""Made In America"", the movie lends itself to multiple viewings and interpretations.",The Many Saints of Newark

Dickie is not a particularly interesting character. In fact, I think focusing on Johnny Soprano would've made for a way more gripping film. What we end up with is something half-baked, more of a mini series than a stand-alone film.

He was a fairly minor supporting character who wasn't given much to do.#2, I don't think anyone out there was clamoring for The Dickie Moltisani Story. That seemed like an odd and pointless choice by David Chase.#3, it's always difficult to cast younger versions of iconic characters, but I thought there were some really off putting choices that took me out of the story. Particularly Billy Magnussen as Paulie Walnuts.#4, even if you put all of that aside, pretend The Sopranos had no connection to this, and judge it as a stand alone Mafia movie, it was very average at best. It had nothing new to say. You knew two seconds after you saw her that Guiseppina would be Dickie's mistress. The yelling, angry mob wife has been done 1000 times. And obviously Dickie was going to get killed at the end.Maybe Chase is hoping to make another film or two that will further the story of young Tony and actually show his transition from civilian to mobster. If so, I hope he comes up with something a lot more compelling than this. I do think that Michael Gandolfini is a decent actor and looks enough like his dad to pull off Tony Soprano. It remains to be seen if he has the acting chops to truly do justice to his father's legacy, though. Can he actually come across as menacing and intimidating when necessary?

452,oddballloulou,If you're a true fan you'll like it,10,9 October 2021,"Everyone on here complaining about how it doesn't show the history of the characters and of Tony, we just not have watched the same movie.Keep in mind, this movie is called ""The Many Saints of Newark, a Sopranos story"". A SOPRANOS STORY, not a TONY SOPRANO story. Also keep in mind what the word prequel means, a story from before the original show or movie. Dickey is the main guy in the posters and ads, not tony. Moving on....This movie was excellent. Little Easter eggs left in it like Junior saying ""he never had the makings of a varsity athlete"" at dinner.There is nothing ""woke"" about this movie at all. Everyone in here saying ""oh BLM, oh they're trying to be woke"", the race riots in New Jersey actually happened they put it in the movie, it happened during Tony's childhood. If you're upset about them showing that, I think that's just straight you calling yourself out as a racist. Just saying.The movie actually does have A LOT to do with Tony, it shows him and what he does in his childhood often, how his home life effects him later on in life. The scene in the guidance counselor's office, when she is talking to his mother, she tells him how he said a memory of her reading the book to him is one of his best memories, this plays a big part into Tony's character in the show. I know there are many fans out there that fast forward through the therapy scenes, y'all must be the ones saying this movie sucked, because the therapy scenes have a lot to do with Tony's character.As for the scene at the end with Harold (Leslie Odom Jr.), and everyone staring at him, everyone thinks he whacked Dickey, when it was actually Junior! So yes that scene does have a lot to do with the movie.It left it open for another film which I hope they make. And I geeked out with the woke up this morning getting played at the end.And on one more note, I was really bummed that they didn't pan to Tony's headstone in the beginning, just to seal the deal of the great debate of what happened at the end of the show.All in all, this movie is excellent, written and directed by the original writers, not new people trying to be woke and push agendas on everyone.

456,Spiderboy810,"More like ""The Snore-pranos"" (wow, that was bad, even for me)",5,14 October 2021,"I've never seen ""The Sopranos"", but I've heard great things about it. I heard it had great writing, I heard it had shocking twists, I heard it was one of the best shows HBO put out. So, a prequel movie seemed like a great way to get into the show, so much so that an interview with the writer and director of the movie said that was the point of it. What could go wrong?As it turns out, a lot.Let's start with the writing. The film constantly flip-flops between two stories: the standers story about Richard 'Dickie' Moltisanti and his influence on Tony Soprano, and this random story about the start of a black gang in the area. The second story has very little to do with the main plot, only crossing over with each other maybe once or twice. Not to mention that whenever either story starts to get interesting, it jumps to the other one, killing the pacing.Speaking of pacing, that's another problem. The movie tries to cram way too much into it. One second it's talking about Dickie's dealings with the crime family, the next, it's Tony's father coming back home from prison, then Dickie's girlfriend is cheating on him with the leader of the black gang (which is never implied before and seems to serve zero purpose). There's so much in this and so little time to build it. This would have been much better as a mini-series. It would have allowed much more time to build these plot threads into something meaningful, rather than have them just hang around.One of the only good parts about the movie is the acting. The cast does a great job with the script, despite it's shortcomings. They add some sense of emotion and care to an otherwise bland experience.I'm not going to let ""The Many Saints of Newark"" change my opinion on ""The Sopranos"". I'm sure that everything I've heard about that show is true, but this movie seems to be its opposite in every way. The writing is bland and all over the place, the film is rather predictable and by the numbers, and is an easy way to scare someone away from an iconic HBO series. However, despite how true that last comment may be, that shouldn't let this movie scare you away from the series.

For the normal folks, its just a below-average crime TV movie. A lose-lose situation from all angles.The (few) good parts:Vera Farmiga and Corey Stoll are absolutely the best of this movie. Farmiga perfectly encapsulates the hysterical bully temperament of Livia, while Corey low key plays Junior with flawlessness, the scene where he has the accident is pure gold! Every time one or both of them are on screen is a win in my books.The ambiguity of whether the scenes at the prison are real or product of Dickie's imagination is great.And the bad ones:Silvio and Paulie's portraits are so cartoonish that it became cringey, forced and unnecessary.One reviewer here suggests to watch 'Down Neck', 'For All Debts Public and Private' and 'Kennedy and Heidi' beforehand for (quote) ""full appreciation"". Let me tell ya: you don't! The only thing learned from this movie is who killed Dickie, nothing else. It adds nothing to the Sopranos experience, at all. It's just a late 60s early 70s mafia TV movie situated in New Jersey. And even tho, there's no even enough mafia in it.Michael Gandolfini is ok, but with the hand he was dealt, it was impossible to win. Even with the physical resemblance and Tony's mannerisms he's incorporated in his performance, as a young actor, with his first major role in the industry, those were massive shoes to fill. To be honest, the role doesn't demands much from him and ultimately his performance feels flat.In the series, we are lead to believe that Dickie was this visceral and ruthless monster, but even after killing his own father and his 'stepmother-turned-goomar', I was more afraid of Jonny Boy and Hollywood Dick. I know he was supposed to be own 'Tony' for this journey, but Nivola is just too charismatic and in the end it feels Dickie is too.....nice?!The friendship/rivalry between Dickie and Harold could've been explored in a much better way, instead, it just feels rushed and thin.In terms of sequels/prequels, El Camino and BCS are still the best, which is yet another proof that Vince Gilligan is the best TV writer for the last 10 years and probably the next ten!Davis Chase, in several interviews, alluded to the possibility of coming back for another one.

Sure, omitting it would have given more time for the Sopranos and Moltisanti story which would have been better, but at the end of the day it's not a deal breaker and it is historically appropriate.Long and the short is that it's worth watching if you liked the Sopranos, many a nod to the show and some of the characters in it that are interesting and fun and just when you feel it's all a bit stale and nothing's happening, then something comes out to make you smile and recognise this is the same writer.It also feels like this is not the end of the saga, just a first part so I expect that the rather loose end that it finishes on will lead to a rise of Tony Soprano sequel.I for one will watch it if there is. 7/10.",The Many Saints of Newark

It was also lacking good writing, character depth and good acting. It seemed painfully obvious to me that everyone involved was just there for the paycheck. The movie had no heart. No soul.I can see how this poor attempt of a Sopranos film will disappoint die-hard fans of the series.

Every character from The Sopranos series falls into place within that storyline.All of Christopher's wonderings about his Dad are answered in this film. It's all done in a very subtle yet conspicuous way to the devotee of the 86 Sopranos episodes. This includes what Dickie was bringing into the house when he was shot.Having seen the original series many times - front to back - I enjoyed it immensely on that level alone.DM's story is an interesting one. Vera Farmiglia as Olivia is outstanding. And Corey Stoll outdoes himself as Junior. A huge secret involving Junior and Dickie is revealed and that alone warrants your viewing time.Which is 2 very entertaining hours. Anyone who had not seen The Sopranos will struggle with the story... Because discovering David Chase's ""easter egg reveals"" is a big part of the prequel movie's journey.James Gandolfini's kid (Michael) does a great job as teenage Tony. But the real gem is whoever plays Carmela on screen for about 42 seconds. She nails her. I will rewatch soon for that minute alone.I doubt that they'll make a sequel out of this, unless they decide to take teenage Tony into Tony and his 20s... Which could be interesting. Michael did just that well. It is eerie... as if DNA was shared there. LOL.7.3 out of 10 is the right rating for this film. IMDb's And rotten tomato's score.",The Many Saints of Newark

Instead we got nothing but racial tension between a black gang and an Italian gang. Italian gangs and Black gangs almost never butted heads in late 60s early 70s. Should have been an Irish gang similar to the Westies.One of the biggest gripes I had with the movie was the assassination of Dickie came out of nowhere and had very little build up. Junior and other characters like Johnny should have gotten way more screen time than trying to pander to black audiences.At the end of the day this film was given the hype of a young Tony Soprano growing up in a mafia family and how this would evolve him from an athletic high school kid into a hardened criminal. But we didn't get this at all. Instead we saw a race riot that had almost zero explanation on how it was related to the story. A back story on Harold. I mean come on guys we know Harold is a pivotal part of the hit show Sopranos! A love affair with Dickies young Step mom. And with an abrupt ending there felt as if there was supposed to be something there that got axed by the writers.

The movie is incredibly slow moving and centers around Dickie Moltisanti. Very little Tony and even less Johnny (who I was very interested to learn about). I would say the only part I really enjoyed about the movie is Vera Farmiga who did an excellent job as Liv Soprano, maybe a little over the top, but Liv was over the top. Bottom line, without spoilers, is they had a huge opportunity to tell a great origin story, but instead wasted it on a very weak and rushed plot line with little to no character development.

475,The_Garrison,Bait and switch much?,3,27 October 2021,"Mmmm So based on the trailers and how they promoted this film it gave us expectations that this was to set the foundations of how Tony and his crew got to where we picked up at the start of the TV series the Sopranos.Sadly the film delivered almost none of that, yes we got to see the relationship between him and Chris's Dad (Dickie Moltisanti) was born and developed, there was a few cameos of some of the original characters which was nice, all stuff we knew from the trailer.However, it feels they piggy backed off the Sopranos story and its success, to shoe-horn in another narrative that nobody would really be interested in.Make no mistake about it but this is barely a prequel to the fantastic TV series, we got to the end of the film and felt it had never really got going & without the Sopranos gravitas attached to this story, Nobody would ever want to see this film.Sorry state of affairs, its happening way to much recently, Hollywood takes something from the past that was successful, then butchers it and re-brands it because they have some kind of agenda or narrative they want to proclaim to the audience.Stop it!

This is a movie who's risk:reward ratio was just way too high. Sequels are ALWAYS risky. And prequels even more so because of the challenge of depicting characters we think we already know, but in their formative stages. This is a set-up for a let-down because, like your dead best friend, you desperately want to see them again, but you can't. Not because they have left the world but because they have not yet entered it. The challenge of a prequel is to develop characters that interest us and that we can relate to PRIOR to their having become the characters we know while simultaneously revealing HOW these people developed into those known characters. Jeez...thats hard to do. And TMSON does not succeed. There's a lot wrong here. We catch glimpses of the characters we know...not because of their development but because they intentionally utter contrived phrases or display exaggerated mannerisms like a name tag as if to tell the viewer ""I play Uncle June"" and ""I play Silvio"". The charcters are two-dimensional caricatures of Italian-American stereotypes. As an Italian-American who grew up in the 60s-70s, these are not people I recognize. Then there is the contrived insertion of the Black v. Italian storyline that seems to have been written in for political reasons but which seems forced and unsatisfying.

If you took his character out of the movie, it would likely have ended the same, minus Dickie murdering his mistress. It appears that HBO wanted to satiate a need to inject a racial narrative that didn't need one. His character added nothing to the overall storyline or Tony. In fact, I would argue that the lack of substance in wasting time on this narrative stole away from Michael's role playing his fathers beloved character. This was supposed to be a movie about Tony's arc, but was less about Tony and a rise of a character that did not matter.

482,saulbennett,Overall good but not everything hit the right note,7,28 September 2021,"As a huge fan of The Sopranos from the very first episode in 1999, I couldn't wait to see this at the cinema.It starts slow and mainly focuses on Dickie Moltisanti's Dad, played by Ray Liotta, who with no explanation arrives home from Italy with a young Italian wife. A lot of the movie subsequently focuses on her and she is not that interesting really. Nowhere close to someone like Gloria Trillo.We then gradually see familiar faces in Paulie, Pussy, Silvio and Junior. The actors playing Paulie and Junior are excellent, however Silvio is a bit contrived. Junior is undermined by the other members of the crime family and this will result in a great plot twist at the end of the movie. For me the portrayal of a younger Uncle Junior played by Corey Stroll is the best element of the film.We rarely see much of Tony Soprano's father as he is in jail for much of the movie which was disappointing. There are several other mafia guys who we don't get to know much about. Where was the likes of Feech, Richie Aprile, Ray Curto?The majority of the movie is a battle between Dickie Moltisanti and some black small time gangsters that doesn't even get resolved at the end.Overall a good effort and adds to the Sopranos story, however it could have been done better.",The Many Saints of Newark

I wasn't too concerned about whether or not the""movie"" characters perfectly fitted the ""television"" characters from the show. I was impressed that the movie nicely expressed the violence, uncertainty, and ugliness of the era that nurtured the teenage Tony. I grew up during the same period far from Newark and in a ""normal"" dysfunctional American family. The horrors of the Vietnam War were becoming known to average Americans, the political assassinations of the Kennedys & MLK rocked the nation with riots and protests, and lengthy, profound destruction caused by the drug trade all created an unhealthy frightening environment. Dickie Moltisanto's efforts to look after Tony were commendable but a lost cause. Young Tony really didn't exactly have the option of having a good future. I really liked Ray Liotta's performance as the jazz aficionado inmate and his relationship with Dickie. Yes, the movie is horribly violent. I had to close my eyes on more than one occasion. Looking back I remember enjoying very violent movies of the late 60's and early 70's. As a child I was unable to see how disgusting those images are because violence was a normal element in my day-to-day existence as an American.

But I thought it was beautiful. Well shot, we'll acted, good music, great atmosphere. I was immersed into that era from the start.First 30 mins are strong. Now throughout the middle of the movie there were times when the direction was unclear - where is this story going? What is it even about?. I think those are fair criticisms. Individually, every scene is good. But it gets lost at times in the big picture.But I thought the final act brought it all together, with a genuinely unexpected twist towards the end that leaves me with some answered questions.

I love how David Chase was able to show that if Dickie were alive, then Tony wouldn't be dead since he was the role model/father figure that Tony needed. (You can't say Tony didn't die in the series finale of the Sopranos anymore because this movie confirmed it when Dickie said 'as long as I'm here I'll make sure nothing happens to you' after Tony said he wishes to not die being shot in the back). This further proves that Dickie's death is what led to Tony's downfall. Ironically, if Dickie did not die neither would have Christopher Moltisanti which is why the last line of this movie is ""That's the guy, my uncle Tony. The guy I went to hell for"". Now, what I didn't like about this movie is how Dickie died since it felt slightly underwhelming, as if, there should've been more content building up to Dickie's death. Overall, David Chase did a very good job with making the story come full circle by how he connected one man's actions to all of the events we see take place in the Sopranos.",The Many Saints of Newark

I found it draggy and a bit dull where as the series could never be called that.I think I was expecting it to focus mainly on Tony and how he worked his way up the ranks to become the don , but he is actually only really a bit player here and the main focus is largely on the Moltisanti clan.As others have said I think it would have worked better as a series and been given the chance to explore stories and characters in greater depth , rather than this kind of mish mash of half baked ideas chucked into a 2 hour film.I've certainly seen much worse but I wouldn't be in a hurry to watch this again.",The Many Saints of Newark

The detail and the vibe is on par with 'The Irishman' and whoever scouted for the lookalikes did a fantastic job.This movie is designed to be a glimpse into the past of the series, it was never meant to be a full on mob gangster movie. Anyone who is a true Sopranos fan should know that it's more about family emotion and details rather than action and violence. The abrupt ending with the music made the hairs stand up on my neck.

These riots were mentioned many times throughout the series, and there is also the fleshy part of the thigh, The stuff with Meadow's boyfriend, the whole hood project with zelman's civil rights buddy, the rapper massive or whatever trying to get the masters back from hash , it was a frequent topic in the Sopranos. But that said no this movie wasn't very great, it promised to be about Tony's relationship with Dickie Moltisanti, and that was one of the weakest parts of the whole movie. I also think it's probably rude to say this but I don't think Michael did a very good job portraying Tony Soprano. Basically everyone who played younger versions of the characters from the show were during the flashbacks in the series were a better fit, better casting. There was some small enjoyment from seeing impressions of your favorite characters, But some of it was just distracting from the story itself.

510,watsonjeffj-138-134837,Disappointing.,6,1 October 2021,Sopranos fans might get some enjoyment from the fan service but the movie as a whole is disappointing. Some of the actors are just doing impressions of well known characters and sometimes literally quoting the series. The Dickie Moltasanti storyline doesn't really add much to the sopranos mythology and in at least one case detracts from it. It also doesn't really work as a tony soprano origin story. The whole thing is kinda unfocused and without any thread to hold it together.,The Many Saints of Newark
511,MazzyToU,Is it?,6,1 October 2021,"Odd title but, yeah, is it anything to do with The Sopranos? I managed to wade myself through it but apart from the characters names, to me, it had very little to do with The Sopranos. It didnt have the pacing, it didnt have the dynamic or the want to invest myself in the characters. We all knew who most of the characters were but they seemed empty to me. Movie by numbers. Quite a few other reviews on here have suggested that it would have been better served if it was made into a mini-series, and I completely agree. It could have and should have been much more considering that the TV series was such a landmark.",The Many Saints of Newark
512,tormond2,"What did I watch? Did I miss something? Very underwhelmed, so much hype and no delivery. Bummed",5,6 October 2021,"That pretty much sums it up. We see random characters at their younger ages, glimpses of Tony Soprano and nothing close to what was expected. Acting was great, although a few tried a little too hard (Sylvio (?) ) for damn sure seems like a caricature, and others did so well you knew who they were on sight. Gandolfini's son, spot on, massive kudos, as this couldn't have been easy for him at all. Would have loved to see more of him.Stories seemed all over the place, and I feel as though this could have been a better home in the series format as opposed to a film. Shame, It'd have crushed with where it could go! With David Chase at the helm, I thought for sure this was a winner out the gates.Damn...well, so much potential, so very much wanted to enjoy this, but I'm just left missing Sopranos more than I was after two hours of this.",The Many Saints of Newark
513,sfcuchiara,Understanding the Sopranos.,10,18 October 2021,"I watched Saints of Newark twice. First because the anticipation was killing me. If you are expecting a Sopranos episode you will be disappointed. I realized after my first viewing that it was designed to connect all the dots wherein watching it the second time proved excellent for me. The big secret Uncle Jun lived with, meeting Tony's dad, why Tony needed counseling and why he had mother issues, why Dickie was so revered, among other things in general about Tony's team and upbringing. I highly recommend watching it from the perspective of educating yourself about what made The Sopranos what it is. For avid Sopranos fans it opens up great conversation. One piece, however, none of us remember a twin in the family. I can't forget to mention Michael Gandolfini. It was bittersweet meeting him; sadly missing his father while recognizing a new face with strong potential in film.",The Many Saints of Newark

Some of the acting is horrendous and annoying (Silvio).The plot doesn't thicken it just get weaker by the second....... You reach half way through the movie...... it's over!!!Stories that have nothing to do with the Sopranos.HBO should have just left it where it was.The TV series still remains my all time favorite show ever.... This movie has dented it somewhat.I want my money back!,The Many Saints of Newark
515,Ayman_Refaat,"Don't expect ""The Sopranos"" quality",7,3 October 2021,"I can't say the movie disappoints as I didn't have high expectations in the first place. It's an all right movie, it felt good to revisit the world of ""The Sopranos"", but it's important to watch the movie knowing that it's not really about Tony Soprano.It's actually about Richard Moltisanti, which is not a bad thing in itself, Dickie Moltisanti was frequently mentioned in the original series, and it was interesting to get a glimpse of who that man really was.The problem is the movie doesn't explore the relationship between Dickie and young Tony well enough, it doesn't show that huge influence that was often talked about in the series.Also, the movie neutralised the role of Tony's father, just pointing out that he didn't understand or connect with his son, and so wasn't able to guide him, making Dickie more of the real father figure. I'm not sure that was the case when Tony talked about his father's influence in the series, and I see this as a wasted opportunity 'cause Joe Bernthal (the actor portraying Tony's father) is a really good actor and could've done better if given the chance.Vera Farmiga did a good job portraying Tony's erratic mother, and it was fun watching young Paulie and young Silvio.The best performance is, of course, by Alessandro Nivola (Dickie Moltisanti) who had most of the screen time and almost all of the story's focus.Watch the movie if you are a Sopranos fan, but don't expect Sopranos quality.",The Many Saints of Newark

Unfortunately, the movie was a mediocre TV show.The story begins ok, but then very quickly begins to wander around leaving the viewer to wonder where are we going? They treat us to a view of the race riots, remind us Vietnam is in full swing. All very period appropriate, but how do they factor into the story? They don't. I kept waiting for many of these random elements to tie into the plot, and it never happens.Then, worst of all, the movie ends without tying up any plot lines. Clearly they are planning a Soprano's series of movies, but it ends like a TV series episode, all plots hanging open and no resolution. If we hadn't had a gift card, we would have paid $44 to watch what amounts to two episodes of a TV series.I can safely say I won't go to the theater for the next one, and I'll probably only bother watching when I can do it for free. It really wasn't worth paying to see.",The Many Saints of Newark

Michael Gandolfini did a good job. The rest of the cast did well I especially got a kick out of John Magaro, who had Sylvio down pat! I give the movie itself, a big, fat 0. First, the political statement. I see enough of that in the news. I watch movies to escape the BS of the Left. The other thing wrong with the movie? Another abrupt ending that left everybody hanging, just like the final episode of the series. It seems like I missed something... or, rather, the editing room missed something, and dropped a whole scene or more on the cutting room floor. I really wanted to know Tony's final thoughts about. Dickie. Did he get revenge? Did he even want to get revenge? What happened to Harold? How did Tony end up getting into the family business? I'm just glad I didn't have to spend good money at a theater to watch this mess.",The Many Saints of Newark

With the exception of Goodfellas, the sopranos were the first big cult following of Italian mob series/movie, since The Godfather movies. If the Irishman, that follows an irish associate of the Scranton PA crime family gets 4 hours, then how in the hell does the sopranos prequel get only 2 hrs?!There was no character development. Where was the relationship with dickie that made tony the man he is today? Johnny and junior soprano were just characters, but nothing else. How about some more dialogue from Silvio, Paulie and Big puss. That were PIVOTAL supporting characters in the services, but unless someone said their name we'd have no clue who they are. Also, junior had dickie killed?!? How is chase going to create a plot point out of thin air like that? And if so, whack the main character because he laughed at someone?! You could not whack a made guy with the bosses approval and junior was whar, just a soldier in this movie, maybe a capo?Vera Famiga played Olivia soprano perfectly, but that was about it.This movie could have a masterpiece. Unfortunately, when I tell people about the sopranos who have never seen the series, I will not be mentioning this ""thing"" that was directed.",The Many Saints of Newark

The flash backs scenes from the tv show were better than this. If Chase would have kept that cast, that would provided better continuity and would have pulled new viewers of the show if word came out that the same characters in this movie were the same ones played in the show.Too many stories going on at once and it would have been great to see how some early symbols from Tony life would have materialized...ducks come to mind?It would have also been great to see Carmine and his New York crew to be seen in this movie and how that dynamic would play out between the Sopranos and New York.

Obviously it's not going to be as good as a show that had eighty-six episodes, this is only two hours, and like it's predecessor it leaves you wanting more, and they totally could come back and tell more stories. Here's the thing it was the best 2 hours I've had at a movie theatre in a while!The movie does a great job of taking us back to that world of The Sopranos, that world that we never thought we'd see again, but it's all there, and it's truly wonderful. What I really love about the movie is the parallels it has with the show (you'll know them when you seen them) .Overall I think fans are going to love it, and I can only assume for those who haven't seen the sopranos, but has interest in this movie, you will too become fans of The Sopranos family.

That said I thoroughly enjoyed the movie the acting was supert with lots of well cast characters from the series and good storyline with many references to the series without being over the top. If you enjoy mob movies this is certainly a decent film and if you're a Sopranos fan then purely for the nostalgia it's even better. Just have realistic expectations beforehand.

I knew starting it that the movie would be about Dickie Moltisanti, but it was also planted the idea that we'd find out more about Tony Soprano's uprising. No. I didn't even think the delved deep enough into Dickie and his persona enough. It kind of played like an extended flashback episode.There were side stories that, while they were happening during that time, weren't really pertinent to the story, itself.The movie left off with the feeling of, ""Ok..? And then?"" Because it didn't really feel as though the story I was expecting was what I got.Christopher Moltisanti. Yeah. He's dead. But he's the narrator. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if we all remember the show, we all remember what Tony told him about his father's death. Did Christopher somehow find out more information on it in death? I mean, he has visited the other side where everyday is St. Patrick's Day, but if his father revealed who his killer was, maybe Chris would've said something when Tony took him to wack the guy he said did it.Maybe, if they expanded on this story and gave us more of Tony's uprising, it would be more enjoyable, but after having watched it, I'm in the middle on my overall review of it.

Instead, the movie kind of bounces all over the place and there's little time to explore the roots of the characters we're familiar with.

The performance by Ray Liotta was fabulous as the Moltisanti twins, it brought me back to the Newark riots, the cops the groups and Tony Imperiale though there was no mention I think I heard the word vigilante once. It was so reflective of my childhood I didn't want it to end( that cost you a star) the movie is an absolute 10! Born n raised in Greenpoint where segregation wasn't only b&w but Polish, black, Puerto Rican Irish and Italian, yet approaching the late 60s n the drug culture kids would bond in school

Likewise wasn't entirely sure what the filmmakers were going for with the Leslie Odom Jr storyline but it lacked enough depth to make a strong impact.So overall, weak confusing story, but told extremely well nonetheless with good acting and dialogue.",The Many Saints of Newark

I expected a satisfying prequel to The Sopranos, but didn't get one.The casting of Ray Liotta was a major mistake. Twice. Why the producers thought we'd buy him playing Hollywood Dick Moltisante, AND his incarcerated brother, is puzzling. Or just plain stupid. Both roles should have gone to relative unknowns, or at least actors not so easily identifiable by their previous roles, such as GoodFellas. Every scene Liotta was in, had me saying ""that's Henry Hill, but older."" None of his scenes worked for me. Vera Farmiga, just the opposite. She nailed the Olivia Soprano role on the head, with the accent and mannerisms. Michael Gandolfini as the young Tony Soprano had promise. But he wasn't given the screen time as he deserved. Other casting choices were good...for one, the younger Corrado.I wanted to like this, but I can't recommend it. All the other One Star reviews have been accurate. It pretty much stinks.",The Many Saints of Newark

***********
There is much to get excited for as the high production values, good acting and the more than capable cinematography was much evident.Nice opening speaking from the gravestones in particular and if there were to make a series of it, you'd probably have the panning shot of the graves again and voice of the character you are going to portray.From a technical standpoint all was achieved very well.Ray Liotta (ii) was the standout for me.A couple of songs from the era but there wasn't any score to add to the mood of the film's atmosphere.Themes such as honour, duty, misplaced loyalties, betrayal, discrimination, mental health, respect, revenge and wordplay of the title were conveyed adequately.You could even argue that mafia is a metaphor for the government in this film and if you get out of line you get whacked. The ones with the true power, you don't really notice until it is too late.Very understated part when Dickie was in a shootout against Harold which showed that Dickie wasn't completely irredeemable.The Bad
*********The casting was pretty good but, Liotta's young bride seemed a bit off as Richard 'Dickie' Moltisanti (Nivola) later had an affair with. Nivola's wife was better looking in my opinion than his stepmother and it would have been better if the two wives roles were swapped as that would make sense.The Punisher/Johnny Boy Soprano (Jon Bernthal) character could have been fleshed out more as I felt that Dickie/Nivola seemed more like a bit part in his own movie.The pacing was a bit muddled and it seemed more like a soap opera than some of the Sopranos best episodes. (More Soapy than Soprano.)The movie felt lacking as there was little payoff for all of the setups that the movie alluded to.It is a shame, initially it had all the ingredients of being a really good gangster movie but it seemed more like part one of a pilot of a series that needed two or three parts to be of any substance and build up momentum.TLDR
******If you are a fan of the Sopranos you may feel a bit short changed with it but still enjoy it for some characters.(Much preferred the WIre to the Sopranos.)
If you are not a fan of the Sopranos it's like a watching the first part of a (three part) made for TV movie that seems empty, unfinished and very underwhelming. It does have its moments but they are few and far between. (I sense that there may be a directors version/cut that is a LOT longer which may be worth the time.)
Great production values, mostly competent cast but let down by derivative script, poor pacing. I imagine that most of viewers may have expected less Dick(ie) and more Tony.Perhaps it should have been called My Uncle Dickie.Shame such a wasted opportunity.4/10.",The Many Saints of Newark

I could watch Dickie Moltisanti for hours. I was left wanting more, I wanted to see even more of Dickie and I think thats a testament to how enjoyable the film is.

561,webstefan2003,I wanted to like it ...,6,2 October 2021,"God knows I wanted to like it, I wanted to love it given how much I loved the original series and god mob movies in general but this ... this just falls short, short of mob movies and definitley short of The Sopranos.I'll start with the good:
The characters, we get some of the characters we knew and like from the series and some new ones.The cast, mostly good choices especially Gandolfini's son, Alessandro Nivola, Vera Farmiga and the always awesome Ray Liotta.The young Paulie, Silvio and the other guys were fun to see as young wise guys 😊
Michela deRossi in my opinion manages to steal the spotlight in almost every shot she's in, keep an eye on her, she's going places.The nostalgia, yeap I missed the Soprano's world with their manerisms and sayings.The bad:
Oh boy where to start...
The story is rather weak and to be honest I don't think I can name an episode of the series weaker than this.I get it's sort of an origin story with a twist, but it's just not that good, it's rushed, it's unpolished, it's highly anticlimatic.Ray Liotta is gravely underused, Jon Bernthal the same, Vera Farmiga as well.This could have been made easy as a two parter with more character development for Dickie, Johnny and Anthony.Corey Stoll... usually I quite like him and his characters, here though he just doesn't work for me. He looks the part yeah, but he sure doesn't act like it. He's just not Corrado Soprano, he doesn't act like him, he doesn't talk like him.The whole woke feel of it is wrong, I get it's the new trend now but the movie's supposed to happen in the late 60's early 70's, that has no place being there.Dialogues were so much better in the series, but that might be just because the actors were well ... so much better and better cast.All in all it's not a terrible movie or even a bad one, it's an ok one but it just doesn't live up to the Sopranos name.I think if you watch it with the raised bar from the series you won't enjoy it, but if you manage to ignore the series you might like it.Also people who are strange to the series will definitley like it, and get even greater surprise when they get into the series.",The Many Saints of Newark

Nothing I heard or saw in advance of seeing this in the cinema presented the fact that this film is more about Harold McBrayer than any actual Soprano.The acting in most cases was superb and highly entertaining in parts. But the overall story, pacing and loyalty to the subject matter was completely let down by an entirely unnecessary commitment to wokeness and let's face it virtue signaling. Ultimately a pointless story that adds absolutely zero value to Sopranos franchise.",The Many Saints of Newark
564,SCY385-1,A Film That Just Does Not Work And I REALLY Wanted It To!,5,3 October 2021,"First let me say that I am a huge Sopranos fan. I consider it to be one of the finest shows of the 21st century. James Gandolfini's portrayal of mercurial crime boss Tony Soprano was an example of what a good actor can do with the right people, writing and support around him. That being said it pains me to state that this film with all its good intentions feels hollow and somewhat pointless. The film explores the early years of Tony and his family as well as his lifelong connection to organized crime. The problem is that I don't really know anymore than I did before. There isn't really an exploration of these people or what led them into the lives they found themselves in. And why isn't this explored in more depth? Because this is the right idea in the wrong forum. One of the reasons The Sopranos worked SO well was because we got to know the characters because they could be laid out more thoroughly on a television show. It is hard to get all that nuance in a two hour movie. It is not enough to know names and see physical similarities. We need the particular quirks of the characters which the show was very good at. Oh there are some signs of the nuances that made the show so wonderful, but ultimately I felt cheated in some way. I recommend watching the film if you are a die hard fan of the show nonetheless. Just don't expect to much and certainly don't expect anywhere near the superior quality of the show. RIP James Gandolfini.",The Many Saints of Newark
565,jamesjvarela,Missed Opportunity,3,4 October 2021,"The Sopranos saga really needed a back story but this one did not do it for me. The whole story could have been done much better, the plot is weak and does not really go into what was happening in Tony's life as a teen in the late 60s early 70s. They would have been better off doing the plot starting in 1977 not 1967 and go up to his father's death. The writers could have shown a more in depth relationship between Dickie and Tony and Tony's reaction to his death, more background on home Tony met Carmella etc. I could go on all day.

I do not write reviews often however I am a massive movie / tv show watcher. I was totally let down by this film. The editing, plot pacing, are totally off. It feels like they filmed 30 hours of Material, slapped 2 hours of it together and tried to see what would stick. Tony Soprano is hardly in it. The film is billed as titled ""A Sopranos story"". This couldn't be farther from the truth. Other gangs and random people have much more screen time than any Soprano in this movie. I'm not going to even go into the ""woke"" parts of the movie because frankly it's not even needed. It's a obvious fact that this isn't a Sopranos movie.Young Mr Gandolfini should be ashamed to be in this mess.

Boy did this disappoint ""hugely"".Most of the characters are from the Sopranos series but the story doesn't focus on them enough or develop them.THE GOOD:Gandolfini the younger does a reasonable job as a teenage Tony Soprano, I can buy it. Vera Farmiga probably steals the show as Livia Soprano (Tony's mom) . She is a New Jersey native so she nailed the accent, and they even gave her some prosthetics on her nose to resemble the older version of her character from the show. Jon Bernthal as Johnny Soprano is just Jon Bernthal. He is the same character in everything he does, but I like that character. Corey Stoll was solid as Junior Soprano, he brings a younger version of this character to life. Alessandro Nivola is good at Dickie Moltisanti because he's a character that was already dead in the Sopranos series so he gets to create him. Michela De Rossi's character is also new and she's easy on the eyes so I'll include her performance among the good.THE BAD:The rest of the supporting cast is hit and miss. The portrayals of Silvio, Pauline, and Pussy are cartoonish and exaggerated. The rest of the supporting cast is serviceable but forgettable.Ray Liotta was so annoying he gets his own paragraph. Why did they kill off one character he played and make him have a twin so he is still in the movie? Both characters were weak. Does he have to be in every gangster movie?A wasted effort by the filmmakers. They could have created deep backstories for these characters we know from the series but instead they focused on a subplot about a beef between Italian and Black gangsters. Good protagonists but I think they went into their stories more than necessary. This was supposed to be a Sopranos movie right? We got like 1/3 of one, the rest was hot garbage.",The Many Saints of Newark

That was my only issue besides them not showing Michael Gandolfini earlier in the movie. That being said, the film is still very enjoyable with its very nice cinematography, music, setting, and performances.

Dickie, like Tony is a complicated antihero, distracted by guilt and family - and it leads to his ultimate demise. The parallels between himself and Tony are subtle but undeniable. This seems like a clear way of Chase finally saying what happened to Tony - without SAYING what happened to Tony.Don't listen to the racist haters that are ripping the movie over it's inclusion of a black character. Leslie Odom Jr. Plays Harold perfectly. That storyline may have a few weaknesses, but representation is not the problem.The biggest flaw of this film is its short form.

I guess they wouldn't have attracted many viewers if the trailers featured the 5-10 minute black power beat poetry scene, where I was thinking that someone had accidentally spliced in footage from another movie. The deception in advertising and disservice to the main characters of the show is phenomenally disappointing.On the plus side, Vera Farmiga was an absolute stand-out as Livia, but most of the other re-castings of the main characters fell flat or were outright caricatures. James's son may be the perfect young Tony Soprano, but he was given so little to do, it's hard to tell. The main character Dickie Moltisanti never connected with me, either as a major force or a menace, and the so-called Tony/Uncle Dick bond was given lip service only. There were some moments where the movie seemed to be gathering steam and heading in a direction that long-time fans would want, but those moments ended up only being anecdotal teasers discarded in favor of a sea of irrelevant new characters and seemingly disconnected and random sub-plots.So I'm going to do like I did with Veronica Mars Season 4 - pretend this abortion of a film doesn't exist, purge it from my memory, and maybe something better will come along that does justice to the original show.",The Many Saints of Newark

The tag line for the movie is ""Who Made Tony Soprano"" which would lead fans to believe that we would see how such a layered and complex character like Tony was created and who influenced him the most. But instead we got a shockingly paced character study of ""Harold McBrayer"" a character with no relevance to the series what so ever. I think every single human being in the western world knows that black people were treated shockingly in the 60's and beyond but this is used in the this movie to make you route for Harold. I can guarantee you that no Sopranos fan would have enjoyed Harold, he's poorly written and shallow. His main motivation is that he's black and the rich gangsters are white so he wants to beat them. I don't know why David Chase and the others who were involved in this movie and the Sopranos decided to devote half the screen time of a movie supposedly exploring the upbringing of Tony Soprano to a new, underdeveloped and pointless character. Even the after credit seen is about Harold, like was the movie supposed to be about him?!?!Another problem was the lack of screen time for the characters the audience were most interested in seeing. Since so much time is spent attempting and failing to develop Harold, we don't get to see the more important characters. Dickie is the most prominent character other than Harold and his story is all over the place, he kills is father for beating up his Gumar who Dickie then takes as his Gumar and she ends up cheating on him with Harold. He also wants the raise Tony right but doesn't after his Uncle tells him not too. You never actually see him do anything noteworthy, even though he is hailed in the Sopranos as being something special in the mob world. Even in this movie, Johnny Boy Soprano says that Dickie stepped up when he was in prison but we don't actually get to see what he did. Again, Dickie could have and should have been a brilliant character if there was more time spent on him.I feel so bad for Michael Gandolfini, I seen a few reviews saying he couldn't act but I disagree. I thought he was excellent in the small screen time that he got. I think a lot of people wanted to see this movie because of Michael playing his fathers iconic role and would've expected to see a lot more of him but again we were let down by the choices of the higher ups in this movie to focus on Harold instead of the main character in the serious that this movie was based off of.All the other characters from the series that we see in this movie are barely involved at all. Pauline, Silvio and Pussy have tiny moments within the movie but again there is not enough time devoted to them. And Corey Stroll was brilliant as Junior Soprano, but again there was NOT ENOUGH TIME WAS DEVOTED TO THE MAIN CHARACTERS OF THE SERIES.I could go on forever but I won't, I'll give it a 2 because of Vera Farmiga's performance as Livia. Also, for the ""varsity athlete"" reference. But yeah, the movie is poorly written, shockingly paced and the new characters are unbelievable pointless and forgettable and the movie doesn't even answer the question of ""Who made Tony Soprano"" because the movie isn't even about him or the people that made him.",The Many Saints of Newark

Dicky wasn't strong enough of a lead for me, after hearing so much about him in The Sopranos, I was a bit disappointed by him. He was no different than any stereotypical wise guy. Now, the positives, the portrayal of Livi, Sil and Junior were great. Johnny Soprano was good but underutilized. I wish the movie had focused more on Junior or Johnny if it wasnt going to focus on Tony. It set up the potential for a mini-series or a sequel because so much is left unexplored. Such as young Tony's early panic attacks, Tony missing the heist with Tony B, Carm & Tony's early years, etc. Michael Gandolfini's portrayal of his father's famous role showed a lot of promise and I look forward to more because we all know there will be more. Many Saints is good and gets you excited for more of the Sopranos world but it's a tease, a BIG tease!",The Many Saints of Newark
595,The_Grooves,An insult to The Sopranos,1,3 October 2021,"It doesn't work as a stand-alone movie, it doesn't work as a prequel.As a stand-alone, aside from Nivola's acting, the rest of the movie is a dumpster fire. The plot is disjointed, you feel nothing towards the protagonist, let alone the other characters. People just seem to wander in and out of the scenes, aimlessly. The jail scenes aim to be meaningful, but they just are laughable compared to the depth and psychology of the series.As a prequel, it's horrendous. Most of the characters are caricatures of the real ones ( Uncle Junior, Silvio ), Livia is portrayed only through her mannerisms, Johnny has only a couple of appearances throughout the movie, which in the end seem pretty gratuitous and done more as a fan service. Same with Tony. His relationship with the main character is supposed to be the closest one, and the only evidence for this is because other characters say so.If this movie would've had no connection with the Sopranos series, it would have been a 4 maybe, but by trying to tie it in with the characters from the series... it gets a 1 for tainting a near-perfect legacy.",The Many Saints of Newark
596,krhny,The Many Saint of...whatever happened there.,5,3 October 2021,"While the movie does flash some great acting, witty banter, and a few cool action scenes, it really missed the bases on making a ""Movie"" as opposed to a crammed flashback bid budget Sopranos episode, which this film basically is.Sometimes less is more, and I wish Chase and the writing team realized this when constructing the characters and plot line of this movie. It is just all over the place and there is just not enough time to develop all the characters and plot lines to leave anyone intrigued enough or satisfied to some degree by the end of the film.Is this a movie about Dickie Moltisanti? The Dimeo crime family? The racial tensions of Newark in the 60s/70s? Tony Soprano's origin? The move doesn't make up it's mind and there is only so much development to make the audience care within 2 hours.The best parts of the movie was the performance by Corey Stoll (Corrado Soprano) and Alessandro Nivola (Dickie Moltisanti);. Everyone else was either a character that was forgettable, useless, or basically a SNL parody *cough - Silvio & Livia -cough*. I wasn't too let down with Michael Gandolfini's performance of teenage Tony Soprano, but the script did not give him much to work with. His big ""Tuff guy"" moment was stealing an ice cream truck and giving the ice cream out for free. It was pretty boring.I also felt the narrating by Christopher Moltisanti was a bit of an after thought and was not really needed. It came off as pretty cheesy and unoriginal, not very Soprano like.This film would have been so much better off as a 5 or 6 part mini-series. They would have been able to give each story line its proper development and all of the cast members their fair share. The script itself sounds and feels like a TV show, but you cannot execute that style in a movie setting.",The Many Saints of Newark
597,camaront,This could have been a 10,7,6 October 2021,"This reminded me of All Eyez On Me. The movie about Tupac. They rushed it. They tried to cram way too much into a 2 hour movie instead of making it a short 4-6 episode mini series. As a huge fan of The Sopranos series, I was thinking of all the stories about Dickie and his relationship with Tony. How Chrissy was jealous. How a lot of the characters were jealous and would usually always tie it back to Tony's relationship with Dickie. The movie barely shows this relationship.The movie is more about Dickie than Tony even though it's easy to see the events and situations to lead Tony to be the eventual boss. I loved that idea. I feel the movie did a great job showing how Tony was raised and how he became the character everyone loved in the series.Why wasn't this a 10? As I said they crammed it together and left a lot out. I don't want this to be a spoiler review so I won't get too far into it. Overall it was a great movie about Tony's parents and Uncles and gave good examples of how he became the adult he was in the series. But it showed more of how he developed his personality and not much on how he became the boss. I feel they still could have kept Tony as a background character and still showed more about his relationship with Dickie. After all that's how he got the series back in the late 90s and early 2000s. Still a good movie but I would advise not to expect much about Tony and how he became the person he was was in the series. Just look at it as a stand alone movie. I wouldn't even categorize this as a prequel.",The Many Saints of Newark
598,contemplativeretreat,"""I thought I was out but they....""",3,2 October 2021,"Maybe the writer needs to sleep with fishes? It seems that Mr. Chase went back to his inspiration s for the top notch series. He did mention in several recent interviews that originally he wanted a story of Italian kids finding a way out of the draft with the background being the race riots of the time.Perhaps he should have just done that rather than stuck the Soprano family into the mix.The sets, costumes, and acting are quite exceptional but teasing Soprano origin story sub plot deters from the film itself.However, if HBO was smarter they could try for a series on the original characters using this film to start.Perhaps also extending out Dickie's story too.It seemed liked a pilot movie test and that made it very difficult to care or engage in the film.But hey....

Alessandro Nivola and Vera Farmiga give solid performances as Dickie and Livia and there is a good movie in there, but Chase doesn't give it enough time to let it come out. This was one of the few times where a 3 hour film would have been appropriate. For example Leslie Odom Jr's character sees infamous mobster Frank Lucas at one point and we never see what happens as a result. Johnnie Soprano is such a minor character that it leaves you wanting more. I'm also not sure the ""surprise"" ending even fits in with the Sopranos storyline. What about the cop who supposedly killed Dickie and why would Tony make that up? Anyone could have killed that retired cop in the Sopranos episode, so why did he have Christopher do it? If Chase had spent more time developing the plot and less time on pointless references to Sopranos characters like Paulie, Silvio, and Big Pussy this would have been better.

619,rob-haskins,Great movie. Sopranos Diehards need to get over themselves,10,28 October 2021,"This movie traces events in the life of Dickie Moltisanti (the ""many saints"" of the title). He's a very complex character and it's easy to see how things in his nature would transfer over to Christopher. The other big element, of course, is Moltisanti's mentoring of a teenage Tony. Since we all know Dickie is killed at some point in the Sopranos timelines, there wasn't a big surprise there, but WHO ordered the hit-and why-is mind-blowing. (We know the who but not entirely the why.)A lot of diehard Sopranos fans seem disappointed that they didn't get to see everything they wanted to see, must less explained. ""Poor you,"" as Livia and Tony would say. What we know from the series is that not everything is explained, even in the present of the main series timeline. That's okay-a good filmmaker has to balance between payoffs and lingering questions. The nice thing about ""The Many Saints"" is that it leaves plenty of room to explore Tony's later teenage years, and I would expect a sequel (or sequel series as might happen) to do a fine job exploring that world. I don't think we want that world to be completely exhausted.

This is not the Tony Soprano origin tale that it was advertised as, it just happens to be a movie in which young Tony Soprano happens to be in some scenes. One of the many reasons why this film is a complete mess. David Chase couldn't commit to make it a straight Sopranos prequel, but focuses on a battle of wills and wits between Italian and Black gangsters in Newark with some familiar names and faces thrown in. By the end we're hardly left with an answer to the question of who made Tony Soprano. Just a kid who admired his uncle (who was an incompetent crime boss that couldn't possibly have inspired the Tony that we know in the show), had violent impulses, but still doesn't seem anywhere near on the road to mob boss. Some good performances from James Gandolfini's son, Michael, Alessandro Nivola, and Ray Liotta.

Liotta is the only one that gives something resembling a performance and he was used so sparingly that it was like he was hardly there. It was a lame wannabe mafia movie that didn't need to be made. All it was was a bunch of loosely knit together subplots with characters of no depth. This was a wasted opportunity. How do you justify taking 2 hours to prequel a series that went on for several years?

628,bkuzmin,Appreciate it for what it is,9,4 October 2021,"Here's what Many Saints is not- contrary to popular thoughts its NOT a ""Tony Soprano origin story"". In fact, Tony is a supporting player in this tale.The story itself focuses on Dickie Moltisante- Christopher's father to whom Tony looked up to as a role model- not because of his ""gangster"" lifestyle but because of the person he was and the bond that they had- one that was stronger than that with his father, Johnny Boy.Dickie was conflicted with maintaining that role with Tony while at the same time having living in the mafia world and the demons he himself posesses- including events leading to the murder of his own father and ""goomah"".Ultimately, Dickie's lifestyle, and those same demons catch up with him, leading to his own death, and putting events into motion that result in the Tony we all knew from the series.Michael Gandolfini does a great job as teenage, formative Tony. He's not SUPPOSED to be the tough hard-nosed megalo-maniac gangster that he becomes. Its the events of Many Saints, specifically Dickie's demise that put that into motion.Enjoy the film for what it is and the portrayals of the characters as their younger selves by a very talented cast. Vera Farmiga as Livia is fantastic. Cory Stoll, one of my new favorite actors based on his work in ""Billions"" is a great Junior.This isn't an ""origin"" story- its a foundation- and extremely well done.",The Many Saints of Newark

635,glock78,From creative founts that brought you Superman IV and Thor's number two...,1,2 October 2021,"First off, I never liked The Sopranos.From the get-go I pegged it for a poor intellect's attempt at a Scorsese rip-off, going nowhere, like all the other soap operas, devoid of point or meaning beyond plot for the sake of plot. And only six seasons later it got there - nowhere. Its audience being failed abortions with poor cerebral blood flow, it has some kind of a cult status to this day. What can you do? Some people still think Marion Morrison could act. That being said... This movie is a BIG bag of garbage, wrapped in just enough material from the show, to convince an average cabbage-like intellect that it is a ""Sopranos story"".Plot is all over the place, theme gets confused and muddled into incoherence, story is utterly unremarkable, characters are morons by the decree of the plot and the highlight of the tale (some might call it a twist - which it isn't) is the equivalent of Jar Jar Binks being given the key role in the creation of the Empire.OR... One might compare it to the way Darcy saved the universe(s) in Thor's number two - go watch that movie again and pay attention to how her actions facilitate basically everything happening in that story. You may notice a trend, where similarly third-/fourth-tier supporting character is given the power to direct the plot. After all, that movie and this one share a director. Still, it's one thing to make a laughable filler flick in a Disney franchise. Retconning all of the Sopranos so ALL of that show happened because a character slipped and broke his bum... That's almost poetic.Think about it. Some day, those failed abortions idolizing the show and the characters in it may realize that Tony Soprano ended up choosing the life of crime - because of a cracked butt. That's it. That's what it was all about. A cracked butt. That realization will, in turn, cause a lot of real-life rage, drinking, angry drinking, beating of wives and children, divorces, asset forfeiture, years of mental anguish, failed lives...
All because a guy slipped and cracked his butt in a crappy movie and ruined an old show. It's like poetry.Other than that, story is highly generic. Might as well have a ""I Can't Believe It's Not Sopranos!"" logo on it. It could be a story about ANY generic group of mobsters. Or even non-mobsters. For a movie about a crime family - crime, including murder, is barely incidental. Almost accidental. Heads may explode like watermelons but that neither leads nor directs the story or plot. Which would not have been a problem had characters' actions been doing that job. But once again - character actions are merely incidental and not at all inciting.Further, attempts to make it politically relevant with all of the racial issues are so sophomoric and juvenile it feels like a four-year-old's understanding of racism. Personal, institutional, cultural... Though, I must admit, for a briefest of moments I thought the movie will attempt to tie together themes of racism and misogyny the way a preschooler might - but no. Even that is way over this story's intellectual level. But just you wait until the big shootout sequence which ends with the black man taking a peek at a white man through a hole in the wall. A hole, mind you, which said white man just created with a shotgun, while trying to kill the above mentioned black man. And then the black man peeks inside on him, almost sticking his head inside the hole - and then walks away. And the scene ends. That was supposed to be the big confrontation of the movie. It being a WB movie, there will probably be no lawsuits for plagiarism of WB cartoons, starring Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. Not to worry though. By that point plot has stopped being coherent long ago.Which leaves us with the theme of... well... It's not racism. That's just tacked on for the sake of plot. It's not life of crime either. Not really. Crime is barely incidental. Same with violence. It just happens. Tony Soprano's slow descent into a life of crime? Nope. How about his anxiety issues? Nope to that too. What the writer and the director would REALLY like it to be is some kind of an Oedipal thing... Ray Liotta and Michela De Rossi were in it just to provide that. But apparently neither the director nor the writer ever actually read the story about Oedipus so they fail there too. Liotta even played not one but TWO father-figures just to get that daddy issue in. Nope. Movie is a failure there too. Writer and director ""kinda forgot"" that the tragedy of Oedipus is not in accidentally killing his dad and bedding his mom - it is in unknowingly cursing himself and the land while trying to avert the prophecy and do good.I guess that leaves us with acting. Which is... meh. Liotta is kinda OK. He doesn't do much but he's OK. Which only goes to show how everyone else is really giving a subpar performance.Oh, and lest we forget, like the movie did - movie starts and ends with narration by a character killed in the TV show. Actually, it starts with a bunch of graves in the graveyard talking to themselves (no, really) - until we reach that character's grave. Then he starts the story... and then the movie forgets about him until the very end, where suddenly there's that voice again to tell us that the kid we see on the screen is the future TONY THE BADASS SOPRANO... accompanied with a remix of the show's theme. Yes, they were too cheap to license the original theme.

TMSON is no ""Goodfellas"", is certainly no ""Straight Outta Compton"", and once the novelty of trying to figure out who each actor is playing from the tv series wears off it's basically left up to the cast to make up for the lack of a story, which shouldn't be their job. The worst Sopranos episode IMHO was the Columbus Day episode b/c it's like, ""All of these people are terrible, why am I supposed to support anyone's politics?""
The attempts to build character depth border on ridiculous- woke gangsters, noble crack dealers, and at one point teenagers commit a serious crime in order to do minimum wage work for free, which didn't make any gd sense.

There's some humor but it doesn't really land. It's just a forgettable film and shouldn't be compared to the HBO series.At the end of the film we finally find out what actually happened to Dickie Moltisanti and how he died but for some reason I didn't really care.

But to have Dickie hugging this black guy in front of the Family... that's about as unrealistic as it gets in 1967.

657,dm-92194,Not a Sopranos Anything,2,8 October 2021,"This is my first review. Let me start by saying I was extremely saddened and disappointed by the movie. Nothing in this movie had anything to do with Tony. It was a bunch of subplots and Tony wasn't part of any of them. I thought this was the making of Tony Soprano. What's positive? The late actor's son did a fine job of portraying a young Tony Soprano. Now the negatives. No coherent plot. It was just a bunch of scenes. There was no narrative thread anywhere. The Newark riots subplot ran way too long only to be used as a way to hide a murder. We are introduced to a new gangster by the name of Harold that has zero to do with with Tony. Why was he added? He did not propel the story and he was absolutely not germane to the plot. We get some random scene where Harold meets who I assume is famed Harlem gangster Frank Lucas that adds nothing to the film. It's just tacked on. The other actors seem to mimic the shows iconic characters and they mostly fail. The actor playing Silvio Dante was way too undersized. He captured some of his mannerisms but it seemed mostly forced to me. The actor playing a young Paulie Walnuts had to be the worst. He got nothing right. The actors playing Dickie Moltisanti, Junior Soprano, and Livia Soprano did very well. The rest of the cast was okay too. Nothing in this movie gave us any insight into the old beloved characters.

663,MrTelly,So many great ingredients but it just doesn't work as a movie in its own right,5,5 October 2021,"I went to the movie theatre trying not to expect too much - as a massive Sopranos fan I've been looking forward to seeing it for months.Let's start with the positives....+ Michael Gandolfini plays Tony perfectly. He is a star and could be sensational in follow-up movies telling the story of Tony's life leading up to the Sopranos series.+ It's a joy to be back in Satriale's Pork Store.+ It's great to see the old characters again... especially Tony, Livia, Tony B, Junior, Sil, Paulie Walnuts and Janice.+ David Chase has resurrected the Sopranos universe and got HBO to back it, I'm so happy... and want to encourage Mr Chase to do more... (and ideally include Terry Winter next time too).Now some negatives...The Harold McBrayer story was too long a detour for me. If there is a follow-up movie that brings the McBrayer arc to a conclusion, then I can take it all back... but for now I resented the time taken with Harold (when I'd rather have seen more of Tony, Livia, Janice and Johnny Boy).How was Dickie such an influence on Tony? I didn't much evidence of Dickie shaping Tony... the gift of speakers and the justification of receiving stolen goods wasn't enough for me.I didn't care too much about Dickie... Unlike Tony in Sopranos, I wasn't rooting for Dickie.We are treated to many references to Sopranos... which starts off good but eventually feels like too many Easter eggs. In particular, the call-back to the ""Soprano Home Movies"" episode where Janice tells the story of how Johnny Boy shot a bullet through Lucia's beehive hairdo... we didn't need the exact same story to be depicted in this film (in a film dedicated to Johnny, Livia, Tony and his sisters it would make more sense). Maybe David Chase thought he wouldn't get another chance and wanted to treat the fans to visualisations of all the old stories?I've given this movie 5/10... I feel bad for not giving more points. I desperately want HBO to finance further movies or better-still a series... the stories of Tony, Sil, Big Pussy, Paulie, Junior, Johnny, Janice, Barbara and Livia *not* Harold (other than to resolve the hanging thread of providing his comeuppance). Maybe I'll revisit the movie and give it more on a rewatch... but probably not.",The Many Saints of Newark

But I guess it's not supposed to be. The creators do tell their story with the assumption that you know these characters and have seen the show.My feeling is that anyone who hasn't will not find it as enjoyable. Outside of the Sopranos' universe, it's not a bad gangster movie, but there are better.But if you are a fan, this movie is a real treat! The direction and casting are amazing! The young Gandolfini gives a terrific performance, it's a real tragedy that his father didn't get to see it. We get to see some of our favourite characters being young. Silvio and Polly are hysterical!You get tons of Easter eggs, revisits to flashbacks we saw in the show but from a different angle, and new details of old stories that give that universe even more depths. Also the mystery of who killed Dicki Moltisanti is revealed. This movie is basically his story, and Tony Soprano is the side character here.The one criticism I have is that uncle Junior's character seems very thin. I wish we would have gotten more out of him, but most of what we get is just an impression of Dominic Chianese in the part.

670,NaJoBron,"Do you want to open The Sopranos for yourself? Watch the series, skip the movie",3,6 October 2021,"In my review of The Sopranos, I talked about the three main advantages of the series - the plot, the characters with the actors who played them and the figure of David Chase. Well, the film also relies on these three pillars, but it does everything absolutely wrong.The Many Saints of Newark has no plot. It was like watching the highlights of the full season of the original series. They forgot about the exposition completely, everything is too torn, all the actions are rushing at maximum speed, not a single storyline is given enough screen time for full disclosure, Harold's plot is not needed at all (the end of his arch was shoved into the credits!), various characters are constantly flashing that either aren't needed by the plot, or are pure fan-service.Because of the very fast pace, I don't believe almost anything that happens to the characters. Dickie Moltisanti found out that his father beats his mistress? In the very next scene, he kills his father! Is Dickie quarrels with his goomar? Well, she immediately goes to sleep with Harold. Junior has two or three verbal exchanges with Dickie? It's time to kill him! It all looks too caricatured, too unnatural. And in general, the plot with the murder of Dickie for some reason gives a direct answer to an extremely important question from the original series - who killed Chrissy's father? In my opinion, it was an absolutely unnecessary. Maybe we can make a movie about what happened to Tony at that diner?In addition, the relationship of young Tony with Dickie is very forced. There is practically no chemistry between them and very few scenes together. «For this man I went to Hell», Christopher says about Tony. Well, what did Tony do anyway? He steals an ice cream van and... that's it? Dickie Moltisanti isn't the man who created Tony Soprano as we know him.However, the plot isn't the biggest problem of the movie. Yes, Alessandro Nivola played Dickie Moltisanti very good, Harold McBrayer is an unnecessary character, but Leslie Odom was good too. I also liked Michael Gandolfini, there is a certain mix of aggression and tragedy in him, which was inherent in his father. However he's still very young. Also noteworthy are Vera Farmiga (Livia Soprano) and Corey Stoll (Corrado Soprano), who most closely portrayed the original characters. Otherwise, everyone else is bad or unremarkable.John Bernthal is a very good actor, but he has nothing to play. Johnny Boy is an absolutely flat character whose goes against the original. Ray Liotta is in the movie just because he's Ray Liotta. Young Jennice is absolutely miscast. Young Artie is annoying. Paulie and Pussy aren't much like the original characters both in terms of appearance and behavior. But most of all got Silvio Dante. Steven Van Zandt wasn't a professional actor, but, thanks to his style and chemistry with actors, Silvio was one of the most memorable man in DiMeo family. But, thanks to John Magaro overacting, Sil was completely destroyed and turned into a caricature of himself. Now he's a comical epileptic who can't take a step without twitching and joking about his wig (which had no accent at all in the original show).But what could be worse than a broken plot and flat characters with bad actors? The worst part is that David Chase didn't put anything into his movie. It's a two-hour black hole. The Many Saints of Newark doesn't feel like a part of the series. Almost all the elements that make The Sopranos a truly unique show have been removed from the movie, and those that remain are served very badly. The result is just a weak b-movie about gangs. Chase may have been pressured by the producers, but I think most likely David Chase just lost contact with the original series. And this is sad.Oh yeah, we also have a fan-service! Uncle June talks about a varsity athlete and falls with swearing just like in the TV series! And here's the scene with Tony and the school psychologist, who looks just like Dr. Melfi! And here's Tony's girlfriend with one line, it's Carmela! Johnny Boy shoots Livia's hair just like in that story of Jennice! And why doesn't anyone say, «Gabagool? Ova Here!!» Everyone loves The Sopranos because of the memes, right? Right?And yet, The Many Saints of Newark has advantages that don't allow me to put the lowest score. The movie has an amazing first two minutes. That's truly goosebumps. In general, I have no complaints about atmosphere of the late 60s. As I said, there are really good acting jobs. The storyline of Livia and Tony is even interesting and has a character development. I hope the younger Gandolfini will have a good future. It was nice to hear «Woke Up This Morning» again. That's it.The Many Saints of Newark doesn't work. This doesn't work as a prequel to the series, hardcore fans will be disappointed and it will mislead newcomers who decide to watch The Sopranos for the sake of criminal showdowns.If it was a 13-episode series, then perhaps the result came out satisfactory.

The second problem is that you feel like you're walking into the middle of a movie and you have no idea who the characters are or what the story is about. Viewers are expected to already know who these people are and what their relationship to each other is. If you did not watch The Sopranos, do not see this movie.

I feel it could have worked better as a 10-episode mini series or something along those lines. It had a lot of potential but it ran out of steam quickly due to the standard movie formatting - which invariably forced the story to jump too much around.I am all for Civil Rights and learning about the era, the struggles and the difficulties - but that entire side of the story felt forced and out of place.Casting was ok and it was fun to connect ""who is who"", the songs, places, sayings etc. But that was just not enough to make this a compelling offering, let alone a prequel to the greatest TV show in history.I would have been pretty pissed had I had gone to the theater to watch it, glad it came included with HBO.

They tried too hard to make Silvio exactly like Stevie Van Zandt and apparently it's a toupee on Sil's head all along. Paulie was cool. At the end of the day it's ""loosely based"" on the Sopranos universe but doesn't measure up in the slightest. Like other reviewers on here frankly I'm depressed and ashamed, because I really thought this could be something.",The Many Saints of Newark

678,harshathebale,Whatever You expect from a Sopranos episode David Chase delivered it,7,1 October 2021,"The film adapted the entire family well. The writer still hasn't lost his touch. I still wish this could've been a Tv show. This movie felt like a promo rather than a feature film. They advertised this film as Tony's legacy but that's not what happens. This entire film is about his uncle. He is a new character to us but we still love him as we loved all the other characters in Sopranos. The main plus point for this film is its cast. They would make us this for even a minute that they were different actors. The slow music too is awesome. I felt chills when the Sopranos title track
played. This film doesn't feel like it is over done. But at the same time it felt a little empty. I feel the exact same way that I felt with the Sopranos. But that's me I watched this film at home. I don't know how its like for theatre. But I am sure I would be disappointed if I watched it there. There are some moments in the film where only sopranos fans can notice and if they did then that scene it self stands alone with the rest of the movie. Only some characters aren't fit for example Silvio is my favourite character but in this I felt a little off when I saw him. I loved Dick Moltasanti character I wish I want to see more of him. But I think its not possible. I hope to see more adaptations from this franchise. Crime never delivers boredom.",The Many Saints of Newark

If you're a fan of the show and understand what this film is, a story about Dickie Moltasanti you'll love this film like I did. I think it's hitting badly with audiences because of the marketing. They're promoting it as a ""Tony Soprano origin story"" when it's not really that at all. That synopsis is probably better suited in a sequel to this film, if anything. You get a ""soft rise"" of Tony Soprano. Not the big moments that transform him but the building blocks as to why he ultimately becomes who he is. So if you haven't seen it yet, and are expecting the ""rose of Tony"" get that out of your mind and expect to see something ""new yet familiar"". It's a fantastic movie and a great addition to the tv series. This film definitely leaves you wanting more, which is a good thing. Although, it probably would have worked better as a mini series.

This movie makes the sopranos pale in comparison to the far more interesting story of the struggle of Black people in America. I love Italian mafia genre movies, but this movie just destroys that genre by showing that the struggle of black people is way more interesting than the Italian mafia. Thank god the truth about Black people and black culture is finally coming out. Because the truth is that the plight of the Black man is much more interesting and important than any other ethnic group's story.

689,chloep-39466,Not as bad as people are making it out to be,7,2 October 2021,"People are being way too overly critical of this movie & honestly, I feel it's mostly because they went into it expecting something the creators never promised to deliver. Yes, the trailers were somewhat misleading but had people actually listened to what Chase had to say about the movie, they would've known what to expect because Chase LITERALLY explained it multiple times in interviews for months. Chase said he always wanted to make a movie about the Newark race riots as he grew up through them & when this opportunity came up he used it to do so. People mad because they're confused as to why certain elements were included in the film only have themselves to blame because the man couldn't have made it more clear. Smh.Also, as a diehard Sopranos fan I know James Gandolfini holds a special place in our hearts, no one could ever replace him as the Tony Soprano we know from the show & creators of the show have always respected that. However, that doesn't mean that fans can't want or enjoy more Sopranos content if he is not in it as long as it is respectful of the legacy he left behind which they did by creating a new version of Tony Soprano, young Tony Soprano. Since, this version of Tony we don't really see too much of outside of flashbacks so, we don't know how he acted beyond mannerisms. Therefore, Michael Gandolfini's depiction of Tony Soprano doesn't have to be spot on, because young Tony Soprano is basically a new character open to interpretation. You can't criticize him for looking at his father for inspiration while also trying to make the character his own.",The Many Saints of Newark

The characters I wanted to care about, but there were no stakes for them.It would have worked much better if it was simple. Show Tony making that transition into that life. How he would have wrestled with that duality of identity. Doing this would have opened up that world, showed the stakes within himself while also doing fan service for other characters.As it stands, it's surprising the direction Chase takes. Because it's all over the place. There's a shoehorned affair, the Newark riots serving as the backdrop (which could have been a heck of a movie on its own), and Taster Choice moments in prison.All told, making this a movie limited them. If they would have done a miniseries, at least they could have set this out in a more compelling way, giving each character more detail, more stakes, not just flashes of who they were. It would have given them the opportunity to create a point of view, which this movie severely lacks.",The Many Saints of Newark

701,john-5198,Pointless,2,5 October 2021,"Let's start off with the good points. Livia (Vera Farmiga) and teenage Tony (Michael Gandolfini) were both good in this, and managed to do more with the script than maybe anyone else. A highlight for me were the interactions between the two of them, and the overall excellent depiction of a toxic narcissist. There were other good actors in the film, but they didn't have a lot to work with.Pretty much everything else was weak and superficial. Part of it may have been David Chase's inability to work within the sharp time constraints of a movie as opposed to a TV series, but that's not all of it. Maybe a third of the film was wasted on the rise of a black gangster that nobody cared about, and was nothing more than a nod to woke culture. I'm tired of it.Some of the characterizations were really bad. Even in the original, Silvio was imho a little overacted, but here it's ridiculous. Uncle Jun is depicted as a bumbling fool privately consumed with vindictiveness, but even in the original we are shown signs of a clever old man who was deeply respected by the likes of Richie, and even though he is deteriorating, he can still basically outsmart anyone outside of other Sopranos. In fact, the original series revealed the entire Soprano family as intellectually gifted criminals and psychopaths, but in TMSON, they are merely backdrops for Dickie Moltisanti. Dickie was hinted at in The Sopranos as a dynamic guy that Tony looked up to, but also a drug addict. Okay, that works. He could have been conveyed with the addict's energy and boldness that would appeal to a young Tony while Jun and Johnny were quietly calculating in a way that only an older Tony would appreciate. Remember when it was said that they ran the whole family though neither was never officially the boss? What I'm getting at with these examples is that the movie does not mesh with the series.",The Many Saints of Newark

But the connection between Dickie and Tony's eventual immersion into Mafia life felt cheap and unearned.The movie wanted to bring in a second storyline about Blacks in the 60s and early 70s. Dickie is the Soprano connection and a weak one at that. That storyline became equal to Dickie's and Tony, which was also unearned. It would have been a fine stand-alone story for a different film- maybe a prequel that connects Johnny, who had little to do here.This movie ruined Junior. Junior's pettiness is a part of who he is, but he is so much more. I can't fathom why the film felt the need to cheapen him, unless it is supposed to make Dickie look better , which it did not.Dickie's story started off well, but after a while, it is hard to feel invested in him.I got no complaints about the acting or the look of the film.

Although a little faster than I was anticipated. But since the TV show already exists, I imagine further development would take place there.Unlike in another Warner Bros. Release, Joker (2019); the development was contained within the movie. While ""The Many Saints of Newark"" already had the story of the series to support the narrative.The cast did excellent as well making the environment feel reminiscent of what the early 1970's were like in Newark.The audio mixing could have been made a little better as well because it became very distracting and I couldn't easily understand the dialogue of the characters.This movie felt like watching two extended episodes.

Why not hire more Italian actors? It reminds me a lot of season 4 of Fargo. A lot of people pretending to be Italian and failing miserably. Not good...,The Many Saints of Newark

736,broseph-23358,"""A lot of people didn't like it, but I think it was just misunderstood""",7,4 October 2021,"After seeing the ludicrous reviews of many, (I am aware that opinions exist) I had to give my two cents. This movie is NOT a terrible film. People who say this claim have clearly not seen that many films, because this is not even close to being terrible (don't wanna call out any bad movies, but you can think of some). It was good! There were moments and scenes that were riveting. Cinematography and acting were top notch. However, it isn't a perfect film, as some scenes dragged on and seemed tedious. I did finish the movie wanting more, in which I hope David Chase continues the story (especially considering David Chase's recent deal with HBO). The movie is about Dickie Moltisanti, and even though you don't get too much Tony, you understand how he shaped up to the way he is now. People complaining about ""black empowerment"" and ""pandering to BLM"". So are black characters not allowed in the Sopranos universe? Lmao, it seems like the racism from the show rubbed off some people. Watching too much television these guys. All in all, it's a good movie that begs to be continued. Hopefully, people will watch it and appreciate it for what it is.",The Many Saints of Newark
737,anytimeblues,Very disappointing,2,3 October 2021,Vera Farmiga was the only bright spot. Movie is more toward the BLM movement than a mob movie. The movie has no direction goes no where and is an embarrassment to the great Sopranos.,The Many Saints of Newark
738,jonnyk82,"""Disappointing"" is the only word I can think of",3,5 October 2021,"Recreating the magic from a show, years after it ended, is never an easy task. Knowing that, I tried to temper my expectations for this movie, but seeing the performances in the trailers made that difficult.As others have said, the story is all over the place. However, unlike some snowflakes have said, the problem isn't ""wokeness"" (whatever that word means anymore), the problem is that the storylines revolving around the black characters had little or nothing to do with the mafia. The riots didn't influence anything with the mafia characters. Other than resulting in the death of Dickie's mistress, Harold's character could have been completely removed from the story and almost nothing would have been changed with the overall plot. The movie builds up to make you think that Harold will somehow be the downfall of Dickie, but it turns out to be Junior, of all people? And why? Because Dickie laughed at him when he fell down the steps?Anyway, to sum up, the problem isn't the inclusion of the black-focused storylines. The problem is that they weren't important to the story. Even if you replaced Harold and his gang with a rival Italian gang, or even an Irish or Jewish gang, it wouldn't have made the movie any better, because he was ultimately irrelevant. Replace the black people rioting with other Italians, or Irish or Jewish people rioting and the movie isn't any better because the riots are ultimately irrelevant. Hell, remove the riot scenes altogether and the movie isn't any better because the riots are ultimately irrelevant. The way to make the movie better is to make these characters and plot points relevant to the story.I think the snowflake response to this movie is just further proof that the backlash to ""wokeness"" is really just another example of racism.These issues aside, I still have several problems with this movie. One of the biggest is that the poster for the movie says ""Who made Tony Soprano?"" In my opinion, the movie doesn't answer this question, because the only time that I recall Dickie influencing Tony in a negative way is when he convinced Tony to take the stolen speakers. But by the end of the movie, Tony destroyed the speakers and renounced the mafia.Next, I felt there was a little too much forced fan-service. The main culprit here being Junior. He says one of his famous lines, ""Your sister's (c-word)"" one time throughout 86 episodes of the show, and he says it twice in a 2 hour movie? ""He doesn't have the makings of a varsity athlete"" and ""What a f-ing blow"" also seemed forced.Then I have a few minor issues. In the show, Christopher makes his dad out to be a junkie, yet Dickie seems pretty well put-together throughout the movie and I don't think we ever see him use drugs at any point. Second, there was no mention of Jimmy Ruffalo or Barry Haydu. Third, there was nothing in the series to hint that Junior was responsible for Dickie's death. I don't think this twist added anything to the story, and may possibly even detract from the series a bit.Anyway, overall it was a total letdown, and the only reason it gets 3 stars is for the performances.",The Many Saints of Newark
739,knowledgeisdivine,Terrible,3,28 October 2021,"Uncle Junior Soprano shot the main character all because the schmuck fell on a set of stairs, and dickie moltisantti humiliated him in front of his relatives. What a terrible ending to a terrible prequel.",The Many Saints of Newark

I have to disagree with many of the posters, I didn't mind the racial element, as that was a big part of the late 60s and early 70s. But the first part of the show (with the kid Tony) could have been left out. Would have been much better if they just started with Tony as a teenager and his father getting out of prison, and exploring Tony's transition into the life.

I'm not sure how I would have felt if I had never seen the show. Maybe I would have just considered a mediocre Mafia movie using Ray Liotta to bring in viewers.But because we many of us had seen the show and were used to that elaborate and intricate storytelling we were left disappointed.

I now want to rewatch all six seasons of The Sopranos which I have on DVD. The first time I watched a Sopranos episode was actually in Italy and it blew me away...When Meadow was doing her visit to a university in New England and Tony...well you know the story. It's not easy living in a nation where decline is an everyday experience but The Soprano's, The Wire, and Breaking Bad capture that pessimism in a real way. It's even worse now in 2021 with the 1% having so much wealth and evading taxes while also owning our electoral infrastructure. This can't end well.

When characters died you really didn't care because they were just background characters who barely had names.The young character depictions from the show was the saving grace as it added a bit of humour. Sil and Pauline being my favourites.. but even this felt as if every character was their old self in a younger meat suit also why did they not expand on jackies character!*warning spoiler*Biggest problem with the film was junior but are we meant to believe he was behind dickies murder because he laughed when he fell over?

765,tdwest-69875,"Too Much Plot, Too Little Time",1,2 October 2021,"This is a movie that should have been a 3-4 season series instead. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just say that The Many Saints of Newark attempts to compact a multi-plot line story that would have been 1-2 seasons in the Sopranos into a 2-hour runtime and completely flops. If they just picked the main plot line and ran with it they may have made something watchable, but they simply tried to do too much to give any reason for the viewer to pay attention, let alone emotionally connect to any characters.Absolutely nothing of consequence happens until around the 20-minute mark and by then they've almost entirely phased out one of the characters and shifted focus onto a character that has nothing to do with the Sopranos. This character goes on to be an antagonist for about 30 minutes and those thirty minutes are the only intense minutes of this entire film. It scrambles to shift focus back to the phased out character near the end but completely bungles the ending and makes the Sopranos end scene look like the most satisfying thing ever made. It feels as though they began to film 2 seasons of a TV series but cut out all the scenes that would have established the characters and ended the second season's footage at the penultimate episode.The failure of this film isn't on the actors, the writers, or the director, it's whoever gave funding to a movie prequel to a TV series known for its long drawn-out storylines.",The Many Saints of Newark

Then there's the big reveal of Junior Sopranos having Dickie killed for laughing at him when he slipped, which foreshadowed Juniors insecurities in the series about people talking about him or laughing at him and also gave us a reason as to why Junior never seemed to like Christopher.

772,rjtoogood,Whacked to the future,6,10 October 2021,"Spoilers ahead.I can't say I was looking forward to the film when I first heard that there would be a prequel to The Sopranos TV series, despite being a big fan of the show. It's quite rare that you get a film prequel/origin story in this day and age without far too many nods and shoehorning of scenes, characters, dialogue from the source material. Also the retrofitting of certain devices in order to make them more relevant when you watch the source material again. Certainly, the Star Wars prequels were massive offenders of this. In fact the Han Solo movie was pretty much unwatchable because of these storytelling crimes. Basically, you end up with something that wouldn't be able to stand up on its own with the excuse that the fans must be serviced.Probably one the best examples of an exception to this, is the Robert De Niro parts of GF2 as a young Vito Corleone.For someone like David Chase, I didn't expect too much in the way of fan service. After all he is very much an artist and his own boss from all accounts. However, my very first thought upon finishing The Many Saints of Newark was - Not a one-off film for anyone going in cold having never watched an episode of The Sopranos.For those who are familiar with the Sopranos - watched the series 2 or 3 times through maybe - this film is a bit like that extra helping of lasagne that you didn't need, in that maybe it's not going to do much for you, but it tastes soooo good!For a film about a young Tony Soprano there's not enough about Tony Soprano. OR for a film about Dickie Moltisanti there is almost too much Tony Soprano! What is this film supposed to be about? Is it Tony's formative years or is it more about ""Christupha's"" pa? I felt that the film didn't really know what it wanted to be. Even, the monologue didn't really feel like it belonged there as it was seldom used. Albeit I inwardly cheered as the film opened in the way it did.Maybe a little too many nods to the series, but some of those are fun and some needed to be in there.Examples of the stuff that didn't feel right -
The 'pinkie promise'
The theme from Sopranos used at the end which felt very much out of place for era in terms of the soundtrack that came before it.The mid credits scene - I was waiting for more scenes and none came.The pacing felt a little off to me. There was not enough to the build up of the deaths of Dickie senior and Giuseppina. Or there wasn't enough to show me that Dickie Jnr was on the edge and ready to deal out such violence. I didn't quite believe that Dickie was so motivated and the type of character to do what he did.I know that Pussy's father smartmouths Dickie about Giuseppina just before getting whacked (years after Dickie got with her, I might add), but how do the other Family members seem to immediately accept Giuseppina as Dickie's goomah after Dickie senior's death? Seemed pretty odd.But a lot of the story works for fans of the show. A steady build up to why Tony chose the life. Glimpses of his relationship with his ma, little light shed on his relationship with his father, what with him being 'in England"", and an understanding why he might feel responsible for Christopher.The era looks amazingly realised.Soundtrack is great.Casting, which was such a strong part of the TV series is perfect.Vera Farmiga is awesome - not in it enough
The guy who plays Silvio 😂😂😂
Uncle Junior felt like the young version of his Sopranos' self.Janice is a spitting image of her older self.And Gandolfini's son is really impressive. As is the kid who plays the younger version.Also, there were plenty of Easter eggs - the rehash of a young Tony following Johnnie and Janice to the fairground was nice but shows it as being more pivotal with Johnnie put away and Dickie being Tony's father figure; the bird in the garage; the old woman at the table foreshadowing events to come; David Chase as Ecoli DiMeo (is he too old considering he's supposed to be in prison during the first season?); Tony's dog; plenty of Junior dialogue; and there being yet another set of twins (I think that's three sets of twins - patsy and philly, jeannie and Joan cusamano)!Also, the gunshot to Livia's hair - I didn't know whether to shit or go blind.I loved the glimpses (fleeting albeit) into the histories of the characters that we came to know and love/loathe - although more Paulie would have been nice hehe hehe.As the TV series did so many times, the violence shocked me. Not about what I saw, more about the timing. Its brutal and gives you a reminder of what these people are about.Overall, I thought the film felt a little rushed, and there clearly could have been more to the stories being told. I enjoyed watching the film, especially in a cinema. But, I left the film wanting more and didn't really feel that I had learned much more than I ralready knew. I kind of wish it had been 10 hour long episodes of a limited series. But I am greedy. I would never turn down extra lasagne.",The Many Saints of Newark
773,Mohua7,THIS IS SOPRANOS!,8,2 October 2021,"I can't unsee Sopranos. So, my perspective could differ from those that haven't seen the show as I had the privilege of witnessing hours worth of character development of each character. And the relatively new ones here were given enough time to shine. And so they did. Alessandro Nivola killed it as Dickie Moltisanti (literally) ; The protagonist of this particular story. Leslie Odom Jr. Played his role Harold quite good, so did Jon Bernthal as Johnny Boy Soprano. Both of the Ray Liottas shone bright.Fan of the show will get a lot of references, events and character motives that general audience would not get, that might take half of the fun away. But still as a 'one of' I would say it has compelling story & great character arks. And if you have seen the show, what are you waiting for, man! It ain't no 'many saints of Newark' IT IS SOPRANOS.

779,jbgris,The question - what made Tony Soprano is NOT entirely answered... and that is a good thing.,10,8 October 2021,"The film continues the series' tradition of character study even without the assistance of a psychiatrist. The film features excellent direction, acting and cinematography. There is a difference in the color tone, pacing and distance from the actors from the original series, that takes some adjusting to.David Chase and company have not shied away from revealing the cause and effect of the actions and bad decisions of these characters, just as they have masterfully done for the entirety of the series. The step-wise consequences of misguided words, bruised egos, careless decisions, greed, lust, and associating with people just like themselves is what The Sopranos is trying to highlight. It's an anti-glorification.After the shock of violent scenes, just as in the series, is a core of black-comedy for those who are patient enough to allow it rise, which highlights the storytelling prowess of the writers.The main story is played out by Christopher Moltisanti's father, Dickie and his African American associate Harold McBrayer. Dickie Moltisanti is a high earning mafioso who is fighting his demons of rage while trying to be a good person to those around him. Harold is trying to step out on his own, not needing the help of the Italians.Dickie Moltisanti is Tony Soprano's role model. Dickie takes an interest in Tony's potential, while his parents, due to their preoccupations, don't give Tony the attention that he needs. Tony, as well, tries to be good but loves the thrill of doing bad things.Most of the regular Sopranos characters are here, some are giving comical impersonations of the tv series characters, while others like Junior Soprano, and Livia Soprano add much to our understanding of the depths of their characters.The ending leads very nicely to follow up movies. I feel David Chase's intention was to open the way for more of these movies. The question of how did Tony Soprano get this way is NOT entirely answered - and that is a good thing. There is much of Tony's backstory that is not touched by this movie.The movie is richly packed with action, quick dialogue, and callbacks to the tv show. It will take at least 2 viewings to catch everything. And in my opinion, a few more viewings to appreciate everything.I wasn't ready for what was in store for my first viewing. I've re-watched it a few times now, and the richness grows each time. I couldn't imagine a better prequel for the Sopranos.",The Many Saints of Newark

But after watching this film, I felt compelled to add my voice to the other disappointed Sopranos fans.That being said, I do find the outcries over the so-called wokeness or SJW stuff to be very racist and unnecessary. Let's judge the film on its merits, shall we?Let me start out with a couple of caveats: I'm not a male nor am I an Italian-AmericanWhat I am is an avid televison and movie watcher that has a deep appreciation for the mobster genre and its place in film history. When the Sopranos came along in 1999, I fell in love with the show's compelling narrative, the fleshed out characters and the complexity of its lead protagonist, Tony Soprano. For 6 wonderful seasons I faithfully watched each episode. When it ended, I waited paitently until I could purchase the DVD box set. A few years later, got Blu Ray set, so I could revisit the world created by David Chase.When I learned of the prequel, I was cautiously optimistic. But when it was announced that James Galdonfini's own son was protraying a younger version of the indellible character he masterfully embodied, I was over the moon. By the time the trailer came out I was salivating with antipication.When I sat down to watch TMSON on Friday night, I was as giddy as school girl. I was so psyched to see younger versions of the characters I had loved for so long. I was so looking forward to seeing young Tony's rise and how Dickie might have molded him before setting him firmly on the path to ""the life"".However, as the film rolled out and we got Christopher's jarring and unwelcomed narration, all my hopes turned to ash. Instead of the origin story we were promised, all we saw were parodies of beloved characters, and a thin story at best. There was no connective tissue tying this film to what came before.I was especially put off by the actor that played young Silvio Dante. My god did he miss the mark! It was like watching a bad skit on SNL.The acting two standouts for me were Livia and young Tony, just not enough screentime. Everyone else's storylines were lifeless and boring. There was so much wasted potential and it's heartbreaking.As for the subplot of the Newark riots- okay I get it. As a person of color, its historical impact is not lost on me. So I was waiting to see how these events unfolded and how they mighy have correlated with the inner workings of the DiMeo crime family and the Soprano crew. I was waiting for all out war to erupt between these two factions, the Italians on one side and the African Americans on the other. What we got was weak sauce. A bland, barely there story about certain players in the black community trying to take over the numbers racket. Ho-hum.And Harold the numbers runner? I don't understand his significance. I guess he was set up to be rival of sorts for Dickie? But with two major events that happened late in the film, the rivalry is done and dusted. So why should we are about Harold moving forward?Ray Liotta? The less said about his performance the better. This was clearly a paycheck for him, nothing more.As far as I'm concerned Dickie Moltisanti has been demystified for me. There just wasn't enough meat on the bone to give this character any substance.Perhaps the story might have been better served as a limited series that actually revolved around young Tony Soprano where the true mentor/mentee relationship could have been told with the richness and fullness that we Sopranos deserve.Sorry Mr. Chase, but this was not what we wanted.",The Many Saints of Newark

788,amasaints,Surprisingly disappointed,6,2 October 2021,"I was expecting a ground -breaking film with Many Saints, considering the writers and director. Unfortunately, this felt like they were merely trying to re-live their glory days of the series. The racial conflict sub-plot wasn't needed and seemed a cheap attempt at grabbing an Oscar nod or at least appealing to a wider audience. Aside from the unrealistic aspects of the film, this idea was better suited for a limited series, seeing as the Sopranos history is just too rich to be squeezed into a 120-minute production.Unrealistic aspects ? There was no way in hell a mid-tier black gangster would have whacked several made men in an Italian neighbourhood in the golden age of the mafia and lived to see next week. To add to the unrealism, McBrayer thereafter moved his family into an Italian (?) neighbourhood. During the golden age you would be begging to get whacked.Silvio and Paulie Walnuts felt like YouTube comedic parodies. Anyone who is invested in Sopranos would have seen at least one better depiction of the two awesome characters on YouTube.This film fell short of what it could have been, and was not assisted by a small run-time. Salute, however, to Alessandro Nivola, Farmiga and Michael Gandolfini for delivering stellar performances and making this film worth watching otherwise.",The Many Saints of Newark

795,manisafaei,Could have been way better...,7,27 October 2021,I love Sopranos and I praise David chase for it but come on! This movie should have been a mini series (about 10 episodes). There a lot of things in a short time that everyone of them needs 1 episode.,The Many Saints of Newark
796,rubymcquizzle,Really disappointed,2,31 October 2021,As a person who has watched the series sopranos about 10 x through this was highly anticipated and highly disappointed. The main plot point had no baring on the original storyline which made it difficult to watch and connect with sopranos as a fan. The trailer drew me to this as an origin of tony soprano however this is more of a prequel to any origin tony soprano story.Tltr disappointed not as much tony as promised.,The Many Saints of Newark
797,dr_shagwell,Not so sure,6,27 October 2021,"Like any avid Sopranos fan, I'd been anticipating this film since I came across the hyped trailer several months back. And fool heartedly, I have to give credit to the the person who cut together this misleading trailer because they had it reeled in a lotta suckers.This is not as much a Tony Soprano origin story as it is a pieced together recollection of brief moments in his childhood which coincide with the story of Dicki Moltisanti and his ultimate downfall. Now granted, I think learning more about the skinny guinea's father was necessary for the fans, but the film ultimately gets lost in a myriad of social issues that don't add up to the Soprano story. The Newark riots certainly were a thing, and infusing that with the ties to the North Jersey mafia was a warranted touch, but overall the side plots and dialogue are too unrealistic and a little 'woke' for a movie depicting the late 60s/early 70s. Seems to me like Chase forced a discombobulated mess together trying to match the rise of black gang leaders alongside a tapestry of Italian mobsters. And to add insult to this injury to the fans of the historic show, Tony's relevance gets washed up in small and indirect increments that give way to only a few elements of his rising persona and the inner demons that ultimately come back to haunt him as an adult in the series.Don't know if it was Chase or Taylor who dropped the ball on this one, but both seemed to have contributed to ruining the only real shot at a deeper look into the deep well that is Tony's dark soul. Giving this film a 6 is gratuitous only for the sake of the beautiful cinematography and orchestrated designs of 1960s Newark. But if you're expecting an origin story 'masterpiece' with the same neorealism style of the Sopranos, better go rewatch the series and reminisce and avoid this 'piscadoo'.",The Many Saints of Newark
798,cevnsp,Really enjoyable with flaws.,8,23 September 2021,"As a sopranos fan I really enjoyed this movie.The story isn't predictable (mostly) with lots of strange sopranos happenings throughout keeping you interested and surprised the whole time, although the ending seemed a little confused.The movie definitely has a goodfellas / sopranos blend of dark comedy, but the movie is unfortunately marketed as a Tony origin story, which it isn't, and he ultimately is not much more than a supporting character who doesn't really add much to the film, despite a good performance from Gandolfini.The characters new portrayals are mostly done very well, with Livia, paulie and others capturing the essence of the character, with others (Silvio) being more of an impression. Other characters are there simply to look like the original actors, with Carmela and Janice being scarily accurate.My biggest gripe is with some of the on the nose references. When Tony is talking about Playing football, the cinema was already laughing when it cut to junior shaking his head, but they unfortunately added the famous ""never had the makings"" line which would have been funnier if left out.The line from the trailer about baby Christopher crying around Tony again, was understood through context and didn't need to be spelled out to us.Despite the flaws, I loved the Dickie moltisanti storyline, the acting, setting, visuals and more, but I wish they would have maybe removed it from the sopranos fan service clutter a little bit.",The Many Saints of Newark

It made us think we would actually be seeing a movie about Tony growing up yet he had so little to do with the plot. Unfortunately his subplot was the most interesting in the movie.It's all about Dickie yet we never actually feel any of Dickie's struggles. I mean he murders his own father and we never see his internal struggles with this after the fact. Just one and done. Tony struggled more in the series when he was thinking of have his uncle June whacked. Also, we never really saw Dickie influence Tony at all. From what we can gather, Tony admired him and that was the extent of it.What did the race riots and civil rights sub plot add? Nothing at all. I'm not really sure why we saw it or why there was so much time dedicated to this subplot. It didn't effect the outcome of the characters AT ALL. If that would've been who killed Dickie then sure, but nope. Just was added to be PC maybe? I'm not really sure.Overall, I would say skip it.

817,OrlandoDreamer2022,Oooof Madone! So disappointing!,2,24 September 2021,I'm a die hard Sopranos fan and watched the TV seasons multiple times so when it was announced that a theatrical version was being made I really could not wait. After getting even more pumped up by the fantastic trailers I can't believe what a let down this film was.The plot is so weak and did not flow at all.The younger versions of the characters that we all love did good jobs in recreating their mannerisms but sometimes they went way over the top especially Silvio Dante. Also some of the fan homages were way too frequent. Would of been better adding just a few of these in but there were too many for my liking.Alessandro Nicola and Vera Farmiga were the standout performers but could only do so much with such a weak story.In the TV show it's made out that Dickie Moltisante is Tony's hero but from my memory I'm not sure where they depict this in the film and for what reason he would look up to him. There isn't any part where Dickie does anything to impress Tony. Feels like Tony is a spare part in this film which frustrating as he was the focal point of the TV show and I personally wanted to see how he became the character he grew up to be.Also the ending just didn't feel like there was any justification for the demise of a character?Feel like maybe David Chase is better suited to writing for TV where you have longer to flesh out a story.I know that it was a tall order to live up to but came out deflated after this long wait.Maybe if a sequel comes out it can.,The Many Saints of Newark

The film ends extremely abruptly as it just starts to feel like its picking up momentum and it feels very unsatisfying.Its difficult to relate or empathise with any of the new characters who were not in the original show because none of them are given the screen time to be properly developed outside of their surface level.On the bright side there is heaps of fan service and a lot of fun references thrown in as well as a few stand out performances, Michael Gandolfini was surprisingly convincing as a young Tony and John Magaro is absolutely perfect as Silvio.The film is a mediocre experience at best, as a big fan of The Sopranos its a shame to see a lot of wasted potential as this film clearly could of been done a lot better.",The Many Saints of Newark

822,rfaddes,Ticked a lot of boxes but I was left wanting more.,8,27 September 2021,"As a die hard Sopranos fan I was excited about the prospect of a prequel. I wanted to see a young Tony coming in to his own, showing early signs of the character that kept us hooked for years and perhaps learning his skills in the art of manipulation. I didn't feel I got this.I must stress, ""many saints"" is not a Tony Soprano film, it is a Dickie Moltisanti film. Which is not a bad thing, I did expect more of a presence from Tony. However, the character of Dickie is more than enough to hold an audience's attention for two hours.The casting is spot on. Corey Stoll steals the show for me as Jr Soprano and Vera Farmiga actually manages to create some sympathy for the character of livia. But I wanted to see more of Michael Gandolfini and Jon Bernthal. Bernthals character, Johnny Boy Soprano, is very underused in my opinion.As much as I enjoyed the story and the occasional references to the TV show, as the film came to a close I felt like I was ready for another hour to wrap things up. I didn't feel like enough questioned were answered and a couple of story lines were left floating in the wind.I saw the film with 3 friends. 2 of them were big fans of the TV show and the other had seen a few episodes so had a basic knowledge of main characters. Once we left the cinema the 3 fans were left scratching our heads while the other thought it was a fantastic film. So I guess chase has done a good job of bringing these characters to a new generation of viewer but has not delivered for the existing fans of the franchise in terms of answering the many questions regarding Tony's relationship with Chris on the show.I can't fault the cast and the story so I can't take too many stars of the review and I'm sure 90% of viewers will really enjoy it, but I just felt like I would have happily sat through an extra hour to properly wrap things up.",The Many Saints of Newark

827,andrewgigan,Big oof,3,3 October 2021,"Where to start; let's be positive. The acting for what it was, was pretty decent. I think the casting was fair for the most part. I'm relieved young Micheal Gandolfini's lack of experience didn't bog anything down, in fact I think he held his own very well. Characters we met before were also well done, in particular Olivia Soprano was portrayed extremely well (in my estimation). Okay here's the not so good parts - everything else. The plot for this movie I think centers around Dickie Moltisanti and his life over maybe 5-6 years crammed into a 2 hour window with zero breathing room. Mixed in there you got a returning Micheal Imperioli playing a supernaturally resurrected Christopher Moltisanti for about 4 lines of narration (what.) An international non entity goomar from Italy, Ray Liotta getting 2 pay checks (good on ya.) Little Tony Soprano being naughty for about 20 minutes of screen time and the Newark riots as a B plot that did not quite connect to plot A for some reason. This was it. A clip show featuring your favorite Soprano characters. That was this movies biggest problem. It was a messy clip show that had a hard time connecting it's dots. Like many other reviewers I think The Many Saints Of Newark would have done better as a 6 episode mini series, where characters and plots could have had more room to breathe. So final thoughts - hats off to the actors, they did their best. I don't know who to blame for the spotty story and editing.

829,davidsalinas-20569,In my opinion.,7,4 October 2021,"The fact that David Chase got involved in the writting but not on the direction, I think, is the biggest problem here. The movie should've had been at least 4-hours long, they wanted to tell us a story with so much information and characters in just a 2-hours film, big mistake. We shouldn't blame the actors that are interpreting our favorite characters from the show because, let's be honest, I'm not saying it just because I'm a huge Sopranos fan, the characters in the series are perfectly executed by their respective actors because the characters and the actors are literally the same person. Tony Sirico looks like Paulie in every other project he has work on, Steven Van Zandt's character in Lily-hammer is literally Silvio Dante, Pussy and Vincent Pastore are the same person, you could corroborate this information by seeing any interview with him. And I'm not just talking about personality, even physically, they are just so particularly specific that I could easily understand why It could have been so hard to pull-off this characters. And I think thats why they didn't show us a lot of scenes from them, to make a sort of combination between a real scene and our imagination. Paulie was great, I think he was the best character from the old ones, even thought unfortunately we didn't got much from him in this film. Jon Bernthal's Johnny Boy Soprano was awesome, perfectely balanced between an easily-irritated mobster and a Husband/Dad. Junior was a little bit lame, maybe he is in fact sort of dumb, but he has been the boss for some reason for so long, maybe he ain't a gunslinger, but he had that emotional intelligence that defined him, even though he just cares about him and his own interests. Not a huge fan of the casting and his apperenance on the movie. Silvio was so weird, he did looked like a cartoonish parody from a Late Night show badly executed, I'm not saying the actor was the problem, in fact, he is a good actor, but I don't know what the executives of the film where thinking when they where working on the characterization and the script from this character, I can't believe they didn't even got the aging right, I think they nailed the rol he has on the mob Family tho, but that's it. Pussy was okay, I didnt't like his appereance on the first pictures that came out, but meh, he does the job and the voice kinda sounds like Vincent's.Same with Livia, the actress is great, but, the character from the show has very specific style and manners that are almost impossible to imitate, or at least to look alike.Ray Liotta had a good character, but I think that was unnecessary his fate on the movie and the fact that he has a twin brother who happens to look exactly the same like him. Everyone thought that we would make Ercole DiMeo when the first pictures came out, that would have been perfect.Dickie Moltisanti was good. Here is my problem, the chemistry between him and Tony was gaining strenght and sense and they just cut it off. That's one of the main reasons I thought this movie should have been at least 4-hours long. Michael Gandolfini showed us that he has the capacity of pulling off a very important character like Tony Soprano, yeah he is practically Tony Soprano's real life son, but we all know that James Gandolfini was in another level, and the fact that Michael did got close to a very good interpretation of a young complicated Mobster is very impressive being his debut.I think we could have seen more young characters, Ralph Cifaretto, Richie Aprile, Hesh, younger Johnny Sack, Carmine Lupertazzi and maybe Carmine Jr. Too, Carlo Gervasi, etc. I know some of them could have been in the can, but at least mentioning them or a cameo or something.Adding Carmela was great, for at least 2-3 minutes we got to see a young relationship between Tony and her, and I think that was awesome.I don't have any issues with the racial problem, unlikely most of the critics that I have read in this platform, but I have to say that some times is tiring that a lot of movies, Tv-shows, short-cuts, Musical videos, etc. Have to include any social problem that we are still dealing with, we just want to watch a great story, if it's not necessary I think it just doesn't need to be there. But, the racial problem in 60's-70's was in fact a problem, and the DiMeo crime family did had trouble with African Americans, thats why I don't have any problem with that area of the film. I think adding Frank Lucas gave a little bit more class to the movie, for a second I thought I was listening to Denzel Washington's character from American Gangster.Adding Christopher's voice gave me nostalgia, he was my second favorite character from the Series, people say that it was odd to make him a narrator from the movie because how does he will know the story of his Father if he was a baby when all of this happened and he is death. I mean... It's a movie, of course sometimes things will not make sense, they are telling us a story, Super-heroes fighting Aliens that are coming from a big hole on the sky does makes sense? No. So I think that's just criticizing the movie of everything they made with it.Yes, it could have been a lot lot better, but I think they were more obstacles in the process of which we know. I gave it a 7 because I did enjoy every single moment of the movie, regardless all the issues we just talked about, they are even more, but I thought those were the most important for me. I hope they came out with a second part, and I hope is better in every single aspect.P. S. I still have trouble with the relationship between Tony and Chris; I know some theories about why Tony killed him, but, I still don't get it. They loved each other so much.",The Many Saints of Newark

But let me start out by saying this movie felt like one big YouTube video some guys made to achieve the same effect as the films creators. Like they wanted it to be one long name drop. Reusing the same jokes and quips from the show. The same expletives. And even just crammed in every ""old memory"" ever talked about on the show. Tony and his friends were a very small part of the film and it was basically just about dicky. Also a local black criminal was introduced and it makes no sense to even be discussing him unless he was a main reason the family formed the way it is today. The movie even ends abruptly and the only reason we see it coming was the trays. Otherwise you'd have no idea the end is near. Just not a very well told story, felt like it had nothing to do with the mob or a ""young tony soprano"". Huge huge disappointment after being a die hard fan for more than 20 years.

I enjoyed seeing Dickie but wanted more Johnny and Junior. I loved the narration. I didn't mind the racial issues but they did seem a bit out of context.

For half the film he's just a chubby 9 year old. Then magically a 17 year old. But the fact the film is not centred around him anyway makes all that pointless as all we see are series of unrelated events unfold. Whatever happened to storytelling? Plot? Tension? There must be storytellers in Hollywood? In the end, you walk away feeling cheated, confused and wondering why the hell you just sat through that for 2 hours.

To be fair, that's mainly because the story is muck.The movie can't decide if it wants to be a gangster movie or a comment on racial tensions and as such manages to do neither.For instance what was the point of Ray Liotta in this film, it's almost like a decision was made to grab someone from the golden years of gangster movies and hope he lends credibility to the story... which he doesn't! And if anything I feel he takes away from the movie.I also hated seeing the younger versions of well liked characters who when you see them being portrayed again on screen come across more like caricatures of themselves.

Just comes off as a cheesy play by children not a professionals. Then half the movie was going on and on about the riots and the black protesters.. why are we watching black protesters?

At the most basic level, the Sopranos series is wonderful because of fantastic character depth. Every character in the series is well acted with story lines that bring out varied nuances of good, bad, weakness and strength, and the character traits produce actions that carefully craft where the story is going next. This movie was terribly disappointing in its development of character depth and replaced what could or should have been with random space filler. Take Carmella, for instance. Amazing character in the series, but shown here standing for a minute without any lines. Many reviewers complain about the inclusion of the racial relations sub plot. That too was extremely weak and mostly reminded me of how great ""American Gangster "" was in comparison showing the Frank Lucas story, or Chalky in ""Boardwalk Empire"".

No.However if you're a fan of the show prepare to be entertained for two hours in what looks to me like a movie length pilot of the young Tony Soprano.A lot of people may have went in with different expectations but I went in cold.Jon Bernthal and Vera Farmiga are known for TV work, as is Ray Liotta, Michael Gandolfini is likely willing and David Chase has signed with Warnermedia for a new big project.A lot of the younger versions of characters we already know, were given just enough so you know who they are.So taking all that in, I can't wait to see more. It's seems obvious with some of the unanswered questions we got.The bad - like season1 of the Sopranos (which had narration much like this) had some of the characters will need a little more work for a longer project.The most obvious being Silvio Dante and to some extent Paulie.With the ending how it is, the stage is set for a long form show.Now if that doesn't happen, I may regrade it.

889,sestanden,BadaBing,7,3 October 2021,"I'm seeing a lot of hate on this movie, and while I understand where people could find this a disappointment, I think the hype they must have had in their heads around it is more of the reason behind their letdown than anything else.I agree with 2 major criticisms- this probably could have been more detailed as a mini series, and the trailers inaccurately made the audience think these films were going to be centered around Tony.However, I think people are forgetting what The Sopranos was all about at it's very core - a good man who did bad things... or a bad man who wanted to be good... you decide. And this theme is very much still present and reoccurring throughout the film. The other major theme I think carried over from the series is that it's taking an unrelatable premise (mob life) and thrusting it onto a relatable man who wants the same things everyone else wants- success, family, love, etc.At times, the story could drag or seem inconsequential, but that's life. And all this relates back to why we were all in that theater - how did Tony Soprano become Tony Soprano? It's just not obvious, and it makes you think.Overall I really enjoyed the film for that reason, and the quality of the casting blew me away.And for all you asking, ""what was the plot, what was the point?"" You tell me. After all, what was the point of the Russian in the Woods? That's the beauty of the world David Chase created and I say just go along for the ride.",The Many Saints of Newark

I enjoyed the fact that this wasn't a childish glorification or perverse romance for simple or broken minds of what street crime is. The characters are imperfect and problematic which probably why they're in crime anyway. They have their obvious flaws that would demote them to a life of crime, which if your around people like that and not voyeurising them from a distance with preconceived made up fantasies is completely accurate. A few characters spend a large swath of time incarcerated causing brutal disruptions in family dynamics which is a reflection of that life. The story is hodge podge is a beautiful way because it again accurately reflects that life and it's chaos. So for want-to-be's and namby-pambies this may not be for you. Try a video game.

Adding Michael Gandolfini to the cast only emphasized that expectation. This film barely touched on TS and focused on Dicky Montalsanti, a character that I don't recall ever being mention on The Sopranos. The overall story was uninteresting.

It had the potential of being excellent, with a strong cast and intense interest. But wokeness and pandering to BLM had to poison another facet of our society, the classic masterful Sopranos series.Viewers tuned into Many Saints of Newark to see the origins of their favorite characters and how they were shaped and affected. The rioting and black panther poetry lent absolutely nothing to move the plot forward, nor to enhance it at all; it was shortly for the appeasement of woke culture and was, quite frankly, insulting.Vera Farmiga did a very good job of portraying a young Livia and Michael Gandolfini played a young Tony well, nailing his mannerisms.I personally enjoyed having Christopher narrate parts of the story; it brought back that familiarity of the series that was probably its saving grace to some extent.If there is a sequel to this prequel, please please focus on the characters and their stories, not pander to the political climate of the day.

902,michelefury,Judge the film for yourself and don't compare it to The Sopranos.,8,4 October 2021,"This film does not depict our ""favorite"" characters as heroes, but the violent, chauvinistic, often hypocritical monsters that they really are. Because the show was spread out over 8 years, often times, we would see the really ugly sides of the characters, but then the writers would give us a softer side for an episode or two, so we almost forget that they are murderers, cheaters, liars. Thieves, and traitors. Because this film is only 2 hours long, the writers focus on the ugly truth that we already knew deep down, which is why the narration is such a brilliant way to solidify the point that the movie is not about ""good"" men.People are denying that the writers developed Anthony Soprano's character in the film, or that they did not focus on Dickie Moltisanti's relationship with Tony, but in this case, less is more. The story line in about how Tony Soprano's life is shaped by growing up as the son of a prominent gangster in the DiMeo crime family. The plot of the film strongly relies on our familiarity with the characters from the show because there is not enough time to give 100 back stories and present a decent plot. The plot focuses on developing Dickie Moltisanti's character, since he played a father role for Tony, considering Johnny Soprano spent a large deal of Tony's youth in prison. In order to develop this character and really tie together all of the information that we received from the show, the writers had to create a conflict for our beloved mobsters, and their choice is brilliant, given then current state of civility today and the state of civility in the time period the film is set.The beauty of the writing of the film is that is showcases mob mentality through two different groups: the Italian Mafia, and the African American group that challenged their power. The film is meant to challenge the viewer to realize that violence, oppression, pride, prowess, dominance, and greed never amount to much more than a bunch of chaos, death, and destruction, which was a prominent theme in the show. It also showcases that people will view the same exact behavior in different ways based on who is displaying the behavior. Perhaps the writers are trying to help people identify their own biases and hypocrisies.Either way, the conflict between Harold McBrayer and Dickie Moltisanti is necessary in developing Dickie's character, and ultimately in understanding how Tony Soprano came to be the character we hate to love. Don't watch this film through a narrow lense, and don't compare it to the show. What the writers and directors can convey in 2 hours vs 90 hours is incomparable. Look at the film as a stand alone that gives us a little background about characters that we are already familiar with. It was nice to see Michael Gandolfini own the role and make it his own, while still staying true to the character that we know.",The Many Saints of Newark

904,phytotech,Good background to the Sopranos for some of the characters,8,4 October 2021,"Like many reviewers, I was intrigued by the film concept and was looking forward to the movie. Unlike many reviewers, I really enjoyed the movie. I was ending high school and attending college during the time depicted. It was Vietnam war, it was Martin Luther King and the Black Panthers. It was the beginning of what I consider to be the golden age of rock and roll (lots of background music in the movie).The snippets of events with either characters directly from the Sopranos or historical ones helped me to see how ultimately Tony was shaped and sought out his inevitable criminal career. I thought Michael captured the teenage essence of the grownup Tony of the Sopranos. Great to see his mother and father and of course, Uncle Dickie, who was depicted as a complex character trying to be better than his father, but ultimately becoming like him in spite of himself.Interesting to see how Tony's grownup self's wife has similar mannerisms to his mother.I do not feel that the movie was in any way ""woke"" because it showed blacks assuming criminal power and pushing back at the mafia.

Tries to build Dickie Moltesanti as an interesting character but fails at it.

909,emaleth333,So many reviewers missed the point,8,3 October 2021,"OMG people...This movie wasn't a a Tony Soprano origin story. It was a story about the person (people) AND the environment that had influence over him. Sopranos gave us a new outlook to the mob story, it added facets to a character beyond being a one dimensional sociopathic gangster. This movie is a similar story of someone who tried to do better but couldn't get past who they really were.Honestly, did any of you naysayers not realize that the name Moltisante contains the word SAINT, and if you don't speak Italian Molti means ""a lot"" or you know MANY, the freaking title of the movie. Its about Dickie, not the Soprano family, which is why Christopher is the narrator and not a a Soprano kid.And for those spitting out about hollywood woke-ness, those riots actually occurred in Newark, two cops did pull a taxi driver out of the car and nearly beat him to death, this would have definitely affected the mindset of a teen growing up in an environment where gangsters were using the riot backdrop to cover up their crimes i.e. No consequences. Let me add as someone who grew up in north Jersey, the racism is as rampant there as you'd find in a klan rally, the Jersey guys just dressed better. This mixture of history, culture, subculture, family etc created Tony Soprano and this movie was just a sprinkling of what formed that character.In reference to the addition of the black gangster, I don't believe it was showing woke-ness, he's a not a hero or antihero, he's a sociopath too. If I had to guess he was there to develop a spin-off or a sequel. This is about money, not political pandering.Look, I rarely put in reviews but so many people missed the point I was compelled to add my opinion... even though no ones opinions should matter but your own.

914,gdvid,I liked it more than I thought I would.,7,5 October 2021,"I do not agree with the people who say that this movie was not what was advertised. Chase said that this will not be the Sopranos. As even the poster says, it's about the man who made Tony who he is. And I think if you have seen the series, you can see many similarities between Dickie and future Tony. He has the same murderous rage Tony had, and after he commits atrocities he goes and tries to make things better by doing good deeds no one has asked for and blames everyone but himself for his mistakes. He kills his girlfriend by choking her same way Tony almost did to Gloria. He attacks Joey Diaz's character after he says something out of line about her the same way Tony would. At first he tries to stop his girlfriend from buying the beauty parlor and only helps her after some time and a lot of fights, similar of what Tony did to Carmela with her contracts. He laughs at the pain of others, makes petty and hurtful remarks, cheats on his wife, is racist, is still charming, kills a parental figure (Tony didn't do it but he did try) and he is seen as a leader by his peers. You can see the older Tony in him in a lot of scenes. And Alessandro Nivola did a great job portraying Dickie!I also appreciated the way the other characters' personalities were mostly true to their origins. Junior was a jealous man with a fragile ego, not really taken seriously by other gangsters, we all knew that about him, and his actor's voice was pretty similar to Junior in the show. Vera Farmiga played Livia Soprano really well, she did the best job out of the cast in my opinion, the voice and the expressions were mostly on point, her dialogue could have been a bit meaner though. Paulie was a pleasant surprise for me, I really didn't think it would work but it kinda did, even though his introduction with him painting his nails over food was really forced (Just like most of the other fan-service stuff in the movie). Pussy was okay, I only remember hearing his voice a few times. I didn't like Silvio, even though he is my favorite character on the show. Maybe it was his voice but he seemed like an exaggerated parody of the actual Silvio, very overacted, even annoying. And then there is Michael Gandolfini who in my opinion did a good job, not amazing but pretty good, especially with the shoes he had to fill. His posture and facial expressions were close but his voice was weird. But you have to remember, this isn't the Tony you know from the show, this is him like 30 years before. He is still trying to please his mother, and he doesn't yet have the platform to do all the stuff we can see Dickie do. Also, the amount of funerals in the movie was a nice nod to the show, always another toothpick.The Harold storyline wasn't bad but didn't really come to a conclusion either, I wouldn't say it was unnecessary as it did two things well. Made viewers believe that he was about to do the hit on Dickie for the longer part, so it did help make the twist at the end a bit more surprising. His affair with Dickie's girlfriend made the main character choke her, showing again his similarity with Tony. Also it adds a bit to the world, the show did mention the Newark Riots of the 60s.The bad things: The first segment was a bit longer than it needed to be. Corny fan service moments, a bit bumpy storyline, the ice cream truck scene was out of place, Silvio's overacting (he is not a subtle character but he is a lot more subtle than that!).Overall I didn't find it bad, although I did go in with low expectations. It wasn't close to the level of the show, but you obviously cannot do in 2 hours what you can in like 80 episodes. Many have expected something amazing, which it's not, it's just good/not bad. I think people who have a negative opinion will come around sooner or later.",The Many Saints of Newark

How could it as there is no heart, no one to root for, no humor, and is nothing more than a misguided mishmash of mafia meatballs and macaroni? If I didn't know David Chase was at the helm I would have guessed it came from a Community College upstart living outside Duluth, Minnesota where the acronym LCN translates to Long Cold Nights. Where is the character development that allows us to care if someone lives, loves, or dies? Where is the explanation of what caused the Newark Riots and why is this even in the movie other than David Chase said he'd be interested in doing a movie that takes place during the Newark Riots? He may as well have said during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and have flooding and rooftop rescues in the background while never mentioning the storm that preceded it. And who, please answer me, who, thought it was clever to cast the same actor in two different roles that strained credulity and actually made me pause the movie and say aloud, Wait, WHAT? This movie has no idea what its about or what it wants to be when it grows up. Cringeworthy dialogue, underused characters who could have added depth and heart, and a string of half baked plot lines that never coalesce had me constantly checking to see how much time was left before it was finally and blissfully over.

""Sal Moltasanti"" played by the excellent Ray Liotta "" It's the wanting. All life is pain. Pain comes from always wanting things.""Was the long wait worth the pain...?Ultimately I was a bit underwelmed & wanting more.It's a great stand alone gangster film, but I must stress it's really the back story of Dickie Moltasanti not solely about Tony Soprano.Dickie brilliantly played by Alessandro Nivola will no doubt receive an acadamy award nomination.In fact we don't get to see much of young T' at all.So where is Tony during all this? For the first hour of the film, he is 9 years old and played by William Ludwig in what is nothing more than a cameo roll.It's later when Tony hits 17 years old we get an insight into how the man was made.By this time he's played by Michael Gandolfini who looks eerily like his father.The film hits all the right notes historically - culminating in the 1967 Newark race riots that saw more than 2 dozen killed and hundreds injured as black rioters looted & fought against the police.I felt the narrative of The Many Saints explored the root causes of the italian mob moving out to the suburbs, away from all the devastation in central Newark.A bloody turf war is sparked by Harold ( Leslie Odom Jnr) one of Dickies former ""employees"" when he decides that he and his Black family deserve a piece of the book the Italians run in the city - this is the key part of the story.If I can be critical of David Chase , too much was crammed into a 2 hour film.

Art and entertainment is not free from this charlatanism, and audiences have come to expect sequels, prequels and spins offs; but, in a post post-modern world, where audiences are now not only aware of the inner workings of narrative but also the inner workings of the industry, it's important to start asking: is nothing sacred?When The Sopranos first aired between 1999 and 2007, it was revered by critics and is regarded by many to be one of the best examples of television as art; therefore, when the announcement was made in 2018 that David Chase would continue Sopranos lore with a prequel named The Many Saints of Newark, the question on many people's minds was ""why?"" Why risk tarnishing the legacy of a TV show that is frequently lauded as the greatest of all time?When the first theatrical trailer for The Many Saints of Newark was released earlier this year the easter egg hunt began, and even the most ardent cynic will have enjoyed identifying who's who in the cast of youngsters now playing characters that they once knew to be in middle age and beyond. Unfortunately for The Many Saints of Newark, identifying characters and nods to moments within the TV series is about as much fun that can be had with this ill-fated prequel.Set against the 1967 Newark riots and the influence they had on the community, the main plot clumsily explores a power struggle between DiMeo crime family captain Dickie Moltisanti and his African American associate Harold McBrayer. The pair begin the film on good terms with McBrayer overseeing the Italians' gambling operations in the black community. However, influenced by the rise of the Black Panthers in the aftermath of the riots, Harold decides that illicit operations within the black community should be controlled by the black community and attempts to force the Italians out. This leads to a gang war that is never fully resolved.The story lacks focus as Chase (co-writer) and Alan Taylor (director) awkwardly attempt to appease the audience with a lesson in Soprano family history; thankfully, they don't always fail. Vera Farmiga as Oliva Soprano and Michael Gandolfini as a teenage Tony eerily revive the volatile mother/son relationship with the same tight-rope tension and melancholic frustration as their senior counterparts. Michael Gandolfini in particular manages to balance Tony's playful side and his vicious rage with the same ease as his late father. Corey Stoll as Corrado 'Junior' Soprano undermining teenage Tony's athletic prowess is an especially amusing highlight and welcome nod to one of the funnier moments in the TV series; however, the more screen time these legendary characters are given, the more they begin to act like caricatures - this is most evident in John Magaro's over the top portrayal of Silvio Dante.Other than drawing to a conclusion a question that is left unanswered in the TV series, this addition to The Sopranos story is entirely superfluous. There are amusing moments throughout, but they're simply filler in what could have been an interesting film about race riots, white flight, and the rise of drugs in organised crime. David Chase had a seemingly interesting movie in mind and the impression is given that he simply used these revered characters as a means to secure interest and funding in a story that he ultimately failed to tell.In the very first episode of The Sopranos, Tony tells Dr. Melfi, his therapist, that he ""came in at the end, the best is over""; if, in order to get interesting films made, legendary characters and canon must be sacrificed, is the best over for cinema?",The Many Saints of Newark
925,avkelly-73918,Enjoyed It!,9,9 October 2021,"I have been looking forward to this movie for a long time. I've seen many harsh reviews, so was expecting it wouldn't be that good. I really liked the movie, the storyline gives a lot of backdrop that helps to better understand some of the storylines in the Sopranos. I fully went into this telling myself not to compare or expect it to be as great as the Sopranos, which I think is the expectation for many. Watching Michael Gandofini was very surreal, he looks so much like his Dad. They did a good job with the other characters (actors that resemble what they looked like in the Sopranos). Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As I said, don't get hyped up expecting it to be on the same level as the Sopranos, you may enjoy it more without the expectation.",The Many Saints of Newark

The mannerism of some of the younger characters were great as well. The story is definitely lacking though, and the mix of the race relations story was terrible in the end.

Why isnt there more of the family in general, on their operations, on how Tony got involved, how he grew and evolved as a person in a violent, crazy but loving mafia family? Where is the crazy and violent but yet loving relationship between Tony, Dick and the rest of the family?1 ""serious"" talk on the bed , and 3 pinches on the cheek and the word ""gagoots""; really?Instead, I get a racial movie about an afro-american and his struggle while running the numbers. Some riots, and a step-mom/mistress that Dick used to have sex with. What is this?The only positive thing in the movie is Vera Farmiga interpretation of Livia. Bravo.I've never been more disappointed in a movie. 2/10.",The Many Saints of Newark
928,chuckbuk,Just Okay,3,11 October 2021,"I loved The Sopranos. I thought this film was just okay. LIke many of the criticisms I have read, I do believe the movie tried to do too much in too short of time. In fact the first hour and the second hour seemed two different types of movies. So here are my thoughts:1) I loved the idea of this movie. The character of Dickie had so much potentital. THe U. S. is a myth-building culture. Our heroes are big, exaggerated, bold. So are our villains. I expected Dickie to be this big, especially since we was only an associate but who made alot of money and had a lot of influence. Sort of like Jimmy Burke. But there was nothing that even hinted that he was a big deal. He carried a lot of money and he ran numbers. This is not the stuff of mythbuilding. In The Sopranos Tony talked of him taking the war to New England when he took out an entire crew up there himself. This was not shown or even hinted at. A missed opportunity. Dickie seemed... well, regular.2) When did Dickie mentor Tony? Did I miss it? Where did Tony in the movie actually look up to Dickie? When did Dickie actually teach Tony anything? I expected this movie to show a lot more of this ""mentorship""... I didn't see much if anything.3) What's the deal with Dickie coaching deaf kids baseball? That was a throwaway scene. No one in the family was even deaf. What prompted this? And just as quickly as it was shown, it disappeared. Horrible.4) The who shot Dickie scene Are we to assume the cop did it (per The Sopranos) on you know who's orders? If so, nothing indicates the cop's character at all. And kill Dickie for a slight like that? Seems very contrived and convenient.5) In The Sopranos, Dickie was an addict and a alcoholic. Aside from two scenes of him taking a sip off a pint of vodka, there's none of that. Another missed opportunity to show a really complex and troubled character.In the end, I ask myself this. If The Sopranos never existed, and some newbie screenwriter presented this script to an agent or a studio, would it get picked up? I say not a chance.",The Many Saints of Newark
929,iambadgood,Disappointed,3,11 October 2021,"Disappointed. Like one other reviewer had noted, they spent too much time on black empowerment, I was looking forward to a mafia movie. I also think they could've focused more on the characters we came to like from the Sopranos. I would like to see more of the younger Pauly and the younger Sil, especially considering these actors put a lot of effort into developing the mannerisms. And how about Tony, why did we not get to see him cross over?",The Many Saints of Newark
930,GJ4795,"Hard to believe the man who changed TV, made this",3,13 October 2021,"The best part of the film was the parts of it that were directly from the show (Johnny and Juniors arrest, Johnny shooting his wife's hair, and Christopher being the narrator). Unfortunately, these things could not have held the story together because there was no true plot to the film. I was hoping for more of seeing how Dickie molded Tony, Tony's relationships with the men he would one day be the closest too, why Tony was so close to Dickie and not his father or uncle Jun; instead the audience got snippets that never truly connected to each other. So many questions left unanswered and because this is a prequel, there is no real way of answering then.As a huge fan of the show and all that it was, take my advice and just stick to the show if you are in a Sopranos mood!",The Many Saints of Newark

You cannot replicate the plot and character development of an 86 episode TV show in a 2 hour movie. If you can accept that reality, it's a good movie.

936,IncoherentRamblings,The Many Disappointments of Newark,4,28 October 2021,"The Many Saints of Newark was sold as a coming of age story for Tony Soprano. Trailers suggested narrative focus on Tony's childhood and adolescence, under the tutelage of the crime family. Instead, we were given a sub-par relationship drama involving Dickie and his goomah.Those expecting reasonable screen time for Michael Gandolfini will be sorely disappointed. Michael's shuffled to the sideline. What little screen time he has, he demonstrates an uncanny ability to carry his father's body language, mannerisms, and capacity for serious dramatic performance.Those expecting ""origin stories"" for anything more than quips in the TV series will also be disappointed. TMSoN narratively has little to do with the show beyond names. Viewers of the series already saw Tony's father get arrested at the Carnival, and already know that Silvio has hand gestures and Paulie has a distinct laugh.Viewers looking for a light to shine on Pussy, Paulie, or Silvio will too be disappointed. The movies focuses on the least interesting reoccurring theme in the series - who is sleeping with who. We get it, Dickie and everyone else has mistresses.Last, and most controversially, TMSoN seemed to prioritize industry equity over diegetic continuity. Despite superb acting and reasonable (albeit shallow) story lines, the characters and their relevance had no connection to the series' universe. The Sopranos had shockingly little attention - or even reference to - the African American crime families in NJ or NY. At best, this movie serves as an unsatisfying explanation for why Tony and Paulie were racists. As a movie marketed and sold as an origin story, spending so much screen time on irrelevant characters and issues is a huge let down for fans.Overall, the acting is great but too little screen time is given to those who would become mainstays of the TV series. Silvio, Paulie, and Pussy are tossed in with little thought. Their respective actors did what they could, but are otherwise shuffled to the side with Tony. Considering the material David Chase had to work with, this was a hugely wasted opportunity to satisfy the itch of a recently reinvigorated fanbase.Lastly, and perhaps a minor gripe, but did Ray Liotta have to be cast in a twin/brother role? This trope works in series like Living with Yourself, but it comes across as cheap and groan-worthy in movies. It was a terrible casting choice that, in my opinion, distracts from the movie.If you're looking for a mediocre crime drama, you might like TMSoN. If you're a long-time fan of the series, avoid this like the plague. It's a waste of time that has little to do with the main series.",The Many Saints of Newark
937,simonmccrea,"Okay, but disappointing",7,30 October 2021,"Very disappointing for a sequel to the sopranos which in my opinion is one of the best series ever made.

938,jlowe-92281,Exhilarating and expansive,8,31 October 2021,"While this film wasn't perfect, it was certainly a welcome addition to the Sopranos universe. The cast from top to bottom is start studded and stacked. The Many Saints of Newark is filled with great performances from new characters such as the lead character, Dickie Moltisanti (played by Alessandro Nivola). Nivola embodied the living legacy of a man that was only described verbally in The Sopranos. Junior Soprano couldn't have been casted better, from inciting iconic quotes to committing shocking acts out of jealousy and greed, Corey Stoll delivered as uncle June. Michael Gandolfinni's performance as a young Tony Soprano gave us a bit more of an insight into his home life and behavior as a teenager growing into a young man. Tony's relationship with his mother Livia Soprano (played by Vera Farmiga) was front and center. Tony's love, conflict and hardship with Livia only expanded what was already such an iconic and rich relationship. We didn't get to see much of Johnny Boy Soprano (played by Jon Bernthal) in this film, partly due to his stint in prison, this only leads me to believe that we will see a follow up project, whether that be a film, TV show or mini series. It appears that Dickie was what Tony wished his father was, and in some ways he saw him as more of a mentor, he was active in his life, he included him and allowed him to have freedom. There are many interesting stories that have been yet to be explored, and there's still characters that need to be fleshed out. In conclusion, this film was billed as being an expansion on Tony's character, in reality, it was the story of Dickie Moltisanti. Many questions remain, such as what happened to Harald, what other conflicts did the Dimeo crime family go through between 1973 and 1999, what was the relationship between Johnny and Junior, did anyone ever find out who actually ordered the death of Dickie and how did Tony, Paulie, Silvio, Pussy, Ralphie, Jackie and others grow into the hardened mobsters we know of.

940,johnnyenglish-13933,A unique journey through mob reality,10,9 November 2021,"One things that David Chase understands well is the human condition.Not only does he tell a good back story, but he connects the two era's on a spiritual level. He also gives the story great depth by emphasizing how fragile physical life is, even more so when your purpose is to be part of the mob.Perhaps going to these levels was made possible because of the vast range of experiences portrayed in the TV show.It shows better than any other mob movie I have seen that much of the emotional expression of people in the mob is through anger; and that whatever good intentions you may have, you accept just as night follows day, that when you live by the sword, you die by it.Ray Liotta as Salvatore ""Sally"" Moltisanti is actually better than his alter ego, ""Hollywood Dick"" Moltisanti, Dickie's father. He is serving life in prison and has devoted his life to introspection and contemplation. His perspective enables him to become a de facto spiritual adviser to Dickie.At the end of the movie, you just feel that it could not have been done any better.",The Many Saints of Newark
941,youbetshiraz,The most disappointed I've ever been with a David Chase creation,2,4 October 2021,"Ten minutes into this movie and I was giddy with delight. 30 minutes in I was asking what was happening. After the first hour, I couldn't believe the train wreck on my screen. I didn't come to this movie expecting another The Sopranos. David Chase already did that, it was perfect, and it is over.What I did expect was an intelligent, gripping origin story focusing on Dickie Moltisanti and how he orchestrated the NJ crime family. I also expected deep and nuanced character development. What I got was a collection of disjointed scenes that didn't flow from one scene to the next, shallow characters of whom I could not have cared less about, and parallel story lines that made me feel like I was watching two separate movies.The one carryover I did expect from The Sopranos was the intriguing glimpse into the juxtaposition of normal life and murdering psychopathology of the members of the crime family. In The Sopranos, you're supposed to be fascinated by Tony Soprano. In MSON, I'm bored by Dickie Motlisanti. His motivation and driving forces aren't developed, he is neither the protagonist or the antagonist. He's just a dense character who doesn't engender any feeling or attraction from the viewer.A common critique I've seen of MSON is the race riots plot line. Certainly a deep introspective look into the relationship between the mob and the black community in 1960's Newark could make for a rich plot. But, that's not what we got. The writers gave us a rushed, gratuitous, dumbed-down plot line that was distracting and annoying. There was no exploration or nuance, it was just woke pandering. And, the depiction of successful black men in the movie was borderline blaxploitation. The whole subplot was wrong and gross and poorly handled.The acting was mostly excellent. Young Gandolfini has his father's gift and it was a joy to see him honor and connect with his father's powerful character. Vera Famiga was a tone-perfect Mama Soprano. The rest of the characters felt like they were role-playing Sopranos (especially Silvio and Junior). But, the rest of the movie was such a disaster that the hackiness of the imitations were actually refreshing.Two stars for some good acting and nice nostalgia. Otherwise, there's not much else good about this movie.",The Many Saints of Newark
942,monkeyraft,Excellent Origin Story (Obtuse Haters are Wrong),9,4 October 2021,"This is a compelling examination of the lowercase family & environment - and uppercase Family setting - from which someone we later already know as a fully formed Tony Soprano springs forth. From the casting to the music and sound design to the subtle literary elements, it's so well done that it stays miles away from what could have been a Star Wars-prequel level disappointment telling cute stories about Anakin when really we're just fans of Darth Vader.I truly don't understand the reviewers here who think that race and culture shouldn't have become plot elements in this film. Is there really much if anything other than race, and heritage, and societal status, behind what really drives crime families (of any ethnicity) to do what they do?And to the reviewer here who complained that there's a ""time and place"" for such racial discussion (stating that this film was neither), here is an origin story that takes place in a specific place at a certain time. In Newark, NJ, in 1967, there were actual race-fueled riots.This is the literal environment that David Chase has the Moltisantis, Sopranos, and the rest growing out of. To sidestep neighborhood racial temperatures - to ignore the entire ""time and place"" setting of the film - would not only be dishonest, but would have unfortunately landed this whole excellent project, like the above critic's complaint, in the Just Plain Dumb category.

They absolutely should build upon this movie by casting Michael (who doesn't see Jimmy G.

967,aesokol-186-336198,"Subverted Expectations, But Not In A Good Way",5,3 October 2021,"So...Was waiting for this to come out for years. Like many others, it didn't meet up to expectations. Not that that in itself is a bad thing. David Chase has demonstrated over the 86 episode run of Sopranos that he was willing to not give the audience what they wanted. That's what allows loose threads of the Sopranos to result in audience hypotheses, for example whatever happened to the Russian from Pine Barrens.The problem with this movie is that it focused on three characters (Harold, Dickie, and Tony) without giving any emotional weight to any of them. To some degree Dickie's conflict is interesting, as it mirrors that of Tony (as an adult). But the beauty of the Sopranos was that we followed, cheered for, and empathized with Tony, a philanderer and sociopathic murderer. It took many episodes for this to happen. It was much harder to root in this way for Dickie, particularly because we were also forced to follow events with Harold and Tony in a short movie.The movie itself occasionally had the humor that the Sopranos was known for. Definitely winced when the ""makings of a varsity athlete"" comment inevitably was proffered by Uncle Junior.Clearly the actors in this movie have incredible pasts and in theory should have delivered the goods. However, any attempt would result in caricatures of iconic roles. The actor who played Silvio really got down the mannerisms, but look, it was goofy. Livia was somewhat great under seasoned actress Vera Farmiga, but even then it was a bit of a caricature as Nancy Marchand uniquely created one of the most evil characters on television.As an episode of the Sopranos on HBO this would have been a promising start to a season. As a movie, eh... Seinfeld was smart not to do a revisit of his show, and instead do a bit on Curb Your Enthusiasm. This movie was a great attempt but unfortunately it fell short. For tried and true fans, we'll still watch this and enjoy it as part of some broader context. But this movie definitely cannot be considered a success.",The Many Saints of Newark

I think people are after more of the same from the epic TV show but enough of that already. What more could you want to know about Tony that you couldn't get from this film?

Yes, he has done or does terrible things but he is compassionate and loyal.",The Many Saints of Newark
980,aerosmith777,Not the movie it was marketed as,6,28 October 2021,"If you're expecting a Tony Soprano origin story (which is what I feel this film was marketed as), this is not it. Tony is, at best, a tertiary character in this movie. And if not for the series, if you didn't know who he'd grow up to become and/or this was your first viewing of anything in the 'Sopranos' universe, you'd be very confused as to what the point of his character was or why he was even in the film.All-in-all it wasn't terrible. I really like Michael Gandolfini's portrayal of his father's character (even though I don't think he got enough screen time or was made relevant to the main story). And Vera Farmiga rocks as Livia, she really steals the show imo. And Michael Imperioli's narration as Christopher was a really cool idea to me. But the problem was, like many things in this movie, that decision to use as a framing device just didn't line up with what the plot of this movie was actually *about*. It was like 2.5 different movies, rolled into one, that didn't *really* connect with each other in any meaningful way. I think they just needed more screen time to tell the whole story they were trying to tell. Probably would've been a lot better as a limited run series than a feature film, imo.",The Many Saints of Newark
981,Stewart461,Who was this made for?,3,6 October 2021,"I'm not sure who the audience is for this movie. It certainly isn't for Sopranos fans and I can't imagine newcomers are going to enjoy this either.SNL caricatures of beloved characters, no character development, very predictable plot, odd CGI, and just over all a very dull experience. The Harold character felt like an afterthought, only there to have a black presence. Such a waste of a good actor. The ending was just cringe inducing as was the awkwardly forced slam poetry. At certain points it felt like the filmmakers couldn't decide if they wanted to make a film on the Newark riots or a Sopranos prequel. They instead settled for some odd mixture of the two and the whole thing feels off. Especially since, in the end, the riots really didn't have any effect on anything in the film.There is some good, but not much. I enjoyed the music and some of the cinematography....and not much else. I think given better writing most of these actors could have really been amazing, but unfortunately they don't have much to work with. I would love to have seen more interaction between young Tony and Dickie. I wanted to see Tony at that crossroad of joining the family business or staying a civilian. Dickie basically has a handful of scenes with Tony and we are to beleive he is the guy Tony looked to as a mentor and father figure? Idk felt like a big swing and a miss for me.My advice would be to skip this and just rewatch the show. Hell, I'd even say play the Ps2 game before watching this mess.",The Many Saints of Newark
982,lilboom65,GREAT PREQUEL- don't understand bad ratings,9,3 October 2021,Nestled in tonight expecting a prequel to the Sopranos and that is what we got. The movie starts out with narration by Cousin Chris and leads in and focuses mostly on young Tony Soprano's uncle. In typical mafia format there is a lot of murder and crime - not sure what folks are taking about with racial storyline. It was important to what was going on in the country at the time. And added to the building of characters of the family. The 2 hours went by so quickly - hardly noticed it and wanted more.

The guy playing Silvio was awful, like an SNL sketch of the great layered character performed so expertly by Stevie Van Zandt in the Sopranos. The plot was non existent and was just basically a study of Dickie Moltisanti. Tony Soprano was a very peripheral character really and we didn't learn that much about him that we didn't already know from the show, in fact there were a lot of omissions and some really silly references to lines from the show (particularly from Uncle Junior who again was mediocre compared to the sharp as a tack wit of Dominic Chianese).

990,Sweetheat,"Holsten's, best onion rings in the state",8,4 October 2021,"There's a lot to peel back as an avid Sopranos series fan. First, the parallels between the anti-hero Dickie Moltisanti and the ""much later"" Don Antonio Soprano are palpable viewing the sociopathic delusions of being a good & generous person while also being an adulterous, murdering organized-crime lord. Sure, Tony's looney toon of a mother (emulated beautifully by Vera Farmiga) and father created a self-loathing, destructive Tony. The influence that Dickie had was shown through the lens of Tony's young mind catching glimpse of irrational motives, explosive violence, charismatic magnetism, and empathy for those close to him.The casting of all the beloved characters from the original series and level of effort they all put into voicing cadences and mannerisms was incredible to see. The sets, locations, and costumes in two time periods (60s/70s) were visually stunning. The soundtrack was curated carefully to embody the times without the use cliché generational hits.Some characters weren't as featured as many wanted (Paulie, Puss, etc.) but they weren't the focal point of Tony's visions of grandeur. The small screen time they did have was executed well to embody these great characters. Paulie and Sil's hand and facial gestures were so fun to see.Major credit to Michael Gandolfini (teenage Tony). He nailed it. If you've seen any of James Gandolfini's other work, or even how James speaks in the episode where he is in purgatory, he sounds nothing like Tony Soprano. We know Tony's voice, so much that it's imitated often. Michael growing up with his dad had to relearn how to speak like this character. Unreal. He mentioned that he listened to hours of his father playing Tony. The dedication to the role came through on the film. James was a giant to us and the acting world. I can only imagine how much this meant to him to continue and do justice to his father's legacy,For a 2 hour film, it's difficult to compare it to the 86 hour drama series that was the catalyst that changed television. It was far from perfect, but I found a lot of joy seeing this film.*Spoiler warning*
History is bound to repeat itself. The obvious connection with the symbolism of the crow Christopher saw outside of the window when he took the Cosa Nostra oath was seen again fleeing the garage after Dickie bashes his pop's brains into his steering wheel.We find out that Junior has always been a conniving lunatic against anyone who slights him in anyway after Dickie laughed at his fall.A glimpse into Tony's interest in the benefits of psychiatric medication to have a happy mother. Taboo enough to tear down the character image of Dickie for having the meds Tony asked him to get for his mother in his coat when he was gunned down. Similar to how Tony is seen as soft later for seeking therapy due to panic attacks.How can any Sopranos fan not get goosebumps seeing a young Tony peering out the window of Holsten's, where he later shared his last moments with his family (or ducklings) and was popped.A lot of small details from the series were baked into this film like a comforting Ziti, that a casual fan may have missed.I have a seen a lot of politically charged issues with the racial tensions portrayed in this film. Watching the series, this was common in a lot of seasons. To me it appears like a non-biased social commentary of the time and importance on the Italian-American families being tight. That said, there was a LOT of character development for Harold. Perhaps for a sequel? Otherwise why have the cut in the credits to show Harold with a fat stack of cash doing well.Seeing several 1/10 reviews is telling of the times for entertainment media. Given the quality of
the production alone, it difficult for me to understand a rating lower than Sharknado. ""Hey, What are ya gonna do about it?""",The Many Saints of Newark

Several younger versions of characters well remembered from the celebrated tv series get screen time but the mood and tone is markedly different. The story focuses on Tony's uncle, a character too bland to hold our attention, particularly when sharing the scene with the powerful Bernthal or charismatic Liotta. There's some half formed rivalry with an emerging African American criminal group, an extremely poorly judged scene at the seaside and several mob movie cliches but little of the distinctive feel of The Sopranos.",The Many Saints of Newark

This gave me an even deeper appreciation for what this film sought to accomplish in this back story. It gave just the right amount of info while keeping some mystery.

999,abdulrahmanshehada,"If you hadn't seen it, dont waste your money on a ticket (spoilers)",3,12 October 2021,"This review will contain spoilers as I need to touch on some parts of the movie that made it bad.It starts by telling you that Christopher is dead and that he's narrating from beyond and while the Sopranos ended in 07, it felt completely unneeded to give that spoiler especially that they said the moviis for everyone and not just people who watched the sopranos, so there you go, spoiled something big for anyone who might have become intrigued enough to watch the show just because you want to have someome narrate it like the good Scorcese films.Making this into a movie, with a screen time of only two hours was a guaranteed disaster, as they try to cram so many storylines in the movie and ends up with the storylines being half-assed like the riots. While I have seen reviews touch on how this movie is offensive to Italian Americans, I will not touch on that as I am not a part of that group and I cant have any input on it , but the race thing was overused in the movie just with a message of showing that the characters are racist and kinda creates tension.The movie should've been made into a mini show because in the 2 hour screen time you wouldn't even grow any sort of attachment to those characters, they all seemed one dimensional, all wasn't too captivating which is understandable because even when you watch a show you need at least 4 episodes to start getting to know those characters and in this movie it just didn't do it. By the end of it I still didn't care about Dickey.The only upside of this movie is how it shows you that Junior was always a spiteful maniac and it puts a lid on Dickey's death, and casting choices were all good until it got to Silvio.I am a long time Sopranos fan and i was looking so forward to watch this and it resulted in a huge disappointment especially if you're looking for a Sopranos quality film.

Nor did I understand the reasoning for the narrator. If anything, the narrator confused me even more.I was extremely disappointed in this movie.

1015,KayBeezy,"Too many plots, not enough time",6,2 October 2021,"The Sopranos is a fantastic show because it develops characters and relationships, creating conflicts and arcs around the dynamics of mafia life and how it impacts these relationships. The expectation going into this movie was an expansion of the backstory of these relationships through the eyes of a character who we never met on the show. Unfortunately, that isn't what happened.This movie is so fast paced and tries to cover so much ground, it misses the very thing that makes ""The Sopranos"" or any mafia movie really. There is no arc. There is little relationship building or character development. There is no real antagonist. Instead, there are multiple plots that come and go.The movie is well-acted. The callbacks/Easter eggs are fun. There are moments in the movie which enhance the understanding of the characters in the show. The beehive scene was hilarious. Unfortunately the Dicky-Gumar and Harold plots go nowhere. Considering these characters are not part of the Sopranos show, the fact their little character development make it movie a bit hollow.The movie should have started where Tony' dad got arrested and began looking at the inner workings of family dynamics and Dicky mentor relationship with Tony and potential growing rivalry with Junior. Could have focused more on Tony's descent into deviance with his friends (Jackie Jr/Ralph), Dicky's conflict with wanting to do ""right"" by Tony and he's newborn son and Junior's resentment due to him being a prick. If you cut out the Harold/Gumar subplot, make Junior the antagonist, and keep it in the family, this movie could have been a true prequel.

I do not believe the user got the value of the time spent developing her back story.

What was the whole movie about?The trailer teased about a coming of age story of Tony Soprano. Nothing of that happened. We see just an almost absurdly random sequence of ""events"" in the life of Richard Moltisanti (Christopher's father).Nothing has a point, nothing adds together. But they are all saints. Somehow.Also easily one of the worst endings in the history of movie making. How corny to use the pinky swear and actually end with that fading into the originally theme song (or a bad version of it). That had the originality of a high school junior. Ew!

I was a pretty big Sopranos fan, so my expectations for this movie were sky high. This movie disappointed me greatly, but it's by no means terrible. It just doesn't have the feel of the show. It's not nearly as funny as the show, and for a movie that was marketed as Tony's origin story, it's certainly lacking in Tony.However, it still has enough interesting moments and good performances to make it watchable.

Correy Stoll as Junior. Michael Gandolfini as his father. You couldn't do better than him for sure. The only thing a bit off (for me) was Pauly's part.

It felt manufactured and generic; so poorly produced and vapid.Some of the acting was ok, but it mostly felt like caricature. The dialogue is silly at times.Everything is off. Even the marketing: Imagine watching a film adaptation of The Wire sold as focusing on the early life of Omar and Stringer but it actually spent half of the film on a Chilean newspaper distributor.

There were no themes. When Dickie killed his father it felt abrupt and unmotivated. The CGI fire looked awful (I am a fan of CGI when done right).If this was a movie about Dickie then why was I never in tune with who he was and what he wanted? Why did the marketing lead me to believe it would add more insight into Tony?It felt like the writers did not know what they wanted to convey or have a reason for making this. They should have chosen a character or theme to anchor the script.The acting was good given the quality of the script. Everything else was mediocre.,The Many Saints of Newark
1041,doximir,What was the point of this movie?,3,9 October 2021,"This movie is marketed as Tony's origin story, as the set of occurances that made Tony who he is at the time The Sopranos begins. This movie isn't that.Young Tony gets barely any screen time and the only backstory we get is that his mother was neglectful and dismissive (which we already knew) and his favorite memory of her is when she did something as simple as reading him a bed time story.The whole arc about his relationship with Dickie Moltisanti is that he looks up to him and then Dickie is told by his uncle not to talk to Tony anymore, so he doesn't and Tony gets pissed off at Dickie, saying that he wants nothing to do with the mob... and then becomes one of the best mobsters anyway?????So this is a movie about Dickie... alright then. Well, it's not a very good movie about Dickie either. Dickie's arc is totally unoriginal and non-interesting. He realizes that the things he does as a mobster are bad and then he dies... because he laughed when uncle Junior slipped. So he doesn't get punished for killing his dad or for killing his goomar, but for laughing at uncle Jun's accident???Maybe this was the point? That mobsters are really petty and you can get away with murder but something as little as laughing at another mobster can get you killed? This tells more about uncle Jun than it does about mobsters in general.So let's get to the only good thing about this movie: the younger versions of the beloved characters from the Sopranos.Uncle Jun is great, we get a better insight into how he feels like he isn't getting enough respect so he does something brash like getting Dickie whacked. The impression of him is also very good.The impressions of Paulie and Pussy are great. Silvio is good too, although a little overdone and borderline comical. Artie and Carmela are there too I guess?Young Tony wasn't very good. Gandolfini's son doesn't have the makings of a Young Tony Soprano.Now let's get to the biggest issue with this film: THE UNNECCESSARY BLACK GANGSTER PLOTLINE. There was just no need for this to be in the film. It adds nothing. It teaches us nothing. There is just no point to it whatsoever. It's only used as a motivation for Dickie to kill his goomar, but her just cheating with anyone would've done it. I suspect it's been added because you just can't make a movie in 2021 without adding a race/gender/sexuality angle to it. It's just a box to be checked.Anyway... the movie isn't very good, but it kept my attention. The cinematography is fine, the acting is subpar, the plot is dumb.",The Many Saints of Newark
1042,michaeljohnsonfromnj,Awful,3,4 October 2021,"What an awful movie. Aside from Vera Farminga, there is literally not a single saving grace. The plot was ridiculous.

Besides this ridiculousness the film was an abomination of what the show was, i wanted to see the rise of Tony S, not the Uncle's imagination.

1046,dainbedfordpugh,"Not exactly as expected, but that's not necessarily bad.",8,4 October 2021,"All of the numbskulls giving this movie terrible reviews probably just wanted to see a gangster movie, with the same old gangster tropes and stereotypes, and really aren't what I'd consider true fans of The Sopranos. I like the fact that this film actually focuses on a character we never got to meet in the show. Nivola's performance was subtle and affecting, and his performance as the man who *really* raised Tony Soprano was fantastic. For those of you who are asking 'what was his big influence on Tony, then?' (or similar to that) clearly can't understand subtlety, and also clearly missed the point of the last 10-15 minutes. As for Michael Gandolfini, he did a great job. To put him for the and Center would have been a bit much, and he performed the role exactly how you'd imagine young Tony would have been, from the flashbacks and stories of his youth from the show. Vera Farmiga was absolutely astonishing. It really was like we were watching a younger Nancy Marchand playing a younger Livia Soprano. I accept that there was some over-the-top moments with some characters (Silvio was a little ridiculous - but hell, I still loved it) but Farmiga was amazing and avoided caricature in her performance. Ray Liotta was bloody great as well!As for the people whining about the race thing - this is exactly what was happening around that time, and to have not included it would have been ridiculous. Obviously those complaining about this are the same people who complain about any 'SJW agenda'.

Allesandro playing Dickie in my opinion was garbage. Did not give me that italian gangster feeling whatsoever like you would see watching Goodfellas, Mean Streets, The Gofather, etc. Every single actor in those films made you feel that these guys are ruthless and live the lifestyle, Allesandro was some actor acting terribly. Then you see Corey Stoll as Junior.....wow. Once again no italian gangster feeling whatsoever and the only thing these two actors had in common was a bald head.Next was the tones of racially fueled aggression and happy ending for Leslie Odom Jr. Who played Harold. This is a gangster movie that was supposed to be a prequel, not a 2021 film that needs to again (like most films these days) go out of their way to address racial issues from the past. The most messed up part wasn't that they had it a part of the film but instead the fact that they never killed the character. I mean the character killed made men and got to move to a new neighborhood and lived a happy life. What a joke.Lastly if another italian mafia movie is made with a terrible impression of an italian blurting out ""OOOOOOOOoooohh"" during a conversation like Allesandro did during the conversation with Tony (Michael Gandolfini) then stop making the genre of film.",The Many Saints of Newark

James Gandolfini's son was amazing. He even had so many nuances that were so ""Tony"", ie, the sniffing, the way he sits, eyes, etc. I just felt that the story was disjointed and was a little frustrating. Side note, young Pauly and Sylvio were some favorites though. But OMG, Vera Farmiga was INSANELY GOOD. She embodied Olivia in the best way. She was killer. The whole story of Dicky, though? That was the disappointment for me. It was set up beautifully but it wasn't fleshed out enough, in my opinion.

1059,dougtortorici,Don't Listen to the Naysayers,8,3 October 2021,"Anyone deriding this film for being ""woke"" or trying to impose some kind of ideological tilt was either not paying attention or doesn't care to understand the setting. Just because this film features a black person's perspective doesn't mean there's automatically some social commentary taking place-it's just the history of New Jersey, an honest depiction of what was going on during Tony's formative years. Certainly if this film were so ""woke"" and sanctimonious, it wouldn't feature some of the foulest language used towards people from all different types of backgrounds. I think many peoples' negative responses to this film say more about the overly sensitive society we live in than the film itself and that's true for both sides of the political aisle. Criticize the glorification of violence, the pessimistic tone, the irredeemable characters, but calling this film ""woke""? Try again. The film, like the series, is a blank slate depiction of a society slipping into amoral decay. No ulterior motives are at play here.Ultimately what handicaps this film is the limited runtime in the face of so much story to tell. Dicky Molisanti had the potential to be a legendary character in my eyes. There were definitely some shortcuts taken and the origin story would have been better served as a miniseries, something that would do justice to the setting and the paradise lost theme from the series, which is at work in the film but is suffocated by the medium.",The Many Saints of Newark

1064,darshanbudhai,No good 😕,1,9 October 2021,"""THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK"". Prepare to be mostly disappointed sadly. Some nice nods to the show (inc a fun reconstruction of a story Tony tells Melfi, & a redo of a young Tony memory), younger Sil is great & spot on, especially his walk (& yes...we learn a secret), younger Pussy & Paulie are wasted (& Paulie isn't much like Paulie), younger Livia is pretty accurate (with shades of Carmela at times, maybe intentional), younger Junior is pretty good (with a wonderful expletive nod to the show). Ray Liotta is good, but he's used VERY strangely & a (weirdly forced) surprise about him was totally ruined by the trailer! Dickie is okay, good at times, but mostly unlikeable & unappealing as a character. And yes, we learn the truth about Dickie's fate... Now the real disappointments; There was little point in the 60's stuff being so long, bar 1 big event, the Race Riots were too long & (that 1 big event aside again) totally pointless (we pandering here?). Michael Gandolfini is sadly poor. He can't really act, lacks charisma & his speech is weird & slurred. There's very little sign of Tony Soprano in his performance & there's not even any real arc for the character (there's a nice Melfi foreshadowing involving a Guidance Councillor though). Johnny Boy is sidelined & does very little. Janice is wasted too. And it all lacks focus, drive & energy. And simply isn't that entertaining. The biggest problem though is a massive chunk of the film is spent on Harold, an up & coming Black Gangster who means zero to the audience. We're here to see the World & characters of ""The Sopranos"", this ain't it. Why is an entire sequence spent on Black Power beat-poetry? What's with the final credits scene? Are BLM a big part of ""The Sopranos"" audience? We want ""The Sopranos"", this ain't it. So overall...A letdown. Good moments (some nice if brief action/violence too), a few nice backstory reveals, & character moments. But so much wasted time & potential. Most of those backstory moments we were hoping for...just aren't here. I sure wish that time had been spent on, you know, things to actually do with ""The Sopranos""! Harold is easily the second lead character. Find me one fan who heard about this film and was hoping the 2nd lead was a non-Mafia, non-Italian, NON-""SOPRANOS"", Black Gangster character who gets a good 3rd of the running time devoted to his backstory & rise to power (& Black Radical Beat-Poetry!) You'll find not a single one. But most won't have the guts to call foul.",The Many Saints of Newark

1068,antwell,"Wtf, David Chase",1,2 October 2021,"First off, I think that the Sopranos is one of the greatest works of art ever created by mankind and David Chase was a genius in my mind.But this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The only good things are the casting (minus Silvio) and some good cinematography here and there. It's a weird film because it doesn't look a film or an episode either, it's in a weird in-between that makes the series of scenes so inconsequential.The plot is predictable and cliché, the retcons destroy everything great about the show, Junior is turned into a shadow of himself who repeats great lines from the original show like a comic relief.They remade the 1967 flashback we saw in the series and it wasn't needed at all and it retcons the fact that Johnny Boy went to prison but Tony somehow doesn't remember it, wtf? They retconned everybody's age as well so I don't consider it canon at all.The film fails to be a Sopranos prequel and a good movie on its own.The only scenes I liked were between Livia, Tony and the school lady because it provides some interesting food for thought concerning the original series. The rest is just a dumb and pointless fanfiction. Oh, Ray Liotta was great but the thing about him having two roles is so cheesy and poorly done.David Chase, you may hate TV shows but that's probably the best-suited medium for you to tell your stories. Stop being childish and wanting to be like Scorsese and admit that a miniseries would've been better than a mere 2-hour movie. It's as if you don't understand what the show was all about. The Sopranos was all about de-glamorising the mob and you somehow want to go back to the 90s movies that your show managed to blow out of the water? Wtf, man. If you wanna make other projects in the Sopranos universe, try to make them interesting and don't copy Scorsese, his mob movies stopped being relevant 25 years ago.",The Many Saints of Newark
1069,joeygarsone,Could've been so much more,5,19 October 2021,"This film had so much hype behind it! I personally was looking forward to see Tony grow up and become the man he was in the show. And we do, for my maybe 30 mins or so. Michael Gandolfini needed more screen time. Im sure if we had the movie focus more around Tony, he would've done his father justice God rest his soul. The black riots were put in this film for obvious reasons and focused alot on it which it shouldn't have. I thought it was a nice touch to have Michael Imperioli come back for some brief narration, though l think it would've been nice if they used that narration more throughout the film similar to ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Irishman"" respectively. In conclusion, the film is passible. My only hope is that Michael Gandolfini gets a nomination for best supporting actor. If you liked The Sopranos l'd say give it a watch, but keep your expectations low.",The Many Saints of Newark

1071,michaelgibson-63947,Didn't disappoint,10,23 September 2021,"Having watched the show 50+ times I couldn't wait for this. I went in a little nervous, I'll be honest, knowing that I wasn't going to see 86 episodes worth of magic, but a 2 hour film giving some background to the characters.I was amazed by some of the acting (Nivola and DeRossi in particular) And the backdrop and wardrobe etc were absolutely spot on.There are some superb nods to the show itself and some bits that were laugh out loud funny, and a few nice twists.Take this film as it is. It's not a movie about young Tony, although he does feature quite heavily at 2 different ages. It's about Dickie Moltisanti primarily (hence the title).The more I think back, the more things pop into my head and I realise how clever it actually was.Well done David Chase et al. And thank you.",The Many Saints of Newark
1072,bluesmagician,David Chase's bag was short...,6,5 October 2021,"It boggles my mind the decision that made this story a 2 hour movie instead of (at least) 2-3 seasons of a prequel series.Surely the talents of many of the actors and actresses involved here will not simply be wasted on this one film, but be allowed to develop (and provide them further employment...) in a series / episode format. It is a no-brainer if I was an HBO exec. So much more potential here that was just...where was it? I want MORE! Multiple storylines that new fans and Sopranos nuts can easily latch onto here, until suddenly the movie was over! I wanted to know many of the characters more, love them, hate them, then see them unceremoniously shot to death for an actual reason...or not. The racial tension angle of the late 60's, the moltisanti family issues, livia, young tony, giuseppina (!)...all the guys in the crew....junior soprano!I am really hoping, especially for the talent involved that this movie was simply a cheap commercial advertisement / overview of the coming season of The Many Saints of Newark about to premier on HBO. I'm dead serious Chase; ""you owe us a full bag next week, plus 10 points as a reminder..."".This could be saved if rolled back to the beginning pf the story and issued as a series, therefore it gets only a 6.",The Many Saints of Newark

Casting was spectacular, down to itty bitty Tony, even before Gandolfini's boy steps in. Younger boy reminded me of little AJ in every way! Was blown away by how true to character the younger versions of our faves & even their parents & relatives were portrayed. Can't wait to watch again. Very well done & left me wanting more of the origin story!!! I feel truly sorry for anyone who didn't get the same feeling.",The Many Saints of Newark

1075,shbaker-47887,A dreadful mess,1,4 October 2021,This is a terrible movie cashing in on the Sopranos legacy. It's a stretch to tie this junk to the incredible screenwriting and acting of the original. The cast tries to do their best with a woke left script. The racial tension in the storyline is yet another example of Hollywood's attempt to drive a narrative. Don't waste your time with this garbage of a film.,The Many Saints of Newark

1077,justinxhenry,Garbage,3,3 October 2021,"First off I'm black and I like the sopranos probably better than the wire but they're close for me. This new era of tv n movie where everything is PC is ridiculous. Black people loved the sopranos without any black ppl in it because it was authentic we don't need to be in everything especially in ITALIAN GANGSTER MOVIES. Why is there so much black people in this movie? Why involve riots? The first half of the movie barely involves Tony, these black people aren't even relevant to the tv show they are creating characters to add black ppl in the show I waited years for this garbage. This was a clown show I give up on ever seeing good tv or movies again. The Irishmen didn't all of a sudden add 15 black ppl to the movie for no damn reason.",The Many Saints of Newark

I was certain this film would disappoint and I picked it because it was getting late and I figured I wouldn't mind falling asleep half way thru. I hadn't seen the trailer, had no idea which actors would be appearing, and my expectations were low. I was blown away. The characters and plot were not overplayed. You see subtle similarities without anyone overdoing it. And Michael Gandolfini-wow. I didn't know he was James Gandolfini's son until the credits at the park me, but thought throughout ""this kid is good-and damn, he's playing Tony perfectly. Even looks like Tony."" I loved it and hope they make another!",The Many Saints of Newark

I have missed the Sopranos and thoroughly enjoyed The Many Saints of Newark.It was a treat to see the younger versions of these beloved characters and bringing to life the stories the characters of the Sopranos would nostalgically reference.

If they had seperated the two and had them occur in the same ""movie"" universe they could have had two great movies but instead it feels like a weird chop of two or three movies into one. What a waste of good actors. I feel like a movie about Harold and the Saints getting out from under the mobs thumb would have been a great movie but sprinkling in some Italian guys and slapping the Sopranos name makes this hard to sit through.",The Many Saints of Newark

It's mainly about the racial divide of the times.

I imagine this was written by some BLM leaning sorts as half the movie is about racial tension. Really don't understand what they were trying to achieve?

Very gutted.",The Many Saints of Newark
1097,stevedaly,Disappointing,3,19 October 2021,"I saw three things going on.First, there was a parade of characters meant to invoke younger versions of the characters we know.Second, there was a storyline--Harold's story.Third, there was the Tony Soprano origin story.Okay, the younger character thing was cute. In particular, Silvio and Junior were interesting. My favorite was Dr. Melfi, expressed as the guidance counselor; her interaction with teenaged Tony was what you'd expect.The storyline--meh. It would have made a forgettable episode in season two. The social upheaval aspect was interesting. This would have been a part of what made Tony Tony. I say this is someone who grew up in an urban area at the same time.Where we come to the final part--Tony's story. First, I have to say that Michael Gandolfini was perfect, physically, for this role. But too much was made dependent on that fact. We were left to imagine this was the nascent Tony Soprano.There was even a part where we were being led into thinking Uncle Dickie, taking his Uncle Salvatore's advice, would leave young Tony alone, but ultimately give in, bring him into the organization, and thus lead the way to Tony's doom. Dickie was to Tony as Tony was to Christopher.But, instead we get Dickie's death and Tony finds his own way into being a mobster (not explained in the story--does this mean there will be another story?)I think the movie failed to tell a decent story. If you were not familiar with the show, would this movie have even made any sense?And if you ever had questions about why the characters are the way there are, did this movie answer any of these questions.Junior, Paulie, Livia, Silvio, and so on...why are they the way they are? Well, apparently because that's the way they've always been.For Sopranos fans, this movie perhaps lays out the basis for the relationship between Tony and Christopher. It's not ""Godfather Part 2.""For everyone else, this is like a pretty lame gangster movie.",The Many Saints of Newark
