0,MartinHafer,Nothing says romance like a kidnapping and sexual assault!,1,23 April 2021,"A mobster has a woman he's never met kidnapped and when she awakens from the drug given to knock her out, he informs her that she'll be living as his prisoner for 365 days. If after this period she hasn't fallen in love with him, he says he'll let her go. And, this weird rape fantasy ends up proving that in the end that the woman DOES want to be dominated, abused and forced to be a sex slave because the man is so sexy hot.I honestly think that the folks responsible for ""365 Days"" know they created an evil and dangerous film....and that was their intention. Sure, it's irresponsible to make a movie promoting kidnapping and sexual assault...and I cannot imagine any normal person thinking this is a good thing or that it would make a good movie. No, I think the filmmakers knew the film would get a lot of hate and anger...and as a result, it would get a lot of attention. In other words, if you can't make a good film to get attention, make a terrible one to get attention. And, not surprisingly, this film has earned a spot on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List.So is the film good in any way? The plot that is pro-rape and pro-kidnapping certainly isn't good. Technically speaking, the film also has a few issues.....though it is slick and 'hip' much of the time. While they do a lot of gimmicky cinematographic techniques to make the movie look good, it also often falls back on the tired use of the shaky cam. Additionally, the film turns out to be disappointing even as pornography, as you really don't get much enjoyment or sexual energy from most of the picture. You'd do much better just looking at porn online or just making consensual love with your own partner! Overall, a smarmy little picture...one that unfortunately DID get the negative attention they filmmakers wanted but which also contributes nothing positive to this world and is rather boring.In real life, I am trying to imagine an offender in court telling the judge ""I was just doing what I saw them doing in ""365 Days""...is that so wrong?!""....and promptly being sentenced to 104 years in prison!",365 Days
1,kosmasp,50 shades of Beauty and the Beast,3,9 August 2020,"The movie got quite infamous - I think it was in the top 10 in many countries, because of ... word of mouth. Though mouths are being used for things here, that will be quite appalling to some. You don't even have to be a prude to feel this goes a bit too far. This is quite the understatement to be honest, because it is quite explicit.While I didn't freeze frame, you can clearly see a (plastic) penis in many shots. So if that already is shocking and feels a bit too much ... maybe this isn't for you. The shock value aside though, because while most already have mentioned and are aware of the 50 shades of grey connection, many have not mentioned or connected this with the Beauty and the Beast story. It is there, even the time frame, how long she has to fall in love and all that. There is no witch with a curse, but there is an inciting incident at the beginning of the movie, that completely breaks our character.This broken strong man (alpha male) type thing draws a certain female fantasy and type in. So while I think a lot are unfair to demean this because of its story, the real flaws lie in the script and the very weak performances. As a mixture of two movies this is fine actually. If the script would have had some tweaks to it, I might even have considered it better than 50 shades (you can hate me now), especially because of the B&B injection - and because it actually dares to go some extra miles (didn't even have to be as explicit).So in conclusion, not your typical love story in any stretch of the imagination (and not much imagination needed anyway) ...",365 Days
2,jboothmillard,365 Days,3,4 March 2021,"I became an official voter for the Razzies in 2020, not long before the world was devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, and with cinemas being closed, it meant that the nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards would include digital platform releases. This Polish film was one listed in the suggested films to be nominated for the awards, it was surrounded by a high amount of negativity and controversy, including for it to be removed from Netflix, so I watched it as soon as possible. Basically, during a meeting between the Torricelli Sicilian Mafia crime family and black-market dealers, Massimo Torricelli (Razzie nominated Michele Morrone) sees a beautiful woman on a beach. Moments later, Massimo and his father (Gianni Parisi), leader of the Sicilian Mafia family, are both shot by the dealers; Massimo survives while his father dies. Five years later, Massimo is now the leader of the Torricelli crime family. He is often urging to fulfil his sexual pleasure and can only be satisfied by women he hires to perform oral sex and other acts with him. In Warsaw, Laura Biel (Razzie nominated Anna-Maria Sieklucka), a beautiful sales director working in a luxurious hotel, is unhappy in her relationship with her boyfriend Martin (Mateusz Lasowski), and longing for sexual pleasure herself. Laura celebrates her 29th birthday in Italy, but after Martin embarrasses her, she goes for a walk and runs into Massimo, who kidnaps her. Laura finds herself being held captive at Massimo's villa. He reveals that she is the woman he saw on the beach when he was injured. He has been thinking about and searching for her for five years. Massimo tells Laura that he intends to keep her as a prisoner for 365 days until she falls in love with him. He also promises her that he will not touch her without her consent, whilst simultaneously having his hands around her throat and touching her. When Laura tries to escape, he does not let her leave. With no choice but to stay with him, she accepts and takes of advantage of the luxurious lifestyle. As they spend time together, Laura teases him and then refuses to have sex with him. However, she slowly starts to get him to open up about his personal life. At a hotel in Rome, she teases him again. Massimo cuffs her to the bed and forces her to watch him as he receives oral sex from another woman. Afterward, she appears to want to give in. But he releases her and orders her to get dressed for a night out. At the club, Massimo is angered as Laura flaunts herself in front of him and his friends. When she begins to flirt with a man from the rival mafia family, the man gropes her against her will. Massimo and the others draw their weapons while Laura is taken out of the club. The following morning, she wakes on a yacht to see Massimo and his fellow mafioso, Mario (Bronislaw Wroclawski), arguing. During the night, a mafia war between the two families has ignited, after Massimo shot the man who groped Laura in his hand. Laura attempts to apologise, but Massimo blames her for the incident. As they argue, Laura falls from the side into the water. Massimo jumps in and saves her. When she awakens, he admits he was scared she might not make it and does not want to lose her. Laura finally gives into her feelings and sexual desires, gives Massimo oral sex, before the proceed to make love on the bed, and numerous times in numerous positions in other places on the yacht. After a long time being incarcerated, Massimo allows Laura to visit her family in Warsaw. He tells her he loves her and will join her after finishing up business. In Warsaw, Laura waits for Massimo for days with no contact. She reconnects with her friend Olga (Magdalena Lamparska) and they go clubbing. At the club, she runs into Martin, who says he has been looking. He wants to apologise and reconcile. He follows her back to her apartment, where Massimo is unexpectedly waiting. After Martin leaves, they have sex, during which Laura sees wounds on Massimo's body, wounds from the mafia war. She confesses to him that she loves him. The next morning, Laura is surprised when Massimo proposes, to which she accepts. However, she tells him she wants him to keep his ""occupation"" a secret from her parents. Back in Italy, Mario informs Massimo of rising tensions. Laura mentions feeling unwell but decides not to see a doctor. They discuss their upcoming wedding, she does want her family to know what Massimo does, so they are not allowed to attend. However, Massimo allows Laura to invite Olga as her bridesmaid. When Olga visits, Laura tells her she is pregnant. Olga urges her to tell Massimo about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Mario receives a phone call from an informant that the rival mafia family has threatened to kill Laura. Laura and Olga are driving through the hills, and Laura's car enters a tunnel but does not come out the other side. Mario rushes to find Massimo just as Laura's call to him is cut off. Massimo breaks down, as it is implied Laura is dead, with police gathering at the entrance of the tunnel. Also starring Otar Saralidze as Domenico, Natasza Urbanska as Anna, Grazyna Szapolowska as Klara Biel, Laura's mother, and Tomasz Stockinger as Tomasz Biel, Laura's father. Morrone is good looking and Sieklucka is beautiful, there is only a little chemistry between them, the morality of the situation is concerning. The film has 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it is listed in the IMDb Bottom 100 list, and there is a petition to have it removed from Netflix. This is due to its sexual violence, and that it apparently is ""glorifying Stockholm Syndrome and abuse"". There was the slightest part of me that went along with it, being so ridiculous (I can see the comparison to Fifty Shades of Grey), the softcore porn style sex scenes and violence certainly get your attention, and maybe some songs in the soundtrack, but otherwise it is a dark and daft ""love"" story, a silly and unconvincing erotic romantic drama. It won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Barbara Bialowas, and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel (rip-off of Fifty Shades of Grey). Adequate!",365 Days
3,CinemaSerf,"Leaves, quite literally, nothing to the imagination....",4,15 June 2020,"So Massimo is a handsome Italian mafiosi whose father is gunned down as they sip chianti on the balcony. Astonishingly the bullet passes straight through Pop but not his son - and, phew - thank goodness. Otherwise we would have been robbed of the subsequent 2 hours, each feeling like 365 days of their own... Anyway, meantime, Laura is trapped in a rather humdrum existence with her boyfriend Martin. With some friends, they head to Sicily from their home in Poland for a holiday and that is where she encounters our swarthy, lustful Italian stallion who proceeds to kidnap her, promising not to harm her in any way but insisting that within 365 days she will have fallen in love with him... The question is - will she fall for his physique, his charm and... his very large... chequebook? I never thought I'd say this about any of the ""Fifty Shades..."" films, but by comparison with this nonsense, they look stylish and sophisticated. At times this is little more than soft porn with some very fancy cars/boats/houses and frocks (optional). The writing is about as unnecessary as a chocolate oven and the ending was terrifying - it tees things up nicely for a sequel....",365 Days
4,grantss,Incredibly bad,2,8 June 2020,"Laura, from Warsaw, and her boyfriend head to Sicily for a holiday. There she meets Massimo, the young leader of a local Mafia family. He is immediately smitten by her and kidnaps her, takes her back to his estate and holds her captive. He gives her 365 days to fall in love with him.Incredibly bad: weak story, dull and wafer-thin plot. Doesn't work on any level.Not sure who the target audience is. If you want a good story, there isn't much of a plot. If you want a good gangster/crime drama, that element takes up maybe 5-10% of the movie. If you want a romantic drama: what part of a woman being kidnapped by a knuckle-headed hoodlum and yet somehow falling in love with him is romantic, or even plausible? If you want an erotic drama, this will only work if you're a teenager and/or you don't have access to the internet.I assume this was made to cash in on the inexplicable success of Fifty Shades of Grey. On that note, as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey is, 365 Days makes that look like a masterpiece.",365 Days
5,Calicodreamin,Don't watch for the plot,4,21 June 2020,"There is no plot to speak of, the dialogue is disjointed, the storyline is disjointed, and the ending is a joke... but don't kid yourself that you're watching for any of these things.",365 Days
6,ElMaruecan82,"What Massimo wants, Massimo gets...",3,29 June 2020,"The extraordinary bodies of Michele Morrone and Anna Maria Sieklucka are perhaps the only forces that drive the ludicrous and somewhat silly ""365 Days"", the Polish production that generated such a hot buzz it ended in the Top 10 Netflix to-watch films.I confess my male crush: the man, Massimo, is a towering and tanned Latin hunk with finely-traced abs and looks like he's always posing for a Giorgio Armani ad, the woman, Laura, has the kind of gorgeous face and tantalizing body that provoke an immediate urge for possession. Only a fool would have a woman like Laura and make no effort to keep her... only a fool woman wouldn't surrender to Massimo's charm.But only a fool script would have a man like Massimo kidnap a woman like Laura and sequestrate her in a heavenly remote island and give her 365 days to love him... in fact, only a fool script would have Massimo say ""you have 365 days"" whoever says ""365 days?"" isn't saying ""one year"" a simpler formulation? What if it's a bissextile year (like 2020), are you willing to sacrifice the possibility to have her love you at the last minute? Or is ""365 days"" only a figure of speech and Massimo knew damn well it wouldn't take so long? Anyway, when he said ""365 days"" I could swear I head the voice from ""CinemaSins"" saying ""Title Drop"".So Massimo takes Laura in his dungeon of wealth, luxuriance and... weird sexual practices, he promises not to hurt her, to let her go shopping but she's his prisoner before becoming his lover. All we know about the two is that Massimo is some kind of Mafia member who instantly fell in love with Laura and Laura is a tough businesswoman with a husband who doesn't know how lucky he is. Massimo had his father killed in front of him and Laura is in need. Massimo as a man of possession and Laura as a woman in desire of possession.The expositional part goes even further, it also shows Massimo forcing a flight attendant to make him happy, she's reluctant at first but at the end, she's smiling. What we have in that scene is the film in microcosm, Massimo is the new Leo, what we want, he gets, and apparently, the director is stingy on shocking moments that would normally be followed by instant uproars and calls for censorhip in these post-Weinstein days. Seems that the confinement context helped a little. The problem with ""365 Days"" is that the film tries too hard to make a sensation: so many scenes are filled with useless pop music that we're not left one instant with an opportunity to get into the depths of these characters, basically, they're all characterized by their needs.It's a sort of psychological arm-wrestling that would be fine if the film wasn't just going up and down between moments where both go along and others where violence ensues. The film intelligently avoids the point of no return, Massimo never treats Laura like the fligth attendant but then again, it doesn't play fair with its own premise. If days are numbered, how come we never know how many days have passed? How come Laura seems quickly aroused by Massimo? Why couldn't she go through the different stages: fear, anger, hunger strikes, you know the drift.The reason is because the film's sole purpose is to show sex scenes as heated and torrid as the sun we were missing during the confinement, I guess people were in need of that. The film doesn't care much for the feelings as long as they can be expressed within the spectrum of sexual desire: anger is physical need, defiance is sexual tension, gentlness is a preliminary, joy is orgasm etc. What's left at the end is something silly but also unpleasant in the sense that we never exactly understand why Laura surrenders to Massimo: is it Stockholm syndrome? Is it his looks? Or is it because he's stinking rich?But I dare not torture myself with such questions because ultimately, it unveils the biggest flaw of the film which is the premise. Was Laura that hard to get to begin with? Couldn't Massimo just attract her attention? Court her? Didn't he have enough to offer instead of entrapping her in his gilded cage? Did it have to be so damn complicated? Laura was already an unsatisfied wife... The 'kidnapping' part doesn't work because it's a wrong premise but because it's treated like a gimmick, a word to put on the summary and allow the film to have its little edge other over soft core productions, this is what it's all about, and when it culminates with the long-awaited sex scene, I was aroused but didn't feel rewarde I thought ""it was about time"".If you take off the sex material and the awful pop music, there's nothing left from the film... it's dry empty... but near the end the film got more interesting, Laura was given back her freedom and went to her home and met Massimo again, she confronted him, threw her anger at him and then I was following the scene with full attention, finally, a scene with depth, with true emotions, something totally unrelated to body fluids but no it had to switch to a sort of angry sex scene with (you get it) an awful pop music... that's when I abandoned any hope for this film.I take ""365 Days"" at face value as a little more elaborate soft core film with a silly script, and two gorgeous bodies... a wannabe ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", which isn't saying much.",365 Days

8,vivianla,"""Sexy"" Scenes With Not Much Story",5,11 August 2020,"This film didn't have much of a story, especially the beginning and ending. It felt like another version of Fifty Shades of Grey only more exotic and comprising mainly of ""sexy"" scenes. I love all the songs in this film though and they make the scenes hotter.We start off with an Italian (Sicilian) man named Don Massimo with his father. He checks out a female with binoculars and gives the binoculars to his father to see. His father reminds him beautiful women can be dangerous - the son chuckles knowingly. The son points out they drain your wallet. The father says besides going after fun and pleasure, he has to take on responsibilities. His father is shot and the bullet goes through his father to also hit the son.We see the son on a private jet where he goes to the back and pulls the curtains to close off the view (but everyone can still hear...). He gets a blowjob from the attendant.The Polish women parties at a pool for her 29th birthday. She tells the man he makes her feel old when he announces her age.Laura, a Polish woman wakes up to find she has been kidnapped and is in a beautiful home. Laura attempts to escape but is stopped by Massimo. He kisses her and she cannot help but be aroused by his handsomeness. Massimo tells her he saw her the day his father got shot and died and has been seeing her daily in his mind. He finally found her and loves her. He will give her 365 days to fall in love with him.Laura wakes up to find herself dressed in a different nightgown. Massimo informs her the maid changed her outfit not him.Laura and Massimo sleep next to each other on the bed. Laura wakes up and gazes at Massimo's outstretched arms and body. She walks to the showers that is in front of the bed and begins to shower. Massimo gets up and walks to the showers and starts as well. Laura stares at his crotch and Massimo asks her why she is looking, does she want to touch it? Laura walks away.Laura goes outdoors where a long table with lots of dishes has been set up. She wears an evening gown with a low-cut and an up-do. Laura eats the pirogies she prefers (she is Polish and prefers Polish dishes).Massimo takes Laura into a bedroom and chains her. The more she struggles the wider the pole between her ankles will get. Massimo says he is able to access her body wherever he wants now. A prostitute enters the room and walks to Massimo. Massimo tells Laura to watch what she is missing. The prostitute gives Massimo a blowjob and Laura writhes with arousal and disgust. The prostitute finishes and Massimo goes to Laura. At last he unchains Laura and tells her to get ready to go to one of his clubs.Laura is taken shopping Pretty Woman style and Massimo attempts to check her out while she is in lingerie.Laura shows up at the club with a sparkly silver halter and heels. She walks to the private room where Massimo and his buddies are and a stripper is dancing on a pole. Massimo is shocked to see Laura dressed that way and he gets angry as he watches her with another man. Laura teases Massimo by telling him that her dress is so short he doesn't need to take it off to enter her. Massimo tells her to not make him hungry. The man attempts to harass her but Massimo pulls out his guns.Laura wakes up with Massimo and realizes he saved her. She then has sex with him. Song plays as they make love.Next Massimo tells her they are to go to a ball. Laura is dressed up by two gay men who admire her body in lingerie. She puts on a masquerade mask.At the masquerade Laura meets Massimo's ex, Anna. Laura discovers Anna intends to kill Laura. I love the ""wet"" look with the hair brought all the way back (female).Laura has her arms around Massimo while lying next to him. Massimo proposes to Laura. Laura accepts. Laura and Massimo go shopping Pretty Woman style and Laura leads Massimo into the change room for some loving.Massimo tells Laura he bought her a plane ticket to Poland and has an apartment for them. Laura goes home to her worried friend. Laura tells her friend about manly Massimo and how he makes you feel like a little girl around him. Laura says he comes from a rich Sicilian family that would never approve a foreigner. The friend and Laura go to get their hair done and to a spa.Laura comes home to the apartment with her ex begging her to take him back. Massimo waits inside the apartment and tells the ex to leave. Massimo and Laura have sex near the windows.Laura introduces Massimo to her parents at a wedding.Next thing we know is Laura tells Massimo one day she isn't feeling well - I predicted pregnancy. I was right. After talking with her friend she decides to marry Massimo and have the baby. Laura asks Massimo since she cannot bring her parents or anyone - she wants just the most important person to come. Her Polish friend.

10,TdSmth5,Good for what it is,7,2 November 2021,"Somewhere on a rooftop by the sea some mobsters are conducting some deal. Because it involves human trafficking, the one side is reluctant. One guy is watching a girl on the beach when his father goes to talk to him. The father is then shot. Now the son, Massimo inherits the mob clan.Some attractive executive named Laura is working on a deal. She's in a relationship with some guy way below her league. For her birthday they go with another couple to Italy. There she runs into Massimo, who then kidnaps her. Turns out she was to girl on the beach years ago. I wouldn't have known, we only get a split-second view of her on the beach. But he became obsessed with her and made it his mission to find her and make her his. He offers her a ""deal."" He'll keep her for 365 days during which he'll try to make her fall in love with him. If he fails, she's free to go and he won't force her to do anything against her will.Even though this guy lives in a castle for crying out loud, Laura is downright hostile for a while. She gets to have everything she wants but insists on escaping. Eventually he lets her make a phone call. He makes the mistake of taking her to party where she off course overtly starts flirting with guys. That drives Massimo crazy and he attacks one guy...who happens to be from a rival mafia. This will come back to haunt them.He's not particularly adept at romantic seduction, he's more interested in sexual seduction and surprisingly succeeds in making her fall first in lust with him. Eventually in love as well. And they establish a sort of normal relationship, except that no one can know what he does for a living. They even go so far as plan a wedding but that's when his occupation becomes an issue.Even though there's a quite a bit of story here, the focus is more carnal. There's not shortage of sex involving mostly this one couple. The sex scenes are rather odd. Yes, they are strong in a way, but I found them a bit clean and sterile in how they where filmed. They are also filmed more for a female audience. Anna Maria Sieklucka is both lovely and hot. Not in a bombshell way but more in a stunning girl-next-door way.365 days is a strong erotic romance drama for adults. As such it's a relatively good movie. American audiences are of course not familiar with movies about sex that aren't porn or gateways to bdsm or offensive comedies, hence the poor reviews and the absurd low score here. But this genre of slightly erotic non-porn movies with varying degrees of explicitness where vanilla sex is the main theme has been around in Europe for decades. 365 Days is a just recent and successful example. Hopefully it will begin break the link that the porn industry has established in the American mind that sex + film = necessarily porn. So I applaud the intention of this movie. Perhaps it's success will give rise to more movies of its kind.",365 Days

14,nadkarnisumeet,Avoidable erotica,4,5 September 2020,"365 Days (365 DNI - Polish) review :Released on Netflix in June this year and consistently trending in their top ten, 365 Days is a Polish erotic drama which is tipped to be in league of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' (2015) and has generated significant attention on social media. Hence, this review...A young don kidnaps a woman on her birthday and threatens to holds her captive for next 365 days unless she falls in love with him. He also assures her that he wont have sex without her desire in this period of captivity. The lady ends up falling in love with her captor and then, they do it all over the place and in different positions.With this apology of a plot which is only a catalyst for love making scenes bordering on porn, 365 Days has nothing to boast off other than the sex scenes which pop up every now and then in to its close to one hour fifty minutes of run time.The hero, resembling Bollywood actor Siddharth Malhotra, is all beef but no talent while the ""petite"" heroine called Anna-Maria Sieklucka is a decent performer but no Sharon Stone (in Basic Instinct) to be able to pull off the bedroom scenes with èlan.In one word, avoidable.Regards,

15,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,"Fifty Shades of Grey, Italian Wise-Guy style.",6,11 June 2020,"Watch out Pornhub, Netflix is moving on to your turf. 365 din (2020) is essentially a Fifty Shades of Grey story re-imagined as an Italian Mafia erotica film. Lots of sex in different positions and fancy location like a typical paperback romance novella. It's rated R for the ample showing of boobs, but not quite NC-17.It doesn't have much of a story to be completely honest. It is mostly erotica so comparing it against any other soft-porn film will make it fare badly. The top boss gets wacked almost taking the bosses' son along with him. But son takes over the family business and becomes obsessed with a very pretty Polish girl.No mob business ever gets conducted in the film so don't expect a Martin Scorsese mob drama. It's mostly an eye-candy romance with good looking actors but little acting skill. Watch it as a fun movie without great expectations. I am not going to rate it a 1/10 even though I can see why some would. I enjoyed the eye candy.If the poster interest you and you want to watch some eye-candy, its not bad.

18,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,19 October 2020,"Success on Netflix, film '365 DNI' is not a novel: it's abuse made upAmong the most popular on the platform, Polish film bets on unhealthy and abusive relationship to win fans of erotic productions
With the sun high in the Sicilian blue sky, a heartthrob with a millimeter-sculpted body jumps into the crystalline waters of the Mediterranean Sea to save his beloved, who fell from the bow of a luxurious boat. Back in the safety of the vessel, the lovebirds celebrate the rescue by splurging on sex - intense and nothing prudish, the sequence unfolds in every room. The scene is 365 DNI, a Polish film, adapted from the book of the same name by Blanka Lipinska, which emerged in the first place in the ranking of most popular Netflix in Brazil this week. Conservatism aside, the feature would, in theory, integrate the field of erotic novels, were it not for the fact that it is not a romance at all - or at least it should not be considered as such given the fact that Laura, the beautiful Polish woman saved from drowning by Massimo was actually kidnapped by him.Whoever escapes the film, clarifies that kidnapping here is not an exaggeration or figure of speech. Massimo Torricelli, played by the undeniably beautiful Michele Morrone, is the leader of an influential family in the Italian mafia that, since losing his murdered father, dreams of the image of Laura Biel, lived with merits by the Polish Anna Maria Sieklucka, who leaves nothing to be desired by the ""romantic"" couple in terms of beauty. Driven by an unhealthy obsession, the mobster travels around the world looking for him, and when he finally finds it, he decides that the best way to win his love is by using narcotics to dope her and lock her up at home. Upon waking up in a bed as luxurious as it is unknown, Laura tries to escape, but is stopped by the kidnapper, who imposes a proposal on her (if you can call it that, since he doesn't give her any other option): she has 365 days to fall in love with him, if at the end of this time nothing changes, you can leave.Were it not for the protagonist's admirable physical attributes, the mansion that serves as captivity or the millions in clothing for the prisoner - who, against his will, becomes a luxury escort at mafia parties, it is hard to imagine that anyone would see romance in history. But with the glamor included in the package, part of the audience seems to regard it as a modern fairy tale - a kind of contemporary Beauty and the Beast, which romanticizes kidnapping and an apparent Stockholm syndrome. On social media, there are those who go to the extreme of wanting to be kidnapped by a real-life Massimo, a real disservice in times when consent is deservedly so exalted and discussed, but not exactly a surprise.Let it be said the series You, launched in 2018 on Netflix and flour from the same bag. Played by Penn Badgley, the protagonist Joe Goldberg became a kind of cult prince for the audience. With good-looking features and a literary baggage worthy of admiration, Joe would be truly charming, were he not an obsessive psychopath who chases his muses and does everything to have them as lovers - including killing. The character's romanticization was so absurd that Badgley was forced to make it clear on social media that Joe is a murderer, and that the point of the series is not to make anyone want to be kidnapped, but to see madness beyond a pretty face.The same cannot be said of 365 DNI, whose objective is, in fact, to make up the madness behind beautiful faces and paradisiacal landscapes. Below the minimum expected social responsibility, the film distorts any concept of consent. Massimo, several times, warns Laura that he will not do anything that she does not allow - except, of course, to keep her as a kind of property, with the right to violent actions and inappropriate touches, until she meets her sick desires. . If the kidnapping, by itself, is already problematic to make anything that follows unfeasible, there is still a scene in which he ties her to the armchair of his private jet, palpating her in inappropriate places with the clear intention of ""provoking her "". In another passage, Laura is immobilized on a bed straight out of Christian Gray's fetishes, in Fifty Shades of Gray, while being forced to watch another woman satisfy the kidnapper's sexual desires in order to show her what she is supposedly missing out on. be so resistant to giving yourself to the executioner.At this point, it was to be expected that scenes like these, which are so obvious they become caricatures, dispense with problematization. But given the frisson caused by the relationship on social networks, it is important to remember that drugging women, keeping them in captivity and touching them without their consent is not romantic, even when you own a sculptural body and millions in the bank . Ironically, who fulfills that role in the film is Laura's best friend, an expansive woman and portrayed caricatively as ""crazy"" who, although a losing vote, shows herself as close as the long dare to reach the voice of reason when stating that the friend is trapped in a golden cage, but still, she is a prisoner - symbolic phrase, whether she is with or without intention. In times when it is tried, at all costs, to educate women to recognize abuses, even if involved in apparent chivalry, it is symptomatic, and regrettable, that a film naturalizes in such a grotesque way everything that has been trying to fight. There is no romance in a kidnapping, and there is no beauty in the abuse, even though captivity is paradise island.Film seen on October 18, 2020.",365 Days

25,euroGary,Obviously '#metoo' hasn't yet made it to Poland...,6,20 February 2020,"Laura is an attractive, ball-busting Polish hotel executive who fights her corner in board meetings then goes home to her slobbish partner and collection of dildos. Massimo is a gangster - but the young, sexy kind: he's described as having ""a body sculpted by God... and a dick sculpted by the devil"" (which is a pretty erotic line until the viewer unwillingly starts picturing said protuberance with horns and a little pointy beard). Having caught a fleeting glimpse of Laura some years before and been obsessed with her ever since, Massimo is delighted to discover she is holidaying on his native Sicily. He promptly kidnaps her and tells her he will hold her for 365 days while attempting to make her fall in love with him.Personally, I would have thought not kidnapping her in the first place would have been ample proof of his honourable intentions - as would not promising he will not touch without her permission whilst nonetheless pinning her to a chair and grabbing her tit. But then this film - based on a novel - is hardly politically correct. The main problem, of course, is Laura's ultimate falling in love with Massimo (c'mon, you knew she would!): although she is allowed a scene of berating herself for so doing, there is no effort to examine whether she is suffering from, for example, some form of Stockholm Syndrome - although that would have made this a far deeper film.Other flaws are the many dangling plot-threads: for instance, Laura's weak heart is mentioned several times but nothing is ever done with it. When she is offered a job as ""general manager of Preston"" (presumably not the football club) we have to guess that she turns it down; and when Massimo is told ""they"" want to kill his sweetheart we are not told who ""they"" are, despite the fact the preceding scenes have identified at least two likely candidates. On the plus side, one plot-thread that I thought it a wise decision to leave dangling was the final scene involving a tunnel: we know the outcome of what happened in there, but we are not told exactly *how* it happened, which adds a pleasing air of mystery.As for the acting, leads Anna Maria Sieklucka and Michele Morrone deserve credit for delivering much of their dialogue in English, which is presumably their second (at best) language: this does mean, however, that some of their lines sound a bit clunky to those for whom English is mother tongue. As often in this kind of production, the supporting characters - not encumbered with the requirement to be romantic heroes - are more interesting: there are fine comedic turns from Magdalena Lamparska as Laura's exuberant friend Olga, and from Otar Saralidze as a bemused young gangster.This film is, I imagine, an attempt to create a Polish version of 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. It does not match the latter's theme of women's empowerment (for all the whips and chains, Anastasia is in control in a way kidnap victim Laura certainly is not), but - with apologies for shallowness - there is more nudity and sex in '365 Dni'. But it *is* similar to 'Fifty Shades' in the attractiveness not only of its cast, but also of its locations and clothes (there are several shopping scenes); and as a piece of escapist entertainment it certainly hits the spot.",365 Days

However due to the outpour of bad reviews of this movie I hesitated to see it for a bit. I happened to have date over for a hang and she begged me to watch it so I caved finally. While I wont say its bad, it wasn't anything amazing either.I personally thought the premise was interesting. Highly powerful man in mourning of father meets girl of his dreams, kidnaps her, and gives her 365 days to fall in love with him. The actors were likeable and the movie isn't slow by any means it does move along at good pace.Where the movie lost me is the constant plot holes. I've never seen so many in one movie. It was almost like you're getting trolled thats how frequent it was. You're left confused and totally scratching your head. Another thing I hated was the movie had ton of incoherent/abrupt sex scenes. While obviously sex is what the movie is going for.

I was going to rate this a high 9 stars, then, the ending happened. It didn't make sense, Mass sent Chloe away to Poland to take care of Anna, &when he came to get her, he had 2 bullet sounds. Yet all of a sudden, as they were preparing for their wedding, a threat against Chloe, we can only GUESS it's Anna, because they don't tell us, occurs so it WASN'T taken care of, and SOMETHING happens seven her vehicle drives into a tunnel! We don't know anything, because the call is dropped, and all we see is 1 cop car at the end of the tunnel... we don't even know if she died or not for sure, but they act like they want us to believe it.

38,TheVictoriousV,We've all learned absolutely nothing,1,27 July 2020,"I was given an offer I couldn't refuse when my littlest brother ""pitched"" 365 Days, insisting that the Fifty Shades of Grey films will seem ""f-cking amazing"" by comparison. You can't achieve this, I thought, unless satirizing the format, but even if the film in question is laughable, that is because it's entirely serious.I could end things here if I were more dismissive of inept cinema. The thing is, though, that movies like 365 Days are of greater psychoanalytical interest than most media, especially in the climate that surrounds contemporary courtship and that which men are said to be collectively guilty of. Much like the Fifty Shades trilogy, this is a movie I desperately need to see remade.Why would I want to see this movie again, you ask? It's very simple. It is because this film, like Fifty Shades, does have a fanbase, and I am so endlessly curious as to how these people (mostly female, middle-aged, and amidst various crises) respond to the material if we pull a Michael Haneke and remake these movies exactly the same way - scene-for-scene, shot-for-shot, each inane line left intact - except the powerful, dominant male of the central romance is replaced by a Kevin Spacey or a Harvey Weinstein analog; a closer resemblance to how these scenarios may pan out in reality.How would the fangirls feel about this kind of story, in terms of its purported sexiness and mystique, if it better resembled the real-life counterpart? Better yet, would it turn a knob in their brains that finally made them look inward and think about what this signals to the abusers of the world?What exactly are they communicating with their love toward this kinda content? What does it look like they're into? If they want to improve/change the way that men are societally taught to approach women, is it easier for them to understand how ""I want my own Christian Grey or Massimo"" isn't helping if we show them what Christian Greys and Massimos actually look like (and where they can find them, if they're serious in their pursuit)? Is the present state of things, I query with complete honesty, squarely on the dick-owners?I think I got ahead of myself by asking these questions straight away. Who exactly is this Massimo? Well, he's a Sicilian mafioso (played, fortunately, by a photogenic hunk named Michele Morrone) who abducts an unwitting Anna-Maria Sieklucka and explains that she must fall for him within 365 days if she is to regain freedom.Essentially, some Polish author gravely misunderstood Beauty and the Beast and decided that something as nightmarish as this would be equivalent, plus the oh so daring sex scenes. The consolation is that Massimo agrees not to touch Laura, as the character is named, without clear consent. We all wish we could be imprisoned for months on end by someone so thoughtful. I've seen more romantic things in my stool.So, is this indeed worse than Fifty Shades of Grey? On one hand, it is categorically more original than ""glorified Twilight Saga fan fiction"" and it may not be quite as dangerous as young women aren't as likely to go after mafia hunks as they are to end up in a Christian Grey scenario (albeit with more of a Weinstein type in the role). On the other hand, who has time to learn Polish?And before anyone starts: I get it. I get that we all have our weird fantasies that don't strictly adhere to what we desire for realsies (hence my terabytes worth of ""Bugs Bunny on Daffy"" fan-art don't prove my sincere dating preferences). I preemptively agree with your counter that ""this is just a movie, bro"". But sometimes it isn't ""just a movie"". Ask yourself whose fault that is.",365 Days

If some big fat ugly Harvey Weinstein looking dude kidnapped you and said you had 365 days to fall in love with him you'd run as far and fast as possible.

Anna Maria Sieklucka is better looking than Dakota Johnson but is that really all that hard ? She definitely doesn't look like she's 29 and it's funny that Laura dyes her hair blonde and gets it cut into a bob just like the author who also put her 35 year old face on the cover of the second book.

But from the very first moments of ""365 cringe"" we are with ease able to predict the rest of the film.

44,Golden_Hope,Insanity,1,16 June 2020,"I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.One of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it.The actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like ""woo lets go buy some new clothes"". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like ""oh that's good she got away from him"". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive????The second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like ""Yeah fair enough"" and just sits down like this happens every day.On top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like ""Posing, modelling"" faces and is not like ""Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help"". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows?It also relies heavily on ""Pop"" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like ""well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in"".I could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm.Believe it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason.So its really up to you if you want to watch it.

I found myself constantly checking how much time is left. It's so boring because the story takes a backseat to the sex scenes which in themselves are poorly shot, undeserved, and cringy. The plot takes such a backseat that I honestly don't know what exactly happened except that the guy kidnaps the girl and that's it. The performances are fine but the actors have nothing to work with.

This is different The acting is good and theres a few likeable characters and you can definitely feel the chemistry between the 2 characters and are rooting for them to be together it's like something out of alot of womens fantasies . I also think the cinematography was beautifully especially showing Laura's de ja vu face as an Angel when Massimo is shot. And I liked him saying ""Are you lost babygirl"" didnt make me cringe at all it was sexy. I gave this a 9 when really I'd say it's more a 7.5 but wanted to even the scores. As I actually think the score for thos has been fixed I've scrolled through the reviews and theres just as many high scores if not more as low so how they come up with 3.5 I dont know. Too many femanazis have posted with their agenda this is a great romance film. The only down points quite a few sex scenes are cheesy and unbelievable the faces pulled are a little laughable. I didn't like all the blowjobs scenes. Not my thing and guys that try force that in womens faces it is sickening, I also hated they turned her blonde at the end & No way should she be dead that would ruin it.

However I do have some critiques though:1. The premise wasn't strong enough & the acting was incoherent. The whole thing was just too unrealistic. E.g. At the beginning - Laura was too comfortable with pissing this guy off - bearing in mind that he's clearly a dangerous man. Whereas a normal person would be scared. Also - I feel that a normal person would potentially pretend that they're okay with it, and then behind the scenes - try to find a way to escape etc. Ultimately I think they should have tried to add more depth to the storyline.2. Pacing was off. The cat & mouse situation was dragged out for too long and it became tiresome. However - when that finally ended I became bored & there was nowhere for the story to go.3. Some of the scenes were kinda rapey, and they should have generally toned down the sex scenes.4. Laura become intolerable, very quickly.

How anyone could seriously rate this 10/10, even for the erotic (there is no chemistry, so not) factor, is crazy, as there is much better FREE erotica (sans terrible pop songs) on the internet, unless your country or your parents have it blocked (more like). The frequent terrible pop songs (one of which I think was by the lead actor, who can't sing) don't help. If the writing, acting, dubbing, directing, producing, cinematography, assistant directing, and wigs don't drive you away, the music surely will.This movie not only makes the director, writers, actors, and all the crew look bad, but Italians, Poles, gangsters, parents, besties, assistants, cars, boats, wigs, men, and women. And yes, nothing makes me want to fall in love with a hideous hairy cartoon bully monster than getting kidnapped, tied up, knocked about and thrown off a yacht by the same obsessed, violent moron with whom I have no chemistry.If not for a certain virus, and Netflix constantly pounding this movie into our heads, I doubt this movie would even be in anyone's bottom 10.

This movie is considerably better and deserves to be taken for what it is, soft female centric porn and a lot of guilty fun. Tough, brooding mafioso kidnaps his dream girl (literally) and imprisons her in his castle - cue Beauty and the Beast comparisons. He is pretty horrible as a person but extremely good looking and dominating. The girl briefly fights back against her predicament before shopping till she drops at his expense and living a luxurious lifestyle that she has never experienced before. He gives her a year to fall in love with him and then the nearly constant sex scenes start (not much in the way of a plot) as captive girl begins to fall under his macho spell. Is she a victim of Stockholm Syndrome or is she really in love with this brute of a man? We never really know. It reminds me of some of the well produced soft porn movies of the 70s, it doesnt apologise for what it is and at least the sex scenes are convincing and the lovers have a great chemistry. This is what raises this movies from a Shades of Grey ripoff to something a bit more watchable. Its filmed very prettily, the leads are really attractive and its clearly aimed at a female audience. A downbeat ending with some unanswered questions may lead to a sequel? Who knows? Disengage your intellect for a couple of hours and enjoy!",365 Days

The first half was very cringy at some moments. The second was slightly better.The nudity is on a very high level, that I felt somehow uncomfortable. It looked so real and they had a good amount of duration.The scenario was cringy at some point and with holes. For example, who killed the father of the protagonist and why?The positive aspects are the photography, the direction and all the beautiful landscapes. The performances were mostly good, atlhough the male protagonist was somehow mediocre. Female lead's performance in English language wasn't that strong, but in the Polish was good. I think this is normal.Let's go back to the photography aspect. I'm so happy that a European film did such a great work and looked so luxurious. I'm not sure if it's a low or high budget film, but I can say certainly that this work looks so rich and I loved it. The soundtracks were really nice. I liked most of the songs.Again, if you feel uncomfortable with nudity, this film is NOT for you. It contains many sex scenes and look so freaking real.This film is not to be taken seriously.

If my kids were young when this came out on Netflix, however, I probably would have had a very different reaction, as with 3 girls the conversation could have been ..problematic just trying to get a word in edgewise, as they commented, compared notes and egged each other on.I don't know how this got on Netflix. It's soft-core porn. Most of the movie isn't about plot at all, and we don't get to know the deep motivations of the characters beyond skin-deep. (Even though they both have very nice skin. 😍) Heck, I'm a woman over 30 (& 40). I'm totally unashamed at looking and maybe even fantasizing about.😈*** PLEASE NOTE: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!! ***
You have been warned.The ending was ...shocking, unsatisfying and left me feeling totally rotten. We FINALLY get to the point wherewe know more about the characters, and I empathized with how Laura was feeling. Yes, most of us have a bit of Laura inside us that wants to be taken care of. Massimo isn't such a bad guy, and loves us completely. We just got engaged, found out we were getting married ..and suddenly she's/we're dead? Wtf?Suddenly this movie is about anger and revenge, not sexy happiness, and it twists inside, making me really not like where we ended up.The only thing I can take from it is the hope that she isn't actually dead. We don't actually see a burning wreck or a corpse ...so maybe this is setting up for a sequel? I can see where that could go, all the mistaken signals could make a good flick, and how I would write it (because I'm actually screenwriter, just not this genre). Perhaps cops they found a burned-out wreck, but no bodies. Massimo gets directions but it doesn't say who. His right-hand man is playing both sides of the fence, and REALLY wants her dead, because when she isn't around Mass is colder, deadlier, but with her he gets weak. So they play a cat & mouse game, and by the time he gets her back, both have changed and their personalities somewhat reversed - she's become an ice-cold killer and he's found his emotional side....but that's just fantasy because the current ending left such a bad taste.

The direction is terrible-we are treated to panoramic shots of Seatt...sorry, Sicily - and for an ""erotic thriller, aside from a scene on a yacht (which, by the way, the circumstances leading up to this scene are entirely inconceivable) there's nothing even remotely erotic or thrilling about it. The ending makes no sense to anyone even vaguely attempting to understand this film, and the film instead of being erotic or thrilling actually ends up being downright hilariously bad.Overall, this film may be less boring than 50 Shades, but this is only as a result of a more steamy sex scene and the downright ridiculousness of the plot.

106,soundstormmusic,Toxic Masculinity at its finest,1,17 June 2020,"This movie shows why a lot of movies from the 60s feel wrong.Treating a woman like an object is just...not sexy. This panders to the 'I wish we could go back to the 60s'-crowd, where women were fulltime moms and rights were mostly reserved to white people (I write this a white man fyi).All I can say is; yes dominating someone can be sexy. But not if the dominator is also your kidnapper, who wants you to fall in love with him and keeps you there for a year. Stockholm Syndrome anyone?Besides these horrible decisions, the movie itself makes it even worse. Inconsistent shots where you're wondering where you're going because the editing is so bad you kind of go 'oh ok, apparently the previous scene was done?'.Horrible acting. The story itself sucks big time. It's just in general confusing but also tedious and filled with cliches. Big dominant rich man, weak frail woman, woman likes shopping, man and woman likes party. Rich, bling, nice island. God it's so dull.I think this has been the first movie I've watched where there are literally no redeeming factors. Just don't watch it.",365 Days
107,cutesd,Just think of it as porn ...,5,30 August 2020,"It interesting how much venom people have for this film. Is it completely unrealitsic? Of course ... but ... uh ... it's a movie! Is it full of bad messaging about relationships between men and women? Absolutely, but so is 50 Shades of Grey, and Twilight, and the Notebook ... and pretty much EVERY steamy romance film you've ever watched.Is the dialogue terrible? Sure.
Is the plot weak? Absolutely.So ... yeah it's porn. It's titillating and has lots of steamy sex scenes and absolutely no substance at all. And so ... in that frame ... it does exactly what it is meant to ... and better than most.Should we be appalled at the fact that people find this kind of stuff sexy?Well ... you can examine most of our media in this light and find it EXTREMELY problematic. There are all sorts of art forms that could be considered appalling. The way I see it is films and television are meant to be fake and unrealistic and so long as you're not sitting with your daughters pointing at the main guy and saying ""definitely try to marry a guy like this when you grow up"" ... I think this film is no more appalling than 50 Shades ... or Rambo or Kill Bill or thousand of other films out there.It's basically an NC-17 Beauty and the Beast, and Disney made 2 of those movies.Lastly, this film is based on a book series written by a woman ... for women. Just like 50 Shades ... just like Twilight ... and on and on. So before we brand this as hyped male fantasy ... it's not. This is 100% FEMALE FANTASY. Maybe women need to take a look at why WE find this stuff to be sexy before we talk about how NOT-WOKE it is.",365 Days

Movie has no story, nothing special in technical aspect etc.
Movie is just erotic, which has lot of draw back.
Its only visually some what OK and that to because of male lead.
No sexy dialog, No sexy music, Not a sexy story, Just some scenes.
Even in the porn world this movie would fail.
In one sentence it looks like 2 robots trying to have a sex life.Every human in certain period of life needs a sexual life and all the fantasy,
It can only be satisfied with Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste, and Touch.
Good director should be talented enough to visually create all these 5 senses in such erotic movies. This movie gives only sight which didn't convince as well.Thanks,

First of all, the film has almost no history, just some justifications for putting on sex scenes, editing and editing are a disaster, so the film at times becomes confusing, the script is shameful and one of the worst things from the film, and to finish the direction and horrible in all aspects, the film is directed by two people and it weighs a lot.",365 Days

Morrone is hot as hot can get and Anna something something Polish is a natural beauty. Very pretty but with an innocence that a bad boy (or mafia Don) would find intriguing. The soundtrack is pretty darn good, too with Morrone performing many of the tracks himself. They just seemed to have the songs playing in the wrong scenes. Is Laura experiencing Stockholm syndrome or is she revelling in the power she has over this hot AF Italian man? After the lackluster relationship she had with her clod of a boyfriend Martin, tall, dark and handsome would be mighty appealing. If only he weren't in the mafia. I am married to a Martin myself, sans the cheating, so a Massimo could occupy my bed, sans the mafia involvement because like I said, I married a Martin. Seriously, gave me a vacuum for my birthday because he realized he hadn't given me a present in five years. Told me ""now I could really suck"" and then laughed at his version of humor. So, back to the movie - I very much liked the number two man, Domenico. I hope his role is expanded in the coming sequel. So pop the popcorn, sit back and enjoy the escape and maybe later, your own Martin since this film is very um, evocative and ah, um - stirring, so to speak. FYI, guys - you don't have to be a Massimo but for your lady's sake, please, please don't be a Martin.",365 Days

She seems to forget all about her situation once he takes her shopping. This breaks all the suspense and immersion for me.

I mean, if we can call this even a movie. This amount of recording images that were putt together is an insult to bad movies. As one journalist once said, this movie is a worst version of 50 shades of gray.
For start the movie giveaway the future ""couple"" of the movie and 20/25 minutes with some nerve or lack of it they force the meeting of the characters. This use to be the part where I talk about the performances, but to be honest I didn't saw any that should be call performance so let's skip it. The movie is very problematic. This thing is basically some kind of monument to abusers, sick (in the really bad way) and kidnappers. Off course we can discuss that there are a lot of movies like the martin Scorsese ones where the mob life is presented. But unlike this director Scorsese has the wisdom to present the life of crime, give to the audience the opportunity to care or even like the characters despite there acts but in his movies there's always a message that the public at the end of the movie takes with them, like for example: the life of crime doesn't worth it; normally the movies talk about fragile masculinity and other social problems. At the end of this movie I got the impression that the director was telling me that being an abuser is a good thing.

The climax was made v urgently and not so dramatic. There was alot room to show how he made her fall in love how much efforts. All round music in movie i loved specially song feel it. Polish subtitles were not available so most of that part is not understandable. Movie looked slightly inspired by 50 shades of grey,365 Days

The main character is very, very attractive, and its nice to see movies catering to women, or anyone appreciating a mans body. Think about it- how many times have you seen an almost naked woman in a movie?

Many ppl seems to question why this is in netflix... If that was the case, all the movies in netflix should show only positive movies ( movies based on robbery, killings,psycho thriller etc shouldn't be showed). I get it. Movies can influence ppl.Dont watch this movie if you dont like watching too much of nude scenes. Lot of it was spoken in polish and without any subtitles. Its sad that movies are released without much english subtitles. I was able to see the movie with 50% english subtitles. Couldnt understand the whole story.But, from what i understood and the acting by the male and female character, movie was nice. Far better than 50 shades of grey.Good choice of main characters.

193,campos-8,"BAD, BORING AND MORALIST.",2,14 June 2020,"When we watch a lot of films, it is natural to watch some very bad films. But what about a film that clearly proposes to be a pastiche of the already superficial and debatable 50SHADES OF GREY? The film 365 DAYS - a huge success at NETFLIX - is really a cinematographic product difficult to see, given the obviousness of its plot, scenes and ending. The great film critic from Rio Grande do Sul, Tuio Becker, once wrote a review about the movie LIPSTICK (with the Heminghway sisters) which was called ""Boring, Bad and Moralist"". I can paraphrase the great Tuio Becker to describe 365 DAYS.Based on the first book in a trilogy written by Polish Blanka Lipinska (how can a woman write something so shallow about women?) and directed by a pair of Polish filmmakers (Barbara Bialowas and Tomasz Mandes), 365 DAYS tells an unbelievable story. Italian mobster Massimo Torricelli is having one of those normal conversations among members of the Mafia, about killing people in cold blood, when his father is shot by multiple shots, which also hit Massimo. There, he has a vison with a beautiful woman. He spent ten years trying to find her (including placing giant pictures with her face in his house (???). One day, when he arrived at an airport in Sicily, in his private jet (where he had a quick and violent sex with the stewardess), whom he meets: Laura, a Polish executive bored and distant from her boyfriend who constantly cheats on her. Massimo simply kidnaps the girl, imprisons her with him and gives her 365 for her to fall in love with him.The film is a patchwork of the arguments of other works: GODFATHER, of course, removed all of Massimo's ""existential dilemmas"" in being a mobster. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, a fable recently adapted by Disney, where behind the monster is a tender and passionate being. And, of course, FIFTY SHADES OF GREY, of whom he intends to be almost a copy, even in the form of a trilogy, but also in the origins of Massimo's brutality with women, justified by abuses he suffered in childhood. And finally, PRETTY WOMAN, in the repeated scenes in which Massimo takes Laura to designer stores to buy luxury clothes, while he is bored and continues to work in front of strangers. Of course, it never comes close to its cinematic models.Worse than that, although it seems bold (there are sex scenes in abundance, but the actors' nudity is only allowed by the system) is in reality moralistic (Laura is called and treated as a prostitute for wearing a short dress). What about the scene in which Massimo, in order to convince Laura to have sex with him, handcuffs her in bed and makes her see another woman (who was on duty in the closet dressed as dominatrix) performing oral sex? Unbelievable!Speaking of the script, it would be trying to explain a number of absolutely inexplicable things: no one (boyfriend, family, employees, authorities) went after Laura when she was simply abducted? In Massimo's companies, no one decided to oppose a kidnapping committed by the Owner just for fear of him? Couldn't those hundreds of people Laura had contact with on their travels rise up against a kidnapping of an executive? And what happened to the company that Laura presided when she disappeared?It really is difficult to know what is worse in the film. Its ideology of justifying mistreatment of women (I have never seen a film treat women as objects like this), the idolatry of the script to unrestricted power and money, or the moralistic ""end"" (there will certainly be sequences).Italian actor Michelle Morrone (seen in the great series IL PROCESSO) and Polish actress Anna Maria Sieklucka - quite bad, because they spend a lot of time making faces and mouths and sexual gymnastics - live the unbelievable pair of characters without any sense.Of course, each person sees what they want and is free to like their favorite type of films. But facing the success of a (sub) product like 365 DAYS is sad. NETFLIX has about ten thousand films better than this one.",365 Days

The thing is that it's supposed to show the female character as a strong and independent woman, but the psychological aspect is of one frail, inconsistent and insecure little girl.

229,pinkandhugs,Finally the ALPHA male women wanted,10,13 June 2020,"This movie was written and directed by women. As a reader of romance novels, I can say the actor Michele Morrone nailed his character of the ALPHA MALE. So many actors in the past have tried to master such a character but fail miserably. Michele Morrone has a strong presence-from the way he walks and he speaks with his eyes alone. He is DANGEROUSLY alluring. I hadn't seen an actor ooze so much sex appeal since Leonardo Dicaprio in Titanic and since James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause.
The female lead Anna Maria also did an excellent job. I enjoyed her strong attitude and the two leads have great chemistry. This movie was definitely made for the female gaze and romance book lovers.
There is no comparison between Fifty Shades Of Grey and this movie. Jamie Dorman was miscast for the role of Christian Grey and Michele Morrone made him look like a dweeb next to his acting. Also, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dorman had no chemistry and the leads in 365 did and much passion. The cinematography was also beautiful and impressive.

I even understand why she acted not scared, unlike any hostage, because they wanted to show how strong she was and how she knows how to play games with him, I even understand why she fell in love with him(as she said herself - she feels like a little girl behind a strong male), but then leading whole movie towards her dying and that is the end?! This is dumb. It felt like they just needed some plot, no matter how dumb, just to have it in order to explain all the sex scenes. Because what it is for sure--it is porno, just like 50 Shades of grey. Like someone here wrote--it is porno for women. Exactly! This is it!

And it is definitely not fair that only the main character is getting b...jobs haha But he is so hot and suits the role, just his script is pretty bad in general so he is doing the best he can. Now about the girl, she is trying too hard to have an Polish accent and that I swear in some parts you can hear her slipping and speaking proper English. And they could at least give the lead girl larger 'chest' if they are going down that road. And she wasn't that good in general and her hard to get act was not convincing at all.

241,ingridxxxxxx,"Good concept, but terrible execution",3,7 June 2020,"I like the idea of a powerful mafia boss falling in love with a beautiful woman and trying everything to convince her of loving him. What I don't understand is his motif for loving her (he saw her face in a near death experience and thus they are soul mates? nope try again), why he chose to kidnap her (he could have easily made her fall in love with him using his looks, charm and money the legal way), laura so easily forgiving him for kidnapping her and cutting her out from her life (aka taking away all of her choices, and laura does not seem to be the type of woman who wants a man to control her or her life) and (a minor irritation) why they chose such a horrible haircut for her in the final half of the movie (also the fact that they didn't even show us the results clearly in a shot before the bar scenario). And nick names such as ""baby girl"" is just cringey - how about just ""are you lost?"" but thats more my personal opinion. In addition, there are also many scenes I would have done differently and a lot of lines in the script that i would have rewritten. Such a shame really.

248,TattooLuna,Comparing 365 days with 50 Shades,3,30 August 2020,"Since this movie was so compared to 50 Shades, here I give my 2 cents about it: although both have nudity, 50 Shades is more a drama compared to 365. The latter is more a porn with a suuuper cliché plot. The former is more an erotic drama.
365 days pictures that mafia guy who gets whatever and whoever he wants. I wonder why he would be able to see Laura in his property in the first minute of the movie, why he would see the image of that woman he just saw at his dying hour, and then get obsessed about her because of it. He doesn't know her, but he loves her to the extent of risking everything he's got. Really? And then we have Laura, who seems to be a strong and determined business woman who's got a bf who obviously doesn't like her. Does it make any sense? So he kidnaps her, she plays hard-to-get, and she falls in love with him bc he saved her life. How heroic! And less than 2 months of wild sex are enough to make her want to marry him and have his baby. Well, let me tell you there's nth romantic in this movie. You see a bunch of silly dialogues that make you roll your eyes. Just watch it for the sex scenes.
As for 50 Shades, although there's that cliché of rich CEO who also gets whatever and whoever he wants and the ordinary good student girl, the storyline is different and more 'sustainable': 1st) the woman isn't kidnapped nor forced to anything; 2nd) neither of them fall in love for no reason and they take their time for it; 3rd) there's a whole 'psychological explanation' for Grey's behaviour, which gives sense to the plot; and 4th) Grey wouldn't get involved with just 'any' woman; he'd choose them very carefully, mostly when it would come about (physical) health. So because Anastasia is 'just an ordinary girl', we don't get to know much about her story, but there's a whole story that develops and makes sense.
So imo, both movies can't even be compared.",365 Days

Hence the reason for my 10/10. It probably deserves more of 6/10 or so.365 dni is not to be Oscar worthy. It wasn't made to be the best dramatic film either. It is EROTICA. All these horrible reviews on acting, explicit sex, fetish's, no plot, and etc. Disappointing if you expected something different than the great erotica it is. The movie photo alone allures to more.365 dni is aspects of movies more on the lines of Wild Orchid, Secretary, Henry & June, Killing Me Softly, Delta of Venus, 9 1/2 Weeks, Red Shoe Diaries, and yes even 50 Shades. ASPECTS though, not entire scenes. Move along if you're not here to view erotica and forgo your inaccurate reviews, please.Although technically the lead male, Mossimo kidnaps lead female, Laura, there's more to it. Those crying #MeToo or Stockholm, maybe pay attention to the lead male character, Mossimo, as there's more.
Sex only comes into play about halfway in. The only body parts shown are buttocks and breasts. However, it's very sensual and there is indeed build up, showing we didn't need full nudity to enjoy (but might be nice). Yes, there are oral scenes with proper sounds, but again, parts are not truly shown. You must use your imagination, which is fine and works well in this movie.The movie begins on a rooftop. A meeting between Mossimo's father and two men. Mossimo is there (along with guards), but sees a beautiful, smiling, dancing, happy female through binoculars. I won't list any spoilers. There are three languages spoken (Polish, Italian, and English). My subtitles only captured the Italian and I understood the English. I missed out on the Polish conversations, which was a bummer, but not too many scenes (maybe 4). There is death (2 count), there is the chance sighting, there is beautiful scenery, there is wealth, there is the chance finding, there is murder, there is drugs (one scene), there is teasing, there is sex, there is pleasure, and there is love. Sure, there could have been more building between the two main characters, but that didn't make this a bad movie. Sure, there's aspects in the flick that are never fully explained, but again, it's erotica and didn't make this a bad movie. Yes, there's a spreader bar, chains, and fasteners, but this doesn't make it a fetish film.To each their own. Only you, the viewer can be the judge, but you must be open minded and enjoy erotica to enjoy this movie. As for me, I'll watch it again and be happy with it. Thank you.",365 Days

It is just that simple.Pretty actors, a story that is almost coherent if you don't look too hard, dialogues and acting that is not as bad as some reviews suggest, though not Oscar-winning either.

262,dragoshilbert,Why you should see this movie?,10,16 June 2020,"1. great music
2. very good looking male and female main actors
3. good chemistry between two main protagonists
4. shows you how a man with masculine energy and a female with feminine energy conquer each other.
5. a lot of people seems to hate this movie :)
6. from what I asked around mature women with feminine energy are loving this movie - ask yourself why?The music is perfect! This movie is a perfect exemplification of a lot of real behaviors in the old Europe, yes, from my experience - even if I assume the book/scenario is fiction - the inspiration was on real facts/desires/behaviors.You do not like it? For comparison, watch Lauren Bacall with Humphrey Bogart in ""To Have and Have Not"" 1944 and compare the sexual tension, femme fatale archetype and the ""game"" with the same from this movie. If you are not convinced then continue with ""The Big Sleep"" 1946, ""Dark Passage"" 1947 and ""Key Largo"" 1948. Then take a look at the more modern one, like ""Basic Instinct"" and ask yourself if is a problem with this movie or with yourself. If you are a man, ask the woman near you what she loves, hates and get arouse from these stories/archetypes - then draw your own conclusions. If you are a woman and the man near you needs some guidance maybe you can learn a few tricks and help your man to become a better one for you.Watch this movie to learn about seduction, power of a strong woman, respect to a woman, love, passion, the price you pay when you go too far, respect of a woman for a man and the passion of a man for a woman - more about the pain and the suffer but also about the victory of conquer and love and be loved.In this movie is so much psychology and human behavior than I asked myself who wrote this? from wikipedia: ""Lipinska worked as a therapist-hypnotist. She enjoys sports and fitness as well as sailing."" Do you need more to understand from where all of this is coming?In these times, in Anno Domini 2020, such a movie cannot be done anymore in USA, not even in France or UK.

This genre is so rare in past decades and audience were so thirsty for it, that 365dni was trending all over US social media when it released on the online streaming services, all major European newspapers had articles about this movie. How many polish movies got this kind of attention?
If your are someone who gets offended by watching two attractive, beautiful actors get naked and perform sex scenes on screen, it would not be a problem for you to find an American alternative in last ten years; Hollywood movies which pretend sex does not exist, actors whom keep their clothes on for a sex scene or directors who have to shoot actors in a way that audience wouldn't be able to see anything during love scenes.

296,mimino99,Gomorrah meets 50 shades of Grey... GONE WRONG,3,9 June 2020,"Yeah, the result of this mixture was quite terrible.
Not a real movie, but more of a random messed-up plot constructed around (very) explicit sex scenes.
The two main actors are so attractive it's ridiculous (""it's like they're Photoshopped"", Emma Stone would say), and they have good chemistry: but that's all this motion picture is really about. Hot erotic scenes that might be a good watch for you in place of your usual adult site if you're feeling like it.
However, the plot is so poorly written it's embarrassing. The characters are... weird and illogical. A lot of mainstream American songs played at totally inappropriate moments make the soundtrack of this movie sound like a bad bar jukebox.
Long story short, watch only if you're feeling horny.",365 Days
297,darkomarijancevic,Not to be watched from the perspective of a 'normal' person,7,23 September 2020,"'365 Days' seems to challenge the perspective, the angle from which you decide to watch this film. It doesn't lend itself to audiences who are not comfortable sneaking a peek into the lives of emotionally un(der)developed personalities which this film features. And that is OK.As much as it is OK for this film to exist, so as to portray all the rollercoaster life-threatening drama which - in a lot of aspects - is plausible and comes with the lifestyle featured in the film.If a storyline like this seems unfathomable to you, you can consider yourself lucky to live in a society where this doesn't occur, but it helps to have awareness that what you see in the film is a dynamic paradigm of a relationship between a powerful man and a beautiful damsel who dreams of being saved by a knight.If you watch this film from the place of an average (I like to avoid the word 'normal') person, it's most certainly justified that you'll find it disturbing (and outrageous even) how the events unfold and how people in the film respond to events.If you scratch below the surface and place yourself in the mind of a handsome, rich and powerful man who calls all the shots or a young woman in her prime who realizes that her beauty and sexuality call the shots for her, you can understand how this story of wealth, grandeur and brilliance comes together to produce a ""power couple"" embodied by the protagonists.He controls everything, she controls him. This is where the story falters in realism. Even though we see his anger in response to her control over him (the seduction games that she plays), the kind of narcissistic and antisocial personality of an average mobster wouldn't allow such behavior from ""his woman"". In real life, the woman in a similar situation might have been beaten into submission, but the film romanticizes the level of control the female protagonist can have over her male counterpart.The ending is supposed to be a morale to the whole story. The splendor of high-end life may come at a steep price. We are all free to choose our journey.",365 Days

The dialogue sounds like it was written by a 5th grader, dramatic scenes (for instance the one with the father in the beginning) make you laugh out loud, the editing is so bad that certains scenes don't make sense. In turn you get numerous drawn out poinless shopping montages (??)

Like reviewing a high school drama class project.LE: After reading some 10 star reviews, I came to see what the appeal of this movie is.

2.-He has the body of a god and the genitalia of the devil (do they mean his bits are red and have a pointy beard?)
3.-He is ridiculously rich. Everyone does as he says. He is powerful.
4.-He is dangerous, he is a gangster, but he protects you to the point that he is happy to start a gang war to save your honour when you act all slutty with another man. This war ends up with your death, but hey ho.
5.-He tells you what to do. But not boring things like make me dinner, he ends your toxic previous relationship so you dont have to, and forces you to go to shops to buy ridiculously expensive clothes and bras and tells you you have to go to masked balls and parties with him. Or to his yacht. The brute.
6.-He takes you to a place where his ex can show you how bitter she is he left her and how gorgeous she is. Gosh this means I must be even hotter!
7.-His relationship goal is a wedding. Soon! without your family but with your best mate though. You can go dress shopping.
8.-Babies!
9.- Lots of sex! But with the magical third rate erotic literature formula of: domination+consent= I am going to have sex with you until they hear you scream in warsaw.
10.- your foolish behaviour provokes a mafia war but he forgives you like totally because you are amazing even though his family wants you dead too.Listen, I've watched it so you dont have to, please, don't waste your time.

This movie exceeded my average expectations. I thought this movie was going to be another cookie-cutter, soft core, Fifty Shades inspired ""lady bean flicker"". It wasn't. The sex scenes outshined the rest of the movie, but it was still enjoyable to watch from start to end. Not to give too much away, but the ending is not your typical ride-off-into-the-sunset happy ending, and that's my overall favorite aspect of the movie. No generic happily ever after.Okay, so the main plot of the storyline isn't the most realistic (most romance novels aren't either), but it was still fun to get wrapped up in the sexiness of the actors and the characters they portrayed. NOT ALL MOVIES ARE MEANT TO BE TRUE-TO-LIFE REALISTIC! Some movies are meant to have fantasy story plots with guys who have 16-pack abs and a crap load of money, a huge mansion in Europe, and a beautiful woman they can take on a stereotypical shopping spree movie montage. Sometimes you just want to watch a movie to escape reality, not to relive it all over again. This movie does just that. It puts your mind in a fantastical, kind of farfetched, sexy and romantic haze.

No person in their right mind would ever fall in love after being kidnapped, touched without consent (the line Massimo delivered that he would never touch her without permission didn't sound so convincing since he was grabbing her tit right in that moment), having their privacy invaded and being tied up, forced to watch a man receive oral job in front of you with the goal of making you fall in love.

I'm not sure if this is what they think women want and I guess you would consider this to be like every woman's wet dream? But there's no plot, the dialogue is terrible, and sure women like being dominated from time to time but not to that extreme and the guy isn't even sweet or gentle as he claims. He is only sweet or gentle after he gets his and i feel like that's kind of backwards. I felt like I was just watching porn and that's it. I did enjoy the main actress, I think she is just stunning but I found it funny how they kept putting her in the same low cut black dress with the same hair. *Spoiler* When it came to the ball scene, I expected a even more beautiful transformation with a flashy dress and hair done but nope.. just stuck to the same style she's been wearing.

It's a bit far fetched but not for a fantasy, romantic story, with a lot of erotic scenes. I didn't like the 50 shades of grey due to the casting the main character lacks charisma and the female is as sexy as an ice cube.

I guess the end supposed to make you sad or something because she is killed, but is just made poorly. Anyway, this movie brings a lot of questions: In which twisted universe kidnapping brings happy ending?!
Is it supposed to be a new way of meeting people?! Why would you go to a holidays with friends and realize someone is missing and you won't do anything about it? Is it supposed to be fine that the male character abuses his victum, because he is good looking and rich? What if the guy was fat and bold, would she try to escape? What is with the sex scenes and the weird music? Why all the erotic scenes start with blowjobs? Was the script written by some horny teenagers? What happened to the bad guys?
Why would you give as argument to someone to stay in Sicily because there are a lot of ""horny Italians""? And how does she knows, when she went there, got kidnapped and boom engaged?

Their English is cute sounding and easy to understand though so that's a plus I guess.

The only character I really liked the most was Domenico the henchman he should have been given more lines and screen time.All in all, this movie has no plot and was clearly made for the sex scenes which are also hard to watch 😬 none of this movie is about love it's totally about lust and nothing substantial.

Ugly and cheating, can spend 24/7 in front of PC!). Everything romantic between them is long gone. And as from the beginning, Laura's is in need of a change. So far, so well.
Then we are introduced to Massimo. Mobster with history and traditions. He's a bit cou cou, as we see him taking hard decisions, keeping the family business strong, but emotionally he's a mess. When he saw Laura at the airport, he end long term relationship with Anna, because he believes that he's in love with woman he doesn't know anything about ?!?
Probably Anna (Massimo's ex) is the most realistic character. She's a real mafia boss woman. She's takes everything she loves, with power and no mercy.Anyway Laura's behaviour is just like a teenager girl, trying to tease Massimo with cheap tricks, and then pretending to actually long for him. She actually must be feeling super blessed that man this handsome wants her (having in mind the ex Martin)

429,x_narinka_x,Worst movie I've seen,1,21 June 2020,"Look I get it, most of us are at home, we have a lockdown and all legitimised porn is welcome. But let's just call it what it is and look for better porn ok? This movie being top 10 at Netflix makes me sad for humanity. In one of the first scenes the guy basically rapes a flight attendant by implying she blow him when she is at work and he's a powerful maffia head. But wait, she enjoyed it! Right, because flight attendants wait around for a chance to blow their clients. I'm surprised there was a female director involved, because this whole movie seemed a guy's fantasy (otherwise known as bad porn, yes), just as long as you have enough power and money, all the women will enjoy blowing you and if you fall in love, you can kidnap her and then she will love you too. Oh and when she does fall in love with you, first thing she will do is blow you! Not kiss you first, no hug or touching otherwise, she'll go straight for your dick and blow you.

These are the worst actors i have ever seen, no one would act like that in real life.The combination of Polish, Italian and English is giving me a Headache.I have watched alot of erotic drama movies and this is by far the worst. I feel like I am watching a home-made movie for a bizarre schoolproject??I don't get the good reviews here, must be paid for cause it's IMPOSSIBLE someone didn't cringe while watching this.

434,oliwiafalowska,"Not as bad as people make it sound and has nothing to do with 50 shades except for ""erotic"" genre",7,15 June 2020,I'm delighted i checked out the ratings on both Polish websites and English ones before I watched it so my expectations were quite low to begin with which could be why I didn't completely hate it.Not the best film I ever watched but honestly it's not as bad as people make it sound?It's not to promote violence against women or to encourage this kind of behaviour especially since there isn't that many great looking gangster millionaires who would want to kidnap a girl and have the resources to do so. It's about fulfilling the writers (and hopefully for them - the viewers) fantasy.People would be surprised how many women get turned on by the consensual non consent or however it's called and how many have rape fantasies and how many get going on the dom/sub scene. Obviously a good looking man was a must though because who would watch it with an overweight old hairy sugardaddy?My second point is that it is literally nothing like 50 shades of gray. It's not a Polish comeback about 50shades or what not. I keep seeing people comparing those two but the only thing connecting the film's is erotic theme and a handsome millionaire. The plot is completely different the actors are different the set up is different literally everything is different. It's like saying that the Witcher is just another Game of Thrones cause it would be a similar genre and Henry Cavill is as built and good looking as Jason mamoa even though everything else is completely different.The one thing I could not stand in the film is the accents. As an only English speaking person I would not be able to sit through the entire film. Thankfully I speak polish so I switched on polish language to speak over their English. I mean I understand they can't have English native accents or else it would be very unrealistic but Jesus that was a torture to listen. Fair play to the leads though for pulling through and learning the script in English that is at best their second language they still done a great job.On a side note if I was to compare it to 50 shades (both films and books) I would put them both on the same level. Fifty shades is just as cringe and as poorly written at least in the film Laura has some kind of edgy side (very annoying at times) unlike Anastasia who was just plain boring throughout (and yet also very annoying at times),365 Days

Epic scenes, lights, filming angles. The way they are dressed, the color palette of the entire movie, everything is storytelling, every decoration...The way they managed to film something quite erotic, yet romantic, not porn. It's more suggestion and simulation than actually real action. Most important, I think, this movies transmits feelings and emotions, and that's what should matter in this genre.

485,web_address_08,Actually not bad; it's getting bashed for all the wrong reasons,7,8 August 2020,"I've seen so many negative reviews about this movie, and they all attempting to suggest it's either a piece of pornography or misogyny. I don't at all believe this is the case, and I'll tell you why.First of all, the movie is 2 hours long, and my assessment is the sexual content accounts for about 20 minutes total at different intervals throughout the movie, including sections which primarily depict nudity, and not necessarily direct simulated sex.I also think the misogynistic angle is actually the exact opposite. While the movie might seem to suggest that the lifestyle of a wealthy mafia boss can be glamorous, my take on the end of the movie was that Massimo set himself up for failure. He believed that as long as he had the opportunity to prove to Laura that he was an ideal man for her, that he could win her over. Where he went wrong was the very first step in the entire process; he took her by force. No logical woman should forgive having her freedom taken away, and Laura proved herself to be weak to manipulation.But what happens to Laura in the end? She dies as a result of Massimo courting her, and thereby inviting her into the mafia family. That was something that was directly of his doing, and he promised to protect her, then failed. Presenting the head honcho as this tough figure with immense power, who then later defeated the very goal he was aiming to achieve, does not cast a very bright light for misogyny. Yes, Laura was not able to see past the fact that she was a kidnap victim, and that the ends did not justify the means... But Massimo spent years going to great lengths to plan this arrangement, then lost his pride due to his own decisions, including shooting the man who groped Laura.I do think the amount of sexual content was more than necessary to convey the message. Still I think it's an interesting tale in the end of how both parties were not strong enough to either think clearly or overcome their ill fated desires. I was also impressed with the acting and musical score. It's a fictitious story, but a representation of how some people in life do not have a firm grip on their emotions. If anything, perhaps Laura was almost leaning towards Stockholm Syndrome, and eventually could not tell the difference. But it doesn't matter, this eventually backfired on Massimo regardless. Certainly not the best film I've ever seen, but it was worth watching once.",365 Days

487,couchpotato2k,The film that redeems Pornhub,1,16 June 2020,"Apparently Netflix picked the month of June to do their own ""Really Unwatchable Film Festival"" (see ""Last Days of American Crime"" for another cringeworthy entry). Or maybe with the current worldwide shutdown of all film and television productions, they're searching for anything, anywhere to post as a new release before resorting to pirating stuff off of YouTube.This brings us to ""365 dni,"" the film that would premiere on Lifetime Entertainment Service's porn channel if they had a porn channel. It's - oh, boy. I understand it's based on a Polish novelist's work, and there might be more books in the series. This is unfortunate. It's terrible to hope that the production company responsible for this dreck goes bankrupt or that every showrunner involved dies of food poisoning. Many of us are still hoping for this anyway.There's two pretty hetero people destined to fall in love/boink a lot, the female being Polish (""Laura"") and the male being Italian (""Massimo""). They mostly communicate in English, so maybe the producers hoped it would have broad appeal to a U.S./UK/Australian audience, especially the types of watchers who hate reading subtitles. The pretty people have a lot of explicit sex, but while you will see breasts and rear ends, it does not feature anything but implied genitalia. Is that a plus? Does it keep it from crossing a line into being an actual porn? Is anybody else a little worried about what they're not quite seeing? The one redeemable factor in this film is at least the female character doesn't have fake boobs. Oh, and the fact that you'll learn to swear in Polish, always a plus.You will read plenty of descriptions of this movie being similar to ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" That's not a compliment, by the way. ""Fifty Shades"" is a committee-written fanfic retelling of ""Twilight"" without the vampires and werewolves or any of the redeeming literary value of the original. Uh-huh. And as they say, it goes downhill from there.There is a kidnapping. There is a cringe-inducing caricature of Italian men, reductively labeling all of them as being Mafia-involved, overbearing, hopelessly romantic, kinda' neanderthal and a bit dumb. If not for the film's positive spin on Stockholm Syndrome, that would be the greatest criticism of this movie. The female character is being given a full year to fall in love with her kidnapper, but gets it done, all the way to being engaged, in around two months. Because that happens. All the time. There's sexual tension, sure, but wait - is she that immune to trauma or do both of these characters have the emotional depth of a potato? And what's with her portrait? He saw her allegedly ONCE, when his dad was killed - no pictures on his phone, no police sketch artist, and no access to her social media. So from memory he has a huge portrait of this woman he's obsessed with hanging in his living room? Um, okaaayyy.Around the first thirty minutes of this film, I thought it should be retitled ""Massimo Gets A Lot of Head."" If you're masochistic enough to watch this far, you'll see why. I should also point out that the soundtrack, which is mostly old-school-porn forgettable, features the actor playing Massimo doing a lot of the lyrics and the vocals. Yup. Didn't see that coming, did you? The female character has a supposed heart condition which is referred to several times, then seemingly evaporates. There's a whole ""Pretty Woman"" montage, played for - laughs? pain? a commentary on conspicuous consumption? Maybe every Lifetime porn film as a rule somehow has to feature such a lavish shopping scene along with required attendance - for no discernible reason - at the compulsory Masked Cinderella Ball. Is this really what hetero women fantasize about? I feel like I'm missing something. Then the character playing Laura, after being sent home by Massimo, somehow decides this is now the right time for her to get the asymmetrical blond bob known as the ""Karen."" It's topical, but the meme doesn't really work with the theme of the film, or in this story, or even as extremely bad satire. It makes just as much sense as any of the characters suddenly mastering the accordion, or adopting a deaf camel.At least this movie ends in a good place - the deaths of both a main and supporting character. Of course, given what I know now, that may be too much to hope for. The best that can be said is you'll watch a fairly entertaining film if you fast-forward to all the sex scenes and skip all the other parts, especially the dialogue. You were warned.

If he had approached her in a different way maybe I would've given it 10. The plot was a little bit hazy but overall understood what it was portraying, I would've wanted more elaboration and action but it's a romance movie and clearly did not have enough time to demonstrate.

493,ccorreialoureiro,A golden cage,3,27 July 2020,"To sum this plot up, an Italian (greek) God falls for a woman he saw once from a sort of fortress on the very day his father died. From that day, he didn't keep the memory of his father dying in his arms, but the sight of the woman he saw by the shore. Five years later she goes to Sicily on a tour and he sees her at the arrival. As any other man in love would do, and being the head of mafia he is, he kidnaps her. She is an empowered polish woman with fake dark hair, fake lashes, fake nose, fake nails and I suspect fake lips as well. As an empowered woman would do, you'd suspect she'd try to flee her captor, but she trie it thrice in very stupid ways and then decides to tease him. Any woman would tease a stranger who had her emprisioned, for we do not fear rape! So she goes around teasing him, until they both have sex, and sex, sex again. Next thing you know, she loves him. Also, they never have a really conversation throughout the movie. He says he kills bad guys who hurt children, she buys it and finds it romantic. She teases him in childish ways and he loves her too. In the end she puts on a blonde wig and makes the cringiest smile ever while trying on her wedding gown. The only nice thing about the movie is the camera, it is visually gorgeous, but the actress just got on my nerves for looking so pretensious. Also, I've learned that it is a female fantay to take man out for shopping. By the second shopping spree I was sincerely feeling sorry for him, for she was having the best of time with her captor.",365 Days

I speak for myself here, but I don't really like regular porn as it's very unrealistic. Yes as a female I will watch some of it, but I don't get turned on to the same things men do and I'm always searching for something that I really enjoy watching that doesn't annoy me with the whiny moans and money shots. At least something like this is a little more relatable and not so ridiculously fake (very little based on the ""plot"" but you know what I mean). It's a steamy fantasy movie. That's it. I read all 50 shades books and the movies were really awful. I was so disappointed. They should've gone all out. This movie, the sex scenes, especially the first one, were on point! As a chick, I'm into the erotic steamy sex scenes in movies and they're hard to find. Those turn me on more than porn. I like to see passion, love, sweat, etc. This movie shows that.

And if I had to choose between this and 50 shades I would definitely pick 50 shades. The acting was not the best, but it still kept me entertained enough to finish the movie. The first half of the movie was very rapey and depicted women as nothing but sex objects. Shoot The first sex scene was rape, but made to look like the woman was enjoying it. The main male character was decent looking, but definitely a stalker and literally kidnapped the main character. I would call this a case of Stockholm syndrome, where the girl only feel in love with the guy and had sex with him simply because he saved her from drowning. And the reason she almost drowned was his fault for backing her up against the rails of the boat. She falls in love and totally forget he was throwing her around a room just a few minutes ago. While I wouldn't say I enjoyed the film it was interesting in the sense i felt I had to know how it ends, and given the storyline i think the ending was befitting. The camera shots were amazing, as was the scenery and set designs. While there were elements of 50 shades in the film, you really can't compare the two. There was one scene he cuffed her to the bed, and made her watch ""what she was missing"" . Let's just say it wasn't boring, and I would watch again since there were several different languages being used in sure I missed stuff, but it's nothing to call home to tell mother about.",365 Days

The sex scenes are that of the books my grandma even read and handed down to me! The story line did make sense, however the back story wasn't supposed to be the focus. The film was about desire, passion and sex. That's it. Erotica novels are cheesy with some cringe story lines but the sex scenes are hot! And this is what this movie really is. The adult film industry is the largest in the world and believe it or not this type of fantasy is actually very common. Of course it's not wanted in real life that's why it's a fantasy. The woman's sexuality actually had all the power and what is wrong with that? Don't over think the ""captive"" part. It's just a plot to build competitive desire between the characters.",365 Days

This movie will work for people who don't read books, zero story development...so unintelligent!!! I feel like we are being introduced into porn. They are sanitizing porn for normal viewing...

587,deepalinishad,One of the worst movie I've ever seen,3,5 July 2020,"I've seen a lot of movies which are hilariously dumb because they don't have any logical story or they're just stupid. This movie, well it made to my list of top ten worst movies very effortlessly. Now you may wonder what's so bad about this movie and why I'm calling it the worst so let me tell you.Plot-It was horrifyingly bland. Laura, a sales director working in Poland goes to Sicily to save her drowning relationship. Her boyfriend is very busy with work and stuff that he doesn't have any time to look after her girlfriend.There she's kidnaped by this Italian don Massimo and he gives her 365 days to fall in love with him. Then after few scenes they're making out and she's realising that she's in love with him.There was no character development also the plot doesn't have any potential. Infact it was glorifying kidnapping and assault.
ScriptStupid! Just atrocious. The amount of cringe in , ""Are you lost baby gorl?"" Is really huge. The script writing is done on a horrible level and even a twelve year old can write better dialogues than this.""I want you to teach me how to be gentle"" Next level cringe.
""I don't 365 days to fall in love with you"" Second hand embarrassment. Cringe again.CharactersNot remarkable. They all were horrible and dumb. Massimo was a hypocrite. He said he wouldn't touch Laura without her permission but also ties her up and make her watch him getting a blowjob.Laura who's written very badly. She doesn't even fight for her freedom. After a point she was very comfortable with her kidnapping and who the hell in their right mind tries to seduce their kidnapper?Side characters- Totally forgettable. They're just there to move the plot or some are not even doing that. Without some of their existence, the plot would be same.",365 Days

Everyone in my family liked this movie, me, wifeand kids, ages 13, 11 and 9. A couple of inappropriate sexual parts, mainly at beginning so easy to skip past or talk over. We watched from home but would def go to theater for sequel. It is hard to find movies that we can enjoy as adults and we are okay with kids watching. I see there are poor reviews but it is a fun sexy movie we thought. Loved the girl power because she is a given a choice and she makes one. I don't know why it is lower reviewed but society does seem to put down female empowerment movies, especially when they are more sexy rather than fulfilling cliche mainstream stuff. Anyway, we would recommend and will watch again.",365 Days

None of my friends nor my husbands found this appealing in the slightest - neither did I - and on the contrary were actually rather repulsed.

When I saw the rating I almost passed on it because my free time is far and few. So of course kidnapping is awful and I don't agree with that. But it's a movie. It's fantasy. He is sexy, she's gorgeous and needs to feel that way, he takes care of her and worships her. Who doesn't want that life?!

We really got into it from start to finish the whole old money will buy you love and I recommend this movie and its a good watch with family.

598,barehuntertm,Not happy with the ending,8,14 July 2020,"Here is one that is not for everyone. Certainly the feminists will hate it. It seems like a mash up between the Fifty Shades trilogy, and The Pet, with a similar ending to The Pet.. The female lead is played as a woman who is internally strong so that, whatever happens to her, she deals with, instead of crumbling like a soft weak frightened babe. She tries to get away at various points, and she pushes the man's buttons, but also works within her limitations. the turning point comes when she falls off a boat and he saves her. From that point, she is played as the thankful girl who falls in love with her rescuer. This I didn't feel was realistic, considering the way she was acting before. I would have expected her, instead, to blame him for the danger she was in, and continue to act like a P.O.W. in a war. At one point he gave her back her cell phone. She should have called for a rescue, since she wasn't in love with him yet. While things picked up towards the end, and give you happy feelings, the ending was a huge letdown and happened quick. At least you don't actually see her die. Her car goes into a tunnel and doesn't come out the other end.This is a fantasy. There are plenty of people, of both genders, who enjoy such as these. Those who are horrified by these, especially those who have suffered being kidnapped and abused, I can understand them hating a movie like this. But the world doesn't revolve around them', If you don't like it, don't watch. Do not, however, prevent me from watching it. That is not your right.",365 Days

Also this movie introduce a new genre to the cinema called ""porn-comedy"" Well maybe that is a genre which was used before but never unintentionally. The movie is trying to be deep, romantic and serious while it is totally the opposite; it is shallow, cheap and ridiculous. It almost feel like parody of Fifty Shades Of Grey, while Fifty Shades Of Grey almost like a parody of clichés. It is like a parody of an another parody.

With his mysterious and manly personality he can always make her want him by not telling her what she ""doesn't need to know"" and by being strict and a little bit violent when he has to. If he tries enough, he can make her love him. Of course, shopping, clubbing and a luxurious lifestyle is a good way to do so because, this is what a woman really wants to be happy, right?This movie is the definition of sexism and patriarchy and It's ridiculous that in 2020 movies like this are being released.",365 Days

50 shades of grey kinda style but more grasping, definitive, haaaawt. Definitely not boring & overrated as 50 Sog got for me.Let's admit it, 365days is very old harlequin novel style which we loved. Heroin is kidnapped by the hero (Whose heart had been captured unknown to her 5yrs ago when he first saw her) and given 365days to fall in love with him.Liked the characters too. Beautiful people.

The kidnapping. The hot scenes. Even her eventual death (though this bad ending is usually reserved to the worst of the worst of these independent novels).

I rarely, and I mean rarely, will watch either romance or erotica.But I saw this out of curiosity due to the tremendous backlash. And, I liked it.
It was different for me. Admittedly, maybe I'm saying this because I hardly ever watch these kinds of movies but I liked the premise of the movie and I liked its boldness. The two leads also weren't bad. They were both attractive and, dare I say, likable. The movie has plenty of ""dumb"" moments and the ending is a cliched letdown but overall it does its job effectively. The dialogue is several corny light years away from Woody Allen universe stuff but the film compensates with the chemistry between its leads and their development as characters. It's effective lowbrow art done right.The hook is simple. A young successful businesswoman is taken prisoner by a young Mafia boss. A Beauty and the Beast arc ensues where in the end despite their early differences and hostility toward one another they fall in love. The romance is physical and raw and in the end emotional. The sex scenes were unsubtle but strangely stimulating.I liked all the little bits along the way where both leads have to little by little give up something internal in order to gain something. Fear, guardedness, pride, security, authority and even dignity. For vulnerability, intimacy, and finally, love. However, it's not a one-way as the other reviewers here make it sound like. I also enjoyed how this surprising bit of substance was coated in an eroticism which the two main characters pulled off real well.As for the philosophy of this film? If you even care about deeper meaning in a lowbrow work.. well for me at least, in an age where men and women are almost not allowed to be men and women, this movie was refreshing. The movie grasped at the nature of attraction between men and women and in a way had something to say that not many dare say nowadays. It took a detour off the acceptable mainstream cultural highways. I liked that.",365 Days

I can't get those minutes that I actually wasted hoping that it would get better back. It took 3 minutes and 6.5 seconds to turn a poorly written soap opera into a bootleg porn. I have to give him credit.... He booked a role where he managed to have an ""oral"" conversation throughout this waste of screen time, and I am OVERLY surprised that it made it on Netflix. I've heard that Netflix and chill means that Netflix plays in the background, while you're engaging into other activities, and THIS would be the PERFECT thing to play, if you like sleezy sex scenes.OABTW, I truly hope those sex scenes are indeed fake, because when he spit in between her legs....that's where you lost me. That was disgusting!!!!. I was sooooooooooo confused on so many different levels with this movie. He kidnaps her because he had an image of her when he thought he was dying after his father was shot, so kidnapping her was the way to go..... Good job with that in real life to whomever wrote this unrealistic teenage fantasy. I kept watching it, trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, and praying that it would get better, but it only got worse smh......I'm still so confused. .",365 Days

729,medontknowanything,"What a cliche, but...",6,24 June 2020,"Ok, so I obviously belong to people who took some time to review this, as, no matter how disturbing it was, we need to acknowledge that there IS something we should talk about:
1. To everyone wondering, why this movie is No 1 in their country: OBVIOUS thing - we've been in a lockdown for weeks, everyone is longing fo a hug OR MORE. So don't judge the moviemakers to give you a taste of basic intimacy we are all longing for. BUT...
2. To everyone feeling ""THIS FEELS SO WRONG, BUT I WANT TO SEE, WHERE THIS IS GOING""- please don't feel wrong. Yes, I guess, like some of you, being aware of all the debates on gender equality, I counted the times she was on top of him vs. him on her. Yes, I found it disturbing, that every intimate moment between a man and a woman has to start with oral sex provided by the woman. Yes, I judged the message, that marrying an ""alpha guy"" (after having unprotected sex) is the ultimate goal for every woman (not even questioning, that everything a woman wants is a marriage and a child). BUT everyone of us needs to question - and this is what I think the role of this movie is - why we find it so intriguing and why most reviews are so bad? Obviously, most of the 1-star reviewers didn't switch it off after 20 min, meaning there was a reason to watch? And for me, I have the answer why. I believe the movie had a good purpose after all: I had to question my own values, watching some, IN MY WORLD, old-fashioned ideas and making me question, why all stories of submissive women are still being binge-watched? And I figured, it is because the majority of us is still not there yet - to think a woman and a man can actually ask for love in an EQUAL way, EQUAL meaning, in a way that they define being EQUAL for THEM. So if we all agree that all she and him wanted is what we saw, why should we rate the movie with 1 star? Do we need to have the same understanding of equality, or shall we leave it in our own (their) bedroom? Isn't it the ultimate freedom we are looking for?
3. A message that got lost in all this soft porn, and that deserves a star, is that, a true friend's company will always help - no matter, if they are saying yes or no to what you do - they do it out of love for you.PS And btw, a good reminder for me - going to hairdresser after a break up, will, most of the times, do you no good.",365 Days

This movie is not for prudes. The leading man looks like a 10 years younger David Gandy. It was a bit difficult to hear what the actors were saying in parts so I had to turn on the closed captioning.

Choice of actors: 0/10 -> they probably found the only Italian-looking guy in poland. However he couldn't act. I didn't buy the mafia role from him for one second
Sexual Scenes: 3/10 -> come on, a bit of making love on a boat? I've seen better sexscenes in bollywood!
Camera: 3/10 -> the polish interns did okayOverall: 1/10 -> Story is bad, acting is even worse, the dialogues actually hurt my ears.

I actually really liked it.Granted it has WAY too much sex, I skipped over about 20 minutes of sex scenes.

The music was oddly placed and really wasn't too fitting.
The writing was difficult to bear. Didn't appreciate the whole ""baby girl"" thing. I especially did not enjoy the way the mafia boss treated his love interest. He was borderline abusive to her, and that's not cute.
The ending was absolutely rushed and unnecessary. It's like they ran out of ideas for the way it could end.
Overall the biggest plot point in this whole movie is sex and if that's what you're looking for, great. If it's not, I suggest looking for a different movie.",365 Days

What's bothering me most is that this movie was supposed to be polish verion of Grey and it turned out to be a cheaper version of Bounty ads. Too much explicit sex, no real bond and depth between main characters, no viable motivies behind characters' actions- these are only a few of so many sins that have been commited. This movie is outrageously bad. The very first impression that came to my mind after seeing it was that everything was so forced and artifical.

795,dkellikay,"Too hot to handle...sex, fetishes, gangsters...it's blazing fire.",10,10 June 2020,"The movie is a good watch. It is currently buzzing all over instagram, and there as to be a reason many people rate it 10/10 right!To give this movie 3 out of 10 is to say the movie is pretty much dirt, which couldn't be further from the truth.
This movie is worth atleast a 7, I gave it a 10 because it was so captivating, I went back and watch it again from start to finish, other than Titanic and Underworld, I have never watched a movie back to back in the same week.The movie is stimulating and inspiring, well depends on what it inspires you to do. 😂
In reference to a review I read, with the reviewer commenting on the fail attempt to make the gangster scenes more believable. I do agree, there wasn't a big impacted gangster scene.
A little snip here and there but not compelling enough. Instead of seeing the female actors going to the spa and dancing in the clubs, I think the writer could have deleted those scene and focus on some more cutthroat gangster scenes.
It would have been nice to see more ruthless, merciless scenes, especially due to the fact the writer is trying to center the plot around the lineage of Itilian Mafia.With that being said, this is just part one, and judging by the way part one ended, I assuming part 2 is going to be 🔥 ""blazing!!!! Red, bloodbath""The sex scenes are a major part of the movie, definitely mind blowing, mental release. 😛 whoo intense! These scenes will definitely stimulate all your 7 chakars, allowing your mind to virtually venture into a plessurable world of passion, lust and temptations. whoo child, yes!The fashion in the movie, is stylish, simply yet classy, tasteful and sexy. You will be Inspired enough to wanna switch your wardrobe up a little.The females are sexy, would have liked to see more diversity in female actress, maybe some black girl magic and a little spanish spice, I mean the plot destination of the movie is centered around Italy. Whereas Spain and Africa is right there lol.On the other hand the role of the lead actress slow seduction, while trying not to give into the Alpha lead male actor was captivating to say the most.
I liked how, she started as a Alpha female and slowing became submissive. In her efforts to retain power and break the male, she ended up neutrally requlishing her power and falling in love with him.
Being Alpha female myself, I found that part very sexy. Whoo!! Moving on.There was some little corny parts, like the repeative use of language from the male lead saying ""baby girl,""
I mean I have never heard any gangster talk like that lol, however I do have friends with worse corny slang. And mine is ""whoo child honey,"" lol.
None the less I would love to see the writer leave that grammar in part one.In conclusion, for a movie to have a female getting captured and making it look sexy, to the point where every female now wants to be captured by a sexy, talk glass of water, six pack blazing, Itilian gangster lol hello! It as to not, only have great convincing actors; but also amazing writers, directors and beautiful Cinematography, so great job to them 👏.So should you watch this movie!!! Absolutely 💯😎",365 Days

811,mrsgrecki,NOT as bad as everybody says,10,13 June 2020,"I loved it so much, I watched it twice in a row.
The plot is simple and not too complicated to understand. Yet it is not boring at all.
Whether people can relate to it or not is irrelevant, because the film itself is just pure escapism and eye candy.
Hot and steamy - oh yes.
Beautiful settings, dramatic scenes - absolutely.
Gorgeous languages - again, oh yes.At a time, where nothing is allowed anymore - where everything seems to offend everyone - I was so utterly grateful for this simple movie that tells its story bluntly and unapologetically. It's primal, hot and sweet.
And it's a beaufitul story, even though people are offended by the fact that he is a ""kidnapper"". I'd call him a rescuer instead, because her life before sucked with a lying boyfriend and she is clearly unfulfilled. She is taken into a wealthy lifestyle, he provides her with everything she needs and then some. Including incredible sex - which she craves. Even though it seems violent at times, it's not really. She is not exactly some helpless damsel in distress taken by some creep. There is a deep love story hidden inside it all and his desperation drives him to give her his world - and she still has a choice and does what she wants anyway, which adds to the humor.This movie is the perfect escape from all the craziness in the world right now.
Loved every bit of it.",365 Days

821,westchic,I wish i could get the 1hur and 1/2 Back!,2,7 June 2020,"I've never reviewed a movie before but I'm so ""for lack of a better word' Disheartened but the pure idiotic premises of this movie that i feel i should worn anyone thinking of even wasting their time watching this movie.
So let me start by saying someone sent me a link on Instagram a few months ago when i clicked on it i saw a beautiful man with his shirt off being what i would describe as 'Alpha male' lets just say i was hooked i search and found out what the name of the movie was but was disappointed when i found out that Netflix had only released it in Europe. Finally while scrolling through Netflix soon to be released in the US movies i saw it was going to be available June 7 2020,. I couldn't wait. Now I've always been a fan of movies like 91/2 weeks, Wild orchid, Two Moon Junction to name a few, that take charge 'Alpha Male' appeals to me. So i waited until 4am in the morning until Netflix's released it to their US audience. Michele Morrone is an amazing actor and he delivered, but the actress who I've never heard of was for lack of a better word ""God Awful"" now i don't want to be to hard on her it could of been the script she had to work with. But the character ""Laura"" came off like a petulant child with daddy issues and very unconvincing.. first off.. in this day and age someone' kidnapers a woman and tell her he's been dreaming of her and has a picture no-less of her she would atomically think this man is a Psycho and i need to get the hell away from him before he kills me and wears my skin as a hat'. But that not what happened she teased him provoked him and pretending to run away ""in High heels no-less .WTF Look i get the premises as i said i love these kinds of movies but the reason why 91/2 weeks and Wild Orchid have stand the test of time is because its well written with strong female characters. ""not some Scarlett O'Hara please rescue me from my life I'm a poor needy girl that can't make it on her own"" This kind of character doesn't work for this time with the ""Me Too movement'. Now i don't think that 91/2 weeks would work if it was written today because women are a lot more independent, and even though we like it when our man takes charge because' WE LET HIM TAKE CHARGE, AND NOT FORCE HIMSELF UPON US'. Even in 91/2 weeks the female protagonist 'Kim Basinger"" was strong independent and wanted the male Protagonist 'Mickey Rourke"" to take her on her terms. Maybe I'm looking at this god awful movie through American female eyes, and again it might be unfair to judge this actress because she probably did the best she could with the script she was given.
On Instagram i see people asking for a ""Sequel"" i hope to god if the studio decides to do a Sequel they get better writers and or a different actress.
This movie has the potential to be a really good movie if they would take the time to develop a better story line that matches the 21centery. If i may they might want a well known actress like ""Gal Godot, Zoe Sadler, Natalie Portman, Zoe Kravitz just to name a few. I gave it 2stars only because of the actor ""Michele Morrone"" who has taken the time to work on his craft.",365 Days

I was surprise to see how some ""movie Directors "" can take that existing issue and turn it into a heck of a ""romantic movie"".
The movie is supposed to give you a feeling of love and trust, but all it does is, reminding us how dirty love can become when practiced by sick and sad people.
Netflix was until now a safe place for people who want to enjoy a good movie once in a while.I am not sure what kind of place it became.

A lot of the lines are awkward and don't belong in the contest. The plot is just bad. Like they're is no significant development. Basically the main girl gets Stockholm Syndrome or/and is so sexually frustrated she fell in love with the first d*** that enters her. The camera work is not bad I have to admit that. But all in all they're is not really a purpose in this movie plus it would have been more impactful that the main girl dies at her wedding or after she announce her pregnancy.

838,gg-44097,"Long needed ! Soothing and exciting to watch, really enjoyed the female lead.",10,9 June 2020,"I really enjoyed the female lead, it's so rare to see this kind of female personality in movies.
The erotic style she put forward and her relationship with her female friend towards the end of the film made her very comfortable to me. I feel very disconnected from the people reducing the female lead to having stockholm syndrome or invoking metoo : This piece is about female sexuality and fantasy, based on a female writer's work. It's great we get to see this stuff. The female lead with her energy and confidence stood up for herself the whole time and was fun to follow during the film. The sexual essence in the film was so interesting.I related to the stronger and more visceral erotica in this film very easily. I can't really associate with ordinary romance they always feel empty and lacking reality.
It reflected frustration and hunger for initiative that lived in both characters in a much more interesting and relatable way. The sexual tension portrayed here felt much more real. I definitely dont get the comparison with fifteen shades ? The character build and personnalities, their interactions and the sex scenes simply do not compare. I think this comes from a real lack of understanding of the initiative play environment.
The play at work in the film actually reminded me of some of Marc Dorcel's work (an amazing french-hungarian high quality porn film producer) around initiative play actually. Its erotica with depth and detail on a completely different level.I'm not surprised honestly by the abundance of ""cringe"" or reductive comments. I can understand why so many people felt uneasy. I think the perspective and representation the film puts forward is not often heard and not well understood in the mainstream culture.
Im so glad this was made and is out here. It made me feel more comfortable with myself and my sexuality and I'd gladly see more female roles like this one.
Cheers to the people who worked on this and believed it was worth showing it. I really enjoyed !",365 Days

Do not watch this. This NOT an american film.. Now of you have a good eye for films and enjoy reading romance novels. By all means watch this. A lot of people are comparimg this to 50 shades of gray (a movie i can't stand, and could not even finish watch the films) the actors are great. Was the english a little off in translation? Yes it was but that's ok. I preferred that it was. You have to remember that this film comes from Poland. Thus polish origin. The culture there and here are different. As well as for Massimo. Who just so happens to be Italian. Now I'm not saying the way massimo behaves depicts all italian men. I'm just saying. Educate yourself before you judge the plot and its characters. And DO NOT judge the cultures off of your own standards. Or off of your culture they are not the same. Also you have to remember your seeing this film from the Laura's p.o.v. so it will be confusing because its her p.o.v not from massimo's p.o.v. so her confusion is our confusion because massimo keeps her away from his world and his lifestyle for the most part hence the confusion for laura. the only time you see it from his p.o.v i would say is at the very end.

857,vjeanpierre,Better than 50 shades of gray!,9,11 June 2020,"I see a lot of people are giving this movie a low rating and I just don't understand why. The plot revolves around a man who is the leader of a mafia abducting a woman and giving her 365 days to fall in love with him. Yes, it's cliché and it's basically a Stockholm syndrome movie but it's fantasy. It's similar to action movies when people are jumping out of houses and cars exploding yet they are still alive. The two actors switch between polish, Italian, and English and when people say they are speaking bad English I have to laugh. The movie was based in poland. Neither one of the actors are American so come again. The only way they can communicate with each other is English because that's the language they both know and share with one another. Unlike 50 shades of gray, these actors had great chemistry with each other. She had numerous times to leave but she needed up staying towards the end so when people say she was forced I'm not sure if we were watching the same movie. Anyways, I would recommend and I can't wait for the producers to start working on part 2. Can't satisfy everyone",365 Days

Just because it's (like the name says) a MOVIE, it is supposed to be a movie; which includes a lot of unrealistic scenes, which allow our creative minds and our fantasy to sympathize with the protagonists. I can't believe that people actually write /unrealistic/ while it's a freaking MOVIE which isn't supposed to relate to the reality. I think a lot of you should over-think, whether a movie should be more realistic OR a place where we can be whoever we want to be. There isn't a single movie which is like this one, it's way more relatable to many of us and outstands exactly BECAUSE of the chosen actors and not only just another standard-american movie. The accents and the acting itself are so remarkable and more relatable to the people OUTSIDE OF THE US.",365 Days

For any of the negative comments about how this is degrading to women etc etc... unless you've also said that about ""Beauty and the Beast"" I would say this is an unfair statement. We all know this is a movie, no it's not nice to treat women poorly....if you watch the whole thing you can tell that this is a beginning of a love story and instead of seeing it as a gangster who's power tripping on a ""poor little woman"", notice that the point here is that this ""poor little woman"" has quite the power over him and that's what's so sexy.

No surprise that it is Nr 1 around Europe in many countries on the online streaming channel at this time point, it shows how diversely can emotions be perceived.

I put the movie on as a nice background to what I was working on and I'll be honest, this story had me hooked. SUPER hot bad boy, sexy leading lady, interesting plot...I was glued to my screen. I even put down what I was working on to watch. (A little too much sex for me...I like a good sex scene but when you're having sex 1000 times on a boat, it becomes unrealistic.

Firstly I love the way that there is such a strong overall reaction to the idea that a woman could fall helpless when faced with a mundane life, particularly sexually, behind her and a new reality of being held captive by a powerful, physically strong, handsome and highly confident man. The list of countries where this kind of title could be filmed in an increasingly ridiculously apologetic society is growing ever shorter. Poland is still on the list for reasons good and bad; a topic outside this subject. Women like to be chased in all sorts of ways and male persistence is highly attractive to many (most?) women. This film depicts an extreme sort of persistence and I am quite sure that many women watching the film have questioned how they would react in the same situation.",365 Days

This took bad movies into a whole new level, I think that the writers of this movie, read Twilight and Fifty shades and thought to themselves...hmmm how could we do the same but add more cringe?

Yes he's violent but not towards her yes he's a very dominant man but hey some girls are into that they like to be overpowered she even said it in the movie he makes her feel like a child and she's into it.

Little did I know that my course of movie reviewing carrier would change in this very day. From the first to the last scene I was disgusted by the amount of obscene scenes that made the movie unbearable to watch. When you extracted the explicit scenes and the hour long of glance exchanges, you were left with cheesy pickup lines and quotes from low grade teenage romance books. I had to skip more than half of the movie. If you value yourself and don't want to watch a movie that is appropriate for adult sites more than a renowned movie streaming site, avoid it.

Now first of all how the hell did she end up in empty dark streets after her fight with her boyfriend. Like who in their right mind would do that in a foreign country .After she was kidnapped she didn't scream or cry for help. Tried to open the door and then was like aight I guess this is my new home now. Then she finds pictures of her on the wall , how ? Wasn't he looking for her for years not knowing who she is ?
The day after she was kidnapped, they went shopping ? WHAT ? And she had a blast, tried to ""escape"" looked left and right and ran slowly.
Girl if I was kidnapped I would take off those heels and run for my life even if I don't Know where i'm Going.
Then she wakes up next to her kidnapper, decides to get naked in front of him and take a shower. Then she goes clubbing with him !! Fast forward to the boat scene where she gives him a BJ and BOOM she's in love.
A love story for generations to come ! I laughed so much !
Also what's up with the loud obnoxious music in every sex scene?
Then we have the Ball scene where they brought 2 flamboyant designers to do a makeover (a classic) only to put her in the same plain hairstyle.
Then she goes back to Poland because she's in danger , wears the worst Karen wig to ever exist and goes Clubbing. He comes back telling her he fixed the problem and had a tiny bruise on his body but we don't really know why. Ok...
he meets her parents tells them he's a gangster and that he will treat her in the worst way possible and they just laugh about it . Lol sure !
Then the producers were probably like aight this is wack what should we do now ?! Ummm maybe we should kill her in a princess diana type of way ?! YES ! Genius ! THE END !
No but jokes aside , isn't this hilarious ?! I just can't Believe I watched it !

The woman is kidnapped , claims to want to be set free yet does everything to tease the kidnapper ... these are just some of the main issues I had.

Now for a reviewer who has watched it:It is fun and non-mainstream. A woman is given a choice and has one year to decide. in the meanwhile, the man goes to work suggesting to her what she would be getting if he chose her. She makes a choice.

Also, their are a lot of people that say it is a spin off of 50 Shades of Grey; which even though that is a little true, they are both completey different movies. If you remember, Christian Grey was stalking Anastasia Steele, and even though she went to his home willingly, he forced himself upon her multiple times. In 365 days, even though ""kidnapping"" her was a little over the top, Massimo protected her and would only behave in sexual intercourse if she wanted it; next thing you know Laura is getting married to Massimo with only knowing eachother for 2 months. Their love for eachother is strong near the middle of the movie. He gives her whatever she wants and make sure she is comfortable. If we could read it as a book, it will probably be better, oo course. But for a Polish movie in America, it is pretty durable. Also lets not forget how nice Dominic is to Laura!!!",365 Days

Honestly, characters are pleasant to follow, sceneries are beautiful, nice soundtracks, and i would not complain despite all the logical incompatibilities such as Massimo somehow levitating every time to say his introductory phrase. However, it was physically painfull to watch how they have portrayed a person's reaction to kidnapping.

990,james-hanssen,A Tribute To Human Love,8,12 July 2020,"The great Tomasz Mandes continues to spin out superlative performances from his actors and actresses and has done a very fine job jumping to the big screen here. This is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a Sicilian/Italian mafia, who is so long a part of the domineering culture of the mob that we're somewhat surprised by his sympathetic love for the initially unfortunate Laura, erotically interpreted by Anna Maria Sieklucka which is a new name to me. People are in relationships, for the most part, because they think they belong there. Mafiosos don't normally exude compassion for their intended partners, but Massimo noticed right away that Laura was of different quality. She is a flower who needs to be planted, given the right soil, water, tender care and in a year has a chance to have its rightful place in his garden. Their friendship and sexual relationship cuts across both racial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison conducted by a society so hell-bent on defining what is allowed, what is not allowed and how men and women should always behave, was a magnificent testimony to the bond that grows at the culmination of the year. Mateusz Lasowski as the boyfriend could have been stronger (if he has managed to get Laura), but here he is too weak to deserve a girl with a face and body like Laura's.The great revelation in this film is how love grows and the admission that materialism has a place in the woman's heart. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a keener understanding of a character reviled by a society that wants to tell you how you are allowed to express your love and lust.",365 Days

It's not supposed to be a Hollywood blockbuster so shouldn't be torn apart like this based on that concept. It claims to be an erotic romantic drama and it brings that aspect perfectly. While watching it I was ever so slightly comparing it to 50 shades of grey (like everybody else) but i don't see a resemblence, there was only a healthy amount of domination here but hardly any bdsm and literally no spanking of any kind. I've found no pleasure in watching 50 shades of grey as i didn't get the motivation of the character, there must've been some serious psychological issues uncovered, whereas this maffia boss is just used to being dominant, no mummy issues or the urge to cause pain to any women. And in fact they didn't show any action that could be labelled as a form of agression between the main characters after their affection was shared. Just saying.. So i loved the chemistry and really could relate to this movie, in fact it reminded me of my 20's as i was the same teasing player kind as the female character. Being the obsession of a handsome, powerful and rich man is honestly more of a flattering thing than something toxic - also don't miss the fact the girl has the ultimate power over this man here..",365 Days

If this movie was this good, I can't wait for the books to be published in English. Polish people went all in. Now, it's not exactly like 50 shades, but it's the same principal: cat and mouse game. I know people are confused on why people and women in particular love this movie. It's a fantasy, yes, it's not real, we know that, but that doesn't matter. It's a safe fantasy in our minds because it's in a movie and not real. Michele who plays Mossimo does an amazing job, better than Jamie did with Christian Gray. He fits the role to a tee.As for the ending, this is part of a trilogy. Once people understand that, the ending makes sense. It's not over and I CAN NOT wait for #2.At the end of this day, this movie is not meant to win awards. It's meant to be a feel good movie and it gives millions of women all over the world, the feels and it hits the mark.

The opening scene and ending was the worst parts in my opinion but overall theres not one good piece of acting or direction that was given. i don't know if the director and script writer was high as hell when making the movie because it surely looks like a joke.

I see the same here... She doesn't go along with what she is told, he asks her to teach him to be more gentle, and more importantly he doesn't touch her until SHE says yes, and then yes, yes, God yes! but come on, She really has all the power, he got her away from a horrible situation with a cheater for a ""boyfriend"", and her feelings were clear in that great conversation with her best friend towards the end of the movie. Those sex scenes were HOT and I wish we had more like these to enjoy. Fifty Shades wasn't a worldwide phenomenon because nobody was interested in wanting to watch it... Passionflix has some pretty good movies along this line, but I really miss Rom Coms, but maybe with some HOT scenes incorporated?

1015,MarieLouiseC,"What the hell, Baby girl...",1,2 August 2020,"I must say this is obviously a ""cinematic masterpiece"" that left me speechless, it is so good it's impossible to watch it until the end...I don't even know where to begin: for instance, i would really LOVE to know how on earth is that male character considered good-looking, i must be blind, 'cause to me he's uglier than the devil. And to make things worse, everything about his attitude, language and clothing too, screams cheap, looow standard and all in all a big kitsch. Then there is the female character who seems to be nothing but a pretty face with the willpower of a worm. The whole kidnapping story and the so-called ""process of falling in love"" are a complete bad joke, a stupidity in its purest form, not to mention how dangerous are these ideas of romanticizing kidnapping and making physical violence look sexy. I really fail to understand what can possibly be attractive about a guy who deprives a woman of her LIBERTY, who has zero interest in anthing that she might think/feel, who treats her exclusively like a sexual object and who is physically violent whenever she mimics some sort of resistance, all this while (this is where the good one comes) pretending that HE LOVES HER!!! Where exactly is the ""LOVE"", i don't see it anywhere, i just see mental illness all along.
The worst thing about this film though is that the producers pretend to call it an erotic drama, somehow implying an artistic feeling, emotion etc. contained within the story line. Why not assuming that this has nothing to do with cinematic art, that is just porn and that means it doesn't belong on Netflix?! Most of the content on this streaming platform is obviously not high art, but this doesn't mean it has to turn into a dustbin. It's all about commercial profit, i know, but seriously HOW LOW CAN YOU GO? There's plenty of websites dedicated to porn, does it have to be included everywhere?!

all the bad reviews on here made me do itthis is an erotica movie, and for everyone who reads romance/chicklit books, they are all the same, and this movie is a perfect example of that. even the ending is. it´s a complete open ending, which is completly normal for erotica-chicklit if they knew that there would be more the 1 book.i can understand why in most country's this movie is ranked no 1, this is the kind of movie nobody wants to admit having seen, but they all have
if you think it was sooooooo bad, why did you finish it? if i really don't like a movie i stop watching after 15 minutes.i liked the Massimo and Laura story. the hero in this movie is a real bad boy, which diverts from about 9 out of 10 chicklits/romance books. Anna Maria Sieklucka is a very attractive woman, who acts very decent in this movie, same goes for Michele Morrone.
i also really liked the 3 language story, yes you have to watch it subtitled but atleast it wasn´t synchronised which netflix wants to do alot. that disturbs more than having to read subs.i also see alot of people who compare this movie with the 50 shades movies-books. those were nice, but far from the best ever. i loved them but the best erotica books haven´t made it to the big screen yet. except from 1 bondage scene 365 days has nothing to do with bdsm, but same goes for the 50 shades movies, there is in all the 3 books only 1 sm scene in there, the rest is bondage.so if you want to see a nice erotica movie, with some nude and definitely some fireworks going of between the 2 lead roles then this is a movie to watch.i really hope that there is going to be a sequel made, and knowing how netflix operates that will be done, because it´s ranked no 1in alot of countrys.
so all the haters keep watching this movie, and keep giving it bad reviews, so the ranking on netflix will keep it on no 1, just so they are gonna make atleast 1 sequel.have fun watching it, and hope they make a sequel",365 Days

How did he notice her at the airport? Why did he all of sudden decide to kidnap her after supposedly 5 years since the death of his father, right there, right at that moment? Why didn't he search for her just after his father died? Why did he wait 5 years? What happened in the meanwhile? Why didn't he get up to her right away instead of waiting 5 years?
I have questions for each scene in the movie, but these are some general things that don't seem logical to me..maybe i'm just stupid but whole movie is just one big '?'.

Yes, the women in the movie I think was a little too wild and being dumb and stuff. It's like yeah you got kidnaped shouldn't you be sacred and not tough, you should be sacred and then be tough and not go crazy.
Also the way she just let him do it after the clubbing incident was kind of a disappointment, could of have a more reasonable and romantic way. I guess it's fine.
I also think she fell in love with him a little bit too fast, I mean I guess it typical if I find a hot guy and got kidnaped by him hell yeah I be with him lol.
The love scene was like WOW lol got me hype too.
I'm just so sad at the ending was like that. I thought it gonna be a happy ending and OMG NOOOOO. I'm disappointed. I actually want a sequel to it. Why they gotta end like that i was happy with her wedding and her friend and BANG, NOPE. I'm so sad.

I cannot for the life of me imagine a real mafia boss, or even a half successful man in a normal job or business life wasting his time over a woman like this. It seems like his business stopped, his work stopped, his life stopped when he found this girl. Far removed from reality and a really badly made movie.",365 Days

We live in a world where so many movies are violent, bloody, evil and absolutely disgusting yet they get five stars for all this evil! Yes bring on the love! A Man's ardent love for a woman is refreshing to see. Here you have a woman desperate to be loved with the Passion she deserves and when tall dark extremely handsome man kidnaps her of course she not freaking out! there's an excitement in her gut that she cannot explain. When she finally accepts this mans love for her the magic of this all consuming love is expressed. So what of the flaws. Massimo is mafia Boss! The Don! As a leader, he should have a right hand man that looks the part. Domenico could have just been a secondary capo. Laura is too flat chested and it's off putting but as a woman I'm all eyes on him anyways, he's is so very handsome with a smile to melt all hearts and what a voice! Laura's wardrobe was awful. Her blond hair was not well cut! Details are important.
Overall the aesthetics in the movie should have been much much better... more expense was needed here and much better music! And seriously the sex scene in the flat in Warsaw was performed against a dirty window. What a shame!!
Some sex scenes were rushed in parts but their passion for each other was evident and great to watch. It would have been prudent for them to have made slow love/sex in one of the scenes but hopefully they will do do in the sequel.",365 Days

Since the plot is difficult to start with, then everything relies heavily on the acting to make it believable, however both of the cast does not speak their mother tongue so they are not comfortable enough to perform this and it looks fake in some scenes. Both of cast tried to look and act sexy as most as they can (probably this is director and writer's intention), so their body languages are over the top and all over the place and make me feel cringe to watch all of this lolAnyway, now Michele Morrone (the actor playing Massimo) becomes very famous when his Intasgram reach 2.2 mil followers within a few days (including me lol), so I guess women have their own fantasies and this movie taps right into this. Btw, I think this one is better than 50 shades of grey in some angles, at least sex scenes look more real, both actors like each other, while 50 shades of grey doesnt dare to push sex scenes further, there is no chemistry and they look wooden being together",365 Days

1091,basiuch,Glorification of violence and rape,1,30 July 2020,"It is a terrible movie, with very bad acting, wooden dialogs, characters not displaying any normal human feelings, but on contrary, toxic, narcissistic behaviours. Actors speak with unnatural english accent that feels like it has been practiced very strongly for every scene. There is no plot, no chemistry between actors and the movie theme is fantasy about violence against women and glorification of rape. It made it to the top on Netflix presumably because of lenghty, graphically pornographic sex scenes. It shows multiple acts of violence and sexual assault on women, and them finding it pleasureable. I would say even porn doesn't disempower women in such way. The movie is displaying Polish men and women as shallow, money driven and vulgar and is promoting a toxic image of dominant, violent masculinity as something desire-worthy. There is nothing of positive value in this movie, no artistic experience, no entertainment, no moral lesson. I am ashamed that this movie has been made in Poland and by what values it promotes.",365 Days

1100,jon_navarro,A Blatant Rip Off,1,29 April 2020,"All be in more stylized and fine tuned on its sexual exploration 365 is quite honestly the most blatant rip off of one off cinema's finest directors - Pedro Almodovar's ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down"". The film manages to mask some of this with homages to another erotic drama ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" however it's lack of substance and creative authenticity by part of the director is fully evident. If you're looking to get a quick pull & tug, by all means knock yourself out...but this film by no means manages to add anything new, exciting or imaginative to a genre that is rich with higher quality narratives which have already shown how this type of film should be done. If you'd like to see those, I suggest the following - Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down, Basic Instinct, Body Heat, Fatal Attraction, Single White Female. What mad Almodovar's film unique amongst this group and its predecessors, was his inversion of the gender roles, with the male playing the femme fatal role and the woman playing the unwitting object of their affection. However, in this click bait era of over promising and under delivering this film sits right at home.",365 Days

1104,ciprianhanga,Spoiler alert: it's pretty bad,3,8 April 2020,"I don't remember if I have reviewed another movie so far, but seeing so many 10/10 reviews determined me to log in to write this, to ballance things up a bit.The movie is pretty bad. The plot (if you can call it that) is mostly absurd and the events are cliche and totally predictable (try to remember what somebody did or said in all the bad movies that you ever saw: yes, it's exactly what's going to happen), the events don't make a lot of sense, the dialogue is cringe, the characters are very cartoonish and unbelievable. What they say don't make a lot of sense, and also nobody reacts to events in the way a normal person would do. These are comic book characters, not people. When they try to suggest some of these people are crime lords it's hilarious, you can't help but chuckle. Real mobsters would have these guys for breakfast. Ironically, the fly girls in the movie are actually more believable, because the way they live it is more close to some girls I know.I never saw any of the ""Shades of Gray"" movies, but for a good part it felt like a relative of those movies. The sex scenes are pretty convincing, I'm still unsure if the oral sex was actually simulated or not.The good things I can say about this are (and each gets a star from me):
the photography is pretty good, at least the cinematographer knew what he was doingthe actors are generally pretty easy on the eye, the costumes are also solid, there are nice and diverse locations, hence there is always something appealing to look at on the screenthe sex scenes are pretty good if you're into that kind of thing (I am)Should you see it? Well I don't know, even with the low score that I gave it, I feel like people should make up their own mind and not take someone's else opinion on it. Besides, I think people should watch bad movies from time to time, to be able to understand better why other movies are good, and to be more appreciative of those, as a consequence.So yeah, go watch it, but keep your expectations ridiculously low.",365 Days

Also viewers with specific past traumas should think twice to prevent triggers.... but isn't that the case with every movie?Try to look beyond the basic storyline and appreciate this genre for what it is, it's erotica and it's about time there is more tasteful eye candy like this in this world. I personally am glad that these films are being made. Even when it's met with so much criticism - that is always to be expected because it's one step closer to more fysical, visual and mental freedom.Keep it light. It's a Great movie for a girls night... and not made for heavy discussions. The kidnapping storyline is not new - and often used in other genres. This time it's used for creating intimacy. And there is no force in de ssc - safe / sane and consensual intimate acts that are the basis for the developing relationship. And keep in mind there are a lot of fantasies about being whisked away by a handsome stranger who lives in the lap of luxury and who wants to woo his love intrest. And that is wat this is - a fantasy... wich you are watching as a voyeur.
Real life is cruel enough, so these fantasies story's have a place to exist on it own as guilty pleasures.About the critics... in the horror genre are more shocking visuals and worse storylines. But everyone knows what they are going to watch.
So is it with this story. Don't hate what you can expect is coming.
The haters don't appreciate the effort en artistry that has been put in this movie. And that is the only valid parallel with 50 Shades - what had a virgin and a beautiful control freak. This is about a handsome bad boy and a strong girl. So I prefer this storyline more...",365 Days

The plot is not the best, but it is enjoyable and it is shown from her point of view, so she doesn't know too much or doesn't see everything that's going on, or doesn't understand all that's happening, so you will be in the same position as her. You'll see the movie through her eyes!
Of course those who speak ""perfect"" English might criticise the actors' language and/or accent, but for me it added originality to the movie as English is not my first language, and I happen to know how immigrants speak and behave in a foreign country, which is close to the movie's choice of English words and expressions.
A great percentage of those who's English is not their first language would have spoken at some point, a bad English, but this is normal and we should be more understanding and have some empathy.
I would love to see those who complain about the bad English, to try and speak the actors first language. I bet they'll speak it perfectly.
Overall, I watched this movie a few times. Soundtracks are catchy, They're both strong, but vulnerable as well, and passionate characters. Plus their acting is quite good, not perfect, but I never expect perfect. Perfect is boring.",365 Days

For me, there could have been even more sex scenes, and more explicit at that. But those scenes better show something new and not be so utterly boring like the sex scenes in this movie.The worst part is that the main actress is displayed as some kind of voluntary victim throughout the biggest portion of this waste of time. Always the same old fashioned stereotype. As if a hurtful deep throat would be the most satisfying thing on earth for women. Only the last half hour of this movie is a little different and something more like a regular Telenovela (still not watch-worthy).No honest person who has seen this can say it was good in any way. As for the women in some other reviews who appear to actually have some fantasy of a good looking, but aggressive and incompetent mafia loverboy abducting her and forcing her to be his because she is so good looking, well... grow up and live your own life, that will be so much more satisfying.",365 Days

But this? This is totally on another level. The acting is so unconvincing, and superficial. The plot is non-existent, and worse than a soap opera. Camera angles and cinematography is ordinary, and can't highlight nothing through visual imagery only. It is so dumb, and dull, and painful to understand even a minimal action. Not even 5 minutes back-to-back can't put something convincing, like there is actually some artistic involvement into the making of this movie.

1216,maria63303,Sad Excuse for a Movie,2,20 April 2020,"I watched the original language fil with English subtitles and found this to be a very poorly done movie. While there were parts of the plot that had potential, the author/director never fleshed them out. While both the male and female lead actors are good looking, there was very little romance developed between them; they had nothing in common and didn't work at having anything in common. They did have a lot of sex, which was ok but they really had nothing else. There were a lot of holes in the plot - why did it take him so long to find this woman? Why did he have to kidnap her? Why dies he kill some of the people and then blame her for it? And why does she accept his sadistic behavior that puts her in physical danger?",365 Days

1218,wphillipspa,Some people need to learn to read,7,28 June 2020,"Ok I've read a lot of the negsuve reviews and the lost important thing I have to say is this:
You knew exactly what this movie was about when you read the description. It literally says ""abducted, kidnapped""
Now I will agree with the plot issues, there are so many holes in it, but maybe thats how it's supposed to be. In my opinion, I want a fuller story. We never actually find out a lot of things, and they make introductions of characters and then never backtrack to them or include them anywhere.
Another thing I saw was someone complained about how the English was barely understood here. From my point of view, if someone does not speak English as a first language, they don't usually speak it correctly. Nowhere did it say or even hint that these characters were well versed in English, and I think it adds to the plot and their character that they don't speak it perfectly.Overall, I am pleased with this but I would loooove to watch the same movie with more detail, or a sequel or something.",365 Days

You don't smile on the first day you are kidnapped, you just don't! And I wanted to see more of her trying to escape. I did enjoy however her teasing and defying him, and his brutal response when he grabs her by the neck was beautifully done.

1242,Emersonian83,Enjoyment V.S. Quality,3,17 June 2020,"You know, it's actually fine to say ""this was trashy, but I was entertained"". There seems to be some epidemic today where people are so lacking in humility that they take the position that if they like something, it must be good. Anyone rating this film 10/10, a score that the finest cinematic masterpieces ever created don't even have, either doesn't know anything about movies or suffers from this lack of humility. Hiding behind the concept of art being subjective doesn't render all things equal. Theoretically, one could say Fergie is a better singer than Whitney Houston, or McDonald's is better than a meal in a 5-star restaurant. It's a subjective opinion, after all and furthermore, yes, people are entitled to such opinions. But they aren't credible opinions.There isn't one marker of quality that is associated with quality film-making. There is really no story, just a premise and a series of plot contrivances to manufacture drama. Our female lead Laura is abducted, and held against her will by a Massimo; a violent criminal, whose family does business with sex traffickers. He promises he'll never her touch her until she agrees to let him suggesting a kind of duality in the form of a principled monster often seen in gangster films (which would actually have been interesting), but this falls by the wayside when he still manages to threaten to rape her several times, and sexually assaults her once while she is bound to an airplane seat. For her part, Laura says she hates him and will never love him; they don't foreshadow that she is slowly being worn down from this stance and is falling for him in spite of herself (which again would have been too complex and interesting), so she just changes her mind virtually overnight when he rescues her after she falls off a boat, which she fell in the first place because she was struggling with her captor/abuser. At this point the conflict in the story is just removed---so much so they resort to a jealous ex-GF character, barely seen till now, to restore any sense of danger. On an authorized trip back to Poland, she ignores everyone sane; her ex she sees in a club, her best friend who tells her she's insane for wanting to stay. Then they get engaged, conceive a child only she knows about and then she dies in a tunnel, off camera. So much for a character arc; she never gets to her moment of realization of what's been done to her.Aside from story problems and a lack of character development, this film is also hard to listen to. Awful dialogue unfit for a teen drama makes everything even less credible than it already is, and the score is horrendous garbage only a 13-year old would listen to. The acting? Well, they don't have much to work with so it's hard to blame them but they never approach anything vaguely resembling A human moment the audience can invest in, and that includes the sex scenes. Massimo never shows any remorse or grows as a character in any way and the actor doesn't have the range to add much humanity, even when he cries he seems insincere.3 stars out 10 for being beautifully shot, but that is the sole admirable feature of this movie.It sucks. Just admit it. It was your happy meal, your Fergie record. Enjoy it but don't make a foot of yourself denying that it's too bad.",365 Days

As for people saying they had nothing in common not all relationships in real life have things in common. Some relationships like the role play of the man taking control of them.

The filming is nice, it creates a kind of perfect imperfect World where all the characters that are important and you are supposed to like, looks Beautiful and glamorous. It is the only two good things that I found seeing short bits of the Movie, because I acctually did not want to waste time on a Movie with such a bad plot and what I later saw, shallow characters..I was at home and thought that I wanted to look at a movie when i saw that this title was on the top ten list in Sweden, and of course I became curious. I did not look at the whole Movie, because I understood when I read about it that it was not a Movie that I wanted to lay that much time on, but I decided to look at bits of it out of curiosity.I can undertand why people would like to look at this stuff, because I do it myself, but that does not mean I like it. I hate myself for being curioUs about this kind of movies and being willing to waste time on them. They also make me mad so that is why I felt obligated to write this Review and get my feelings out.I can not understand how this Movie is out on Netflix and in the top ten list in my country! I really hope that most of the views comes from similar reasons to mine. After the Me Too movement and in a society where women still are vunarable this Movie really makes me angry. 365 DNI glorifies in my opinion a very diturbing way to look at love and relationships especially romance between women and men.",365 Days

Could it have been a good movie if effort have been put in it?

1318,bavariandas,Glamorizing violence against women,1,6 July 2020,"It's an appalling thing that a movie like 365 days actually exists. The movie romanticizes torture, sexual abuse and subjugation of women blatantly. It promotes the idea that if a man has good looks and enough money and power he can do whatever he wants with any random woman.
The movie portrays an Italian gangster falling in love with a Polish woman. He decides to abduct her and keep her hostage. Yaa, you've read it right. According to the movie's creators, that's what you do to a woman you fall in love with. He tells her that she'll be kept captive for an year and she will have 365 days to fall in love with him. As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more disturbing and horrifying.
