0,grantss,Interesting war drama,7,16 October 2021,"September 1944. The Allies have captured the port of Antwerp but the Germans still control the Scheldt estuary, preventing supplies reaching Antwerp and the Allied forces. Walcheren Island is key to the German's defence. Operation Market Garden is launched, hoping to penetrate directly into Germany via Arnhem in Holland. A glider from this operation is forced to crash land on Walcheren, leaving a handful of British troops trapped behind enemy lines. Meanwhile a Dutch teenager accidentally kills three Germans, causing a tragic chain of events. On the German staff is a Dutch soldier who now starts to question where his loyalties lie.An interesting war drama. Covers a lesser-known campaign of WW2, the battles for the Scheldt Estuary (and the Battle of Walcheren in particular) and does so in reasonably entertaining and engaging fashion. A decent enough plot, covering the battle from many sides, with some good action scenes and CGI.Not brilliant though. The plot is a bit clumsy at times and some aspects seem dumbed-down. The focus of the film is also at a micro level so you don't much information on the bigger picture and the effort involved in the opening up of the Scheldt estuary. While the civilian aspect was interesting much of the time taken on it could have been better spent.",The Forgotten Battle
1,eddie_baggins,A well made Netflix war film,7,8 November 2021,"One of the most expensive Dutch films ever produced and streaming kingpin Netflix's first originally produced film from the Netherlands, The Forgotten Battle is the perfect type of film for the company to support as well as being one of the most well put together war films in their catalogue.Directed by native Dutchman Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. (whose dabbled in Hollywood efforts like the The Thing), Battle tells the story of the not overly well-known World War 2 battle of Schelde in which allied forces took it to a bare-bones but determined Nazi army that was hellbent on stopping the allied march across Europe capturing ports and cities on their way into the Nazi occupied heartlands.Splitting the film up into three separate stories that all combine into one cohesive narrative structure, Battle follows Gijs Blom's young Dutch German soldier Marinus who has been sent back to his home country to take part in the fight, Jamie Flatter's newbie British pilot William who has along with his squad been shot down over enemy lines and battling to get back to allied forces and Susan Radder's Walcheren Island native Teuntje who is trying her best to rescue her brother from the clutches of Nazi soldiers.Offering a wide ranging scope by telling his story this way, Heijningen Jr's film isn't your typical war film that is all battles and brothers and while it has plenty of in your face battlefront carnage and cat and mouse games of life and death, the film provides a neatly observed different lens on the World War 2 front with it far removed from the more Hollywoodized war films that can find themselves front and centre in the genre on regular occasions.Working with a budget that while significant is still merely catering for big time productions, Heijningen Jr wrings every last dollar out of his films coffers to ensure that Battle feels like a more prestigious than usual Netflix mid-tier release and while it may not offer the big emotional pay-offs or gravitas to make it a must-watch, Battle showcases to viewers and to Netflix as a company the exact type of films it should be investing in when its not throwing 100's of millions of dollars at releases like The Irishman, 6 Underground and the upcoming Red Notice.Far from a classic World War 2 tale, battle is still high quality war time drama that offers a firsthand look at a largely unspoken about component of the Market Garden operation.Final Say -The Forgotten Battle is an above average Netflix release that has rightfully proved to be a decent sized hit for the streaming company and should be sought after by anyone seeking out a quality World War 2 offering (or a chance to see Draco Malfoy battle Nazis).3 1/2 biscuit tins out of 5.",The Forgotten Battle
2,Red-125,"Powerful, complex war movie",8,29 October 2021,"De slag om de Schelde (2020) is a Dutch movie co-written and directed by
Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. It was shown in the U. S. with the title ""The Forgotten Battle."" The actual title translates as ""The Battle of the Scheldt."" We in the U. S. may never have heard of it. That's because Canadian troops bore the brunt of the battle against the Germans. I'm sure it's not a forgotten battle in Canada or Holland.Gijs Blom portrays Marinus van Staveren, a Dutch citizen who is fighting on the side of the Germans. He hates Jews--and probably Communists--so he volunteered to fight in the German army. When the movie opens, he's fighting on the Russian front, but he gets transferred to Holland.Jamie Flatters plays William Sinclair. He's a British glider pilot, but his glider is shot down and he lands in Holland.Susan Radder plays Teuntje Visser, a Dutch woman who works in the mayor's office. Jan Bijvoet portrays her father--Doctor Visser--who treats Germans and Dutch equally well.The complexity of the movie is the interaction among these people, as the Canadian forces try to overcome the German forces in the area called
The Scheldt. (I checked, and it really was important for the allies to possess the region, and equally important for the Germans to prevent this.)Of course, in a war movie, there's going to be blood and carnage. However, what keeps this film from being just another WWII movie is the complicated plot, that goes in directions you may not expect.De slag om de Schelde has a pretty weak IMDb rating of 7.1. I thought it was better than that, and rated it 8.",The Forgotten Battle
3,wandernn1-81-683274,Shocking Surprise Of A WW2 Movie Especially For 2021.,8,15 October 2021,Wow. I was very surprised by this movie. This is the best movie I have seen about WW2 in a very long time. It really might rank up there with some of the best war movies.The odd thing is there are so many characters so they really had to crunch for time to develop the characters in the space of two hours. With the various battle sequences along the way.I just finished watching it and I'm still a bit shocked at how it got to me. Very Good Movie. 8/10.,The Forgotten Battle
4,Turfseer,Gripping Dutch chronicle of German-occupied Netherlands and little known World War II battle,9,8 November 2021,"Caught this on Netflix and glad I did. It's an unusual World War II story set in Zeeland, the westernmost and least populous province in the Netherlands. The time is September 1944 just after the Allied D-Day invasion in June of that year. Large parts of the area are below sea level and the flooding of the main town plays a big part in the narrative.The Forgotten Battle focuses on three principal characters in separate stories which converge at film's end. The first story concerns Teun (Susan Radder), who works in the Nazi-collaborator mayor's office, daughter of a medical doctor who cooperates with the German occupiers but is clearly wary of them. Teun's teenage brother Dirk-a member of the Dutch resistance--gets himself into big trouble during what turns out to be an aborted German army retreat-throwing a rock through the windshield of a truck causing an accident in which three German soldiers are killed after losing his temper following one of the soldiers stomping on and destroying his camera.The tension escalates when the Germans return to the town and hunt him down-he subsequently gives himself up and despite efforts by his father to save him, is eventually tortured and executed by the Germans.The second story revolves around Marinus van Staveren, a Dutch volunteer in the Waffen-SS. When we first meet him he witnesses the brutal death of one of his friends on one of the battlegrounds of the Russian front where he is wounded. A superior (now an amputee) arranges for Marinus to be transferred to the office of Commandant Oberst Berghof (Justus von Dohnanyi), head of the German occupation in Zeeland.Marinus, a committed Nazi, gradually becomes disillusioned with their heavy-handed policies when Berghof lies to Dirk's father that he will be sentenced to life instead of receiving the death penalty. Bergdorf coincidentally observes Marinus speaking with Teun on the street and orders him to participate in Dirk's execution by firing squad. He then immediately loses his desk job and ordered into combat action against advancing Canadian troops.The third story focuses on British Glider pilot William Sinclair (Jamie Flatters) whose father is a high-ranking Army officer. William disobeys his father's orders that he's not ready for combat and joins a crew of four other men in Operation Market Garden, the Allied Military operation which ends up in the Battle of the Walcheren Causeway, the forgotten battle alluded to in the title.In the most exciting scene in the film, Sinclair's glider is hit by anti-aircraft fire and they crash into a flooded estuary. The squadron's leader is badly wounded and is carried by the other four on a stretcher. They attempt to make their way to the Canadian lines but along the way two of the men desert. There is an extremely harrowing scene in which they kill two German soldiers inside a flooded house in the town-only to have their leader mortally wounded as he's held hostage by one of the Germans.Teun along with a Resistance Fighter Janna (Marthe Schneider) attempt to bring a map with the German's exact location to the Canadians but Teun is captured and Janna badly wounded. It's all quite gripping with Janna getting the critical information to the Canadian forces only to expire shortly after arrival.The denouement works perfectly with Marinus and William meeting up on the battlefield and opting not to kill one another in the thick of battle. Marinus saves Teun from either being killed or raped (or both) by a fellow soldier but is stabbed to death while killing his adversary in the process.The fight against tyranny and the sacrifices involved in such efforts is the theme of the film. This is by no means a character study but an extremely well-plotted war story thriller. All the performances are gripping and we get to learn an important lesson in a virtually unknown chapter in World War II military history.",The Forgotten Battle
5,valleyjohn,A cracking war movie,8,29 October 2021,"You would think by now that there wasn't any more stories to be told about the Second World War as it has been extensively covered in film over the last 70 years but no , they keep being made and if The Forgotten Battle is anything to go by , thank god for that .1944, the Second World War. A British glider pilot, a Dutch boy fighting on the German side and a Dutch female resistance member all end up involved in the Battle of the Schelde. Their choices differ, but their goal is the same: freedom.This is a Dutch made film that looks like it was made with a massive budget but I was shocked to read that it only cost fourteen million euros to make because it's looks and sounds like it cost five times that amount and credit must go to the Director for that .The story is about three different young people , all involved in the same conflict but from different perspectives. It's not told in a Rashomon style but more in a Crash Style and it's handled very well . The acting is spot on and you really do feel engaged with the characters.The special affects are great and some of the war scenes are quite graphic. I also loved the sound . Sometimes war films can sound a bit relentless but this is nothing of the sort .I'm guessing , thanks to Covid , this is a film that went under the Radar but if you have Netflix, I can highly recommend it .",The Forgotten Battle
6,qui_j,Fails to engage,2,1 November 2021,"This movie is really badly produced. The sets are wonderful , but the way the story is told is too confusing to engage viewers at a global level. The scenes appear to be randomly stuck together, almost as if they were tossed in the air, then reconnected in the hope that a story will emerge. It does not! After the first 20 minutes, and with the movie providing no sense of direction, it was best to not continue. The acting is also very second rate!",The Forgotten Battle
7,btreakle,Ww2,8,19 October 2021,Loved this movie based on a true story from ww2 in the Netherlands.This really humanized the horror of war and the sub stories of the battles.I highly recommend this film.,The Forgotten Battle
8,Holt344,"The Forgotten Battle shows the horrors of war perfectly and is overall a great war film with stunning visuals, but the pacing could have been better",9,15 October 2021,"The Forgotten Battle is a World War II film directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. And written by Paula van der Oest. The film follows a British glider pilot, a Dutch boy fighting on the German side and a Dutch female resistance member who all end up involved in the Battle of the Scheldt that was fought in 1944. Their choices differ, but their goal is the same: freedom. We get to see the battle through these three perspectives, this storytelling is similar to what Christopher Nolan did with Dunkirk. But the similarities kind of ends there, the screenplay is flawed but it's mostly quite great. Where the film succeeds is the cinematography and direction, it's visually a very pleasing movie. It shows how it's become one of the most expensive Dutch films. I thought the film would focus mainly on the battle but I was wrong, it's about the people that the battle and war is affecting, a more human story which I'm totally behind. So it's more character driven than action heavy, but it's of course a war movie and that's shown brilliantly with imagery you'll continue to remember. But with it being focused on three perspectives, the pacing gets worse and it makes the film feel dragged out, story especially as events take too long of a time to build up. Maybe a shorter run time would have helped the film or a different screenplay that focused on mainly two perspectives, the Allies and Axis. But I'll admit that the story arc regarding Teuntje Visser is worthy to be told as it goes hand in hand with Marinus van Staveren's own character arc which is probably the film's best.The acting in this film was terrific and full of emotion and authenticity. The cast has Gijs Blom as Marinus van Staveren, Jamie Flatters as William Sinclair, Susan Radder as Teuntje Visser and Tom Felton as Tony Turner. Felton being the only actor I recognized who was great in this, but the unknown cast is because how it's a Dutch production which makes The Forgotten Battle even more authentic. I can only give praise to the cast's performances, from the leads to supporting cast to guest stars. Everyone did a terrific job.Though I did say the script was kind of flawed, there's no lie that Paula van der Oest can write characters and dialogue well. It's where the script is positive, the ability to humanize the German soldiers which often become black and white. With help of the director and actors, the characters are superbly done. The sound design and musical score is brilliant. An
average Dutch feature film at the time contained about 500-600 separate audio tracks, while this film has well over 1700. It says something about the production, and some sounds were even arranged by Charles Maynes who did the sound for Clint Eastwood's WW2 film, Letters from Iwo Jima. It's truly award worthy work. Something else that was great is of course the makeup and costume department. The sets, production and art design. Honestly the whole production is impressive. What made me truly love the film was the final 30 minutes or so when all the build up comes together and the big battle is shown, it's everything a battle on this grand scale should be. Chaotic, immersive, engaging and simply just real. It was filmed and edited similarly to the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan which made us feel that we were in the character's shoes in the battle and I felt the same way in this sequence, honestly the entire movie.The Forgotten Battle isn't meant to romanize war, it shows the horrors of war on all three sides. The Allies, Axis and civilians. It does it perfectly. If it would have shown more of the battle, locations and such, and had a better script and pacing, I would have found the film to be brilliant. With the beautiful cinematography and everything on the technical side being top notch, I can only say that it's great. Solid 9/10 but not a masterpiece.",The Forgotten Battle
9,djurrepower,common,6,15 October 2021,"Although non american war movies are always interesting for the different perspectives on the war. This movie doesn't really offer anything original.

11,DLochner,The Dutch James Ryan,7,17 October 2021,"Visually impressive war film with a convincing and gloomy atmosphere. It was interesting that, like Quentin Tarantino already demonstrated, the warring parties spoke and were subtitled in their respective national language - however, the German was terrible and since this language was the only one that was not subtitled, the dialogues in German were largely incomprehensible. All in all worth seeing, but many war films have done a lot better before this one. It is ultimately the attempt of a Dutch James Ryan, unfortunately without success.",The Forgotten Battle
12,AJ_McAninch,Excellent except for the pacing,8,29 October 2021,"It's really a fine WW2 film with a strong cast, sensitive treatment of themes, and great cinematography.

14,movieman6-413-929510,Unknown Dutch war history is still unclear due to the wrong narrative.,5,6 June 2021,"The Battle of the Scheldt is a new war drama directed and partly written by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. He is known for directing Red Rain and The Thing from 2011.The film is set in the province of Zeeland in November 1944. Here the Allies try to liberate the Netherlands from Nazi Germany with the help of the Dutch resistance. The battle on the Zeeland islands is difficult for both parties. The Zeeland girl Teun (Susan Radder) discovers that her brother has secret information that can help the resistance in the fight against the Nazis. Getting this info to the resistance seems like a difficult task, because she doesn't know who to trust in this war. In this war, the Dutch Briton William Sinclair (Jamie Flatters) and the Nazi oppressed Marinus van Staveren (Gijs Blom) fight against each other. The different choices these three youngsters make can lead to freedom in Zeeland, or to the loss of the Battle of the Scheldt.This film is the first Dutch film produced by Netflix. For example, it has become the second most expensive Dutch film to date with a budget of 14 million. The most expensive Dutch film remains the war film Zwartboek by director Paul Verhoeven.The story of the film was written by Paula van der Oest, who had help from five others. The final story has also been checked and adapted by ancient military personnel, to ensure that the story contains correct information. The writers have chosen to turn the film into a mosaic film. Thus, the storylines of the three young people are mixed up. The different stories are mixed up a lot. It sometimes seems as if you are watching three different films at the same time. By telling the film in such a way, the film loses some of its pace and the film can sometimes become a bit difficult to follow. For a clearer story, they should have made the film about one of the three young people, or Netflix should have made a TV series of the Battle of the Scheldt.The story surrounding the Battle of the Scheldt contains important and more unknown information, which the Allies needed in their fight against Nazi Germany. Despite the importance of this story, the events of the Battle of the Scheldt are still more overshadowed by larger World War II events in the Netherlands such as the Battle of Arnhem or the Hunger Winter.Netflix and the film crew could also have chosen a better director such as Paul Verhoeven, because he has more experience directing an expensive war film. Director Matthijs van Heijningen has not directed a cinema film for ten years since the prequel to The Thing from 2011. Matthijs van Heijningen often portrays the film well, but more closely with the scenes of Susan Radder's character. Her scenes are more like a war espionage movie. The scenes of the male protagonists are more set in the real war, but here the director chooses to zoom in on the main character. This makes the war scenes a bit unclear, because you only get to see what the main character is doing and not the rest of his army. The further war scenes are well portrayed, only they look a bit familiar compared to other war films such as Saving Private Ryan or Zwartboek.The acting is well done by the film crew, but by choosing to tell the film as a mosaic film, the actors don't get the time to really develop their characters. Susan Radder is most prominent in the film. International actor Tom Felton known for his role as Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter film series also stars in this film. Despite the fact that he portrays his role well, he does not get much else to do with his role.",The Forgotten Battle
15,byron-116,Well done war movie,7,17 October 2021,Very good WWII film with believable battle scenes. The film keeps you on edge throughout its 2+ hours. The Forgotten Battle is the best war movie in years.,The Forgotten Battle
16,Impman2,Wow,10,17 October 2021,"Excellent WW2 film. One of the best I've seen. Nicely demonstrating some of the complexities of that war.Love Hollywood as I do it's portrayal of WW2 often gives the impression that just 3 nationalities took part ie Americans, Germans and Japanese.It's films like this that offer a much needed balance.",The Forgotten Battle
17,JurijFedorov,Very similar to Dunkirk and 1917 in style and quality - and same feeling of emptiness and lack of focus,7,27 October 2021,"The movie is a proper 7,5/10 movie. It's not a great or fantastic story about heroes or some huge battle or mission. Rather it's just a bunch of events taking place in a historical setting with no hero or protagonist. But it is historically very strong, the acting is great, and the sets are believable.You do feel like it's a WW2 setting in Holland as everything is wet, broken and old. The camera is calm and clear and even the ages of the actors are for once proper and not some 35 year old famous actors running around playing fake war. So if you want a WW2 setting and historical focus this is it. It does suffer from the same stuff Dunkirk and 1917 suffer from. It feels empty and pointless at times. While we always move towards a goal the goal is seldom clear and new goals appear out of nowhere coming from the top down as they do in the military. The movie is about 3 young people on different sides of the war all struggling with the war, death around them, things going wrong, and moral problems. But even these 3 leads are just menial workers. They don't have any power, they don't have any control, they are bossed around, they are not that proactive, and they just seem to either get lucky or unlucky depending on what other people around them do. It can be extremely frustrating to see a full plot play out IN FRONT of these people without them doing anything. There is a very important scene where one of the leads just sits on a chair staring at a small personal event happening in front of him that changes the tide of the battle over the town. A crucial event created by characters we haven't even seen before. Even though the lead is in the very room and could have done all of this himself! Which is just weird. In movies the protagonist has a goal and plan. He acts and changes things around him. Here you get extremely frustrated as they in most events do nothing or at most just ""feel"" what is happening. I think the script writer doesn't quite understand that a soldier just looking sad and depressed as he stares at an important exchange of information doesn't really create a fulfilling story. The movie is also wet, cold, dark and moody. So there are no great personal relationships or jokes as you would see in any real military unit. They are kinda just experiencing their own personal hell on Earth. There are no friend groups, no emotional connections as such, no care or love besides in a few scenes. I would have liked for main characters to meet and develop some deeper connection. But there is nothing here. It has a hollow feeling and you feel like everyone just does nothing half the time. This is how real wars happen. But it's not a strong story.If you loved Dunkirk and 1917 you will love this too for sure. It's a good movie. For me it just lacked that final bit of emotional realism. We never really saw real and full humans. We just saw a A LOT of crying, whining, complaining and sad faces and seldom any shared sadness. Rather it's just people staring at sad events. Which makes sense for a realistic history movie, but it still lacks depth. Band of Brothers did pull off a realistic setting with jokes and friends hanging out at times. So I'm not sure why seemingly basically no modern war movie comes close to that. I think we are in a period of hyper realism in this genre and it doesn't always work. But it's nice to experience a single time.",The Forgotten Battle

19,douglasmcbroom,Mostly Mediocre,5,21 October 2021,"This is a human interest story set against the backdrop of Operation Market Garden in the Fall of 1944, in Holland. This was Field Marshall Montgomery's titanic screw-up based on his ego and a catastrophic underestimate of the retreating German Army's capabilities. If you want to see a good film on this subject watch 'A Bridge Too Far' or 'Band Of Brothers.'This film suffers from sub-par acting and from trying too hard to intersect its principle players. The sound is excellent. The battle scenes are well-staged. But, the film sort of lags along and due to the poor performances, the characters don't drag you in and hold your attention. Also, the music choices are ridiculous.Now, you will read some 8, 9 and 10 star reviews, but you can bet they are Netflix paid reviewers.",The Forgotten Battle
20,peterrichboy,Action packed WW2 movie,8,26 October 2021,For once it is great to see a war film that doesn't show America winning the war. We have a story of the Dutch resistance a British glider pilot and a German soldier wrestling with his own conscience.I was previously unaware of this brutal battle to capture Antwerp and ultimately liberate the Netherlands. And whilst this film may not contain any major stars all the cast involved put in first class performances. The action scenes at times are really breathtaking and horrific in equal measure and the CGI used to show the air raid using gliders as the allies cross the channel to the lowlands are very well done indeed.If you're a fan of war movies like me and you think you've seen it all I would really recommend this film. 8/10.,The Forgotten Battle

22,dcarroll74,Bloody Brilliant,10,20 October 2021,"I don't have much to say but, owing to the bare minimum required to make a post, I shall waffle on for a little bit.The wonder of this movie was, while it focused on a main battle in WWII, the perspective was from the ""little"" people, those whom we're aware of but, forget about. The people who were in the various restance movements.Most of us have seen the blockbusters from the 60's to now, regarding all the major battle in various wars. It is refreshing albeit terrible, to relive some of these battles, through the eyes of those who actually lived through them.The viewer is lucky, never having to take up arms. Those who did, and died, didn't. And I speak for all sides.",The Forgotten Battle

24,paaskynen,A positive surprise,8,15 October 2021,"Having seen a number of Dutch Second World War films, If have to say, I was positively surprised as to how close this film aimed to come to actual situations on the ground.

25,rich7354,I was expecting a war movie,5,18 October 2021,"Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed to find out this was really an attempt at a character study (and not a very good one, at that), rather than a bona fide war movie.The movie starts well enough; I particularly enjoyed it when the Dutchman turned German soldier took out the T34 with a panzerfaust. On the whole, however, and with the exception of the ending battle scene (which lasted 15 - 20 minutes), there wasn't much war action in this ""war movie"". Instead, what we got were the mostly mundane stories of three individuals during the battle of the Scheldt.I also found several things particularly irksome:An SS lieutenant is able to make a simple phone call to get his newly found friend transferred from the Russian front to a cushy desk job in the Netherlands.Glider destined for Arnhem is only carrying two pilots and three soldiers; efficient use of equipment there.Highly trained and combat ready British paratroopers desert without any real provocation.British paratrooper who crash lands behind enemy lines makes his way back to where the Canadians are readying for an attack. He is immediately drafted into the Canadian army and participates in the assault.Dutch dad convinces his son to turn himself in for throwing a rock at a German truck, because he knows he can strike a deal with the German commander. Hmmm, hey dad, where have you been for the last four years of Nazi occupation?Models of Lee Enfield rifles carried by soldiers change from scene to scene.88mm flak gun which has been in a defensive position for weeks has to be re-aimed once the Canadian advance begins. Apparently, they forgot to aim it at the causeway (the only place from which an attack can come) when they dug it in.Machine gun belt feeder switches from right side to left side from scene to scene.I could go on, but I might never finish this review.Bottom line. The movie was almost OK, but just couldn't get there.",The Forgotten Battle
26,johnharapa,SIMPLY AWESOME !!!,10,16 October 2021,"One of the best war movies I've ever seen.Acting is exquisite, masterful handling of emotion scenes, very VERY authentic.Hardly comparable to Hollywood style actor hams. Cinematography is also impeccable, direction splendid quite sublime.I particularly like that the direction of the movie has focused on characters, how key roles are somewhat all intertwined.Seriously.......JUST WATCH IT !!!!!",The Forgotten Battle
27,hypersonic8999,Enjoyable but mediocre,5,24 October 2021,"When it comes to WW2 movies, I've probably seen most of them. Not just Hollywood, but Russian, British, Italian, German, French, Dutch, Australian, Chinese, Greek, etc.This one is nothing to write home about. You can have a good time for the 2 hours it lasts, although it's a bit too drawn-out. By the end of it, you'll forget what it's all about.The story never really draws you in. The 3 storylines are too far apart from each other, and the jumps between them never really give you the time to immerse yourself in the story or get to know the characters. The way the film is edited also ruins pacing. Things take quite a while to resolve themselves, and by the time they do, you have either forgotten about them or got caught up in other things. As a result, there's barely any emotional impact on the audience.The plot doesn't give the characters enough depth. As a result the performances come across as a bit wooden, even though the actors seem competent enough to pull off a major production like this.The story doesn't do anything really original, and doesn't do enough to be apart from other ""serendipity"" kind of films or films about German occupation. Frankly, I caught myself often thinking back on Black Book (an excellent Dutch WW2 resistance film) and comparing it to this one. Black Book is superior by far.The film is just too long and too slow for its own good. And I'm not talking about lack of action. You can have good war films with barely any action in them. The problem is that the weaknesses I mentioned become more apparent the longer a film is. If this film was 30-40 minutes shorter, it would have a more compact and better paced story, the vision and the premise would have been given a better chance to shine, and it would have been a lot fairer to the actors' talents.The director, editor and screenwriter all fail to deliver suspense where it was needed. There's many scenes where characters are about to die and the film might as well have been describing the weather.In fact, if I was in charge of this, I would have cut the glider pilot's storyline out all together. It's completely irrelevant to the other 2 stories and it leads nowhere beyond a minor tie-in at the end. The ending could have easily been the same without this entire storyline. The storyline itself has an interesting premise. It would have served the entire project, if it was instead turned into a separate film. As it is, it serves no purpose to the plot of this film.Summary: Decent acting, average direction, a plot with pacing issues and shallow characters but otherwise OK, subpar editing. I don't know where all these 8, 9 and 10 reviews are coming from. It's watchable, even enjoyable, but doesn't really rise above mediocrity.",The Forgotten Battle
28,JabezGill,"Above average, but would have been much better as a mini-series",6,17 October 2021,"This is a very interesting historical story - the movie on the other hand was decent but was honestly lethargic while simultaneously leaving you with the feeling that the overall story, along with character arches, was rushed.I think if they would have turned this into a 3 to 6 episode mini-series it could have been great.It is absolutely worth the watch, especially if you enjoy this time period in history. However, it isn't something you'd want to watch again and again (like a band of brothers)",The Forgotten Battle
29,briscouver,Good movie,7,31 October 2021,It was interesting to see another side of the war told by a country other than the US. I like that this told the version of the people waiting for the allied forces to show up rather than just the push to catch the Germans. I also liked how the Canadians were featured in this very important battle. I would also recommend Paschendale as a Great War movie told from a Canadian perspective.Overall I liked it and I had never heard of this battle but have now done a deep dive into this.Worth the watch.,The Forgotten Battle
30,frank-liesenborgs,Literally blown away!,9,31 October 2021,"""De Slag Om De Schelde"" is based on real events. Funny enough I am born in Belgium, nearby Antwerp, and I was not even aware of this important part in our history until I watched this movie. ""De Slag Om De Schelde"" is a very impressive and emotionally insightful masterpiece. It is that simple. I was blown away with the story, the acting and most of the filming felt like you were actually present on the scene. The story centres on three leads: a Dutch Axis soldier, Marinus (Gijs Blom), a British Allied pilot, William (Jamie Flatters) and a woman ending up in the resistance, Teuntje (Susan Radder) from Zeeland. It also describes the Allies taking control of the river ""De Schelde"".There are plenty of suspenseful sequences where we are constantly fearing for the characters' lives. Performances are rock-solid with particular standouts of the three leads (Teuntje, William and Marinus). Their storylines become closely connected and all give incredibly authentic performances. This movie is one piece of art, from the well-constructed set to the making of the uniforms. I hope we can see more from director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.Extraordinary, unforgettable, intense and remarkable movie. I strongly recommend to watch this piece of art.",The Forgotten Battle
31,david-546,Riveting war film,9,24 October 2021,"The Battle of the Scheldt was was a series of operations led by the First Canadian army in October/November 1944 in both the Netherlands and Belgium to take the port of Antwerp so as to open up a shipping route for the allies. It ended with an Allied victory but not before thousands of casualties on both sides and eventually upwards of 40,000 German prisoners. There were alone over 12,000 Allied casualties over half of which were Canadian.The Forgotten Battle centered on the stories of a Dutch fighter now working for the Nazis, a British pilot and and a Dutch resistance woman. The Dutch fighter working for the Nazis was questioning where does his loyalties lie. In between was some of the most riveting, tense, brutal fighting ever put to film. Think Saving Private Ryan and Dunkirk all rolled into one. A real surprise at this time. Yes the pace can be slow at times but the story became more fascinating as the film moved on.The Battle of the Scheldt was one of the lesser known battles of WW2. Showing it as it did with personal stories gave it a more intimate feel than many war films. This operation while led by the Canadians also had British and Polish units. This operation was occurring just after Operation Market Garden an Allied failed attempt to take the Netherlands in September 1944 and depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far (1977).That the film centered on the stories gave it an unique personal feel rather than just centering on the how and the battles. It apparently is the most expensive Dutch film ever made. Highly recommended. A possible contender for Foreign Film Oscar?",The Forgotten Battle
32,121mcv,A refreshing change from the usual humdrum,8,17 October 2021,"A forgotten story which is depicted very well considering the budget constraints, I was very surprised to see the death toll breakdown .

33,BestBenedikt,A mostly average effort despite an interesting concept,6,23 October 2021,"Big- or even mid-budget war films are rarely to be seen these days. While I appreciate Netflix for providing a platform for such niche genres, it is ultimately frustrating to see, how little those films have evolved ever since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN vigorously set new standards in 1998.Let me start with the positives: I liked the whole production value and especially the somewhat unique perspective, as the story is in parts told from the point of view of a Dutch Waffen-SS volunteer. Unfortunately, these interesting conceptual choices are quickly thwarted by many inaccuracies that range from ""sloppy"" to ""irritating"": From the incorrect borders displayed on the map right at the beginning of the film to anachronisms in language use - f. E. an SS officer refering to the Kulmhof concentration camp as ""Chelmno"", the Polish name of the town.All this nit-picking aside, the main problems of the film lie in its script and its direction. While a big part of the story depends on a forced conflict between the German military and the local townspeople - Who would be stupid enough to throw a rock at a soldier, when there's still a massive troop presence in town and the war is in its final phase? And does a German Oberst in these times of frantic chaos have nothing better to do than visiting a local household in person, sitting down in an armchair like a clichéd Bond villain? -, the direction indecisively vacillates between worn-out melodrama and rather unoriginal action set pieces.In the end, you are left with an entertaining, yet very average film that mostly confuses war with fast-paced action. Films like THE THIN RED LINE (1998) or LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA (2006) had a much better understanding of war and human tragedy that most modern films apparently can't capture.",The Forgotten Battle
34,brockfal,Excellent war film,8,24 October 2021,"The intersecting fortunes of three people caught up in the relatively unknown battle of the Shelde in 1944 make for a powerful and intimate wartime epic which, in some respects, manages to outshine bigger high profile epics. The script manages to connect well both characters and wider wartime events whilst maintaining small scale interest and an intimate feel, and there's often a terrific believably about the drama. The landscape and battle scenes are handled really well and it's all directed with assurance, and though i thought some of the acting slightly below par and the film isn't exactly original in approach, I enjoyed this often impressive gripping and intriguing war movie, and it is well worth a watch.",The Forgotten Battle
35,aldebaran68,$14 million ...why did they bother?,4,15 October 2021,"OK, as far as i could make out (my eyesight esp. For screen isn't that good...) the production values in terms of WW2 equipment were OK. Nothing cringingly out of place... exc that in the first battle scene these Germans are fighting guys in Red Army uniforms and a T34 tank... I thought this was set in Western Europe, not the Eastern Front.However... the story is all over the place, very fragmented. Some of the dialogues are a bit 21C. 'Have a nice day'... and the way the group of British paras is made to interact would be shameful to any WW2 British paratrooper. My parents were the war gen (I'm 66) and I spent my childhood watching WW2 movies.There is far too much 21C in some of these 're-enacted' WW2 movies. The dialogues, the way some of the actors look is nowhere near how they would have been in WW2. So, not very impressed with the writing or the directing.Sadly the Dutch along with most EU citizens take PC for granted and it seeps into their war movies. American and Russian WW2 movies tend not to have as much. So, 4 stars for the production values re equipment, but otherwise... why did they bother? Its was the 2nd most costly Dutch film ever made. They could have done better with the same money.",The Forgotten Battle

39,joelmulder96,Reviewing this is difficult,5,15 June 2021,"For me, a Dutchie, this is a very difficult film to review. I am trying to figure out whether to see this as a war film or as a Dutch film. As a war film, this film does not stand out amongst others. Sure, it tells a relatively unknown story and it keeps its premise small and contained. However, it didn't invite me in. I don't know whether it's the characters or just the actors that played them, I just didn't have a solid point of reference. Of course, this could have been a purposeful decision, showing the audience that in those times, people (soldiers especially), were rather expendable. Not having one ""hero"" who everyone knows is going to survive is part of many a war film. If that is the case, I should definitely watch more war films to wrap my mind around which different choices each director makes in this genre. As a Dutch film, this is genuinely good. And that is saying something. As most fellow Dutchies will agree, Dutch films are just cinematic turd. Not bad or unprofessional or anything, just aggressively mediocre, forgettable, and predictable. Plus, the dialogue is always the verbal equivalent of wet socks. So, compared to those, this movie is pretty solid. Everyone speaks in their own native tongue, the production value is grand, and on a technical level, it is of convincing quality. I think that sums up what I think of the film. I would not say I had a bad time watching it, because I loved experiencing this in theatres. I just had a difficult time reviewing it.",The Forgotten Battle
40,tloader-1,Unique and compelling,9,7 November 2021,"This movie stands out among other war movies - shows a balanced view of several sides of a war, and doesn't rely on heroes making big speeches or taking monumental actions.The characters and acting are first class, and the action feels very real and tense.While the connection of the characters is at times a little too convenient, it is nonetheless a highly recommended movie.",The Forgotten Battle

42,Arconada,"Good movie, disappointing soundscape",7,3 November 2021,"This is a good movie focusing on the fights around the Sloedam. However, the battle of Walcheren consisted of two more amphibious attacks and an inundation of the island. The budget did not allow to show these parts. But what the movies shows is credible. The villages of 70 years ago are convincingly rebuild and the acting is good. But were the sidelines really necessary? The fights around the Sloedam started on 31 October. The storyline that introduced Jamie Flatters/William Sinclair took place half September. A bit far fetched, it seems. The same goes for Gijs Blom/Marinus van Staveren. Did they really need to build an expensive Russian frontscene to introduce a disappointed German soldier? I think they could have saved some money there, and instead have some extra budget to include the other fronts in this battle. Anyway, the film entertained me, that's important. One last thing, the soundscape was mediocre.",The Forgotten Battle
43,Vinny37,Spoilt by one word,1,23 October 2021,"I have watched many war films & series since the sixties. None as realistic for wounds. A mixture of folly and bravery, of civilians and combatants, as a vital clearance was made to open essential supply lines. Ordinarily I would have felt good, and sombre, after such a film, but for the F-blasphemy, that needless attack against marriage and decent humanity, and which, as told to me by a former WW2 Brit who fought in Africa, was not a feature of the times. Why must folk wreck a film just to get in their bit of filth?",The Forgotten Battle
44,vangamer,Canadian Army in film that's strangley flat,6,15 October 2021,"The Forgotten Battle is a slow burn of a movie that gets some of the historic and military hardware things right but somehow doesn't satisfy as either a personal or historic story.The setting is the Battle of Scheldt in late 1944 which offers the cinematic rarity of showing the Canadian Army in action as it fought to secure the water approaches to the great port of Antwerp - which was already in Allied hands.The story follows a young Dutch woman, a British paratroop sergeant who is isolated when his glider goes down, and most interestingly a Dutch national fighting for the Wehrmacht. Borrowing from movies such as Dunkirk or The Young Lions, the movie follows these three very different characters whose paths are destined to intersect by the resolution of the movie.There are some worthwhile issues here about collaboration and the reasons people make certain choices in the chaos of wartime - and director Matthijs van Heinningen Jr lays them out rather effectively. On this issue, the character of Dr. Visser, a man who hopes to reach compromises with the occupiers is especially sympathetic.The performances are decent and a lot of care was given to realistic production settings to recreate the campaign - though this was partially ruined when British 1944 paratroops talked about pizza - a massive anachronism.Two more quick things. It's impossible to believe a real WW II paratroop sergeant would tolerate any of the insubordination the screenwriter dreamed up. Two, it's amazing a Dutch soldier spending two years with the Germans at the Eastern Front (far, far nastier over there) never noticed the Nazis were capable of doing horrible things but realizes that in Zeeland.Still, the representation of Canadians fighting to take a well-defended causeway was largely historically accurate, even if shown at the Company level.Overall, however, the movie is so underplayed that it concludes on a rather flat and underwhelming note. It helps not knowing a lot of the social and military realities of WW II and the first great Canadian Army movie remains to be made.",The Forgotten Battle

46,svanwelie-177-496844,Surprisingly good,8,16 October 2021,"Ok 8 stars, but mainly based on the way the movid surprised me in a positive way. Most Dutch movies are known for stupid dialogues with a storyline as flat as a sheet of paper. Unless it is some romcom thing it really hurts your eyes. Even morr skilled movies like zwartboek, michiel de ruyter or de oost have stupid dialogues. The forgotten battle however was worth watching. Acting was not great, but good enough. Some scenes like the one with the glider planes were very good. Except for some cliché moments. Tom Felton didnt like to play his role and did it for the money. Either that, or he is an overrated actor. But other players did quite well. I really did like the actor playing Dr Visser.Camera work was really good and so were the sfx. Most items fitted in the timelime, the ones didnt, didnt bother me. Sometimes the language was a bit too modern. But well, it wouldnt be fair to make a fuzz about it.

The production entertained me from minute 1 to the end, the scenography is perfect, they do not use misused computer technologies to recreate the past, on the contrary they handle very good methods to catch the viewer in a scene of war, of partisan struggle and a German disappointment. It is worth highlighting the good studio work of the excellent costume director Margriet Procee, it is an Academy Award winner. The question is why this movie is called ""The Forgotten Battle?

56,jimfarley1025,Disjointed,6,21 October 2021,"Like all of the modern retellings of WWII, the film makers fixate on the details at the expense of the reality. The costumes and makeup for this film are extraordinarily well done. The details of uniform and equipment would be remarkable if they were used to enhance a story that was equally concerned with the truth of human courage and suffering in war. The characters in the story are too shallow to support the incessant fear and shock they are displaying in the moments of crisis. We don't understand why they act as they do because we have no idea who they are. Especially egregious is the portrayal of the British Glider soldiers who completely fall apart when they are force down in the wrong place. I suppose one could make a believable story of such an instance, but it would require meticulous explanation because it goes completely against every true example of those men that we have from history. Such a group, in such an instance, as was demonstrated more than once, would have been much more likely to become even more tightly bound and fiercely heroic. Similarly the portrayal of the young Dutch Resistance man as a careless, foolish boy is practically a slander on the reality, which was a great many very young people who acted with old heads on their shoulders with gallantry and stoicism. All in all, a terrible waste of talent.",The Forgotten Battle

62,MoviePeek,Perspectives of War,8,9 November 2021,"Being one of the most defining periods of the 20th century, World War II is no stranger to big-screen adaptations. From defining battles to small personal struggles, many corners of this dark and defining period have been brought to life with harrowing and gut-wrenching realism.The Forgotten Battle illuminates the Battle of the Scheldt, an often unsung (or forgotten) moment of the war in which the Germans must be defeated so the allies may take control of the Scheldt estuary, which will then allow them to get supplies to the city of Antwerp in Belgium.The Forgotten Battle is a Dutch production and is reportedly the second most expensive film ever in Dutch history, with a budget of around 16 million dollars. In Hollywood land that would barely make a quirky independent rom-com, about a girl who rides a penny-farthing and is accompanied everywhere by her pet parrot. She then begins an unlikely relationship with an unexceptional man in his early thirties who whiles away every day at his mundane office job and never lived in the moment, that is of course until he met Poppy. But the Dutch know how to get a little more bang for their buck and on that modest budget, they were able to produce an entire two-hour war epic.While I'm not going to tell you that the film has the same production values as genre-defining movies such as Saving Private Ryan or 1917, the film does nonetheless deliver an authentic portrayal of the period with surprising detail, effectively demonstrating that the Dutch film industry has talented filmmakers that can rival their American counterparts and save a few quid at the same time.Okay so it's a film about World War II, we've seen a few of them. We've seen battles, we've seen family melodramas, we've seen the horrors of the camps, we've seen the build-up, we've seen the aftermath. What does The Forgotten Battle do differently from all the other war films that came before? The film may feature familiar troupes, set pieces, and even characters that have been seen in countless other films, but the real difference that separates The Forgotten Battle from other World War II dramas is it features multiple protagonists. This enables the film to tell its story from three different perspectives, thereby giving a more in-depth portrayal of the entire situation.There is the perspective of a cocky British soldier who finds himself behind enemy lines, the perspective of a young woman whose brother gets on the wrong side of the Germans occupying the town. And finally, and most surprisingly the perspective of a young German soldier who begins the film with an unwavering allegiance to the cause, but soon has his eyes opened to the real values of the Nazi party. These three characters make up the unfolding narrative, and no one gets short-changed in terms of screen-time, with everyone given enough time to become complex three-dimensional characters. For me, all three of these characters' stories were compelling and had me completely invested. But, depending on your tastes, your mileage may vary. If you were expecting The Forgotten Battle to be a nonstop barrage of blood and bullets, then you may be disappointed.The film has many quieter moments, after all, one of the main characters is a civilian, and overall has a slower pace than other more bombastic war films. That's not to say the film shies away from the battle itself because it doesn't. Without spoiling anything the climax of the film features a shocking and heart-pounding battle that despite the modest budget, portrays the fight with brutal realism, that stands toe to toe with any of its contemporaries.For me, the most compelling of these three characters was the young German soldier, Marinus van Staveren who undergoes a dramatic shift throughout the film as his propaganda-filled mind is opened to the realities of the war. It's an interesting and often unexplored element of World War II, that of the German soldiers themselves, who are rarely explored and examined with such depth.The Forgotten Battle may not have the flash and pizazz of American-produced war epics, but it more than holds its own, producing harrowing battles and multiple protagonists you care about. Featuring an often-unsung moment from World War II, the Dutch-produced film explores this dark chapter through multiple characters, delivering a war film unlike anything in recent memory.",The Forgotten Battle

Sad, depressing and anti-war in ways many American war films just can't seem to capture, the dehumanising and especially the disillusionment of war. Beautiful cinematography and great effects considering the low budget compared to many blockbuster films!Do not understand the low scores and feel some may have watched a different film or maybe watched a dubbed version? How did people not follow the story, not hard at all and I thought the pacing was pretty good to be honest. I mean I saw one guy complaining that the Germans were fighting Russians in the opening when the film was based on the western front ? Yes but a characters story starts there duh -Anyways a great film, not the best war film you'll ever see but still great.

76,NosCustodimus,The Forgotten Movie,2,3 November 2021,"TLDR: Script was decent enough and the actors played their parts admirably. Unfortunately, it suffered from slow pacing, poor cinematography (shaky cam), and an unoriginal story. Not recommended.----- While the battle in question is new material (from a Dutch perspective), very little new ground is broken with this film (from an American cinephile's perspective). We have already seen better versions of this movie numerous times. Not every single skirmish in every single war needs its own movie, especially if it's going to drag as much as this one did.Where I feel it really fell short was the cinematography. Can somebody please hold the camera still for half a second?! I don't know why they're still in love with Shaky Cam. Even on its lowest setting, it is completely inappropriate for some scenes. At least hold still when two people are sitting down talking.The Forgotten Battle left me bored and a little bit motion sick. I recommend skipping it.

History is written by the victors but a lot of these Scandinavians like may other sovereign states considered the German cause just due to The Treaty of Versailles. This is something that is always overlooked. This was akin to breaking up the United Kingdom with added retributions payments. The majority of the Axis forces were defending against an aggressor, the Nazi's/hard line element was around 1%-5% with the rest made up of average Wehrmacht soldiers.10 stars for this due to keeping in touch with the era- no wokery/overt sexuality (you know which type..), or cultural mis-representation i.e the need to add every culture/ethnicity into the story to comply with current the ""most include"" tick list.",The Forgotten Battle

The Battle of the Scheldt - the second most expensive Dutch film ever - mixes grandiose battle scenes with personal stories about resistance and collaboration.The Battle of the Scheldt certainly looks spectacular and it is a Dutch film that is technically well put together. At the same time, the film shoots in all directions. The crew is unable to focus clearly on a thematically strong story.",The Forgotten Battle

The story unfolds very slowly, with full of clichés and predictable plots.The historical complex battle itself is brought down to a single struggle, completely at the end of the movie. But before this all happens the viewer is tortured with more or less childish stories about civilians and individual soldiers struggling with the of course really nasty and bad Germans. It is well filmed and well-acted, yes technically nice movie and the stories are probably historically realistic but so shallow and slow and therefore to me very boring. There is no character depth, no surprising or switching plots and with stories that in the end forcefully come together.Luckily I watched it at home and could fast forward many scenes without losing the story-line...Too bad though because, as a Dutch national, I really would have liked this Dutch production to have succeeded in making something beautiful.

They never really take the time to develop the characters, so you end up not caring what happens to them. This makes some scenes that should have been very impactful and powerful for their respective character come of as unexceptional and dull. At no point was I sitting at the edge of my seat and this is unfortunate because the historical story behind the movie itself is quite interesting. It's not a bad movie by any means just doesn't draw you in like it tries to. So in conclusion, worth a watch but don't expect too much.",The Forgotten Battle
84,f4estudios,It lacks the elements it needs to be a proper good movie,5,26 October 2021,"*spoilers included*
Visually, great movie. Grading is very cool, love the style. Many of the sets are very impressive too. Acting, half decent at best. But there are two things that really annoy me.The story is too simple, There is an attack coming, the resistance made sacrifices and gets the plans to the allies. There is no proper build up, and you see like 20 guys attacking. In the end you read thousands of people died.Character development is almost none, before getting to know anyone, they die. There is a Dutch Nazi soldier who just sees a lot of bad stuff happening, barely does anything, and then his death is the most dramatic thing ever. The doctor and German officer are great buddies, still the doctor basically gets backstabbed over his son. How are the relationships? It's just tiny pieces of stories from a large group of people. It doesn't tell a story like this.Then the second part are the mistakes. Huge cannons shooting without any recoil - same for guns. People falling from being shot and later crawling on. But the worst: seeing an automatic machinegun being fed blanks. Yeah, if that's accurate I understand the Germans lost the war.There are many dramatic scenes, dramatic deaths and dramatic music... but it's all about actors we barely knew or had sympathy for. There are just too many scenes that feel unnatural and unrealistic.Huge potential, but it just lacks.",The Forgotten Battle

86,jeffreyshyatt,Lazy writing,5,17 October 2021,"It started off decent but about halfway through the writers got lazy in order to add suspense. They did this by making the characters act REALLY dumb. Spoilers ahead.Two British soldiers sneak into a house where their officer is being held prisoner by 2 German soldiers. They knew there were 2 Germans. But instead of rushing into the room with the element of surprise they just stand outside in the hall until they are discovered. Then 1 unarmed German discovers them and instead of shooting him the British let him charge them and get into brawl with one of them(Brit1) The other British soldier(Brit2) just stands there with his rifle not sure what to do while his friend fights for his life in front of him. Brit1 overpowers the German and leaves him to be guarded by Brit2. Then Brit1 takes his rifleand goes into the room where German2 is holding a pistol to the head of the officer. And again he hesitates and doesn't shoot the German even when ordered to do so. So German2 shoots the officer then stands there, pistol in hand while brit1 shoots him. Smh.Late in movie a Dutch girl is worried about her brother(a resistance fighter) who is held prisoner by the Germans. A German soldier/clerk stops her as she's walking in front of the German HQ so he can tell her her brother is tio be executed. A German officer sees this exchange, you know because they were stupid enough to speak in public on front of the HQ, and now the German clerk is in trouble. Lol3 out of 5 British soldiers in a squad, get scared, refuse to try and link up with their unit and desert. It's not like the British haven't been fighting this war for several years now. I can see 1 maybe 2 losing their nerve but nearly the entire squad? Doubtful since the desertion rate was only 3% for the British not 60%.There's many more examples. The movie is just full of people staging around looking dumb. Or making terrible decisions. Like ""turn yourself into the Germans for killing 3 of their men. They won't execute you of you say you didn't mean it."" Yes that happened. 😂",The Forgotten Battle

92,tin-whistle,Nothing new here,4,18 October 2021,"Like most Dutch war films full of clichés. The collaborating mayor, the clumsy resistance fighter and the Nazi with a heart. Yawn. The visuals are fine, but the dialogues are flat and meaningless. As if the screenwriter hadn't put anything on paper, but ordered the actors to just say the first thing that came to their mind. After the beginning, in which a boy is photographing German soldiers unhindered and throws a stone through the windshield of a military vehicle without being shot immediately, it is very difficult to take the rest of the story seriously. The oftentimes theatrically trudging wounded soldiers are certainly not convincing at all. Too bad for Jan Bijvoet and Jakob Diehl, who stand out as actors far above the others.

It shows how savage war is and the sometimes small token efforts that people risked and in many sacrificed their lives for.The film crosses genres with battle scenes, spying, family drama but also survival behind enemy lines.The production values are simply stunning. I felt the atmospheric dampness of the flooded fields of the Netherlands. It transports you right to that place and time.History nerds have complained that the film doesn't cover the whole campaign. I'm a history nerd too but the film IS NOT a documentary. It is a tale of war told through various characters. A tiny snapshot of the struggle to liberate the Dutch. As the camera pans out and we hear the rumble for gunfire and see fires rising into the sky I was left with the terrible realisation that this little snapshot was happening in every direction. Thousands of people all enduring and losing their lives. The history buffs would have this as a documentary without heart so don't listen to them. Watch it on it's terms.",The Forgotten Battle

96,joe-morphew,Worth watching,8,17 October 2021,"The film takes place months after D-Day: the map of Europe shows retreating Nazi-Germany armies, steadily displaced by the advancing armies of the Allies. The Dutch province of Zeeland is still in German hands, but the arrival of the Allies seems imminent.The Battle of the Scheldt, often called The Forgotten Battle, took place between October 2 to November 8, 1944. It was was a variety of different operations to open up the shipping route to Antwerp, which was important to supply the Allied Forces. We follow three people one from each side of the front, and one civilian. On the German side, there's Marinus, a young Dutchman, a member of the Dutch Nazi Party who enlisted to fight the communists. On the other side: Willem Sinclair, a soldier in the British Air Force who crashes during a flight over Zeeland. Teuntje Visser is the daughter of the local general practitioner in Zeeland who becomes involved in the resistance after her brother is taken away by the Nazis.The Forgotten Battle never shows false heroism or glorifies the violence of war. It focuses on fear, pain and loss. The film shows both gunfights and daily life under the yoke of the Nazis.Overall the film has excellent cinematography, good acting, and a unique way of telling a war story. We are left with some questions because the film never deviates from the perspective of the three we follow, but this just helps illustrate the fog of war and adds to the realism of their stories.",The Forgotten Battle

98,Frankflash77,Visually impressive but.....disjointed,5,17 October 2021,"While this movie looks amazing and their are some very good battle sequences, the story somewhat falls apart. I did however watch it in Dutch with subtitles so maybe I lost some of the story in translation.This is essentially 3 characters stories. Teuntje Visser who is trying to save her brother from a German firing squad; Marinus van Staveren who is a Dutch soldier fighting for Germany, and William Sinclair who is a British Airborne soldier. The problem I had was that none of their stories were explored enough and the film felt too rushed in such a short time frame (maybe I'm just getting spoiled by all the series on offer now).I also had a major problem with William Sinclair's story. There were so many continuity problems and his story just didn't make sense. Some of these are;-
-His rifle kept changing.-His Glider only had 5 people in it.-2 of the British soldiers just disappear (presumably to surrender) for no real reason.-somehow he paddled through enemy lines in broad daylight without being noticed.-Even though he is a British Airborne soldier who has escaped from behind enemy lines he somehow gets conscripted into the Canadian Military and thrown straight back into battle. Surely someone who has escaped from behind enemy lines would be very useful for intelligence reasons and would be returned back to his own military as soon as possible?These were just a few of things that really started to get to me.... I could go on. In the end there were too many to try and suspend my disbelief .",The Forgotten Battle

So the Airspeed Horsa gliders and Handley-Page Halifax towing aircraft are all there, as are Dakotas and Lancasters, T-34s and Panzerfausts, Bren guns and MP-38s.But unlike many WWII films, this is a ""character study"" of various people caught up in it. And all of the unknown (to me) actors gave me a glimpse into the extraordinary human carnage of it. Everyone was fighting their own war...and some survived it.Personally I'd rate this film as being on a par with ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998)"" or ""Dunkirk"" (2017) or ""1917"" (2019). We're seeing an era in which ""set design"" and ""production design"" are making things ""possible"" for the first time.But in this case?

This movie also portrays British pilots who've gotten lost as completely incompetent and scared. If the director was trying to show a glorious monumental achievement he completely ruined an untold screen story. Your better off reading about it on Wikipedia. Im well versed with movies especially historic ones and this movie just makes you angry at portraying the Dutch and the British for being easily jolted like scared mice.I know there were very courageous resistance fighters and British soldiers but this movie does not even get close to showing that , which to me is a massive injustice to the pain and suffering many met. This movie makes everyone look timid and afraid. Maybe the director should watch some of the defining war movies as I clearly believe the producers were incompetent and completely damaged the reputation of the British and definitely the Dutch. Good thing they had the USA and Canadians, maybe make a movie about their heroics and not belittle the British involvement which was tremendous. 1 hour 35 mins you may as well just fast forward if you want to see a BATTLE, a British slaughter and retreat.Hurray , the British won a small arms BATTLE with 15 mins left.Awful war movie - the ""forgotten battle"" I'm still trying to figure what that was because this clearly doesn't define it.Pro Nazi movie in my eyes .

I mean, yeah it would be some kind of surprise if these guys walked across the water due to the tide, but boats? No German expected this, they didn't even put a single dude on the flank? None of the 10 dudes in the German army epected this. All of these stupids scenes ruins the immersion and excitement.

This dog turd of a film gets it wrong from start to finish.Operation Market Garden took place in September, the battles for the Scheldt Estuary and Walcheren Islands in November, this film tried to tell us they happened simultaneously which is WRONG !!!!The CGI aircraft start out wonderfully, but then we see the aerial equivalent of the M25 at rush hour with C-47s, Halifax's, Spitfires and Horsa Gliders all within 15 feet of each other. Once again completely inaccurate and wrong.While we are on the subject of Gliders, why don't any of the pilots have their glider pilots wings on either their Denison smocks or BD uniform ?? Simple mistakes which ruin films.Why does the officer commanding the Glider pilot regiment have a 47 AOS on his Jeep ? That's a Royal Artillery AntiTank serial !!! Another simple mistake that's easily researched.A Horsa glider heading to Arnhem with all of three soldiers in it ?? Great use of transport on a glider that carried 28 men....and all three of them are sergeants ??? Give me a breakOh and if you loose half a wing on a Horsa, it becomes an UNCONTROLLABLE lawn dart...Why does the hero's rifle change from a number 4 Enfield into a Number 1 Mk III and back several times during the film ??Again simple continuity fixes crass mistakes like this.And our hero after boating across numerous North Sea inlets is rescued by the Canadian Army and is immediately added into their ranks ??? WRONG !!!Glider pilots were far too valuable to waste, and especially since he's just apparently ""teleported"" through two months of time to reach them.You think perhaps he'd be sent back to the UK and debriefed properly ????Nope he's sent on an immediate first world war style attack with a huge clump of Canadians (commanded by an officer of the British 52nd Lowland Division that was nowhere near that are in September) all in 1950's helmets and British BD trying to run up a narrow causeway in broad daylight without artillery support or smoke cover....Don't waste your time watching this if you are a historian, you'll rip your hair out seeing these mistakes.",The Forgotten Battle

Bullet should have been in chamber as soon as they hit the ground.I liked the storyline. Acting was decent. The SS officer was a horrible character, and woefully inaccurate.

But for me its maximum 6 stars because the movie failed to explain the course of the battle of the schelde.It started so promissing with the map of europe that started at D-day and ended at Vlissingen. Why not continue to use this to explain where the glider crashed, where the dam was located and show the names of the villages where the scenes took place? That would be so much more catchy for the dutch audience.And last but not least, the attack on the dam was too much of the same as Saving private Ryan. More originality please!",The Forgotten Battle

Many soldiers and civilians of Zeeland paid with their lives. However, not many people know about it and it is easily forgotten. This movie perfectly shows the horrors of this battle from three different sides, in a realistic manner. It is very refreshing to see a Dutch production where nothing is romanticized (like in Hollywood), because there was nothing romantic about the war.This movie really captures how the war affected all these different people's lives, and here in particular the lives of young people.The story of de Slag om de Schelde is a very important part of history and can never be forgotten.

So I think it was a very interesting story to watch.What I like about it is that everything looks really like 40's Netherlands, the interior of the houses, the streets, the clothing of the people. It all looks like photographs I see in books, museums and even photographs of my grandparents from that time.It show the fears of people and the betrayal and what people had to do just to survive.So yes, I liked it and I hope this opens doors for small European movies to be watched all over the world.

the people of the dutch village that are about to be liberated;the allies, that are liberating them;the Germans.Because of this, there is a lot of context switching, which can sometimes be hard to follow.There are also some parts, where, in my opinion, the film focuses a little too much on (small) things which do not add anything to the story.For the allies perspective, it follows the journey of a squad of soldiers, leaving from England, participating in operation market garden and accidentally ending up in the battle of the scheldt.The other perspective is shown, by following a family that is both working with the Germans and involved with the resistance.",The Forgotten Battle

Since most of the area was flooded by the Germans there are only a few causeways for their troops to cross, meaning men are unavoidably exposed to enemy fire.The story is told from the viewpoint of three people. An inexperienced Canadian glider pilot in his first taste of combat, a Dutchman who foolishly joins the Wehrmacht and learns some terrible lessons on the Eastern Front before he is wounded and then sent to a cushy desk job in his home country, and a teenage Dutch woman whose brother accidently involves her in the Dutch underground.Because three separate stories eventually intertwine it is a long movie, but will keep you entertained throughout. The acting is superb. My only complaint was that some of the German voices did not seem authentic.The battle scenes were realistic, gritty and harrowing. You felt like you were there, helpless and confused. It was nice to see a war movie that depicted what it was like for both sides, with the initial naivete of the young Canadian soldier juxaposed with the veteran Wehrmacht soldier who knows the horrors of war and has had enough. The desperation of the Germans is graphically depicted, as well.Overall, one of the best war movies I have seen...and I've seen them all.Highly recommended.",The Forgotten Battle

I understand that for funding reasons the producers probably thought it was better to have a few Brits be the western link for the movie but it is s bad as having a Texas Ranger join the Mounties or Americans join the Canadian army before the US joined the war. Very reminiscent of the Canadians attacking the beaches of Dieppe and the newpapers the next day reading British and US troops invade Europe.No Canadian soldier had more than six lines in the movie and the impact of their role is minimised.Still worth the watch.

160,maartenhoeben,Nice production with a weak storyline,4,15 June 2021,"As a Dutchman I felt almost obligated to go and watch this highly celebrated movie, as the second most expensive Dutch production after Blackbook(Zwartboek)I have to admit that the action scenes have been done quite well, but that's about it. The film is riddled with historical inaccuracies and incomplete stories. The writers have made an attempt to create 3 coinciding storylines, but they failed miserably. For example:
what happened to the 2 English defectors?what happened to the Dutch soldier that didn't say a word when he didn't jump into the dingy?how did the Germans spot the 2 girls on the riverbank right away, while they blew up the dam?This movie would have been so much better if it just concentrated on the Dutch girl/woman who joins the resistance after she finds out that her younger brother was involved, and killed for his involvement.Furthermore, why in the hell did the Canadians assault the Germans over a narrow dam??? A proper strategist would never ever allow this to be done, as it's suicide. Probably one of the dumbest things I've ever seen.We also see the high ranking British and Canadian officers discussing the issue with crossing the river with amphibious vehicles because of the shallows. After they receive the maps of the waterways, they still only use rowboats which aren't affected by the shallows anyway. So why did they opt for the dam in the first place and why did they need the map and photos?Maybe I'm too critical, but I think this movie was a waste of time and money. They could've at least read a history book, before writing this.",The Forgotten Battle

It's such a shame they don't even mention the fierce fighting in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, the bombing of the dikes and flooding of Walcheren whitch caused a great loss of civilian lives and no mention what so ever of the amfibious landings at Flushing and Westkapelle whitch some of the veterans described to be tougher than the landings at Normandy.

165,peter-kistemaker,Boring,4,16 October 2021,"The start is quite nice. Young lad throws a stone through the windshield of a German truck and is immediately chased by those Germans as being part of the resistance.After a short introduction we suddenly find ourselves in Narva, on the Russian front.Here we find a Dutch volunteer and one of the main characters who is being attacked by a Russian T34. Note: In mirror image!!In the T34 the driver is on the right side of the hull and the machine gunner is on the left side.In the film, a T34 rolls up in mirror image, driver on the left, machine gun on the right.These are those annoying mistakes that you can avoid during editing.Pro: The Germans speak German, the Dutch speak Dutch and the English speak English.Fortunately, that has now become standard and we are no longer confronted with Germans speaking fluently English in a (war) movie.Then something else, the story follows a Dutchman in the German Wehrmacht (Heer)? That is not possible.The Wehrmacht was the official German army and only men with German nationality could be enlisted there.Hitler could not, constitutionally speaking, recruit non-Germans into the Wehrmacht.He had the (Waffen) SS for that. Foreigners were all conscripted into the Waffen SS, a paramilitary army consisting largely of foreign volunteers, such as the Foreign Legion in France
So if that Dutchman had served with the Germans, he would have been in the Waffen SS, just like 25,000 of his compatriots.The script was like loose sand to me.I didn't have any connection with the main characters.The Battle itself lasts about 15 minutes and was very amateurish in my opinion.Something like 300 allies who come storming towards the enemy as one big clod, without the support of tanks or proper artillery back-up.Those are tactics from 200 years ago, but they don't fit in with modern warfare.Spreading out is the motto nowadays, by doing so you create lesser targets.I found the whole movie mostly boring.So this film disappears, just like Dunkirk, in my digital garbage bin.Blackbook (Zwartboek) another Dutch war movie still tops the ranks for me.This one doesn't even come close.",The Forgotten Battle

169,karcharhinus,"A serious film about WWII, deserves awards",9,25 October 2021,"This is a serious movie about the final stages of World War II, one related to the honorable role played by canadian forces in the Western Front, in many aspects better than that of the US forces, starting from D-Day, where the latter weren't as good in advancing, despite having the greatest amount of troops.Something to point out: when the general tells the troops the fate of Europe is in their hands, that's a bit exaggerated. Well, it is good to tell that to soldiers and officers, but it isn't historically true. Despite some people's opinions and political sympathies, the fate of most of Europe was in the Red Army's hands, so to say. The Red Army put down 9 out of 10 of every german soldier and officer in the entire war, and was fighting 3 to 4 times more divisions (and more populated divisions) in the Eastern Front (as it was called by Western powers, while the Soviet name for that was the Great Patriotic War), compared to the Western Front battles. In that regard, the Red Army was advancing more than twice as fast against the German troops, kms per day.Back to the movie, it is serious and historically true, and altogether realistic and crude, as war is. Not for people looking for an entertainment where the good ones stay alive and win, history of wars is terrible, so is this film. Good for patient spectators looking for accuracy and realism.

Also, traces of remaining humanity that people may have the power to tap into do not have to feel as cheesy, as the movie proves.And finally, where other movies really are centered around the battle scenes like SPR and Dunkirk, here they are just a side show.

175,kh_almere,it is oke but nothing more,5,15 October 2021,Tonight I watched it with big expectations but during the movie my brother en me said is that all?? It could be much better. We are disappointed. Anyway.,The Forgotten Battle
176,JuztinB85,Visually great.. and that's it!,6,5 June 2021,"This movie is visually amazing. What an impressive camera work. Could be straight from Hollywood. Although the storyline itself.. it misses a match with the title of the movie. It's not really about what happened at the Schelde it's focus is on individuals during this war (which could have been anywhere from Arnhem, Rotterdam or Germany). Missed opportunity to actually tell what happend.",The Forgotten Battle
177,colinhoskins,Good in Parts,6,18 October 2021,"A decent war film is all about accuracy and realism to me, or at least, it has to feel real. The Horsa glider scenes didn't do it for me. Ridiculous mobile-phone-like radio procedure and everyone talking with 21st century idioms, and why do the pilot and co-pilot both have their hands on the controls at once? I'm no expert but it doesn't seem right to me. And why did the glider only have 5 soldiers, when at least 20 would be expected. This is never explained. Their hair's too long, they're all much too chummy with the officer and they don't appear to be highly trained crack Airborne troops. When they're drinking in the flooded village, one actually says ""yeah, it's good, man!"". Seriously, in 1944? This is more 2021 Tottenham. If the Dutch scenes are equally ropey.....
Finally, our German/Dutch hero has been on the Russian front, and we all know how utterly cruel and dehumanising that was, but somehow he doesn't get disillusioned until he reaches a cushy office job back in Holland and resistance members are shot, which I imagine was fairly routine.It's ok, but could have been so much better with some basic attention to detail.",The Forgotten Battle
