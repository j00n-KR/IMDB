0,SnoopyStyle,irreverent fun,8,10 August 2021,"Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is back with the Suicide Squad. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) blackmails Bloodsport (Idris Elba) onto the team. Along with Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the group is tasked with infiltrating the island state of Corto Maltese after a military coup to take out an alien starfish.This is a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question.",The Suicide Squad
1,Prismark10,The Suicide Squad,8,7 August 2021,"The problem with superhero movies. They can easily be po faced and pompous. The audience want fun from their superheroes.Marvel learned this hence why the colourful Thor 3 was such a contrast from Thor 2.James Gunn injected a lot of frivolous fun in the Guardian of the Galaxy movies.Even 20th Century Fox went off the wall with Deadpool. An X Man giving the middle finger to X Men movies.Only Warner Brothers and DC have ploughed on with movies lacking the fun factor.It's James Gunn to the rescue with The Suicide Squad, the follow on to the 2016 original.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Bloodsport (Idris Elba) Peacemaker (John Cena) and some others including a shark that likes to eat humans become part of Task Force X assembled once again by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis.)Their mission is to infiltrate the island of Corto Maltese which recently had a coup. It also has a facility with something alien inside. To find out more they need to get to the Thinker (Peter Capaldi.)This is a zippy action movie that eschews the traditional three act structure. It plays fast and loose. It's faithful to its comic book origins.It is violent and darkly comic. It also has a lot of heart thanks to Elba and Daniela Melchior who plays Ratcatcher 2.Despite what looks like a scattergun approach Gunn also manages to add some political subtext to the film.",The Suicide Squad
2,nogodnomasters,That is a Digusting Superpower,10,12 August 2021,"We are introduced to Savant (Michael Rooker) in the first scene. Don't get too attached. A second squad is made up to infiltrate Jutunheim on Corto Maltese island and get information on Project Starfish which has alien technology.I loved this film. It was funny and fresh unlike the other DC comic films. The Starfish takes on human consciousnesses similar to ""The Attack of the Crab Monster"" and has a certain ""Stay Puft"" silliness. Many dark comedy elements like Idris Elba's relationship with his daughter. LOL funny. Worth watching twice.Guide: Plenty of F-words. Implied sex. Brief nudity.",The Suicide Squad
3,kosmasp,Nom Nom(?),9,9 August 2021,"What can be said about the Suicide Squad (yes the, not a or just Suicide Squad) ... and what can be said about James Gunn? I reckon some may have issues with his work - and that is fine. We all have different tastes. Him going comedy (though very dark and very violent and so many other things that certain people may call inappropriate) - is quite different from what Zac Snyder and DC stood for mostly. But succesful DC movies (at least at the box office) had quite a lot of fun included too - like Shazam to name another.But this is not that - we also have the previous Suicide Squad ... which while not really referred to, is in this too. Because you have some of the former members here. But of course a lot of new people too. The characters are as crazy as they can be - and the movie is as bloody as it is allowed too - it also has some nudity in it. The US has the R rating for movies like this ... UK and Germany went for the 15 and 16 rating respectively ... which some may find a bit low. That will depend on your sensibilities ... just be aware that there is a lot of gore, blood and other ""mature"" things depicted.The movie is not taking any prisoners (almost in a literal sense) and you never know who is going to bite the dust/bullet ... maybe even a member that you like a lot ... not to mention that morals are not really an issue for most members to say the least. Stick for an extra scene after the credits ... it does set up a future project (maybe it's already in the past when you read this)",The Suicide Squad
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Unexpected, really enjoyed that.",8,15 August 2021,"I can't believe it's five years since I watched Suicide Squad at the cinema, I still moan about the waste of time and money, I loathed it.I went into this one with a degree of scepticism, but within the first five minutes, something just feels different, and that vibe continues through to the end, it is a totally different production, one I thoroughly enjoyed, it doesn't matter what kind of film you like, there is something here for you, it's funny, it's dark, it's of course action packed, and if like me, you like a bit of gore, then you may just find yourself enjoying this.I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a hyped up film, I always seem to be at odds with the critics, however this time they're right.The acting does vary a little I would say, Idris Elba is just brilliant, it's nice to see him doing something a little different, I just wish Capaldi had a slightly bigger role.So good, I'm already booked in for a second viewing, 8/10.",The Suicide Squad
5,classicsoncall,"""Nothing like a bloodbath to start the day.""",7,8 August 2021,"In my review of the 2016 film, I noted that I wasn't inspired by it enough to check out a sequel if there was one. Well, now it's here and I'm back to the party, and by the look of things, this sequel clearly outdoes the original with a significantly higher IMDb rating. That's not to say parts of it aren't cheesy, they definitely are, when you consider two of your meta-human heroes are a land walking shark and a guy who kills with polka dots. That King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone) had me reminiscing all the way back to those old time Saturday Night Live skits that used to crack me up. The kicker had to be the super villain who shows up in the latter half, and my word! - Starro the Conqueror finally made it into a DC flick! Starro's first appearance in a comic book story hearkens all the way back to March, 1960 in an issue of Brave and the Bold #28, in which it went up against the Justice League! How's that for longevity, sixty plus years of history for a giant starfish!I have to admit, the opening sequence was a little awkward with the first team being taken out so handily by the Corto Maltese military faction. But then the real Task Force X showed up to side with Sol Soria's (Alice Braga) freedom fighters. After that, it's one major dust up after another, with a couple of surprise outcomes that get further treatment in the after credits scene.As for the story, that's where it gets somewhat derivative. The American government in league with a foreign nation to suppress information about a top secret project that could be used for military purposes? Come on, that's like saying the NIH would fund a secret Chinese lab to engage in gain of function research. Oh, wait...",The Suicide Squad
6,jboothmillard,The Suicide Squad,7,10 August 2021,"The original Suicide Squad was a mixed bag but had its moments, spin-off Birds of Prey was much better, and this third instalment, only adding ""The"" to the title, was highly anticipated, written and directed by James Gunn (Slither, Guardians of the Galaxy). Basically, intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruits a team of Belle Reve penitentiary inmates to carry out a new suicide mission, threatened with bombs implanted in their heads if they go against orders, and with the promise of having their sentences reduced if successful. The team, led by Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), are sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese after its government is overthrown by an anti-American regime. They are tasked with destroying the Nazi-era laboratory Jötunheim where a secretive experiment known as ""Project Starfish"" is taking place. However, the team are ambushed by Corto Maltese military, resulting in the deaths of Brian Durlin aka Savant (Michael Rooker), George Harkness aka Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Richard ""Dick"" Hertz aka Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Cory Pitzner aka T. D. K. ""The Detachable Kid"" (Nathan Fillion), Javelin (Flula Borg), and Mongal (Mayling Ng). The only survivor of the team is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) who is captured by the military and through seducing the leader gains information of the new regime's plans to use Project Starfish against other nations. The distraction of the ambush allows a second team of inmates to enter the country undetected. The second team is led by Robert DuBois aka Bloodsport (Idris Elba), with Christopher Smith aka Peacemaker (John Cena), Nanaue aka King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), Abner Krill aka Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), and Cleo Cazo aka Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior). After finding Flag at a base camp for rebel soldiers, the squad convinces rebellion leader Sol Soria (Alice Braga) to assist them. The squad accomplishes their next objective of capturing Dr. Gaius Grieves aka the Thinker (Peter Capaldi), a metahuman scientist in charge of Project Starfish. After rescuing Harley, who managed to escape captivity herself, the team break into Jötunheim and rig the facility with explosives, while Flag and Ratcatcher 2 enter the underground laboratory with the Thinker. They discover Project Starfish is Starro the Conqueror, a giant intelligent alien lifeform resembling a starfish that controls its victims through smaller versions of itself. The Thinker reveals that Starro was brought to Earth by the American government, who have been secretly funding the experiments on Corto Maltese for decades. Peacemaker, under secret orders to cover up America's involvement, kills Flag after he refuses to surrender a hard drive containing evidence of this revelation. Meanwhile, the squad and the Corto Maltese military battle, causing Polka-Dot Man to accidentally set off the explosives prematurely. Ratcatcher 2 obtains the drive from Peacemaker and Bloodsport saves her by shooting Peacemaker. Starro escapes the laboratory, kills the Thinker and many of the military, and begins taking control of the island's population. Waller tells the squad that their mission is complete, but Bloodsport decides to lead the squad into battling Starro. Waller orders the squad to be executed for disobeying orders, but her subordinates knock her unconscious, wanting to save the population. Polka-Dot Man is killed, but Harley pierces a hole in the alien's eye and Ratcatcher 2 summons all rats of the city to chew Starro to death from the inside. With the military distracted, Soria takes control of the government and pledges democratic change. Using the drive as leverage, Bloodsport forces Waller to release him and his surviving teammates from their imprisonment in exchange for keeping its contents confidential, and they are airlifted out of Corto Maltese. In mid and post-credits scenes, the first team's Weasel (Sean Gunn) and Peacemaker are shown to be alive. Also starring Taika Waititi as Ratcatcher, Dee Bradley Baker as Sebastian, Natalia Safran as Kaleidoscope and Gerardo Davila as General Vera. Robbie is likeable as the gleefully homicidal anti-hero, Elba and Cena are both great being tough, Davis gets her sinister moments, and the other cast members do well. Unlike the original, the characters are much more layered, the story is interesting, the special effects, fights and explosive sequences are controlled, it leaves room for well-timed humour and gore, and a good soundtrack, including ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash, ""Whistle for the Choir"" by The Fratellis, a fun anti-superhero fantasy action. Very good!",The Suicide Squad
7,BA_Harrison,Gunn crazy!,8,8 August 2021,"Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is the common denominator between two of DC's worst movies: David Ayer's abysmal Suicide Squad (my rating: 3/10) and the even worse Birds of Prey, directed by Cathy 'How the hell did she get that gig?' Yan (my rating: 1/10). Robbie returns for this sequel/reboot of The Suicide Squad, but this time she's in the more capable hands of director James Gunn, who has a proven track record with big budget, special effects laden blockbusters. Quinn is still a rather annoying character, but Gunn's film has so much else going for it that it's relatively easy to ignore her grating voice and mannerisms.Gunn began his movie career writing for Troma, penning such classics as Tromeo and Juliet (1996) and Terror Firmer (1999), and made his feature film directorial debut with gory sci-fi horror Slither (2006), and I can't help but feel that schlock horror is much closer to his heart than his family-friendly Guardians of the Galaxy films. Also written by Gunn, The Suicide Squad is certainly a whole lot of twisted fun, loaded with characters of dubious morality, bad taste humour and the type of graphic violence that would easily have earned the film an R-rating a decade or three ago (or seen it edited of all of its nasty stuff in good old Blighty-Gawd bless the BBFC). As a die-hard horror fan with an appreciation of the absurd, this adventure for the Suicide Squad is just how I like my comic book movies: dark, demented, and very gory.Robbie aside, the cast is excellent, with Idris Elba as Bloodsport, leading a crazy squad of anti-heroes on a seemingly impossible mission to destroy a scientific research building on the island of Corto Maltese, home to Project Starfish, a gigantic alien called Starro the Conquerer that can generate tiny duplicates that latch onto other sentient beings, thereby allowing the creature to control their minds. Joining Bloodsport are assassin Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), and King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), all of whom have their own particular and peculiar skills. Harley Quinn joins the 'squad' later on, a survivor of an earlier mission of which she is one of the few survivors (the others being heroic Colonel Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman, and my favourite character, a bug-eyed, child-killing creature called Weasel, presumed drowned but seen recovering and scampering away at the very end of the film).Other familiar faces joining in the fun are Gunn regular Michael Rooker as Savant (one of the not-so-lucky members of the first assault), the 'Twelfth Doctor' Peter Capaldi as scientist Thinker, Viola David as ruthless Suicide Squad controller Amanda Waller (also returning from Ayer's messy original), Firefly's Nathan Fillion as T. D. K (I won't spoil things by revealing what that stands for), Jai Courtney as Boomerang, and Taika Waititi as Ratcatcher 2's father, Ratcatcher.With such a stellar cast, and an A-list director at the helm, it's clear that no expense has been spared to ensure that The Suicide Squad isn't a flop this time around, and this is also evident in the superb digital special effects, of which there are plenty. I'm not the biggest fan of CGI, which can be the ruin of many a movie, but when it is of this calibre, it's fine by me - the film looks great throughout, whether it be chaos and destruction on a massive scale, more artistic flourishes (Harley Quinn on a killing spree surrounded by cascading flower petals and animated birds), or King Shark tearing a victim limb from limb.I had such a good time with The Suicide Squad I don't even mind that Harley Quinn wasn't one of the many characters to die a gruesome death, and I look forward to further sequels and spin-offs (Peacemaker is already slated for his own movie), just so long as Gunn is in control. But can we have a bit more of Weasel next time, please?7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",The Suicide Squad
8,paul_haakonsen,This was cheesy fun...,6,7 August 2021,"Well, if you enjoyed the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"" movie, then you will certainly enjoy the 2021 movie ""The Suicide Squad"" as well. Why? Well, simply put, because it is the same kind of cheesy entertainment.Writer and director James Gunn definitely managed to keep the movie up to par with the 2016 predecessor in terms of oddball characters, an outrageous script and an abundance of action.It should be said though that the 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"" is a step up in terms of graphic violence and sheer mayhem. For better or worse, then ""The Suicide Squad"" was rather bloody and gory. That was something I had not expected from the movie, but it was definitely something I welcomed to the movie, as it just felt rightly at place in the cheesy movie.The storyline told in ""The Suicide Squad"" is a no-brainer, and very much reminiscent of the 2016 movie. So this is essentially a movie where you lean back, munch the popcorn and just enjoy the action-packed ride.I can't claim that I was particularly impressed with the bad guy, villain or whatever you want to call a starfish of that size and magnitude. Sure, it made for some great spectacle of destruction, but the creature itself and the concept of it was just a bit far out there. But hey, then again, anything is possible in these movies I suppose.The characters in ""The Suicide Squad"" were colorful and bizarre, to say the least. And that was something that I definitely enjoyed in this 2021 movie, as they upped the character gallery quite a lot in comparison to the 2016 movie.I feel that Harley Quinn (played by
Margot Robbie) was a bit underplayed in this movie, as her character wasn't really given enough time to show the usual level of whacky crazy that we saw in the other movies.The Bloodsport character (played by
Idris Elba) was definitely one of the more detailed and layered characters in the movie, and let's just be honest here, Idris Elba was superbly cast for this particular role and performed it so well. It was fun to watch Michael Rooker portraying the Savant character in the movie, despite of not having all that much screen time.Then there was the King Shark character. When I first saw him, I must admit that I was ready to face palm myself. But as the movie progressed, I must admit that the character grew on me, and he definitely was a good comedy relief in the movie. And of course having Sylvester Stallone to do the voice was just great.I am not much of a fan of John Cena and his 'acting', but the character he portrayed in ""The Suicide Squad"" was actually a well-written character and one that felt very much in place in the movie.Having mentioned King Shark, I also have to mention the Weasel (played by Sean Gunn). Wow, what a character. He was something unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen, both in terms of appearance, mannerisms and what part he played in the movie. This character was just glorious. But I bet there will be a lot of people out there disliking the character. But, to each their own.And it was really, really nice to see actor Joaquín Cosio in the movie, taking on the part as Mayor General Mateo Suarez. This guy seriously is a great actor, and a much underrated one at that. He was so nicely cast for the movie and brought a lot of flavor to the screen.Visually then ""The Suicide Squad"" is great. Of course it is great, given it being a D. C. movie about anti-heroes.I must admit that I wasn't initially expecting all that much from writer and director James Gunn's 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"", but it proved to be rather enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.My rating of ""The Suicide Squad"" lands on a six out of ten stars - or starfish...",The Suicide Squad
9,BandSAboutMovies,This is how a blockbuster is made!,9,7 August 2021,"Yeah, I get it. There are a lot of superhero movies. But saying there are too many is like saying there are too many slashers or comedies. It's a genre in and out of itself that can tell a variety of different stories. And nobody has done a better job of that than James Gunn, who started in the world of Troma and low budget horror like Slither before making Super and then taking over his own part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Guardians of the Galaxy.But let me tell you - this is basically a high budget low budget film with a heart and you'd be silly to skip it. What other movie would be audacious enough to - spoiler warning - kill more than half its cast including most of the names on the poster before the credits even begin?Where David Ayer's Suicide Squad was pretty much considered a fumble - I liked the Deadshot moments and seeing the cast on screen - this movie fully lives up to the premise of John Ostrander's run on the comic book. These are the very lowest of the low when it comes to super-villainy, forced by the American government to do missions where there's every single chance they'll die, whether at the hands of their enemy, one another or by the bombs implanted in their heads by their team leader Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, perhaps given less to do in this movie but nailing exactly who the character is).Two different versions of Task Force X have been sent to the island of Corto Maltese to destroy Jötunheim, a laboratory that holds the secret of Project Starfish. One team - led by Rick Flag made up of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, who has this character down as perfect as it gets), Captain Boomerang (a sadly wasted Jai Courtney), Savant (Michael Rooker), The Detachable Kid (Nathan Fillion), Javelin (Flula Borg), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Weasel (all CGI and looking like Bill the Cat) and Blackguard (Pete Davidson) will take the beach. The other - using them as a distraction - is Peacemaker (a perfect John Cena), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian, not the first choice for a superhero character or actor, which should explain a bit of this movie to you) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior).This is a deep cut, but even Squad pilot Briscoe shows up to fly their transport. Deeper still is getting characters like Calendar Man, Kaleidoscope and Double Down into the prison.There's really no way that I can be subjective in my review of this. The Ostrander-era Suicide Squad is my favorite comic of all time and I subscribe to its modern remix Copra - you should too RIGHT NOW - and this movie completely hits all of the right notes, from how Killer Shark could eat anyone on the team at any time to Savant running from the battle and paying the price.So yeah. There are a lot of superhero movies. There is only one that has a kaiju starfish, a man who loves peace so much that he'd kill for it, full-frontal male nudity and perhaps the most gore I've ever seen in a mainstream film, as well as moments in the Project Starfish lab that would not feel out of place in an Italian zombie film.Movies can be and should be escapist fun. In a world where nearly every DC film has faltered to almost astounding levels, unable to even get the character of Superman correct in the last few decades, Gunn hits it out of the park. I can't wait for the Peacemaker show and whatever comes next.This is how you should feel after watching a blockbuster, folks.",The Suicide Squad
10,CinemaSerf,Whatever happen to poor old weasel?,6,15 September 2021,"Nope, sorry - i just didn't get the fuss surrounding this. A group of quirk-empowered miscreants are released from prison so they can embark on an highly dangerous, mission to destroy a (not so) secret facility on the island of Corto Maltese. Led by Margot Robbie and Idris Elba, this motley crew prove predictably effective despite facing the usual array of overwhelming odds that never did have much of a chance against the ""Squad"". The thing has precisely no jeopardy to the plot, and although the action scenes and visual effects are top drawer - so what, that's a minimum standard nowadays, rather than a selling point. Though I did appreciate Robbie more here than in the dreadful ""Birds of Prey"" (2020) solo iteration, and there are some fun scenes with Idris Elba there are far too many cast members to keep track of, and for the most part this film hasn't an original bone in its body. Sure it has some feisty, bad-ass attitude, but I'm afraid I've seen this all before...",The Suicide Squad

Totally incapable of independent thinking once the Master Manipulator turns their mind to mush, these miscreants are depicted by the prophetic Warner prognosticators as an imminent threat to many millions IF such a clear and present danger as the self-centered starfish is allowed to run roughshod across traditional American institutions, customs and norms.

12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A beautiful story of the magic that can happen when a studio decides to get out of its own way,8,6 August 2021,"A team of super-villains can shorten their jail sentences by going on missions as the titular Suicide Squad. They're not expected to return, and they definitely won't if they stray from the mission, or disobey direct orders, and have their implanted explosives detonated.It's the kind of ridiculous, contrived concept that we don't expect to work outside of a comic book. Not even in an adaptation. And yet, it does, incredibly well. You'll be surprised by how much you care about some of the members. Others are deliciously despicable, and we hate their guts. The level of interpersonal conflict is fun, and yet you can believe that someone would intentionally put all these people together. The action is tremendously enjoyable. No two characters are overly similar, no one disappears into the background, everyone does at least one major memorable thing, and like in Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn(Robbie, continuing to prove she's the perfect choice, she completely understands what makes Harleen tick) is given great scenes, dialogue, depth.James Gunn brings all of his strengths to this. He handles the ensemble cast without getting bogged down in their introductions: instead, he uses an impactful, if short one for each, giving them something quick yet defining to do early after we meet them, and, of course, utilising, without abusing, the useful narrative shortcut of exposition. This is emotional, if not as much as the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The use of music fits and is effective, not on the nose boring choices that play only very briefly, and are followed up maybe a minute later with another cue. While I have to admit that this is the first R-rated picture of his that I watched, I would definitely say that he should get to do more of these in the future. It still doesn't feel like he's awkwardly constrained when he works with a PG-13, but he really knows how to use the freedom here. We do get ridiculous amounts of violence(and swearing. It is thankfully nearly completely devoid of gratuitous sexuality and nudity, that would only distract. Of course I wouldn't be against it if it served a purpose; there is no time in this when that would have been the case, though) that is expected from this kind of thing, yes, meanwhile, We also get some legitimately powerful, disturbing material. Of course not every film has to ""have something to say""; however, it can be extremely gratifying when we see one that does(and does it well), and this is one of those instances.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. They give you an excellent idea of what to expect. 8/10.",The Suicide Squad

Or should that be Maltayzee?Some returning characters and plenty of new faces populate a second outing for the anti-hero title which demonstrates very clearly why joining the Squad is suicidal. There is a great deal of graphic violence here, a huge amount of profanity, some spectacle, some humour, and some very unexpected deaths.Idris Elba's character was clearly intended to be Will Smith's deadshot to the extent of dominating the film (plus having identical abilities and backstory).The Big Bad was very obviously a bloke in a mo-cap suit: some effort should have been given to animating some non-human movement.The tone is noticeably lighter than the previous movie and, once again, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is the standout character, although I did enjoy a number of the others.Yes, I liked it.",The Suicide Squad
15,morrison-dylan-fan,The New Squad.,10,3 August 2021,"Finding the 2016 one (-also reviewed) to be a jumbled mess, I was hesitant to take a look at the new version, until I began to notice a large number of reviews stating surprise at how good the movie was,which led to me and a pal going to meet the new squad.View on the film:Wiping the slate clean with a blazing pre-credits opening, writer/directing auteur James Gunn reunites with cinematographer Henry Braham, and lays out an expansion of his recurring themes and motifs across the galaxy in a distinctive elaborate colour palette that shines in close-ups on the unconventional group of anti-heroes.Keeping to practical effects as much as possible,the screenplay by Gunn uses the Men on a Mission set-up to unleash a live-wire genre mash-up,that goes right back to his Comedy Horror roots, via zombies,sharks and tentacle Monster Movie, that are combined with Gunn's tongue in cheek zinger dialogue looped round each Squad member, whose bond starts to crack with betrayal as they take on the main part of the mission.Backed by a criss-cross of John Murphy's jaunty score and James Gunn's spot-on song choices, the ensemble cast give outstanding performances, with Margot Robbie and John Cena giving wicked pitch black comedic turns as Quinn and Peacemaker as Gunn fires stylish long tracking shots following the gloriously gory, thrilling Action set-piece carnage they leave behind.Perfectly balancing the comedic line from Robbie and Cena, Idris Elba brings a gravitas to the level-headed Bloodsport,whilst Daniela Melchior captures the deeply flawed, but well meaning optimistic heart of the group as Ratcatcher 2,a piper who leads the Squad to victory.",The Suicide Squad

The Suicide Squad this time is recruited for a mission to fight evil international enemies and cons from prison off the island of Corto Maltese.

18,thesar-2,Third Time's...,8,8 August 2021,"Charming, but...took you guys long enough.This was the Marvel equivalent to what they did with The Incredible Hulk years after HULK. But, way better. Hell, even a better soundtrack than the ""original.""I think new-to-DC James Gunn KNEW this soft reboot of 2016's Suicide Squad would be predictable as all hell, and just ran with it. There were virtually no twists not foretold long before they happened and the character's arcs easy to forecast. But, that's okay. Gunn's filmmaking style and storytelling approach, in conjunction with a cast with extreme chemistry was refreshing.The Suicide Squad's back, sorta, and this time they're out to squash an alien. That's it. That's their mission. Of course, with a title like this, it ain't gonna be easy.I loved Margot Robbie again - still the best thing in the original theatrical cut, original extended cut and Birds of Prey. I miss her when she's gone and her scene-stealing when on, welcomed. Luckily, however, we also got the enormously charismatic Idris Elba, a FAR superior Bloodsport than Will Smith could've dreamt of. And I even loved the hilarious Land Shark, Polka Man, the cute driver, Milton and the ""Oh, Rats"" Girl. I actually didn't have a problem with any of the characters here. Or their acting.Being a Gunn movie, it's well written and shot, naturally. But, while I loved how Hard-R this was (there was a penis shot,) and I'm no prude whatsoever, I found the use of the F-word...excessive. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem, but every time they used it, probably 30-35 times, it felt like they were purposely putting it in to make this a Deadpoolesque Adult Comic Book Movie. Basically, a ton of the time, it was unnecessary and actually dragged down Gunn's typically smart dialogue.Second half's WAY better than the first, but once the movie kicked in, I was completely on board and loved it. Plus, again, that music - really kicked ass here. THIS is how you use music in a Suicide Squad movie.***Final Thoughts: Okay, Time to Update my Best-to-Worst DCEU list:1 Man of Steel

19,cherold,Exciting and hilarious film from the Guardians of the Galaxy guy,9,30 August 2021,"Suicide Squad involved the U. S. government sending supervillains on suicide missions of ""national importance."" The movie is very funny, very dark, a bit gorier than I would have liked, and full of amazing action sequences. It's also got a little political commentary about U. S. intervention.The cast is terrific, most notably Margot Robbie, reprising her Harley Quinn role from an earlier ""Suicide Squad"" movie I never saw and the fabulous Birds of Prey. I really love her Harley, a psychopath with a heart of gold and killer reflexes who moves through the film like a chaos agent, fearless and improvident (if I ever watch the first, reputedly terrible Suicide Squad movie, it will be entirely due to Robbie).While the movie is crazy and hilarious, it also manages to put a little heart in, notably in the father/daughter vibe between Idris Elba and Daniela Melchior. Zach Snyder, who attempted and failed to create emotional resonance in Army of the Dead with a similar approach, should watch this movie over and over until he understands how to fit deep emotion and crazy action into a single film.This is a terrific movie, every bit as good as director James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy films, and you should definitely watch it.",The Suicide Squad
20,FeastMode,big asterisk,5,10 August 2021,"My entire review has an asterisk on it. I had a terrible theater experience with a group of teen couples walking in halfway through the movie. Talking, laughing when nothing was funny, using their phones, dropping their phones, using the phone flashlight to find their phones. Smh i wanted to punch them in the face.And i'm the kind of person that can't miss a single line in the movie. I never leave theater while the movie is playing. But they were so distracting that i left to complain. They quieted down when the attendant was standing by them, but as soon as he left, they resumed. I can't stand inconsiderate ppl.As for the movie. It didn't impress me. I was mostly amused/entertained. But i barely laughed. The action is decent but none of the scenes stood out (i'm struggling to remember any later the same night).I don't really know what was missing, but i just felt like it was almost there but not quite. I'll give it another chance and see if i feel differently about it without morons surrounding me. But i could see it going either way, up or downmy biggest disappointment, which i know won't change, is the same major complaint about the first one: in a movie filled with villains, where is the evilness? Where is the darkness? Why do they want to take villains and make a fun superhero movie. We already have a thousand of them. Don't get me wrong, i love me my superhero genre, but you have the ability to make something so unique.Yeah this movie is filled with bad ppl, but they're portrayed as good, loyal ppl. At no point did i feel a bit of evil out of any of them. And i love that they went for it with the R rating, but that makes it even worse. It could have been truly dark and maybe a bit terrifying (1 viewing, 8/9/2021)",The Suicide Squad
21,Cineanalyst,Comically Cinematic,7,6 August 2021,"Not only an inevitably vast improvement upon the wretched 2016 ""Suicide Squad,"" this definite article, ""The Suicide Squad,"" is also one of the more aesthetically like a comic book of the many comic-book movies I've seen and that our culture has clearly become enamored with, although not as reflexively so as, say, the also ultraviolent ""Kick-Ass"" (2010), or going to the visual lengths of Ang Lee's underappreciated ""Hulk"" (2003). That makes sense in a way, as writer-director James Gunn is a veteran of the genre--having already made two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies (2014 and 2017) for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is working on a third, in addition to other superhero flicks such as ""Super"" (2010) and ""Brightburn"" (2019).Although I think his oeuvre has been one of mixed results, few have arguably had more influence on the direction of the genre than him. The MCU was significantly redirected by the self-aware humor, as well as the pop tunes, of the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" I think ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) is an especially evident example of this, playing as it does much like a third ""Guardians"" installment. DC's Extended Universe was affected, too, in their clumsy way of imitation (""Shazam!"" (2019) in particular, and, by way of the ever-more self-referential Marvel property ""Deadpool"" (2016), ""Birds of Prey"" (2020)). Here, thanks to Disney's knee-jerk firing and before their rehiring of Gunn, DC got the real deal. Perhaps, it may also become a variation of a template for future such movies.It's still consistently light and set to rock 'n roll or otherwise pleasant melodies, but we also get some different, more dynamic movement from those RED digital cameras, which is quite congruent with the comic-book look. Nothing too exceptional, but better than others. In addition to bright colors and anthropomorphic sharks, weasels and rats and lethal polka-dots, that look includes the style of the titles, which often are blended in with the scenery, as in the introductory ""Warner Bros. Presents"" being made of the blood splatter from a character's head exploding. In one of the subjective sequences, not only are Harley Quinn's cable-supported fight moves more cartoonish, but, like those filters for people's narcissistic phone videos of themselves farting hearts, smiley faces and the like, Quinn imagines flowers replacing discarded bullet cartridges and the blood and guts erupting from her victims' mutilated bodies. It's also appropriately rated R, which, of course, such a movie should be if we're supposed to accept anti-hero villains as superheroes as in any way subversive--so we see blood, there's foul language, and, perhaps a first for such a high-profile one of these, brief nudity.All of this is welcome. The awareness of the camera is established from the start, with the shot revolving from a puddle reflection--setting the visual tone for the rest of the picture. There are also some especially good moving-camera shots later, such as revolving around Quinn shooting guns in that red dress, a fight seen through a helmet reflection, or during the climactic tower collapse and kaiju battle. As with a comic-book drawing, the CGI-enhanced digital mobility may even allow the ""camera"" to go inside for a view of a heart being stabbed. The entire opening sequence utterly tops, including by some hilarious false leads, the awful introduction of characters in the first ""Suicide Squad."" It's pretty funny to see a rather more realistic outcome of what would happen to such a rag-tag team when confronted with an actual army. Not quite ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), let alone ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), this bunch. Indeed, some of the biggest laughs here come from the squad's incompetence.Perhaps, the only thing that doesn't especially work here is the dissonance of the banana republic, American imperialism political plot beside the picture's otherwise light tone. Crazy, secret experiments and an alien starfish kaiju plot straight out of ""Rick and Morty"" by way of 20th-century sci-fi pulp such as Robert Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" fits, but I'm not sure about geopolitical satire. It's not because I'm against the message, or that it matters whether or not I or you are for or against it. Perhaps, it would work if the rest of the picture were also a satire on comic books, but it's not that. The closest it comes is John Cena's Peacemaker character, so devoted to peace that he's willing to kill as many as he needs to for it. There's still the blockbuster-franchise reverence for itself with the rest of it, comical though it may be, that one wouldn't find with, say, the puppets in ""Team America: World Police"" (2004), which therefore could convincingly make political commentary.Somewhat more effective methinks is the bit of reflexivity by having Viola Davis's character and her covert-government team both directing and spectating the suicide squad via video and audio surveillance. Superheroes as the movie-within-the-movie. This, too, though, is reminiscent of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2011), which itself was rather derivative of ""The Truman Show"" (1998). In this one, however, that comic-book supes movie inside another movie also ends up fighting over another film, which as with most movies these days, is contained on a hard drive. A film within a film within another film and all digital.Besides Gunn, ""The Suicide Squad"" also benefits from recruiting another MCU veteran in Idris Elba, who far outdoes Will Smith in the Will Smith part of squad leader who shoots good. His quarrelling with Cena's costumed crusader with a similar set of skills is an amusing running gag. Wisely, this sequel excises almost everything from the first movie except for its sole silver lining, the always-fantastic Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Although she's arguably absent from too much of it, it's nice that a good, albeit still flawed, movie was finally built around or to accompany her character.",The Suicide Squad
22,ericstevenson,This was amazing!,10,16 August 2021,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was a million times better! I knew this would have a talking shark and a giant starfish. It turned out to also have a human-sized weasel, a woman who could control rats, and regular sized starfish that mind-controlled people! I missed the second ""Suicide Squad"" movie, but didn't need to see it. This was awesome with incredible visuals everywhere!I day say it's the best DC movie I've seen in the past ten years! Anyway, this movie opens with the title squad going out and...promptly dying. Then we find out there's a real suicide squad (though the first one would be more of a suicide squad anyway) who are the real heroes. They are told by Amanda Waller to find out about Project Starro. Halfway through the film, we realize it's about well, the giant Starfish Starro. This has more listed onscreen deaths than any movie ever made!Well, it's certainly one with named characters. It's extremely bloody and violent, but nonetheless breathtakingly beautiful. Harley Quinn is easily at her best in her DCEU appearance. We need something dark for a superhero movie every now and then. There's a lot of great jokes, but not as many as ""Deadpool"". Nathan Fillion is great in any superhero movie he's in, even if it's only briefly. It's incredibly well paced, especially in the final act. The only thing that could have made it better (as I thought while watching it) is if Weasel survived...and guess what happens at the end? ****",The Suicide Squad

It was fun, entertaining, bizarre, wacky, funny, over the top bloody as well as touching and sweet at the end. Here is what happens when there is a right writer and director at the wheel. Its not that i don't like David Ayer - i liked many of his films, but 2016 version sucked - in my opinion.Overall, i won't spoil anything, just going to say that ""The Suicide Squad"" (2021) is a real fun entertainment. Biggest kudos to writer director
James Gunn for making this movie, it was a real blast.And at the end of the day there was King Shark, who absolutely stole every scene for me.

27,The-Sarkologist,Much Better than Expected,8,2 November 2021,"This film turned out to be much better than I expected, though I suspect the reason that I was somewhat hesitant about is is because, well, the other Suicide Squad didn't really grab me in the same what that this one did. Then again, DC does seem to be playing a lot of catch up with Marvel, and seems to be failing more than their main rival. However, this is sort of a cross between a sequal and a soft reboot, and I have to admit that, except of the silliness of the main antagonist, this film was actually really enjoyable.Actually, what I really liked was how James Gunn opened in the film. It seemed to be going in one direction, and all of a sudden he pulls a surprise switcheroo, and suddenly you discover that the film is going in a completely different direction, and the main characters that we are following actually aren't the characters that we are introduced at the beginning of the film. In fact, it did feel that the start of the film was pretty quickly getting into the action, but it quickly starts to make sense.Basically, this is pretty much the same as the original film, namely that the suicide squad is made up of criminals that are expendable, have a bomb implanted into their cranium, and if they succeed then their prison sentences are reduced. Of course we have Harley Quinn, who seems to be pretty popular, though there is a suggestion that Robbie might be taking a bit of a break from the character for a while.Mind you, it is a lot more light hearted than some of the other DC films, which do tend to be quite darker than their Marvel counterparts, but then again I suspect that this might actually be the reason why they didn't end up doing anywhere near as well as Marvel. However, this one certainly does seem to be quite a lot more popular, even though it has been caught up in the pandemic, which means that like a lot of other films it has been pushed back somewhat.Still, it is pretty entertaining, and when I remembered that it was James Gunn that had directed the film, it suddenly made sense as to what the opening was much, much more entertaining that I had expected.",The Suicide Squad

30,Thanos_Alfie,Entertaining...,6,24 September 2021,"""The Suicide Squad"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a group of Supervillains named Task Force X left alone in a remote enemy island of Corto Maltese to carry out a very difficult mission in exchange for lighter sentences.Since I had already watch the first ""Suicide Squad"" movie of 2016 I was expecting something better than this. Thankfully it was far better than the first movie but still it was a bit boring at some moments. In addition to this, comedy was too much sometimes and it had as a result to lose the whole meaning of the movie. The direction which was made by James Gunn who is also the writer of it, it was good and he presented very well his main characters and the plot twists gave a different touch in the movie. The interpretations of Margot Robbie who played as Harley Quinn, John Cena who played as Peacemaker and Joel Kinnaman who played as Colonel Rick Flag were very good and the combination of them worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Suicide Squad"" is a nice action movie to watch and far better than ""Suicide Squad"" of 2016 and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure that it will entertain you.",The Suicide Squad
31,cruise01,James Gunn is meant for the suicide squad franchise which he delivered the action and humor.,10,8 August 2021,"5 out of 5 stars.The Suicide Squad is an awesome sequel that James Gunn brought to life again. The script, humor, the cast ensemble, music score, action, and James Gunns direction. This film does have more of a story and build up with characters unlike the first film.The plot is great. It has the suicide squad lead by Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) and his team going on a dictator controlled island. Where they come across a secret lab which they will have to face against Starro the Conqueror.The film does have a huge cast ensemble. Some are there for brief cameo moments. James Gunn does build a huge list of characters which you should not get too attached when he kills characters off. Even some are unexpectedly.The film does have a lot of action sequences. It is better with the r rating which made it bloody and gory. The opening scene with the squad invading the beach and being attacked was brutal. Plus the new group of characters like Bloodshot (Idris Elba), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchoir), Peacemaker (John Cena) and Polka dot man (David Dastmalchian). These characters were surprisingly a fun addition. The original cast from the previous film was also great with Rick Flagg, Harley Quinn, and Captain Boomerang.Every character had a moment to shine. Idris Elba stole the spotlight as Bloodshot. Along with Margot Robbie and John Cena.The film is violent. Gory and a lot of fun. James Gunns script and direction was exciting and fun. The script had a lot of fun stupid humor. And action packed sequences. The visual effects were great. The music score by John Murphy is great. Added a new tone and theme.Overall, The Suicide Squad is one of the best Dc films and James Gunn delivered and unexpectedly made a better than expected film. It does feel like a Rambo war film with the squad facing against a rebellious Dictators army and fighting there way to a secret lab to come across something more sinister.There is a post credit scene at the very end that will hint towards whats next to come.",The Suicide Squad

33,SAMTHEBESTEST,The Suicide Squad is brutally and abusively funny but bores you sometimes with the overuse of it.,6,6 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad (2021) :
Movie Review -DC universe after Nolan Trilogy has surely struggled, especially compared to Marvel Cinematic Universe. That huge box office collection and universal acclaim didn't really come for any film before 'Joker' and couple of films before that like 'Wonder Woman' and 'The Aquaman' which brought them respectable results, if not great. This Supervillain franchise was completely new kind of experiment for DC as well as for Audience because such wild and nasty theories in comedy genre and negative characters was something unachieved. Suicide Squad (2016) didn't really live upto the hype but surely has its separate fan base and now after 5 years we have the standalone sequel 'The Suicide Squad' for the betterment and improvisation of this new cinematic universe. Supervillains aren't the thing people love and maybe the makers know it and so they present it without any polish or soft corner. They Suicide Squad gets it right and gets it right for 2 long hours with bigger dose of comedy. It's brutal, vulgar and abusive entertainer and so is only made for adults.There is nothing much to talk about the story cause it's not that important nor it offers anything special to be mentioned. Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. The mission turns evil by the end and expectedly we get to see the villains turning into Superheroes. As if we didn't know it from the start. However, the villain here, i mean whatever Kaiju Starfish it is, it's terribly powerful. It's hard to believe that these little birds from The Suicide Squad were up against a humongous monster. A complete one-sided face off it was. But as we all know, heroes always win so just don't try to find any logic in it.The acts and action scenes are superbly performed by all the actors. Margot Robbie has got a ripping-off kind of stuff twice, holy smoke. That's more than what male supervillains have got there. The problem with all the characters is, after a while all of them look cheesy. The same jokes and abuses we enjoy in the first half, starts boring you in the second half due to lack of originality. That's where the screenplay falters, the second half, where mostly there was nothing much of a scope for the writer as major portion is filled with over explosive action sequences. The VFX in last 20 minutes looks poor when that over-imaginative properties fails to create the scary images accurately.James Gunn isn't that bad, but he isn't that great either. He does few things right and so naturally misses some to leave you have space for bashing. I am using that space but i would like to Praise him too for getting few things right, actually better than expected. Overall, The Suicide Squad is a healthy dose of entertainment and undoubtedly the best thing coming out in this Supervillain category recently after Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" but yes it has its own dragging moments that you have to endure.RATING - 6.5/10*",The Suicide Squad

35,southdavid,Suicide is painless,7,2 August 2021,"I found this to be a frustrating experience. Not because I disliked it, but because I really wanted to love it and it never quite got me up there. I enjoyed it, certainly, but for reasons I'll go into, not as much as I'd hoped too.Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) expendable task force are again called in, this time to destroy the scientific research of The Thinker (Peter Capaldi), undertaken on the Island nation of Corto Maltese. Led again by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team includes Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) and Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian). Though the squad meet heavy resistance, the real issue may come from the fact that not all members of the squad have had the same briefing, and that other agendas come into play.I liked it a lot better than the first one, is probably a good place to start. Made at a different time in Warner Brother's overall plan for what to do with the DC licenses, James Gunn was given creative freedom to make the film that he wanted to make. And I truly believe that this is that, the violence and gore that he learned on the Troma films, mixed with the song choices and the wacky characters. It's a lot more fun, and comedic, but crucially a lot more consistent that David Ayer's film.With the comedy and the visual effects there's much to enjoy, but as I said in my initial paragraph, I never quite got to the stage where I truly loved the film, rather than just liked it. I think the problem is probably the story itself. Rather than a complete plot, it's more like a series of loosely connected scenes, some of which are fun, some of which are less so. It's pretty laggy in the middle, lacking perhaps an action scene in there. Really, more should have been made of the convincing of ""The Thinker"" to be convinced to participate. The ending is pretty strong though, once the bombs have gone off.I'd watch another one, should DC decide to go back to this well again but, again, whilst I thought this was good, the great ""Suicide Squad"" movie remains elusive.",The Suicide Squad
36,Vartiainen,Magnificent tastelessness,9,12 October 2021,"Textbook example on how it actually matters who's behind the wheel. The Suicide Squad is a 2021 James Gunn soft reboot of the original 2016 DCEU film Suicide Squad, while still working as a sequel to it. The 2016 film is garbage. It very comfortably competes for the title of the worst DCEU film. And it has some competition there.But when you put the man behind The Guardians of the Galaxy on the job. The man who went and though that sure, general masses and mainstream viewing audiences will like this talking raccoon and his tree friend in this ultra sleek science fiction superhero film. Sure, that will sell. And when you give that man an A grade budget and the complete freedom to do whatever he likes.Well then you get gold like this.I am absolutely positive The Suicide Squad was not shown to any kind of test audience. It was not written by a committee. The studio did not meddle with it. Why do I know this? Because it's absolutely bat guano unhinged. And it's so gleeful about it. There's violence aplenty, there's tasteless jokes, there's stuff you've only seen in your nightmares.And I love it for that! This is James Gunn simply having fun. Throwing stuff together that would normally make absolutely no sense whatsoever, but which he makes work through sheer bravado. It works because Gunn wills it to work. And somehow it does.I'm in some ways at a loss of words when it comes to this film. I never thought I would see something like this. Or at least with this kind of a budget.

Soon enough, things go wrong, very wrong. But then we learn that another Suicide Squad team is getting onto the island. What the heck is going on here? We then go to ""3 days earlier"" as Bloodsport is cleaning the prison's floor. At this point we are 10 min. Into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the long-delayed follow-up to the original Suicide Squad film in 2016. Don't call it a sequel, though, as much (but not all) of the original cast isn't returning. It's more like a reboot, as if regretting how not very good (ok, worse than that) the 2016 film ultimately turned out. A reboot already? Yup, already. This one is written and directed by James ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Gunn. One thing is clear: once the decision was made that the 2021 reboot was going to get an R rating, Gunn decided to make it as hard an R rating as possible. None of that matters of course, as long as the story line works well and the characters are fully developed. Alas, that is where this movie falls way short. There is no character development whatsoever, as if it is assumed that the viewer already knows these characters (some viewers may some of these characters, but surely not all viewers and not all characters). As for the actual story line, it's hard to say anything about it without spoiling so I won't. For me (and I realize this is a subjective view), it all made for scatterbrained viewing, and in the end this movie didn't do anything for me, sorry.""The Suicide Squad"" opened wide in theaters this weekend but also was available for streaming on HBO Max, where I caught it. The initial box office reports are not very kind, and make this the lowest opening weekend gross ever in the DCEU.

With James Gunn on board and an R rating to boot though things were looking promising. After it was released to a very positive response I realised I had to go and do something I almost never do - watch a superhero (anti-superhero?) movie. And I'm glad I did. This movie is a lot of fun.I love that it doesn't take itself too seriously first of all. Similar to the other superhero series I enjoy 'Deadpool', when these films are more relaxed in their approach they become infinitely more enjoyable. 'Batman' is about the only one I can stomach being overly serious.The R rating gives this film so much more freedom. Some of the kills are absolutely brutal in this movie. Also the swearing, while not over-used, added that little bit of extra grit each time it was needed.The characters are so much fun in this movie. I was a little skeptical when I heard about a character whose power was to throw polka dots, but Gunn not only finds a way to make it work, but makes him brilliant and one of the best characters. Harley Quinn is the star though. This is the best use of her character yet. She is in her element and off the wall bonkers. Anything could happen when she's on screen and she is hilarious at the same time.Gunn is a director in full control of his project. He does things other directors wouldn't dare even consider, and he makes them work time after time. This film works on every level and I highly recommend checking it out. 9/10.",The Suicide Squad
40,DarkVulcan29,The most edgiest DCEU film ever.,8,16 August 2021,"Don't get me wrong DC movies have gone a little edgy but The Suicide Squad takes it a step further. Unlike the last Suicide Squad(2016) film, this film holds nothing back, not a film kids will like.The cast seem to play off each other perfectly, I love the witty banter between Idris Elba who plays Bloodsport, and John Cena who plays Peacemaker. Not to mention Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, although it's not focused on her too much, but when it does she really does shine. Viola Davis is also great again as Amanda Waller. Plays well as an action film and black comedy, this is a DC movie for adults, not for the whole family.",The Suicide Squad
41,stevendbeard,Bloody Good,8,6 August 2021,"I saw ""The Suicide Squad"", starring Margot Robbie-Bombshell, Pan Am_tv; Idris Elba-Cats, the Thor movies; John Cena-F9:The Fast Saga, Bumblebee and Viola Davis-How to Get Away With Murder_tv, Ender's Game.The big difference between this movie and the one from 2016-besides the 'The' in the title-is that this one is rated 'R' and bloody good. It's also directed by James Gunn. I liked the first one but this one is better. The premise-for non comic fans-is that a secret branch of the government uses convicted criminals to do dirty missions, in exchange for time off of their sentences. Some don't always make it back, hence the name Suicide Squad-actually called 'Task Force X'-and you will recognize a lot of the volunteers. In this movie, you have a few returning characters and a bunch of new ones. Margot is Harley Quinn, Viola is Waller-she sends the teams on their missions-Idris is Bloodsport and John is Peacemaker. FYI: John has been given the green light for a new Peacemaker series on HBO in 2022, so you can pretty well guess that he survives. Plot wise, their mission is to go to an island and take out an alien that is going to be used as a weapon-and for the comic fans, the alien is familiar from the JLA books-so two separate teams are deployed. And, not all of them survive. John Ostrander was the writer on the original Suicide Squad comics and he makes a cameo as Dr Fitzgibbon. There is a lot of humor as well as the bloody action-some of the blood splatter reminded me of the last Rambo movie-so don't take the little kids to this one. Besides the violence, there is nudity, both male & female. There is a scene as the end credits start and one scene after the end credits are over.It's rated ""R"" for violence, gore, language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",The Suicide Squad

43,kevin_robbins,The first one was much better than this.,3,23 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad (2021) is a movie we saw last week in theatres. The storyline follows a ""suicide mission"" on an island that needs to be executed and those who would execute the mission faces impossible odds. They need to infiltrate a base and destroy it. The base houses aliens set on world domination and has thousands of troops protecting it. Based on the odds and those selected for the mission, what could go wrong? This movie is directed by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and stars Margot Robbie (Wolf of Wall Street), Idris Elba (The Losers), Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer), John Cena (12 Rounds), Viola Davis (The Help) and Pete Davidson (The King of Staten Island). The storyline for this is very straightforward and the action scenes are appropriately over the top. The dialogue is funny and pretty clever and the film starts off very good. I really enjoyed the introduction of the characters as they are rolled out and the mission begins...and then the movie entirely falls apart. The focus on one character at a time as they executed their action scenes was terrible. It just become blatantly bad. I'm not sure if it was an artistic attempt or DC Universe sabotage by Gunn. The initial villain was very good and the movie should have probably stopped there; unfortunately, they decided one more super villain was needed, and it was an abomination. Overall there were aspects of this film that were entertaining and this film had some potential, but trying to be too stylish and creative sunk the ship of this having any hope of being good. The first one was much better than this. I would score this a 3/10.",The Suicide Squad
44,robfollower,The Suicide Squad(2021),8,7 September 2021,"This film has a lot of balls. I can see people thinking this one is far too weird and bizarre . But for me that what makes this film so brilliant ; raw-- politically incorrect -- uber violent. The shock factor alone sold me from the very beginning. Absolutely an eccentric ride envisioned by writer-director James Gunn's singularly skewed vision, The Suicide Squad marks a funny, fast-paced rebound that plays to the source material's violent, anarchic strengths.Welcome to hell--a.k.a. Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A. Where the worst Super-Villains are kept and where they will do anything to get out--even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X. Today's do-or-die assignment? Assemble a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin and everyone's favorite psycho, Harley Quinn. Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave...and Amanda Waller's government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement. And as always, one wrong move and they're dead (whether at the hands of their opponents, a teammate, or Waller herself). If anyone's laying down bets, the smart money is against them--all of them.'The Suicide Squad' represents the very best that DC films can be, taking the kind of risks that you wouldn't see in a Marvel property.Its has dark wit ultra violence and refusing to apologize for it . Those who dig its bat-s h i t crazy tone will have a lot of fun watching this crazy, chaotic -- and unexpectedly good -- flick.",The Suicide Squad
45,alindsay-al,A Fantastic Bloody Film,9,31 July 2021,"At the beginning of the year The Suicide Squad was my most anticipated film of 2021 and last night I finally got the chance to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of super villains bought together to take down a new intergalactic threat.Main Character
Idris Elba is given the chance to be a lead character here as Bloodsport and he is fantastic. His comedic timing is actually very good, and he has plenty of heartfelt moments and is really effective as a character. There is an argument that his character is incredibly similar to Deadshot from the previous film but I feel Elba manages to add enough to make this character his own.Supporting Characters
This film has one of the biggest casts ever put on film but some play larger roles then others and without spoiling things I will talk about them. John Cena makes his debut as Peacemaker and he was a real highlight of the film for me, his character is so interesting and Cena manages to use his natural charisma to make this a memorable character showing that given the right material he can deliver. Margot Robbie is back as Harley Quinn and what is there to say, she was literally born to play this role and brings the character to life so well. There are some things involving her character I wasn't a huge fan of but there is no denying how great Robbie is in the role. The real breakout star for the film though is Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, she bring so much heart and emotion to the role and considering that she is one of the least known comic book characters ever, she really resonates with the audience and I think we will see much more from this actress in the future. Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis are back as Rick Flag and Amanda Waller from the previous Suicide Squad film and they are much improved here. Flag is actually an interesting and well realised character and Waller is the intimidating boss that she really should be. We also have our big CGI character in King Shark voiced by Sylvester Stallone and he is so cool to watch in action and there is also some heart towards this guy and he will probably be one that people will talk about coming out of the film.Story
The story is decent, the chemistry between the team is so much better then the previous film and the unique and distinctive personalities of each squad member does shine and provide a great experience. The task that they are given is fun enough but it is these characters and the outrageous circumstances that they are put in that rise it above. However, this film does have some story issues, mainly what they do with Harley Quinn in the first and mostly second act, she is on her own and it feels a bit out of place and a slower placed part of the film. Also there is some side plot involving a corrupt government and resistance that doesn't really do much for the film and feels like another not important element of the plot.Script
The script is really good, it has that James Gunn directed wicked humour. With the more mature script it allows way more creative freedom and the majority of the characters are pretty funny. Some of the jokes feel a bit repetitive but I can't deny that I laughed pretty consistently throughout the film. The drama also works, I ended up caring about this group of bad guys and I think the film does an effective job of giving you reasons to care.Style
The style of the film has some really great and entertaining action sequences. This film has the violence and gore that is appropriate for a film called The Suicide Squad. The characters get there own big set pieces and the action is probably the best part of this really well paced out film.Overall
Overall, The Suicide Squad is a fantastic film that finally delivers a film worthy of the licence. This film is such an entertaining watch that all comic book fans have to watch it and others will probably enjoy it too.",The Suicide Squad

47,henry8-3,The Suicide Squad,7,7 August 2021,"Bad Corporate America in the shape of Viola Davis forces Idris Alba (Bloodsport) to lead a group of tough mercenaries including Harlequin (Margot Robbie) and Peacemaker (John Cena) on to a small military run island off South America to destroy a tower containing a secret lab and the associated records.Wonderfully imaginative, very funny and excessively gory. The action, humour and general spectacle never stop with so many great characters and delightfully choreographed action set pieces. Alba is great in the lead with fine support from the rest of the cast but with special mention for Margot Robbie who shines as Harlequin for a third time and Peter Capaldi as The Thinker who knows what's in the tower and the secrets of why Davis wants everything destroyed. It is wildly OTT and gets even more so towards its spectacular climax, but if you can live with the bizarre ideas here, it's great fun.",The Suicide Squad
48,lukem-52760,Awesome Bloody Good Fun But I Still Like The First More & We Needed DEADSHOT!!!,8,9 November 2021,"I wasn't bothered about this reboot as it didn't have the legendary Will Smith back as Deadshot & he was the best thing about David Ayer's Suicide Squad movie but as i saw more trailers it did look like fun & it was.Now Deadshot was missed here definitely & i believe Bloodsport's part was Deadshot's in the script because he even had his troubled story with his daughter, it was all so Deadshot. So yes Deadshot should've definitely been in this movie & it would've been better for it. I also much preferred the Awesome Enchantress as the main villain in the other version rather than the huge alien starfish & the Thinker but what i did prefer here was all the Awesome blood & guts action that was missing from the first film. I so wish we got to see Deadshot blasting bad guys to gory bits. Of course here though it's Idris Elba's savage Assassin ""Bloodsport"" that steals the show or atleast in my opinion anyway. Imagine Bloodsport & Deadshot teamed up!!!The Suicide Squad was a mix of Stallone's The Expendables films & The Dirty Dozen & David Ayer's Suicide Squad & it was a ferocious & funny blast of entertainment. This Suicide Squad was way funnier than the first & i liked the new team especially Peacemaker (John Cena) who is hilarious & extremely deadly at the same time & Idris Elba's dangerous Assassin Bloodsport. Also Stallone's King Shark was great fun & Margot Robbie was excellent again as the wild Harley Quinn (A role she's perfected now) & it was nice to have tough soldier Rick Flag back again played by Joel Kinnaman. There's a nice excepting friendship between Harley & Flag because of what they went through together in the first film. The first film definitely did happen & this is definitely a sequel so i wish Deadshot was mentioned & Killer Croc. Joel Kinnaman was excellent as Rick Flag & has a fantastic fight with Peacemaker. The action is fantastically violent as it should be with blood everywhere & that was missing from the first film but what this one was missing was a big heart at it's centre. Ratcatcher 2 is a good character & is the emotional aspect of the movie but it was Deadshot that grounded everything in the first film with Smith's incredible performance & the team in the first had a real family vibe by the end that i loved.James Gunn's The Suicide Squad is Awesome bloody fun (The Weasel was hilarious lol) but David Ayer's Suicide Squad had more heart, a much better villain (Enchantress), Will Smith as Deadshot & a better looking movie. Both great in their own ways but Ayer's is the better movie in my opinion.",The Suicide Squad

This didnt have the great story, I didnt feel the emotion. I liked the gore but if it was a pg 13 it would have been a 1. I give it a 3 for gore. The action was decent but I've seen much better. No character development at all and I usually dont want any but it was needed here. For over 2 hours I should have felt something and I didnt . I didnt connect with any characters , come on you think there was a star lord? A drax? Not any better than the 1st film I liked will smith and Margot in the 1st film better.

50,Pairic,A Suicide Squad With Teeth!,9,1 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad: best to think of this as a reboot rather than a sequel, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is back, and Bloodsport (Idris Elba) replaces Deadshot, along with a host of other meta-human jailbirds they are offered ten years off their sentences if the volunteer for a suicide mission. Col. Flag (Joel Kinnaman) returns as their leader. This film goes far beyond the usual comic book level violence. People are eaten alive by King Shark (voice - Sylvester Stallone), heads crushed, enemies set on fire, boomerangs cut off brain pans. Harley carries out mass slaughter on an industrial scale and she also becomes the love interest of a Dictator whose island the Squad invades. But there is the human side to things, especially with Ratcatcher (Daniela Melchior) who controls rats, plays beauty to King Shark's beast and tries to help Bloodsport to overcome his rat-phobia, there is also a touching flashback to her creation story. Less humane is the way that her hordes of rats swarm over humans and eat them alive. Throw in a mad scientist experimenting on a giant Alien Starfish which spawns to create human zombies and you have another action vector. There are quite a few plot twists from early on in the film, to reveal any would be to spoil the fun. And fun there is along with adult level slaughter. Writer/Director James Gunn delivers a cracking good adventure which blurs the lines between good/evil meta-humans. 8.5/10.",The Suicide Squad

Their mission; eliminate the threat (& any evidence of the US's involvement) before the new military regime can act. Along the way, the carpet is constantly pulled out from under us as certain members of the squad are killed before the mission begins & others who on the surface are deemed to be too fringe (Dastmalchian's Polka Dot Man & Daniela Melchoir's Ratchcatcher II) step up to the plate & actually win over our hearts. W/a constant grin & a consistent stream of belted guffaws, I was entertained from frame one (the Warner Bros. Logo spelled out in blood across the ocean!). Let's hope the series will continue (Cena's Peacemaker will make an appearance in some future project) as future filmmakers will take Gunn's approach; take your cheese seriously...maybe. Also starring Storm Reid as Elba's daughter, Taika Waititi as Melchoir's dad, Oscar nominee Viola Davis returning as Amanda Waller, Sylvester Stallone as the voice of King Shark, James' brother Sean plays the Weasel & another tat faced inmate, Peter Capaldi (late of Dr. Who) as the Thinker & Alice Braga as a freedom fighter in Corto Maltesse.",The Suicide Squad
54,questl-18592,THE,7,11 September 2021,"Expectations were pretty low for this one. Suicide Squad was an awful movie that bought a soundtrack Oscar. Could adding 'The' really turn around such a train wreck?Answer: Kinda?'The' is a better movie, no question about it. There's more interest in these characters all around, from what they do to who they are. The styling works here much more than it did in the first Squad flick, the bright colors and over the top antics make this feel much more fun than the dower and bleak nonsense of the first. It's still off though and I think the editing team needed to be reigned in a bit because they go really over the top on some of the title cards and hyperstylizing.It's a perfect background movie though. There's enough crazy here that anytime you glance at the screen there's likely something interesting going on. I just don't think the product, as a whole, has much substance to it but what it lacks in substance it counters with flash. There's a definite sense of fun here that gives it a marked leg up on it's predecessor.",The Suicide Squad
55,aidanratesmovies,Nom Nom,8,6 August 2021,"At times tonally messy- but altogether quite a blast- The Suicide Squad may not be as great as Gunn's Guardians films but it is a solidly entertaining flick and a ton of fun. The main issue I had with the film is the tone at times. I get it's supposed to be a comedy, but at times it just felt a bit awkward when involving certain events that happened that I can't get into detail here. Besides that though- the film is very well done. It has a very bizarre sense of storytelling which is as entertaining as it is original- and Gunn's script allows for the characters to be fleshed out far more naturally than the last Suicide Squad film and with far more heart. The soundtrack is incredible as always, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning as well as the comic-accurate costumes throughout. It may be expected, but the CGI and VFX throughout the film are absolutely mesmerizing- and honestly some of the most realistic and fun usage of them on film in quite a long time. It's pretty clear when watching the film that this is Gunn's vision, and it's so exciting to be a part of. On the other side of things though, we have several great performances through our lead actors that are honestly some of the best the DCEU has had to offer. Idris Elba is great as Bloodsport, as well as John Cena as Peacemaker; as well as one of my personal favorites, David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man. Of course we also have the finamous Sylvester Stalone providing a hilarious voice performance as King Shark, but what stands out most among the performers is none other than actess Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn who just steals every scene she is a part of and accounts for some of the most elabroate shts in the film. In the end, The Suicide Squad is tonally flawed at times, but it is quite a blast, and I wouldn't mind catching it again sometime.My Rating: 8.4/10.",The Suicide Squad
56,valleyjohn,Guardians DC style,8,2 August 2021,"Having just watched the first Suicide Squad yesterday and been pleasantly surprised I was looking forward to seeing what magic James Gunn was going to bring to the show and I wasn't disappointed at all . DC have gone all Guardians of the Galaxy and that's a really good thing .Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese.This has Gunn's stamp all over it . It has a banging soundtrack, superb action and most enjoyably of all , it's bloody funny!The story , as I find in a lot of superhero films ( Anti hero's in this case ) is mostly irrelevant .It's all about the dialogue and characters and they have got most of them just right .Never afraid to bump of a big character makes it unpredictable and exciting as well.As in the first film , I thought the enemy wasn't worthy of the film . This starfish baddie was even more lame than the witch of the original but that really didn't seem to matter because the film is so much fun .Looking at the ratings for Suicide Squad and The Suicide Squad , they are massively disproportionate because both are 4 out of 5 films for me although if I had a gun to my head to pick which I though was the best I'd say the latter - Just .",The Suicide Squad

58,davidmvining,Gunn without Structure,5,21 August 2021,"I think it's pretty obvious that James Gunn doesn't agree with me about ensemble movies, not that he thinks they're easy, but that we differ on how good ones are constructed. I feel that ensemble movies are hard because you have to create a variety of different characters all swirling around one thing, and that their journeys need to interrelate on some level beyond the mechanics of plot to help reinforce the central point of the film. Gunn sees ensemble pieces differently. He seems to see them as large canvases for him to fill in with whatever his imagination deems amusing at the time with little regard to structure. There's definitely entertainment to be had with Gunn's approach, but I ultimately find it a frustrating kind of entertainment that's fun in spurts but ultimately feels like its constantly stopping and going instead of being handled by an artist who understands exactly where the narrative train needs to end up.Gunn's haphazard approach to structure often works against him, but I feel like his opening to The Suicide Squad actually works fairly well. We are introduced to Task Force X, a team of half a dozen criminals with super abilities sent to the small Caribbean nation of Corto Maltese. Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), they land on the beach in the middle of the night and immediately get wiped out by the local army leaving only Flag and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) alive. This is told through the eyes of Michael Rooker's Savant, brought into the mission and our very quick introductory eyes into the rules of the world, including the pressure that Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) brings to convincing these prisoners to go on her missions for her, and ultimately how she deals with people who refuse her orders (heads go boom). All of this mission, though, was a mere distraction for the actual force with the actual mission, though, and the way the film jumps from the distraction to the real team and then back in time three days to see how the real team was formed is an amusing misdirect that I feel like is a fun way to begin the film, especially when you consider the gore that Gunn loves to wallow in, being able to put it all on full display with this R-rated DC comic book movie.The real team is led by Idris Elba's Bloodsport, an assassin who can't miss, followed by John Cena's Peacemaker, David Dastmalchian's Polka-Dot Man, Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 (her father was the original), and Sylvester Stallone as the walking shark Nanaue. These five have the mission of finding Jotunheim, a secret installation, home to Project Starfish, and destroy it after the country of Corto Maltese has fallen to a military coup. This cast of colorful characters gets moments throughout the film to highlight their unique personalities, and there's interest to be had here. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be Polka-Dot Man, subjected to alien experiments by his mother that gave him an extra-terrestrial virus that manifests in the form of circular, primary-colored discs that he must expel in one way or another twice a day. The problem is that his back story comes at the most random time where all progress in the story unnaturally comes to a stop for him to tell his tale.And that's the sort of thing that happens to all of them except the characters that we already know, Flag and Quinn. In between, there are definitely amusing bits like the competition between Bloodsport and Peacemaker as they walk into an enemy camp, brutally murdering enemy combatants along the way to the central tent, trying to one-up the other with Bloodsport realizing, in comedic fashion, that Peacemaker had the better time of it than him. But, instead of moving on with the story, the effort to capture the scientist in charge of Project Starfish to get them inside, we have to catch up with Quinn who has been captured by the military and brought to the president because he had fallen in love with her. Again, this isn't necessarily bad stuff, but it's the story grinding to a halt completely to tell what essentially amounts to a nearly unrelated short film.I will say this, I think this is the first time that Harley Quinn feels right. I don't have a lot of history with her, having only watched The Animated Series a bit as a kid and never reading her in the comics, but moreso than in the original Suicide Squad and definitely more than in Birds of Prey, Quinn feels like an interesting character as she kills the president because she got a bad feeling about him, and she made a promise to herself to do the right thing the next time she got a bad feeling about a man she was involved with by murdering him. When she breaks out of captivity on her own, it's the absolute best use of her from an action sequence standpoint so far. Gunn knows to give her lots of guns and plenty of environmental tools to make her sequence where she kills several dozen soldiers feel believable, and the effect of taking it somewhat subjective by having flowers explode everywhere as the sequence crescendos is actually quite nice to see. My problem is that this sequence feels like it could have been pretty much cut completely and we wouldn't have missed anything particularly important to the actual story at hand.The actual story, if you were going to dig through the morass of different threads, seems to be about American efforts to push off its dirty work onto third-world countries, and it doesn't really manifest until something like 90 minutes into the 130-minute-long movie. America hired Corto Maltese to study a space starfish that expelled smaller version of itself that attached to the faces of people and starts controlling them, turning them into extensions of itself. The rest of the film is this huge battle to take it out, using everyone's special abilities to attack Starro in a weird version of the ending of The Avengers (I would be surprised if Gunn wasn't consciously mirroring the MCU team up movie), and it's nice to look at.That being said, though, it ends up feeling like a purely technical exercise because it's just the latest in a series of events. It doesn't feel like the culmination of a story. The whole 90 minutes that preceded it was a random collection of moments of people, connected only by the barest of mechanical plot strings. There's nothing thematic undergirding the earlier moments that brings them together with the larger plot in the form of the giant Starfish that attacks the city, so I end up looking at this finale as mere spectacle and nothing else. It's pretty in the Gunn twisted kind of way, but I end up feeling like it's really empty.I know this film is getting pretty universal praise, and I sort of get it. It's thinly entertaining, but it doesn't really gel overall. It's the best the DCEU has been since Shazam!, though.",The Suicide Squad

The movie is over two hours long, and in the ever shrinking span of paying attention it's important to keep that time period interesting. Gunn accomplishes this quite well, providing little down time in this action/adventure to keep your eyes focused on the chaos before you. When not drowning you in uber violent fight sequences, the movie is spending much of its time shoving jokes down your gullet keeping you entertained to avoid sleeping through this adventure. That pace cuts through what could have been a slog and gets thumbs up from yours truly.The Comedy At Times:
James Gunn loves making you laugh, and he tries very hard in this film to pull out a more mature approach than what Guardians did. The Suicide Squad is more of that darker comedy we got with Deadpool, censoring little and forcing you into awkward territory in ways that sometimes are perfect for inciting a laugh. King shark's limited knowledge and naivety is a large source of the laughs, alongside Cena's still awkward performances that fit decently well in his toilet crowned character. Banter by Harley also helps lighten things up, and Gunn's colorful vision does a nice job helping make her psychosis enjoyable without overdoing it too much. It's clever moments like this that were very entertaining for me to watch and one of the bigger strengths of the film.Some of the Character Usage/Acting:
When the dust finally settles, Gunn accomplishes using some of the Squad quite well in this adventure. Elba's Bloodsport and John Cena's Peacekeeper have a rivalry that is fun to watch and gets quite the presentation on the screen. Much like a DC book, the dark broodiness and edge of the DC was fun to watch, as their intensity bled out into the rest of the team. Harley once again steals the show with her antics, but unlike Birds of Prey gets grounded into manageable levels of fun that fits well with the theatrics of the film and other partygoers. Secondary characters get some decent screen time involvement, using their ridiculous titles as a fantastic joke fodder, while pulling out some surprises to mix it up. It's Ratcatcher II though played by Daniela Melchior who was my favorite, as she had a dynamic that was fun, a story that was deeper than most others, and some fun interactions with the cast that required good chemistry. Almost like a glue to keep this heated bunch together, Ratcatcher II was a very enjoyable character to watch and only needed some better action coordination to really make her complete for me.The Graphics/Visuals
Better than some of the computer work I've seen come out of the woodwork, DC invested some time and money to helping add more realistic sheen and grit to the details at hand. King Shark is a beast of fluid animation and uncomfortable stares of his eyes, while the dreaded Project Starfish has a blend of cartoony with real life that feels a nice hybrid of the worlds. Special effects are edited well to make the fights pop, and maintain the darker tones of the film including immersing you in the carnage at hand. I enjoyed the makeup and effects to further bring out the characters, including the costumes that once again feel like live versions of the costumes from the graphic novels I read.DISLIKES:The Plot is Okay:
Where Justice League's plots held lots of arcs coming together, Shazam had surprising deep character morals, and Man of Steel a deeper dive into the psyche of superman that was okay, The Suicide Squad's plot was much simpler than other installments. A little buddy dynamic chemistry is primary well point, otherwise it's a lot of mashed together simple plots for a grandiose mission with little details or surprise. Sure, a twist tries to shake things up, but in reality the story feels like a contained volume of a comic book that is begging for more time to tell the tale. What is probably the worst part of the story though, is how they seem to change their mind near the end and try to make this thing be a bigger part, again setting up the potential for the Suicide Squad universe to exist in the future. The ambiguity of the ending is only offset by trying to figure out where this thing fits in regards to the original given the poor recap of the first squad to save time. That sort of sloppy storytelling can be ignored to a point, but the bigger piece is still unanswered at this time.The Action is Okay:
I don't know why D. C. seems to struggle with coming up with quality actions scenes, but this movie sort of continues that trend that despite the promise we had. Outside of a few fights, most of the skirmishes are kind of senseless, rather dumb, and over before they built up steam. While I know that Gunn put a point to his decisions, but I'm honestly wishing they could add a little more traditional acting and fighting that films like Winter Soldier, Iron Man 1, and Avengers 1 achieved. Yet, this film is all about the darker side of action and comedy styles, so I guess I should not be surprised that the action took a turn the way it did.The Violence/Gore aspect:
I can handle the gore pretty well and fortunately not too much body horror/torture to drag things out. However, I warn those who hate excessive gore to steer clear of Gunn's work unchained. The Suicide Squad has no problem showing you the horrors of ""black ops missions"" and just how detrimental war can be on a body. Spit heads, burnt corpses, devoured frames and all the blood and viscera to go for it are on full display in this movie. While this goes with the carnal edge the Squad often has with it, I think it got a bit too excessive at times and the money could have been spent elsewhere on better fights, more time for storytelling, etc. While some of the blood was a perfect touch to death at hand, I think the ridiculous levels were a bit too much of the focus for this reviewer.Forced Humor:
Perhaps the other limitation of this movie is the fact that Gunn almost seemed to tried too hard to make us laugh for this film. For a while now super hero movies seem to struggle with filling time with lots of humor, shoe horning jokes in to get you laughing, or trying to be so dark and different that it comes out corny and quite the opposite effect. The Suicide Squad definitely felt that way for me and though it nailed the timing and punches perfectly, much of the darker humor was quite stiff either due to commercials or the volume we got. Again, his work in Guardians was smoother, more natural, and offset by other factors to give us a break, but this work... not even close to the balance he had, showing sometimes an R rating can remove too much of the boundaries for one to lose focus.The VERDICT:
The Suicide Squad was better than the first installment in this group, which for many is not going to be a surprise given how the bar was set. James Gunn shows his humor bone in a darker tone in this film, trying to merge action and comedy into an adventure that is up his unique style. He made a movie that moves well, with a pace and focus that was just about enjoying the volume and having fun in the absurd mission our colorful cast must complete. Some highlight moments blend the worlds perfectly together, and several of the characters show just what the first film could have been with the right direction helming the ship. However, the R rating almost removed too much of the filter for Gunn and that freedom sort of got in the way of the quality I have seen in the past. His ambiguous plot building and the politics complicating DC timelines makes the simplistic tale confusing to determine its place in the world. In addition the violence and gore got a little more focus than say some choreography and ingenuity that I think he could have had our group really pull off with the potential. Yet it's the forced humor and poor overall character usage that I think takes away from this movie, and trying too hard to get a laugh leaving me in cricket chirping stupor at how much he tried to make the jokes work.Overall, my scores for the film are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie overall: 7.0.",The Suicide Squad
60,Kingslaay,I had really hoped for more,5,11 September 2021,"When I heard about a kind of remake of Suicide Squad I was pleased. Good on the producers and studio I thought to resuscitate a film that bombed the first time. However for me this was a disappointing film. It honestly felt like the story was written within a week. Even with the thin story, the poor pacing, weak character development and randomness of it was hard to buy into. The star studded cast couldn't save it. I couldn't tell where the heck the film was going. The humour fell flat and they tried to succeed at things Marvel did so well. Why is DC cursed with their superhero movies? Such a shame.",The Suicide Squad

63,Abdulxoxo,"The Suicide Squad, an engaging, gleefully over the top, completely bonkers action adventure that mostly hits the target.",8,10 August 2021,"The film follows the Suicide Squad as they try to uncover a sinister experiment that has been brewing for the past many years in a South American island-nation. Together this bizarre mix of criminals must find a way to co-exist in order to save the world.The Suicide Squad does something astonishing from a film in this genre. This movie jumps straight into the action with no real need for a bloated explanation, as the 2016's suicide squad did most of the heavy lifting when it comes to establishing the set-up of bringing a group of villains. It has absolutely no problem killing off a large portion of its characters throughout the entire film in creatively gruesome and often unpredictable ways. The action scenes are fantastic. Not only is every action sequence splattered with chunky entrails, but the movie does a great job with presenting it with plenty of artistic shots (including one fight scene that you watch on the reflection of a helmet) as well as editing that often plays around with time in unique ways. The opening sequence kicks things off with an unexpected bang. Throughout the film you could tell a lot of time and money went into choreographing the action and utilising the visual effects really well. The level of violence is brilliant. If you enjoy blood and gore, you'll have a good time with 'The Suicide Squad'. The score/soundtrack, the costumes, the hair & makeup, as well as the production design also deserve a lot of praise.What makes this all the more entertaining is that we care about these characters. One of the major criticisms of the 2016 film was how little we were made to care for (or even remember) the supporting members. This time Gunn introduces us to our squad gradually, developing them throughout the movie, building up an emotional attachment to them by the final act. The cast also do a tremendous job in making these 'villains' likable protagonists. The charming insanity and sheer beauty of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, the charismatic machismo and amusing seriousness of John Cena's Peacemaker, the endearing attitude and sheer commitment of Idris Elba's Bloodsport, the expected badassery and oddly adorableness of Sylvester Stallone's King Shark, the always great and unhinged ferocity of Viola Davis's Amanda Waller, the delightful appeal and weirdly heartfelt core of Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2. There's plenty of actors with each having just as much fun with their roles as the audience is with the movie itself.If I were to criticise anything I would have to say There are a few scenes that are a bit unnecessary and end of slowing down the pace in the middle act. Some of the character motivations don't always make sense or are a little inconsistent. Also, not every joke lands though that's expected with almost any comedy. But it doesn't change the fact that The Suicide Squad is an exponential improvement over the first that's an outrageously violent, frequently hysterical, impressively stylish, and unapologetically bonkers comic book feature that stands as one of DC's very best films.",The Suicide Squad
64,arungeorge13,James Gunn takes the DCEU to unimaginable heights! [+73%],7,10 August 2021,"James Gunn knows how to build chemistry between his superhero leads. This is exactly what worked in GOTG and what works in The Suicide Squad. It is THE Suicide Squad movie that we always needed. We have (relatable) anti-hero characters that make sense, have solid motivations, and supported by splendid-looking set-pieces. As one might expect with Gunn, the humor lands - and it mostly lands well. When you have a bunch of anti-heroes coming together for a do-or-die mission, it's not always easy to pen (and stage) scenes that paint them differently from regular superheroes in the DCEU. They have to be subtly contrasting (when it comes to decisions and actions), but never in-your-face. Gunn visualizes it in a manner that few other film-makers could.The ensemble (comprising majorly of Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Daniela Melchior, David Dastmalchian, and Viola Davis - with cameos from Michael Rooker, Jai Courtney, Pete Davidson, and more) is tremendous. Gunn approves of David Ayer's casting choices though he does away with some from the 2016 version albeit in a highly amusing way. The R-rating is fully warranted as human bodies get sliced, diced, and exploded in bizarre ways only someone like Gunn can envision. He's able to seamlessly blend multiple genres into a single film - that in itself is quite an achievement.The pacing, the twists, and the one-liners are all conceived better in 2021 version as opposed to the 2016 version. I even liked how Gunn adds a very comic-book-like effect (using the specific scene's environment) to let viewers know if the timeline / location had suddenly changed. I suppose the only gripe I had was that I wanted to see a little more of what the characters in that explosive (and completely unexpected) opening scene could pull off. They're quickly written off for the film's actual leads to take centerstage, though I absolutely did not see it coming. Idris Elba takes up the space of Will Smith from the 2016 version (but as a different character), and the daddy-daughter chemistry he shares with Rat Catcher 2 (Melchior) was sweetly portrayed. Robbie is once again a knockout!Gunn's love for animals sees The Suicide Squad incorporate a vicious-but-adorable King Shark (with Sly's voiceover), a CGI rat named Sebastian, and the very odd Weasel (voiced by James' brother Sean) into the screenplay. They all feel organic to the film's plot and irresistibly funny at the same time. The antagonists come off as somewhat thin when compared to GOTG, but that thankfully doesn't deter the overall viewing experience. The Suicide Squad is just the kind of gory, flowery, and supremely entertaining mess that you'd associate with a set of characters like this. The writing of each lead character is unique and does the film a lot (I mean A LOT!) of good. The future of DCEU looks bright, thanks to its recent good run.",The Suicide Squad
65,martimusross,"Beyond Moronic, What Total Rubbish!",1,7 August 2021,"The Suicide SquadWho know where to begin reviewing this moronic rubbish. It's target audience seems to be 14 year old boys what with the endless gratuitous violence that I associate with manga and console war games.The story, what little there was, was vacuous and contrived, the acting had more ham than Sainsbury's and the CGI was omnipresent.The audience around me seemed glazed over seemingly simply to accept this drivel as entertainment.This sort of film is societally dangerous on every front, we have wholesale objectification, normalising violence as a response to any resistance, gross tokenism, disempowered, forced diversity, mistrust of power and big business. If I had the power I would cancel this sort of movie out of existence and at the very least put an 18 certificate on it.This movie obviously wasn't for me but wake up and smell the coffee it's not for anyone but mindless morons.",The Suicide Squad
66,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The REAL Suicide Squad!,9,7 August 2021,"I can't stress enough how much of a far cry this film is from 2016's Suicide Squad. The Suicide Squad has EVERYTHING the first lacked: actual synergy between the main cast, in-character actions dictating the story instead of braindead logic 'uniting' villains who wouldn't trust each other with sandwiches; basically The Suicide Squad is what Suicide Squad tried to be but failed to realise. This one's story was a blast, the humour was fantastic as was the action and James Gunn's direction trumps David Ayer's film by EVERY millisecond.It's beautiful how much better this film is to 2016's flop: King Shark, Peacemaker, Bloodsport and Harley Quinn are easily the stars of the show here; the characters actually feel like double-crossing yet well-defined people instead of the superficial out-of-character superheroes of the first movie. Basically The Suicide Squad does its damnedest to apologise for 2016's film in EVERY way imaginable and it succeeds in spades.The Suicide Squad is the film we deserved the first time around, but thank Christ there's a good film in the DCEU again.This films gets somewhere between a 9-10/10; haven't really decided on the final scoring yet.",The Suicide Squad
67,ketgup83,"Pumps Up The Adrenaline With Gun Blazes, Witty And Fun-Filled Popcorn Entertainment",8,7 August 2021,"DC comics is finally making a comeback with re-boots and better version of the previous fiascos which made the fans unhappy few years back. After the receiving huge respect from DC Universe fans in form of Zack Snyder's brilliant version of Justice League, make way for James Gunn's new and improved The Suicide Squad over the disappointing Suicide Squad released in 2016.In The Suicide Squad , we see Viola Davis returns to her role as U. S. government official Amanda Waller pulling out the most dreaded and probably the most weirdest characters from the prison to make the deadliest anti-hero squad - Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena), Weasel (Sean Gunn), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), Javelin (Flula Borg), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Savant (Michael Rooker) and Sylvester Stallone as the voice of Nanaue / King Shark, for a top-notch secret mission to destroy the mysterious starfish project as they are dropped off in the island of Corto Maltese.James Gunn (who directed the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise for Marvel), makes The Suicide Squad more thrilling and exciting than the David Ayer's Suicide Squad released in 2016. While the few cast remains the same and few were killed off instantly as the first team of Task Force X gets duped by a sudden tip-off while the second team assemble with the first one later to get The Suicide Squad. The witty humor with one-liners is witnessed throughout the film which keeps you entertained with background soundtrack from Johnny Cash and Louis Prima. James Gunn manages to keep the energy even though somewhere in between the plot gets sidetrack (Harley Quinn escaping from the prison had larger-than-life action stunt) and 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. I also felt that makers could have done few scenes without showing killing of birds (even though it was visual but creates a wrong impression with the audience) but with astonishing climax where the battle between Starfish and The Suicide Squad will give you a thrilling ride. It was definitely a refreshing and unique super-hero flick with infused fun-elements making it an enjoyable fun ride. The introduction of each superhero with unique super power is hilarious, especially Sylvester Stallone's King Shark. The camera work is spectacular (check out for the fight scene between the The Peace-maker and Colonel Rick Flag in the reflection of a helmet).Screenplay is good along with funny dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the star cast.Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline and lovely performances. It is definitely an improvement over a 2016 version of Suicide Squad which deserves to be experienced, applauded and remembered. Go for it - 3.5/5.",The Suicide Squad

Each character gets a chance to shine and the balance between the cast is good.There's a lot to pick apart if you want to, and I wasn't on board 100% of the time, but when it really clicked it clicked hard, and I ended up thinking this was really good.

The main reason for that is the ridiculous campiness of DC characters. That's why all the recent DC movies just can't compare to the MCU in my opinion. That said, this Suicide Squad is the first attempt from DC to fully embrace the ridiculousness of their material and it almost works. If they had gone the extra mile to make it full satire it could have been excellent. As it stands, it is not the worst of DC, but still only mildly entertaining.",The Suicide Squad

I can understand some, I'm definitely guilty of it,, but it was too much.)I can't say much without giving something away, so I'll keep it brief. Waller sends the team to Corto Maltese to infiltrate this secret lab called Jotenheim. Corto Maltese has recently been taken over by a new tyrant president (sounds kinda familiar) with a big military force backing him. Will the team be able to complete their mission?The cast is incredible!! There are a few returning faces from the 1st movie (I really liked the first movie btw,, I didn't say it was perfect,, but I liked it a lot)- Col. Flag / Capt.

As a fan of the ""Saw"" saga, you aren't amusing me with fantasy violence where bodies explode and we rarely see any real suffering. It's graphic, but it's not really that violent (except for Harley for like... 10 seconds).Then the jokes. I didn't laugh once. There is nothing to do here. I'm guessing the actors just didn't land the jokes for my taste, because I laughed alot with Pratt and Bautista and Cooper in the Guardians movies.And then the ""weirdness"". I just didn't care for it. Enjoy it you all, I guess?

Crazy, violent, goofy fun. The ensemble cast is what makes this film. From small roles to large, and with varying degrees of comedic timing, they all bring something unique to the table. What's more is Gunn's wonderful sensibility to not take things too seriously throughout the film. Gunn is perhaps the best superhero genre director that's ever come along. Why? Because he gets the genre like nobody else. Comic books, by their very definition, don't exist in the real world. They are serialized, pulpy cartoons. Leave your brain at the door, and enjoy. When a scene calls for violence, Gunn goes for bloody broke. When a scene needs a laugh, he embraces the goof and takes the joke as far as he can. Unlike most comic book movies, most of which go through the exact same predictable motions, the Gunn films feel wild and free. Let's be honest, it's how all comic book movies should be.

I think they're fun and flashy, and I can turn my mind off for an hour or two. What I do mind is endless reboots of franchises. The fact that I saw three separate Spider-Man reboots in 15 years accentuates my point. Now, I understand that The Suicide Squad (2021) is allegedly a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). Still, it felt more like a reboot since Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) were the only recurring characters. And, let's be honest, they can't cast Harley Quinn with anyone other than Margot Robbie now.For those who thought that having a great director like James Gunn on board would make this film better than its predecessor, you're partly right. Sure, there's a bit of his style of humor that is on display. Still, it's essentially the same plot as the previous iteration in this series, with different characters filling the main roles. Granted, some of the storytelling is better, even if it felt like the character introductions seemed to drag on forever. At least they sped through the whole ""this is what the Suicide Squad is"" spiel in the first 10 minutes.To its credit, The Suicide Squad has a couple of great set pieces (which most well-done superhero films have anyway), even if one of them is an obligatory Harley Quinn sequence. I can also appreciate how this film didn't try too hard to tie into the greater DC Extended Universe since it's clear now that they can't get their act together as Marvel did. In the end, The Suicide Squad is a fun, R-rated superhero romp that improved on its formula with the help of a better director with more creative control.The same plot as five years ago, but with some improvements, I give The Suicide Squad 3.5 stars out of 5.",The Suicide Squad
77,Holt344,"The Suicide Squad is hilarious and entertaining from start to finish, much to do with the script and direction from James Gunn but also its ensemble cast - My Ultimate Review",10,5 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is the tenth film in the DCEU and was written and directed by James Gunn, if you enjoy and find his Guardians of the Galaxy movies good and funny then you will love this film. It shows how much he loves the characters and property, the R-Rating helps in a lot of ways. I found it utterly hilarious and kept laughing at the witty and well written dialogue, the actors execution of the dialogue is how the jokes work so well. It very much is a James Gunn film and I'm glad he got all the freedom from DC and Warner Brothers which was something David Ayer never got, but with that freedom James Gunn created something remarkable and unpredictable, a superhero movie that has everything to make it a classic.Viola Davis portrays the menacing Amanda Waller who runs the Task Force X program, she gives the Suicide Squad a task to destroy Jötunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory in the South American island nation of Corto Maltese that holds political prisoners and a site for secretive experiments, and the big villain Starro the Conqueror. The first group contains Colonel Rick Flag, Harley, Boomerang, T. D. K, Mongal, Javelin, Blackguard, Weasel and Savant. Whilst the second group contains Bloodsport, Nanaue/King Shark, Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man and Peacemaker. Thirteen inmates from Belle Reve penitentiary, all with different skill sets and powers which leads to some interesting, memorable and hilarious moments.The film stars an ensemble cast including Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Sylvester Stallone, Viola Davis, Daniela Melchior, Jai Courtney, David Dastmalchian, Peter Capaldi and Michael Rooker. It's quite a large ensemble cast but everyone gets their time to shine, some of course more than others. This film marks the third time Margot Robbie have played Harley Quinn and honestly I would lie if I would say she wasn't a highlight of this film like she was in the first Suicide Squad and then her own movie. But there are other characters here that manages to steal the spotlight and they are Idris Elba as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker, Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2 whom the director have said is the heart of the film and I agree with him (Cleo Cazo and her rat Sebastian), Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag was also another highlight and he is of course one of the very few returning characters from Suicide Squad (2016) I loved how much he have changed and it made him much more relatable and more entertaining to watch. The most entertaining character has to be King Shark, Sylvester Stallone nailed it. At first I wanted him to be serious but I'm down with this silly version, it worked in the animated Harley Quinn show and it worked even better here.John Murphy's musical score was simply brilliant and worked out with the tone of the film, he probably worked closely with James Gunn. The direction and script was fantastic, Gunn continues to amaze me with his terrific direction. He embraced the silliness and picked characters like Polka-Dot Man and an unfilmable villain like Starro the Conqueror and made him filmable. Starro the Conqueror was a perfect villain for the movie, but the real villains are the Suicide Squad members and the inner struggles they have, its engaging and interesting to see how these villains act and become friends with each other, some are just evil though. I wish we get Jarro sometime and a return of Starro, a man can wish. But he made it work and the screenplay which we got is truly amazing. I actually found the cinematography to be another aspect that I liked, the camera work and just visually, incredible and beautiful. Visual effects were spot on. The costumes deserves to be nominated for awards, great and comic accurate. It's just pleasing for the eyes and makes me smile with the huge level of detail they placed on this film. James Gunn has only love for the film and property.I hope James Gunn stays with DC for a sequel to The Suicide Squad and possibly another property. But right now we got the Peacemaker TV series to look forward to.",The Suicide Squad
78,Anurag-Shetty,"Definitely lives up to its title, this time around.",10,5 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad continues with the adventures of Task Force X after Suicide Squad(2016). Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), Bloodsport(Idris Elba), Peacemaker(John Cena) & a host of other crazy convicts from Belle Reve prison, are tasked with an almost impossible mission on the super dangerous island of Corto Maltese.The Suicide Squad is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director James Gunn has given us a hilarious, shocking, action-packed & overall extremely entertaining movie. This film surpasses its 2016 predecessor by leaps & bounds. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are impeccable. Every single character is unforgettable, no matter the screen time they get & this is the highlight of the movie. Margot Robbie is spectacular as Harley Quinn. Idris Elba is outstanding as Bloodsport. John Cena is fantastic as Peacemaker. Sylvester Stallone is adorable as the voice of King Shark. Daniela Melchior is amazing as Ratcatcher 2. David Dastmalchian is excellent as Polka-Dot Man. Joel Kinnaman is awesome as Colonel Rick Flag. Viola Davis is superb as Amanda Waller. Jai Courtney, Nathan Fillion, Flula Borg, Mayling Ng, Pete Davidson, Sean Gunn, Alice Braga, Peter Capaldi & Storm Reid are great as Captain Boomerang, T. D. K., Javelin, Mongal, Blackguard, Weasel, Sol Soria, Thinker & Tyla, respectively. The supporting cast is good, too. The Suicide Squad is a must watch for DC Extended Universe & James Gunn fans.

79,bankofmarquis,More Fun Than I Expected,8,8 August 2021,"It is almost an effort in futility to review a movie such as THE SUICIDE SQUAD, for most folks fall into 1 of 2 camps:1). Are a DC (or Comic Book Movie) Fan, and will go see this no matter what.2). Are not of fan of the darker DCEU movies (as compared to the MCU films) and might have checked out the first SUICIDE SQUAD, but have no intention to watch this one.This review is for the folks in the 2nd camp - for THE SUICIDE SQUAD is a fun summer action flick with silliness, action, humor and HEART at it's core.Directed by James Gunn (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY), THE SUICIDE SQUAD starts out like the first SUICIDE SQUAD film (and most of the DCEU films) - dark, gritty and intense - with a new pack of anti-heroes joining in on a fight that absolutely cements this team as THE SUICIDE SQUAD.After that, the film makes an interesting adjustment, actually giving the audience anti-heroes that you can root for with just enough of a balance between the dark grittiness that one has come to expect from a DCEU film with a bit more humane touch that really is the hallmark of the MCU.And, under the Direction of James Gunn, this film finds that balance very, very well.Gunn, of course, knows how to make these films - his balance of action and character moments is accurate, his action sequences are well plotted and choreographed (no need for ""shaky cam"" to hide the faults) and he populates this Suicide Squad with some memorable characters.Margot Robbie, of course, is in another stratosphere in her portrayal of Harley Quinn. This is the 3rd film that Robbie stars as Quinn and she has this part down pat. The problem with the other 2 films that she starred in as Quinn (2016's SUICIDE SQUAD and 2020's BIRDS OF PREY) is that she was SO GOOD in those films, that everyone else paled in comparison, but in this film, she has some strong actors/characters to play off of, and this benefits the movie.Starting with Idris Elba as Bloodsport the ""Leader"" of the Squad (in essence, replacing Will Smith) and this is a smart move for Elba has the commanding presence of a Leader with that sense of foreboding that he might not be such a good guy underneath - a quality that I just didn't buy from Smith in the first movie.Joining Elba as characters that were interesting and strong were RatCatcher 1 (Taiki Waititi - in an extended cameo) and RatCatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Savant (Michael Rooker), freedom fighter Sol Soria (Sonya Braga), Thinker (Peter Capaldi) and the ""Groot"" of this piece, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone).Oh...and special notice needs to be made of the character of Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian). Director Gunn has stated he wanted to find the dumbest villain in the DCEU and make him into one of the heroes of this piece. He found him in Polka Dot Man and is played with great pathos by Dastmalchian.Fairing less well is the great Viola Davis as the hard-nosed Amanda Waller who seems to be still acting in the gritty, dark style of the first SUICIDE SQUAD film, so misses out on some of the fun of this film as well as Joel Kinneman as Colonel Rick Flagg (the military leader of the group). I really wasn't invested in Flagg (or Kinneman's portrayal of Flagg) in the first film - and I am not in this one either. He just isn't at nearly the same level of performance as the others listed above.Also...a note about John Cena (and his character PeaceMaker). This is the 2nd 2021 Summer Blockbuster Action flick that I have seen Cena in (following his turn in F9) and in both these films I found his performance to be ""flat"". It just didn't fill the screen, nor does he have enough charisma (a la The Rock) to charm his way through. I was bored by him in this film (as well as in F9).But...this is a James Gunn film - and he doesn't spend much time with the characters/actors that don't really work, but rather, spends his camera time on the ones that do - and the over-the-top action sequences (and villain) that are filmed with a slight grin and a wink-in-the-eye.It's a much needed shot-in-the-arm for DCEU films, but - I'm afraid - it might be too little too late, as most folks have already tuned out the DCEU for being ""too dark"". Which is too bad, for this is the fun summer blockbuster film action and comic book fans have been looking for.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",The Suicide Squad

81,PsychoBeard666,An average movie with some excellent moments,7,2 September 2021,"James Gunn puts his stamp on this movie but it still suffers with the same problems as the first film.Some characters are tragically underused, almost as if the writers didn't know quite what to do with them.I imagine there's a scene on the cutting room floor where King Shark gets to really shine, but for him to do so the movie would have to be an 18 rating so they cut it out.Harley Quinn is thankfully toned down but her jokes just don't land.In fact, the movie in general is nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is.The colour palette of the film is moody and sullen with a few bright moments.Remember the weird black bubbling creatures with inconsistent strength and abilities? This film dips its toe into similar waters but thankfully doesn't commit.If you've seen the trailer then you already know who or what the ""Big Bad"".Joel Kinnaman has bulked up and is generally more likeable in this movie, but he's still not Tom Hardy.Positives:When the jokes do land, they're fantastic.Most of the fight sequences are great.John Cena is a revelation.Rats are cool.Polkadot Man is a welcome addition.I was thoroughly entertained.",The Suicide Squad
82,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Meh,3,8 August 2021,"I like James Gunn movies. But I think you really need to be a comic book fan to really appreciate this film. I watched it twice and I could not get into the ridiculous characters like King Shark, Rat Girl and Pok-A-Dot Man. The comedy wasn't there for me. Perhaps I am just too old for this film. But it seems to be doing well here on IMDb so I guess I am missing out on something.",The Suicide Squad
83,abisio,Mr. Gunn please make another one!!!!,10,7 August 2021,"Gunn was able to make a great movie with great characters with Guardians of the Galaxy within Disney / Marvel constrains; but now, without the stupid censorship / PG-thirteeness he was able to make something way better.Making shine fiver characters in one movie is not easy but we already know he was able to do it; this time he put a lot of back characters that do something; a lot of unexpected deaths and the level of gore totally unexpected in a big budget movie. But with all that dark material the movie is really fun to watch with continuous comic moments; one liners and lots of entertaining action scenes; even with some homage to zombies movies.Gone is Will Smith (really unnecessary in the first one) replaced by Idris Elba (who can act and be funny) and John Cena (who at least can be used on some funny scenes). Still the movie belongs mostly to Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie and this time Joel Kinnaman/ Rick Flag gets more gravitas.The rest of the cast (with unrecognizable cameos from many great actors like Nathan Fillion or Michael Rooker is excellent too.Yes, The Suicide Squad kill a lot of beloved characters but is still a comedy and a very good one.In brief; this is the funniest movie of the year so far; so go for it.

84,bob-the-movie-man,A surfeit of Gunn-violence.,8,10 August 2021,"What a difference a ""The"" makes! The original ""Suicide Squad"" from 2016 was a botched and lacklustre affair, getting just 5/10 from me. James Gunn's semi-reboot is hyper-violent, overlong, totally ludicrous but a whole bunch of fun.Positives:
""From the horribly beautiful mind of James Gunn"" gushes the trailer. But in this case, they ain't kidding. The film is (at times) hugely inventive in its visual gags as well as its dialogue. On the DC/Marvel superhero spectrum, this is right up at the ""Ragnarok"" end in terms of comedy value. It made me guffaw a good dozen times.To match that, the action scenes are suitably ludicrous and over-the-top. They feature the most ""out there"" big-boss since Mr. Stay Puft terrorised New York in the original ""Ghostbusters""!All the cast seem to be having a blast, which carries you, as the audience, along with the fun. Both Viola Davis and Idris Elba add real gravitas at the middle of it all, but Robbie's reprise of Harley Quinn tends to get all the best lines and the most memorable sequences. Her petal-strewn decimation of a platoon of security guards is something to behold.But of the lesser known names it's Daniela Melchior who really stood out for me as Cleo Cazo - Ratcatcher 2. This appears to be the first non-Portuguese feature she's done, and a great future beckons I think: such extraordinary screen presence! Loved her character too: a ""millenial"" who sleeps in and questions what an OHP is!Great music choices, as you would expect from the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" guy.Negatives:
Like Polka-Dot's mum, the comedy style is all over the place! (You have to have watched the movie to understand that gag!). I guess that's true of any comedy, but a number of the jokes feel contrived and didn't fully land.There is just so much gratuitous violence in this one that I am frankly amazed that the BBFC awarded it only a UK ""15"" certificate (this is my second query in a row to the BBFC - they need to employ me!). I reckon this will prove to have the highest body-count of any movie in 2021. It's all done in a comic-book style, but when ""Army of the Dead"" (review still to follow) gets an ""18"", I'm not quite sure why this is much different.Summary Thoughts on ""The Suicide Squad"": I'd mentally set myself up to really hate this one. But the opposite turned out to be true. As a comedy it made me laugh like a drain at times, and although some of the violence went somewhat over the top for me, I thought it to be a fine summer popcorn blockbuster (but very much for adults).(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

87,wetmars,Re-posting this review.,10,13 October 2021,"The Suicide Squad has to be maybe my top favorite DCEU film. I'm not completely sure if it's better than the superior Synder Cut. (( EDIT: Snyder Cut is better. )) Harley? Although, I haven't seen Birds of Prey. THIS IS HOW YOU DO HARLEY QUINN INSTEAD OF SEXUALIZING HER! She is fricking badass, Harley Quinn with a god damn spear? Sign me in! Margot Robbie is a wonderful actress portraying, Harley Quinn. She has good chemistry with the multiple characters within the Squad. I did not know that she was a stunt-performer, god damn! Bloodsport is an excellent character, completely badass. I dig his outfit. He might be my personal favorite character. He had such a lovely ""father-to-daughter"" bond with Ratcatcher 2, speaking of the father-to-daughter bond. He had a more interesting one with his actual daughter. King Shark is another great comedic character and has funny lines, also voice-acted by the famous Sylvester Stallone. ""Hand!"" ""Nom-nom?!"" ""Dumb new friends."" I liked how they didn't treat him as too comedic. Ratcatcher 2 & Sebastian are a top-notch duo, relatable, an interesting backstory on what she came to be. I liked how she wasn't a jerk and didn't do any horrible crimes. ""Rats are the lowliest and most despised of all creatures, my love. If they have a purpose, so do we all."" Honestly, I never thought that we would ever see Polka-Dot Man in live-action. I was thinking that they were going to treat him as a joke, but Nah. Excellent character. The mom stuff was funny and had a heroic sad death. ""I AM A F****** SUPERHERO!"" Blackguard? Meh, what a joke. I have nothing to say on Mongal, but her death was cool. Speaking of death's, the gore stuff was extremely well-done! I was rooting for Savant. He seemed like a cool & badass character. TDK has some interesting characteristics. Captain Boomerang was enjoyable as much I enjoyed him in that horrendous 2016 movie. Weasel, nothing. Javelin, nothing. The Thinker was another enjoyable character. Peter Capaldi's performance is always improving. I am still traumatized by what I've seen about Starro in Batman: The Brave and the Bold - Siege of Starro. I find the 80s/90s Space Shuttle backstory nightmare fuel. I would like to see on how Starro the Conqueror would go against the King of Monsters - Godzilla and King Shark going against Jason Voorhees. Amanda Waller was portrayed better where she is sadistic. John Cena as Peacemaker was a great character. I am seeming to notice that John Cena wants to act more. I liked his arguments with Bloodsport on whether whoever is the best, small bullet or bigger bullet. I was rooting for Bloodsport because Peacemaker felt too comedic. Perhaps we will see his character develop more and a backstory in his HBO Max show. I was not expecting Peacemaker to survive, either Weasel! Rick Flag was more interesting in this one rather than the 2016 film instead of the romance bullcrap. Milton was my man.In my opinion, this is James Gunn's best film yet. You have action-packed scenes where my favorite action scene was when Harley was escaping, that was. I have no words on that, but perfection. The gore is astounding when it came to King Shark ripping a guy's body in half, and how Polka-Dot Man kills his enemies, the effects of the Starfish, etc. Brilliant storytelling.10/10.",The Suicide Squad
88,Sir_AmirSyarif,James Gunn does not disappoint,8,22 August 2021,"Brutally funny and gloriously violent, James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad' is a non-stop joyride from start to finish. The film understands not to take itself too seriously, embraces its ludicrous source material to its fullest extent, and delivers spectacularly. That, combined with an appropriately cheesy soundtrack which never feels out of place, adds up to a great time. Characters are strong with all the cast are great fun to watch on screen. Gunn does not disappoint.",The Suicide Squad
89,pietclausen,A Better Harley Quinn movie,6,12 August 2021,"One will compare this movie with Suicide Squad of 2016 and come to the conclusion that The Suicide Squad is a much better movie with an understandable plot. Not so with the 2016 film, which got my star rating of 1 for being nonsensical.The Suicide Squad, a totally different movie, although having a stupid beginning, looked like going the same way. But halfway through the movie it came alive and the last hour was exciting and very well done. Don't expect a serious movie as it is classified as an action, adventure but comedy as well. Accept the idiosyncrasy and look of the players and just enjoy the movie.",The Suicide Squad
90,AhmedSpielberg99,A Joyride!,7,7 August 2021,"Even though it sits somewhere between a sequel and a remake of Ayer's abysmal movie, it's safe to say James Gunn makes no bones here about erasing it from existence. We see people ripped in half, charred, eaten alive, or having their brains blown out, and the titular supervillains included! Needless to say, and regardless of some visceral moments that feel a bit gratuitous, The Suicide Squad earned its rating regarding the violence. Unfortunately, making it rated-R has done it no favours in terms of comedy. For about 20 to 30 minutes in, the humour basically stems from crass and irreverent jokes abound, or watching the members squabbling every now and then as a reminder their mission is bound to fail aborning, and none managed to elicit the faintest chuckles from me. I'm afraid that James Gunn's comedic schtick shows signs of wear and tear here. Like, he's still trotting out that undercutting of an emotional or romantic scene with a comedic or a violent one. That worked to some extent in both volumes of his Guardians but here it seems feigned for it lacks the needed build-up. Sebastian, the waving rat, is a cool wee stroke of comedic genius, though.When the action kicks in, things get astronomically better from that point onwards. Three scenes standout for me in particular. One has Peacemaker (John Cena) and Bloodsport (Idris Elba) - both have similar superpowers - pitting against each other by going on a killing spree. The showdown was a delight to watch, and features excellent, smooth use of rack focus too. In fact, the way the entire sequence is shot is pretty gripping from its beginning, with a tracking shot culminating in one that feels like straight out of a third-person shooter video game. Another scene shows Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie reprising her role, though taking a back seat to the previously mentioned members) fighting guards and beating them to death. It's pleasingly brutal, and, along with another action scene in the last third, features a floral and prismatic aesthetic singular to the character that works very well on both occasions, mirroring the manic pixie maniac she is and never feeling out of place. The third one is an unsparing hand-to-hand combat that ends in a conclusion I didn't see coming, which is one of the few times the movie managed to bring off its ""no one is safe"" approach in a surprising and satisfying result.Aside from Peacemaker and Bloodsport, the rest of the newcomers are a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, we got Ratcatcher 2: a Portuguese girl who can communicate with and controls an army of rats using a certain device. Such a compelling character, and Daniela Melchior who plays it did a fantastic job, notably in a scene that required her to lash out about her past and her father, the original Ratcatcher. Plus, the decision to retain her meekness and endearingness characteristic of her throughout is an excellent one, given similar characters are usually upended over the course of the movie to negate any sense of helplessness one might attach to them. Well, innocence doesn't equal naivety or weakness, and I'm glad someone finally seems to acknowledge that in a superhero (or, for that matter, supervillain) movie. One the other hand, I found King Shark unbearable for the most part. He's a feeble near-facsimile of Groot, only naming everything he sees or comes across instead of repeating his name. Even worse, occasionally it appears there are attempts at making him a new Drax, being dumb and blunt with his interactions. By the end of the movie I was happily surprised at finding myself clearly have been developing connections with each and every character without even knowing. Gunn really has a knack for imbuing his group of misfits of nuances that draw them together almost imperceptibly while also giving each one considerable depth, with a banger of a payoff on the emotional level. We also have a nice score and a soundtrack full of needle drops that are perfectly implemented in the way they accompany their scenes.As far as any qualms I have other than the comedy, I found the time-jumping structure really irritating. Sometimes, it interrupts the momentum and gives way to sub-plots of neither purpose nor interest to me. Other times, it just comes out of left field for the sake of it, and the same can be said about the on-screen text which I'm sure it was intended as a grace note on the scene-to-scene transitions, but it rather comes off as gimmicky and made the film feel patchy at times. Moreover, as admittedly silly as the movie is, the villain being a kaiju-like starfish controlling minds via little starfish facehuggers is something I found a bit hard to swallow, but I'll let that slide since there's a political background surrounding the villainy side, although that one is actually quite perfunctory as well in its exploration. All in all, whilst it left much to be desired as for the humour one expects from the man behind Guardians of the Galaxy films, The Suicide Squad is the gory fun ride I was urgently waiting for to scrub the 2016's one from my memory.",The Suicide Squad
91,kuarinofu,Carried by Harley Quinn's scenes and Margot Robbie's performance,7,7 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is an adequate superhero film satire. Not as entertaining as Deadpool, but surely not as dull and depressing as the old Suicide Squad.I'm not from the US, so I have no idea about the source material, and I'm neither a Marvel nor DC fan, so there won't be any biased nagging or admiration.I found The Suicide Squad just a little overpraised cause I think that it deserves a solid 7/10.As stated in the title, the best stuff in the film is Harley Quinn's scenes and overall Robbie's performance. I'd still credit other actors, but they weren't given that many scenes to shine. Surprisingly enough, even John Cena, whose acting skills in F9 were questionable, could perform, so I think F9 failure was the director's fault.Some of the situational humor was cool. 99% of the verbal jokes didn't land for me, probably because I'm not young enough or I wasn't watching it under the influence.Overall, great production, good use of an R rating (blood and gore), some memorable music tracks, nice action. The humor, as I've said, was 50 (situational)/50 (actual jokes).I can surely recommend it, especially if you've seen the old one, to compare the two. I also think that Gunn could've produced a great Harley Quinn film, especially after the trash fire known as Birds of Prey.P. S. I'm sorry, David Ayer, but from now on, this Suicide Squad will be known by everyone as ""the good one.""",The Suicide Squad

This was for sure one of the most fun and entertaining movies that I sat through in the theater.First thing, this movie was hardcore rated R. Gores were everywhere and people getting brutally murdered and eaten. I love watching gore, and I was not disappointed at all. This was where my favorite two members of suicide squad shone. Harley, played wonderfully and wickedly by the beautiful Margot Robbie, had a great scene where she was just cruising and killing soldiers using guns and a javelin. Mr. Sharkman was awesome, and his best scene was when he ripped a soldier in half.Not only was the movie violent, it was hilarious. Most characters cracked clever and dirty jokes that had me laughing out loud. Their personalities and even struggles were also funny and used well. Even though not every jokes landed, they were still entertaining because all the members of the suicide squad had great chemistry with each other.The story itself was also a blast. Especially in the second half, it was crazy chaos and reek of awesomeness. Also, James Gunn put in some emotions to the characters. It's not the most important aspect of the story, but it was still pretty decent.My problem was that the first third was little bit slow and boring. But that was it, the rest after that picked up quickly and became a fun adventure.Overall, with great characters and spectacular actions, The Suicide Squad redeemed itself from its previous installment and it's a big win for DC.

Her entire identity as a super person is literally dependent on one little device that isn't even attached to her or anything. And I guess to lead up to the plot of her using them to kill that goofy star fish I mean cmon that thing didn't even have a point.

Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout.Each squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster.Gunn just can't seem to miss.""Rating: B+",The Suicide Squad

You are gonna risk the entire mission for a mental defective dressed as a court jester?Bloodsport: This coming from a guy that wears a toilet seat on his head?""Astounding Visuals, Ravishing Gore, Some Charming Characters, and oodles of Quirky Humour; that's how I would like to recapitulate my personal impression. Doubters were mulling over with Skepticism when the Studio (WB) announced this sequel a couple of years back. Primarily because they were worried about whether James Gunn was the pertinent choice to take over this endeavor. As it turns out, Warner Bros. Did make a good call after all!This is an indisputable improvement over the previous outing. For instance, greater consistency in Writing, considerably more effective management of the characters; especially for such a large group of unusual personalities. On top of that; excellent work on Humour or for that matter, the Dialogues; which are exceptionally well-put. The constant back-and-forth between Peacemaker & Bloodsport was something I was pleased to witness.Regarding its Artistic Supervision or to simply put the overall look & feel of it; I am happy to report that 'The Suicide Squad' has been nothing but a feast for the eyes. Even though this was well expected of Mr. Gunn since his earlier works (Guardians of the Galaxy) speak so highly of his competencies as a visionary Director who can handle such large-scale stuff quite effortlessly!Now when it comes to characterization; again James Gunn has this unique trait for which he likes to present ample opportunities to every major lead so that those characters can get their very own moments to shine. As can be seen here, thus; Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, John Cena, Daniela Melchior; everybody got equal chances to showcase their Power and Abilities and so they did.However, I still refrain from calling this a flawless execution; as I found its Non-linear narration to be a bit uneventful at times. Besides, the stakes never felt high enough. Part of the reason is the vague portrayal of our Antagonists or in other words; an alleged lack of a proper one. I don't know why but the final confrontation against Starro appears to be heavily rushed as if the writers were in some sort of hurry. I have to say, the final fight was far from anything satisfactory.",The Suicide Squad

99,0w0,"Worse than Suicide Squad (2016), and that's saying something...",5,9 August 2021,"If you thought that Suicide Squad (2016) was bad, then prepare to be shocked. I kinda liked Suicide Squad (2016) though it was pretty bad, and I gave it a 7/10 score back in 2016... but this film is just so much worse. The previous film at least had 3 people who had super-powers, but this film literally only has 1 person with super-powers..... talk about scaling down. They made a super-hero movie, with just 1 super-hero lol. What on earth were they thinking?This film is supposed to be action mixed with comedy, yet I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire 120minutes runtime. That's exceptionally poor when you compare it to Suicide Squad (2016) that actually managed to get a couple of laughs out of me.I'd honestly rather prefer that they bring David Ayer back as director, instead of James Gunn, as it seems he just can't make a good film (except for the two GotG films). James is better of sticking to the Marvel universe because he doesn't have the 'darkness' in him to be able to cope with the DC Universe it seems.",The Suicide Squad

102,MrDHWong,One of the most gloriously over-the-top movies of its kind that never stops being fun,9,12 August 2021,"""The Suicide Squad"" is a standalone sequel to the similarly titled 2016 DC Universe superhero film. Written and directed by James Gunn (Guardians Of The Galaxy Volumes 1 and 2), it is one of the most gloriously over-the-top movies of its kind that never stops being fun.In exchange for more lenient sentences, the villains Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), and numerous other super powered prisoners agree to assemble into a team referred to as ""Task Force X"" (a.k.a. The ""Suicide Squad"") by commander Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). Their mission is to infiltrate the government compound of the small Latin American nation of Corto Maltese to acquire information regarding a top secret experiment known only as ""Project Starfish"". Once there, the team encounters various hardships they must overcome, including distrust among themselves and a looming threat that could end all life on Earth.To put it mildly, 2016 was a rocky year for the DC Universe. Both its films ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" and ""Suicide Squad"", despite their moderately successful box office returns, received a great deal of disdain from both critics and fans of the source material. The latter film in particular had the potential to break away from the stereotype of DC being all dark and depressing with its energetic ensemble cast of characters, but instead it squandered it all away in favour of rushing out a product simply to make a quick buck. Thankfully, in the hands of James Gunn, ""The Suicide Squad"" delivers an appropriate apology to everyone who hated its predecessor by addressing nearly all of its problems in the best ways possible.Now free from the confines of a PG-13 classification, this version flaunts its R-rating at every opportunity. The violence is frequent and brutal, characters often swear, and even the occasional graphic scene of nudity sneaks its way in there. In other words, it's exactly what the original should have been like. But that's not to say the entire film is just a gratuitous display of sensationalistic chaos, believe me, it still has a heart. In stark contrast to the first movie, there's a certain consistency to all of this madness. Unlike the 2016 film, which was a bizarre mess of tonal shifts and poor attempts at humour, this version manages to find harmony in all of these eccentric moments. For every comedic scene that didn't work, there were at least two others to make up for it later on. Likewise, whenever the film delved into dramatic territory, they all felt earned and weren't just shoehorned in there for the sake of it. To call this film better than the original would be a major cop out, as anyone with half a brain will be able to figure out right away what this one does right that the other did wrong.With a filmmaker as shamelessly entertaining as James Gunn at the helm, we should all know what to expect from a film like this. The man injects his trademark off-colour sense of humour into every frame, whether it's a not-so-subtle dig at US interventionism in Latin America or simply a person being eaten alive by a walking great white shark. He also paces the film rather quickly but never so much that the information is hard to absorb or isn't worth investing in. Additionally, Gunn has written a story that is more believable within the context of the current state of the DC Universe. As we have previously seen in 2020's ""Birds of Prey"", DC is more than capable of exploring R-rated themes without straying too far from what has already been established. Gunn successfully continues this formula and as a result has given us a film that can both stand on its own as an independent entry in DC's catalogue while also leaving certain aspects open should the higher ups at Warner Bros. Wish to expand upon anything else featured here.Best of all, in a film with such a large cast, its characters are well developed and their gimmicks aren't simply there for a throwaway gag. Each member of the squad justifies his or her reason for being here, no matter how insignificant. I really enjoyed the rivalry between Bloodsport and Peacemaker, who were both played wonderfully by Idris Elba and John Cena, respectively. Watching these two try to outdo the other resulted in one of the film's funniest scenes. I never would have picked Elba and Cena having such good comedic chemistry but thanks to James Gunn's solid writing and direction it all works out for them. Of course, Margot Robbie once again owns the role of Harley Quinn, in her third outing as the iconic DC villain. Harley has well and truly moved on from the Joker and holds her own slicing and dicing her way through anyone who tries to stop her. However, based on sheer absurdity, King Shark steals the show in almost every scene he is in. Whether it's Sylvester Stallone's amusing mumbling or his indecisiveness on who he should or shouldn't eat, this anthropomorphic shark with a beer gut was great fun to watch. Normally, a character like this would not have worked, but remember that James Gunn is the same man who made a talking raccoon and a talking tree work in the Guardians of the Galaxy films so a humanoid shark isn't that hard to comprehend.Though it wasn't exactly difficult to improve upon the original, this film does so in virtually every way imaginable. It just goes to show that in the hands of the right filmmaker, it is possible to redeem even the worst of the worst. The 2016 film may have been ""A"" Suicide Squad, but this one is rather appropriately ""THE"" Suicide Squad, meaning that it's the only one worth acknowledging. Reportedly, there is a spin-off series in development focusing on Peacemaker with John Cena reprising his role from the movie so I look forward to that. I hope there will also be a third film in this style in the not-to-distant future but until then, I am thankful to James Gunn for bringing us this one for the time being.I rate it 8.5/10.",The Suicide Squad
103,Alexander_Blanchett,A Revolution,8,14 August 2021,"This is how I imagined the original Suicide Squad to be - and more. To be honest it seems that James Gunn was on some really good weed when he wrote and directed this film. There is stuff in that movie that you hardly ever see in a mainstream movie.. story wise and visual wise. And thats good. Also to give Suicide Squad finally the necessary R-Rating treatment was the right move. The film was equally entertaining but also a kind of revolution of itself.Acting wise it was solid. Margot Robbie is always great in the role of Harley Quinn and there is no change here. She really makes that character her own like hardly any other actor in the past of a superhero franchise. Idris Elba was solid and I really liked John Cena and Joel Kinneman. Also Daniela Melchoir was outstanding. Viola Davis was sadly a bit on the edge of overacting here but still its Viola Davis, she can't do no wrong. Also bunch of great virtual characters , starting with King Shark of course, hilariously voiced by Sylvester Stallone and Sebastian the rat.Signature for James Gunn is also the fantastic soundtrack and that is no difference here.As mentioned above, sometimes he really over does it... but in a way that is acceptable.. because the film is that crazy and out of this world.Definitely a step forward for DC.",The Suicide Squad
104,TheTruthofItIs,Good and bad simultaneously,4,19 September 2021,"James Gunn is great at writing and directing the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series so it's bewildering how he went off the rails here with this version of ""The Suicide Squad"". And it's hard to figure out why since there's both good and bad here. To keep this short-ish lemme dwell on the bad: John Cena as Peacemaker. First, this ""it's your turn"" thing Hollywood does with actors is irritating. First it was when Will Ferrell was in everything from 2004-08. Then it was Kevin Hart 2016-18, and now it's Cena's ""turn"" to be in everything, ugh. And he's just not a good actor, he's too much ""himself"". Then there's the starfish villain, which seriously, did no one but no one tell him about Patrick in Spongebob?! And the desensitizing violence is just over the top. I suppose writer/directors get off on filming new, gory ways to kill people. There's not much ""story"" in this film, which I suppose is why Gunn filled it with so much nonsense action/violence. I was on the FF/skip button much more than I should've been.",The Suicide Squad
105,chunkylefunga,Don't waste your time.,3,7 August 2021,"So suicide squad are the bad guys but Hollywood won't allow a film to actually have characters that are bad guys, so they're basically heroes that just swear a lot. Which massively takes away from the premise of Suicide Squad.Then we have a paper thin plot, with pointless action, with John Cena hamming up another movie with his MDF style of acting.Having a couple of actors who actually know how to act is the only thing stopping this from being a 1 star movie.",The Suicide Squad
106,cardsrock,Gleefully insane,8,11 August 2021,"This is James Gunn without any restraints or studio interference. Just absolutely bonkers. The Suicide Squad is a big improvement from its predecessor. The character development is stronger, the action crisper, and it's just a lot more fun.Pretty much everyone is great, but my favorite was probably King Shark. He steals the show and I hope to see him in future DC properties. There are tons of surprises and everything is filmed with James Gunn's unique style. The humor lands for the most part as well.As far as critiques, I think the third act is pretty long and could've probably been edited down. Also, Harley's fight scenes, while impressive to watch, seemed a bit crazy given what her character's skills are supposed to be.I'm honestly just ecstatic to actually see Starro in a live action film. Definitely something I never thought would happen. This is just a rollicking good time and a brilliant reset for the Suicide Squad franchise.",The Suicide Squad
107,CANpatbuck3664,Fun and Funny Re-imagining/Reboot by Gunn and Crew but Expectations Were Too High,8,14 August 2021,"Superhero movies are starting to evolve, its a crucial and necessary step to stretching the longevity of the genre. The Suicide Squad changes gears from the Ayer version (which was a disappointing yet mixed bag of a movie that I still enjoyed) and the 2021 entry is more of a war movie with action/comedy elements. I wouldn't categorize it as an epic but nothing felt out of place or inauthentic in this portrayal of this universe. There's enough time paid to the people of Corto Maltese (and their plight) to set up stakes and the creative team is successful in dropping you in along with the squad with the understanding that lives are hanging in the balance (both with the residents of the island and the squad themselves). You're rooting for both the squad and the people to prevail despite long odds and more than a few enemy troops between them and the former Nazi science compound that needs to be shut down.It's interesting that James Gunn's involvement has become a big reason to go see The Suicide Squad and in my opinion, its deserved. The Guardians of the Galaxy movies are hugely popular for a reason and he's been instrumental in their success as both the writer and the director. A notable change is the R rating and there's more than enough blood and guts to go around in this film. This is a staple of Gunn's pre-Marvel work and despite the fact it may limit the audience, it fits the tone he's going for here. It also adds to the laughs (if you enjoy that sort of thing), I had to chuckle at King Shark ripping someone in half or someone melting from being peppered with colourful polka dots.Warner Bros. Seemed to listen to the fans in regards to the casting, they kept the members of the cast that everyone liked from the first movie and discarded the rest. Margot Robbie returning as Harley Quinn is the headliner and she continues to be fantastic as this character. She gets Harley's humour, her edginess and violent nature as a character and she's quite the performer when it comes to the stunts. As long as she's portraying this character, I'll be happy to go watch in the theatre. My next favourite was David Dastmalchian as the Polka-Dot Man. The gags with his character made me laugh consistently and his deadpan and reserved energy worked for me. Joel Kinnaman was given more to do as Rick Flag but he also elevated what was on the page and I liked him more in this version. I also liked Viola Davis more as Amanda Waller, she's a great actress but she's given more free reign and she comes off as more nasty and menacing. John Cena continues to be hilarious, Taskmaster and Bloodsport trading insults and trying to one-up each other were highlights for sure. I also liked Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, she's the heart of the movie and while some scenes with her border on being too sentimental, she was always a welcome presence. I'm a big fan of Idris Elba but while he was good, I thought they could have done a better job of differentiating his character from Deadshot (played by Will Smith). They had the exact same energy and I feel like they could have given Elba more room to do his own thing with the character.The other required element of the tentpole superhero movie is some killer action. The Suicide Squad went a different direction with the kind of villain and flunkies that villain used but I think the action and the stunts got the job done. Harley's escape from the detention cell was the standout for me but I did like the liberation of the camp as well. The action was good, I wouldn't describe the set pieces as uninteresting or unsuccessful but minus the brutal violence (which I didn't mind and added some tension), there wasn't anything earthshaking and that's fine (having seen most of the superhero movies, I may just be a little desensitized).The 2021 version of The Suicide Squad is the better movie on almost every level. Its funnier, the characters are more memorable and the R-rated moments help give the movie stakes. The cast is great with both the returning members lighting it up on screen again and the new additions bringing the fire. Gunn's love of gore and the weirder aspects of our villainous team also make for a more distinctive movie that's going to age better. But this is a case where all the critical praise and the hype just put my expectations a little too high. Its a great movie, but it never hit that ""blew me away"" level I anticipated it would. I still enjoyed it enough to give it an 8.5/10 but I'm rounding down because its more solid to me as a opposed to truly amazing. I'd love to see another movie with this creative team and this cast though, if you're interested and feel comfortable going to see it in the theatre, I think its absolutely worth it.",The Suicide Squad
108,saru2020,Not so good,4,30 August 2021,So many characterisations coming and claiming as superheroes and we as an audience aren't sure whether to accept them as such. Some weirdest behavioural characteristic being is being called superheroes and they go on to save the world. I think it is this concept of saving the world that has gotten bored and maybe the superhero subjects are better off with just evil villains and not aliens probably.,The Suicide Squad

Some parts with the shark guy were funny too (like in front of the fish tank).Some other parts were just weird, but didn't ruin the movie or anything.Not bad, especially for now.",The Suicide Squad
110,elicopperman,The Superior Sequel Nobody Saw Coming,7,10 August 2021,"Back in 2016, the DCEU attempted to bring the suicide squad characters into a full blown movie, and it turned out to be far from satisfactory. In addition to the film being heavily butchered in the editing process, it ended up being one of the most divisive installments in the already controversial franchise to the point of being labeled as the poor man's Guardians of the Galaxy. However, five years following its release, the writer/director of the aforementioned Marvel flick James Gunn was brought onboard to helm a standalone followup, with old and new characters coming in. So, how did this one favor out in the end?Now, the basic premise Suicide Squad is that a secret government agency allows imprisoned super villains to take down potential threats in exchange for reduced sentences. Where the first film focused on a ragtag team of super villains taking down a powerful witch to save the world, this followup focuses on convicts from before and now being set out to destroy evidence of the giant alien starfish Starro. While pretty standard for a superhero action flick, James Gunn and the crew clearly took a lot of inspiration from the comics to deliver a balance between hardcore bloody shoot-em up action and sardonic banter used for comedy, complete with some nice violent slapstick for the touches on top. Even though the first Suicide Squad film tried to balance serious action with goofy comedy, it ended up losing its appeal by taking itself too seriously for its own good, whereas this flick has the right balance in knowing when to mess around and when to raise the stakes. Like the better R rated superhero flicks, this flick is a showcase of properly indulging in sprightly, self-aware comic fun for an older audience.In addition to all of the popcorny fun the film has to offer, the cast bring a lot to their performances. It is easy to tell how actors play their roles in superhero movies nowadays whenever the flick calls for a more serious tone, but thankfully, even the likes of Idris Elba, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Peter Capaldi knew how to ham their roles up enough without losing the believability of how much pain is within their characters. Returning from the first film the most is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and at this point, she has completely embodied the psychiatrist turned crazed criminal. Whenever she gets herself involved in specific situations such as life threatening stakes or battles with the squad, she just goes all out in embracing the lunacy displayed on screen. Adding on to that, Sylvester Stallone brought quite a charming nature to King Shark, even if the character does feel a bit too similar to Groot and the Iron Giant. Beyond that, the entire cast clearly fit their roles to a perfect extent, and there's no telling what else could be in store for these characters in future installments.However, in spite of all the wonderful qualities the film has to offer, the one factor that could really make or break one's expectations of the movie itself is whether or not it works as a standalone sequel. Granted, the first film didn't do the best job at introducing its characters to a mass audience out of rushed pacing, but you are still left with this unorthodox team of super villains who aren't all that familiar outside of the more popular DC heroes and baddies. On one hand, the story is pretty routine to follow, but on the other hand, you could end up getting lost in all the different plot points regarding the villain's complex motivation and how each character has to work around one another, especially when one of the teammates, Ratcatcher 2, uses rats to the best of her advantage. Then again, anyone familiar with what made Guardians of the Galaxy work will definitely find it all here, what with the killer soundtrack, sardonic humor, bizarrely creative VFX and oddball characters running amok. So maybe if it won't appeal to everyone, it might bring in the familiar superhero crowd in more ways than one.Is this followup to Suicide Squad going to win everyone over? It's certainly debatable. While it may alienate fans of the previous darker installments in the DCEU, it may give newcomers a chance to really feel thrilled by the more playful direction DC is heading in nowadays. Now that the film is playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max simultaneously, I'd say it's worth checking out at least once to get a good first impression. It's funny how the first film was seen as DC trying to cash in on Guardians of the Galaxy, so if they were to do a superior sequel, why not bring in the man who started that success in the first place?",The Suicide Squad
111,ronakkotian,The NEW and IMPROVED Suicide Squad!,8,9 August 2021,"The 2016 Suicide Squad left me disappointed beyond belief. When The Suicide Squad got announced with James Gunn as writer and director, I regained faith and I'm so happy to say he didn't disappoint.The Suicide Squad follows a group of imprisoned convicts that join to create a task force and are dropped off at the island of Corto Maltese to complete a mission.With The Suicide Squad, James Gunn has made one of the best and most memorable comic book films in recent memory. Having the film be R rated opened up a lot of doors for Gunn and he used the rating as well as the creative freedom Warner Bros gave him to his advantage. He introduced me to characters I've never even heard of and managed to make them so much fun to watch. What was missing in the 2016 film was character depth and the bond between the squad. Gunn includes many funny moments that kept the camaraderie of the team going. There were also a handful of emotional moments from characters I didn't expect which leads into one of the film's biggest strengths: its unpredictability. Whilst Gunn's method of telling of the story doesn't break boundaries, he includes various surprises involving these characters that I honestly didn't see coming. Whether it's for shock value or merely a set-up for a joke, The Suicide Squad has moments that genuinely took me by surprise and kept me entertained.This is very much a James Gunn film. His style, which we've gotten accustomed to since Guardians of the Galaxy, is what increased the entertainment value for me. This film is filled with jokes all the way through. Albeit some of them fell flat but I was laughing my way through most of them. Gunn knows where to place a joke so that it doesn't take away from the more touching moments. I'm happy that Gunn didn't hold back on the violence either. The violence is very gory and over-the-top and the way it's all shot and edited is very well done. What really impressed me were the visual effects. Especially during the choatic third act, the CGI was immaculate and its consistency made this a very immersive experience. It's crazy how a film like Black Widow, a movie with a larger budget, has scenes that look much more fake than the ones in The Suicide Squad. An irritating aspect of the 2016 film was its soundtrack. Whilst being filled with fantastic songs, the songs themselves didn't fit with what was going on. However, Gunn chooses music that feels much more appropriate and compliment the scenes well.The performances were also fantastic and seemed much better than the ones in the 2016 film. I loved Rick Flag and Amanda Waller much more here with Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis giving strong performances. Idris Elba's Bloodsport is reminiscent of Will Smith'a Deadshot but Elba does a better job and is given more to work with. Margot Robbie is great as usual as Harley Quinn. John Cena suited the role of Peacemaker well and had some great moments. For me, the standouts were Sylvester Stallone as King Shark, David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man and Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2. I wasn't familiar with their characters but they were a lot of fun to watch and stood out to me.The Suicide Squad surprised me in ways I didn't expect. It's certainly not perfect as some jokes didn't work and I wish the villains got more depth. Nonetheless, James Gunn definitely delivered and I hope Warner Bros see this and give more directors freedom when it comes to these kinds of films.",The Suicide Squad

I feel like the film makers took on criticism from the first movie and put improvements into this. To me, this was basically like an Avengers movie aimed at adults with violence, gore and swearing.The film is filled with a great cast who all do a terrific job, especially Margot Robbie, I couldn't see anyone else doing the role of Harley Quinn. She is to Harley what Heath Ledger was to the joker. The movie is filled with funny one liners and never takes itself too seriously. I felt the first Suicide Squad was bordering too much pretty humour and seriousness and wasn't sure what it was. This reboot blends humour and seriousness perfectly. Some of the scenes between John Cena and Idris Elba were hilarious, as well as the lines from King Shark.I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this to be honest based on the first film, but this delivers exactly what you would expect from a team of anti-heroes, it's funny, entertaining and aimed at a mature audience, and for me it's an 8/10.",The Suicide Squad

Like, you can't have a character have a heartfelt moment without it being interrupted by cruelty. Oooooo...edgy. Worst of all, it's cynical and angry. I'm tired of it myself.This is a mean-spirited movie with unnecessary violence put under a high powered telescope so you can endure it as much as the talent does. This is sad lazy movie making at it's laziest level. Numb filling stupidity with jokes that seem tired when they were in the trailer. I understand what they were attempting to do but it is just one flaccid joke after another then add gruesome violence then a quip then more violence rinse repeat.Sorry Man...""Guardians..."" was dullsville derivative nostalgic nonsense made for wall to wall era music hipsters.

The only thing that keep me watched this movie is to know how it will end and what will happened to Harley Quinn and the others members of the Squad . The visual Effects are still pretty well made but the story is pretty classic and dont give the same interest as the first one who were a little bit more interesting (characters past , reason to have empathy or reason to their behavior).

It looks great throughout and the tonal shifts are well managed, but I didn't like the episodic and non-linear approach to storytelling and the large number of leading characters meant the focus wasn't as tight as it could have been.

Now I personally didn't actually mind the first suicide squad (which I know will not please some reading), but this one is so much better. It's just fun and incredibly entertaining.I'm not gonna talk about the DC universe, or compare to the first. I'm just gonna rattle of my thoughts on this film only.So the characters were all so unique and loveable in different ways. Really made you root for every single one of them. They all had good depth to them as well, rather than kind of just throwing everyone in and leaving them to it.The action scenes were also really cool and fun. Yes there is a solid amount of gore in this one, but it was done in a much less serious tone to something like Saw.I thought the pace of the film really holds up as well. Never felt bored at any stage and there didn't seem to be any real stoppages.I thought the cinematography and certain camera shots were so cool and different to what you normally see in films.Now, some people I've seen complain that it's ""too silly"". I don't agree in all honesty. I think a couple of the jokes were slightly forced out (mainly in the first 20 mins or so). But the tone of the film really levels out and there's some really humorous parts that genuinely made me laugh out loud.I don't really have much negatives to be honest. I would have liked to have seen more from the ""villains"". The character The Thinker you see for a single scene before the final parts. Just give us more on him, who is he? Etc.But yeah, it's a really fun film that I'd recommend to anyone debating it. It's entertaining, colourful and exactly how you'd expect a James Gunn film to be. So bravo on this one. 9/10 from me.",The Suicide Squad

120,danielcereto,The Boys Squad,8,7 August 2021,"I'm not a fan of Superheroes movies, but since The Boys series I started explore this new universe to me. I'm glad James Gunn wrote an almost excellent script here and The Suicide Squad is close to the best episode of The Boys.First, the first 90 minutes are amazing, full of twists and great Fx's, and gore. I really enjoyed the humor. On the other hand, last 30 minutes were extremely predictable including the ending.Second, characters and cast were amazing. I really enjoyed The Shark, Idris&Cena, but all of them were great actors. If I have to say something bad, some Harley scenes were ridiculous and predictable. Overacted.Last, the movie itself looks dark to me, even I watched the 4k version. On a few scenes I barely know what was happening.To sum up, The Suicide Squad is an amazing movie, goofy, unpredictable at times, and far better than it's precursor. So, even you're not a DC or Marvel fan, you'll have fun.",The Suicide Squad

122,sweidman-28016,One of the Most Fun Movies of the Year,8,16 August 2021,"""You know the deal: successfully complete the mission and you get ten years off your sentence. You fail to follow my orders in any way, and I detonate the explosive device in the base of your skull.""Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. The Suicide Squad is a remake/reboot of the disastrous 2016 Suicide Squad, and it's significantly better! At this point, I don't care too much about the DCEU and saw this on a whim. My only hopes included James Gunn, Margot Robbie, and a killer soundtrack. All met or exceeded my expectations and more. James Gunn is such a great director and he puts every inch of style into this. It radiates with humor, action, and heart. And that's one thing I absolutely didn't expect going in. At least one scene was actually pretty emotional. Working at the theater, I find myself going in to do a theater check just to watch that one scene. What they got right is something to care about. With the first, we were with characters who we knew were most likely going to be killed off soon, and therefore left with the rest that had no character development besides Harley Quinn. We may have a good amount of characters killed off in this (and most in comedic ways), but the ones we're left with have enough character to them.I'll skip out on the returning actors since we all know how well they fit their roles, though I will say Viola Davis went all out as Amanda. Idris Elba gives a stern and comedic portrayal of Bloodsport. He grounds the team with the right amount of seriousness and motivation. Sylvester Stallone is hilarious as King Shark. David Dastmalchian steals the scenes as Polka-Dot Man. His character has deep issues and they showcase it in such a fun and interesting way. But by far my favorite character and actor actually came from Daniela Melchior. I didn't know who she was, I didn't know about her character, I knew nothing. She was fantastic as Ratcatcher 2 and I loved her enthusiasm throughout. As far as story goes, it's silly and not meant to be taken too seriously. When you find out what they're actually facing, and it is shown in at least one of the trailers, it might make or break it for you. I, for one, found it wildly entertaining and a fun third act. The over 2 hour runtime has thrown some people off, but it flies by so quick. It might be because I wanted to see more, and I'm fairly certain we're getting more after how successful this was. There's just so much excitement within this. From the story to the characters to even something as simple as the score, which is pretty good, it's hard to find something not to like. This is one of, if not the most fun movies I've seen in theaters all year. HBOMax thankfully has it for us to watch for free, but it's a movie that I want to see in theaters again. If you haven't seen The Suicide Squad, I'd highly recommend it. It's extremely violent, vulgar, and an absolutely blast. Probably the funniest movie we've seen and will get all year (shoutout to Weasel for the hilarious moments every time on screen).",The Suicide Squad
123,dfle3,"The suicide squad: ridiculous, gory, funny and entertaining. 80%",8,9 September 2021,"Looking back at my review of ""Suicide squad"", I see that all the negative criticisms that I had about the original are now positives in the later film with nearly the same name: this time the characters are engaging; this time it doesn't matter if you have no idea who these characters are; this time I laughed more than once. I laughed numerous times; this time the soundtrack wasn't used to substitute for the film's inability to offer up anything engaging or entertaining. The early use of Johnny Cash's song ""Folsom Prison blues"" was relevant. It reminded me of how dark his lyrics were, when he sang: ""I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die"". Wow! That surely sets up the characters we are about to see!; lastly, I think that this film actually has some repeat viewing value, given enough time between sittings.Now, the plot. Does anyone really care about this for Hollywood comic book related multiplex offerings? If you insist, a team of supervillains is assembled in a notorious gaol in order to undertake a black op of a suicidal nature (hence the film's title) which, if successful, would see the surviving supervillains get a discount on their gaol sentence. Of course, the supervillains need an incentive to cooperate with the authorities running the covert US government operations. The black op will be centred in a fictional island off of South America and science fantasy elements will feature.Idris Elba's supervillain character of ""Bloodsport"" is engaging, as far as what motivates him to join the suicide squad. There's a great scene where he meets his daughter for the first time in a long time. Margot Robbie's character of ""Harley Quinn"" is no doubt considered by the studio to be the pivotal figure of this franchise but I must say that I found John Cena's turn as ""Peacemaker"" much more enjoyable, especially early on, where he contributed more than his fair share to the comedy quotient of this film. Later on, Harley Quinn's narrative arc did become more satisfying but not being a consumer of the comics or cartoons, I can't say that she held a lot of cultural cachet for me (I really have to mention Chloë Grace Moretz' wonderfully brilliant turn as Hit-Girl in the comic book related film ""Kick-Ass""). As an Australian, I was surprised to be actually amused by some dialogue from Jai Courtney's ""Captain Kangaroo"". I can't remember having that thought for the first film. It wasn't exactly champagne comedy from him but at least it was passable.This revamped Suicide Squad seems to have been written by actual, professional screenwriters who know how to construct a good popcorn movie although, I have to say, with the amount of blood and gore in this film, I'm not sure if everybody would be glad to have chosen to be eating something whilst watching this film. In Australia, this film has an MA 15+ rating, so it has blood and gore but unlike a horror movie, there's not a lot of detail on the gore, if that's any recommendation. Given my comments about the first film in this franchise, I would hazard a guess that that first film was written by the studio's marketing department, with input from the accounting department. A rubbish script, in other words.Another aspect to the comedy is how some of the characters say things that the audience is no doubt thinking, like how ridiculous a character's superpower is. Since I'm not familiar with the comics or cartoons which inspired this film franchise, I can't say whether all the characters here have featured elsewhere. But gee, David Dastmalchian's ""Polka-Dot Man"" is a ridiculous concept for a character. Sylvester Stallone's ""King Shark"" isn't much better. There is some fun to be had with these characters though. Perhaps this kind of treatment of the material is because of the impossibility of taking it seriously? That's why this film treats it subject matter so ironically, perhaps. Maybe it's just me though. Watching The Dark Knight trilogy, I came to realise that Batman is actually a boring character and I just wanted to see Heath Ledger's Joker dominate proceedings in the second instalment. Speaking of The Joker, he isn't in this film. That's not something that bothered me at all either. In any case, the characters in ""The suicide squad"" to give one the impression of this is like watching children play pretend and coming with some cheap, home-made ideas for comic book characters, hence the risibility of it all.On the subject of ironic treatment of material, this film eschews film clichés like text on the screen indicating place or proceedings. Instead, elements of the picture will form this information, to interesting effect at times. If that's not the kind of thing that you find clever, at least you might appreciate the frequent use of callbacks as far as character proceedings go. In other words, a scene will recall something which happened earlier with a particular character.Lastly, I should note that the film does critique America's real involvement in that part of the world, as far as supporting brutal regimes go (or least it can't but help remind us of this). There's actually a funny moment in this film where a revelation is made after you see the suicide squad kill a lot of people on their mission. They pretty much embody, at that moment, America's foreign policy strategy and outcomes in the real world. Perhaps that outlook is common in this fictional world? Could you describe that critique of US foreign policy as 'woke'? If this film was directed by Jordan Peele, an African American, would it be considered woke? I ask that because I've noticed that Peele's soft reboot of ""Candyman"", entitled...""Candyman"", has been review bombed on this site for being ""woke"". Reviewers here are actually using that word. This speaks to who has the 'right' to critique America.Stay for the post-credits. It might entice viewers to watch a sequel to this.",The Suicide Squad
124,ethanbresnett,James Gunn you beautiful genius,8,31 July 2021,"The Suicide Squad is everything you could possibly want from self contained (ish) comic book movie.It is outrageously violent and graphic. It is hilarious. It is gritty, emotional, clever, well paced, visually stunning. More than anything though, it is just so fun.Gunn managed to take bizarre and obscure characters like Ratcatcher 2 and Polkadot Man and somehow make them more engaging and interesting than the big hitters in the DCEU like Batman and Superman. All of the new characters were brilliant, with Gunn very happy to poke fun at how ridiculous some of them are. The tone is so tongue in cheek and is exactly what is needed to handle the eclectic character list.As well as introducing so many new characters, Gunn also improved on existing ones. Margot Robbie gave her best performance as Harley Quinn with the character in fine form, and Rick Flag was vastly improved from Ayer's film.The plot, just like the characters, is ludicrous, over the top, and just so fun. It is impossible not to have an absolute blast watching this.

126,stevenrotherforth,Surely this movie can't get any sillier? Oh no wait there's a giant Starfish!,7,19 August 2021,"The Suicide SquadNot to be confused with the total disappointment that was 2016's 'Suicide Squad'.This new version complete with the word 'The' to differentiate it is an entirely better movie. In the hands of 'Guardians Of The Galaxy ' helmer James Gunn this loosely based sequel is more of an attempt to reboot. Gunn's creatively wacky approach suits the franchise much better than David Ayers take. Warner Bros have given Gunn a big budget and allowed him to go nuts!You just know that this is a crazy movie when Sylvester Stallone as a talking shark isn't the most ludicrous thing about the film. There's a host of returning faces including Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag but it is Will Smith's replacement Idris Elba as Bloodsport that carries the movie. As aforementioned Sylvester Stallone as King Shark is the scene stealer and suprisingly John Cena as Peacemaker is hilarious and excellent every time he's onscreen. I think this movie is a real turning point in Cena's career as before now he's mainly come across as a poor mans Arnie. I could go on and list everyone but it's just easier to note that all the cast involved are brilliant and clearly having a ball. Nobody as much as Director James Gunn. It's clear that he is super passionate and invested in this project. The plot is a silly one and I won't go into it. If like me you love this sort of mayhem then the technicalities of the story won't be important to you. On the other hand if you like your movies grounded and realistic then look elsewhere.'The Suicide Squad' is crazier than poo from a bat! Sadly it's not a perfect film.For all of Gunn's crazy creativity there's much of the film that doesn't flow. It feels like a disjointed production. One that suffers from ham fisted editing. Thankfully once the film does gain some traction then there's a lot of fun to be had. Especially in the final act. Technically the film looks scrumptious. Image quality is beautiful and a film I can't wait to revisit on 4K HDR Blu-ray. CGI is some of the best I have seen this year. The detail and texture gone into bringing King Shark to life is spectacular. The giant Starfish Kaiju is rendered perfectly. Yes you did read that correctly, there is a giant Starfish Kaiju! I enjoyed'The Suicide Squad'. It's by no means the genius production and greatest comic book movie ever that some reviewers claim.Not even close.Compared to Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' it just doesn't have the same depth. There isn't the audiences investment in the characters of 'The Suicide Squad' to compare it with the 'Avengers' movies or the emotional heft of James Mangold's 'Logan'. That said it's a wonderful reminder as to why we all live going to the cinema in the first place. In a time when the world is ravaged by doom and gloom,
'The Suicide Squad' is the perfect vaccine.",The Suicide Squad

That being said, the trailers were fun and Grandson released a fantastic tie in track which has been my song of the summer so I was ready to be proven wrong and boy was I? James Gunn's The Suicide Squad is an absolute joy to behold. It is relentlessly violent (uncomfortably so at times), hilariously funny and the thing I expected least, emotional; I cared about each and every member of the team despite the tagline's suggestion to not get attached and was on the edge of my seat from the absolutely bats*** intro to the touching climax. It's impossible to pick a standout performance as everyone was wonderful but if I absolutely HAD to? It would be Idris Elba or Daniela Melchior. They brought so much warmth and heart to the film and it's difficult to pick out anything I didn't like about their performances. In fact? I loved this whole film. I'm sure if I sat and really nit picked I could find plenty I didn't like but the sheer enjoyment I felt watching it and the surprise at just how much i enjoyed it surpasses any critique I can give it. I will say though, this is NOT a film for the squeamish! From credits to credits this film is brutally violent and even those with a strong stomach are gonna get some bang for their buck.

132,Mike_Devine,This franchise is doomed,4,21 August 2021,"James Gunn's much hyped sequel to 2016's disappointment 'Suicide Sqad' did not fare much better than its predecessor. 'The Suicide Squad' did its best to bring together mostly obscure anti-superheroes from the DC Comics universe, but aside from a few semi-bonafide stars like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, it overall was a letdown.Sure, John Cena and Idris Elba are two fairly bankable actors, and the return of no-nonsense Team X agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) was nice to see. But no number of throwaway cameos from the likes of Nathan Fillion and Jai Courtney to Pete Davidson could save this campy gorefest from itself.It's hard to tell what kind of film 'Suicide' is, but it's easy to understand it's basically a mockery of itself and full of irony. There are few actual comedic parts in here, even though the dialogue is written in a way that builds in one-liners intended to yield laughs. 'Suicide' is downright stupid, from the main villain they must take on to the sloppy reliance on CGI around virtually every corner.'The Suicide Squad' was supposed to restart this misfire of a franchise, but it likely will spell the beginning of the end for it.",The Suicide Squad

James Gunn, is a crazy writer and he's a crazy director and his latest The Suicide Squad, well, might be just as crazy as he is, filled to the brim with quick action and even quicker quips so quick that it might just be cathartic...and that's not a bad thing. Gunn changed Marvel with 2014s Guardians of the Galaxy when he turned a nonesense story into pure gold, and that same gold that envisioned him 7 years has been carefully sewn around this dynamite that blows up from a small fizzle, to a cascading chain reaction the kind that kind becomes the firework display around Big Ben every New Year. The Suicide Squad is silly, it's violent and is absolutely bonkers from start to finish, it's so good in fact that this may go down as the best DCEU film ever, but then that's not exactly difficult to do.

All in all, it has that james gunn dullness and distastefulness in many places that most people will probably dislike.

Firstly, its coming from james gunn who got to direct this film when he got temporarily fired by Disney for his past tweets. He was the perfect director to make suicide squad as the 2016 version tried to be gotg which failed.Also james gunn, gave interviews that he was given full freedom by the studios to make any kind of movie u like. And james gunn delivers it perfectly.The whole movie has james gunn flavor in it so hence we don't need to #releasethegunncut#. Its violent like some of his pre-mcu movies which I haven't seen, so it was new for me to see an r rated james gunn movie.There are lots of characters where most of them die in the beginning in which I felt Michael rooker's death very funny. My favorite character was ratcatcher 2 and king shark who are instantly likeable characters. Idris elba was badass as bloodsport but he reminded me a lot of deadshot as there are many similarities with him and deadshot. Both are expert in weapons and both have a daughter angle. Margot robbie was as usual fantastic as Harley quinn.The last act was nail biting as I was worried who will die and to my relief all my favorite characters survived in the end which made me feel good.On the whole, the suicide squad is funny, creepy, violent and emotional entertainer. This proves that how directors can perform if studios give them full freedom. #releasetheayercut#",The Suicide Squad

141,fciocca,"Appealing visual effects, bland plot, unbalanced characters. I can't say that I was impressed.",5,11 August 2021,"Rebooting a franchise five years after its initial release is never a good sign. I had a very bad feeling about ""The Suicide Squad"" when I watched the trailer, later confirmed once I got out of the theatre.The plot is bland and the characters are unbalanced. Too much focus is given to Bloodsport, Harley Quinn and Ratcatcher 2. The rest of the squad has really marginal roles. When you have talents such as David Dastmalchian, and you give them such small screen time, it is a real waste. At least the first movie did not have this issue. John Cena is okay as Peacemaker, but he could do a better job. Rick Flag, in the previous chapter, was essential to keep the team together. Here his part is significantly reduced. Honestly, the movie would be the same even without him. I have appreciated King Shark, that gave a hint of goofy comedy, and managed to release a bit of tension. Overall a downgrade, on the characterization side. A real pity, with more effort they could have done something unique and remake this movie properly.There are some creative visual effects and the CGI is wonderful. There is a lot of gore, violence and blood. I am happy that DC is showing some explicit images. This is exactly what I expect from a Suicide Squad movie. I am tired of this censored joke that Marvel is building up. James Gunn nailed photography and cinematography. On the technical side I don't have any remarks, for sure it is way better than its predecessor.The fact that this is a popcorn movie, does not justify releasing a film that has a flat storyline, dumping completely any form of character or plot depth. I am not expecting a meaningful movie, but I wish to see more logic, not just a bunch of action scenes. Probably this is what most of the fans want to watch, but does not cut it for me. The flick wants to be comedic, and at the beginning there are some scenes that are genuinely funny, but most of the jokes later on are very forced and not funny at all. If you are a fan of the DC universe, give it a try. It is still an enjoyable and entertaining watch, especially if you are with friends. However, this could have been way much better.",The Suicide Squad
142,Puroo,Why can't we have both this AND Ayer Cut? Why do I have to choose one?,10,10 September 2021,"All Snyder and Ayer fans should know three things before they give this movie negative reviews. First, Zack Snyder is the executive producer of this movie. Second, Snyder, Ayer and Gunn are good friends. Dawn of the Dead, was written by James Gunn himself. And third, James Gunn supports the Snyderverse. He himself said he wants to see the Ayer Cut. And this is Suicide Squad. It's always going to be a different team. So both can coexist. With all that said, let's move on to the actual review.The thing I like about James Gunn's movies is that he doesn't take anything seriously. This is the reason why we get to see many weird things happening which we won't normally see in any other director's movies. There are many such instances in this movie itself, most particularly in the beginning where TDK uses his detachable arms to slap the enemy soldiers. There are also King Shark, whom Gunn manages to make terrifying and cute at the same time, there's Harley Quinn of course, who imagines weird things and then acts accordingly, and there's Bloodsport who acts all tough but gets scared of a rat.The comic timing is what makes this movie so good. All the characters have something unique to offer, and all of them are making the scene more exciting. I really liked that part where Harley Quinn comes out of the building and sees everyone coming in to save her. There are also other scenes where I couldn't hold my laughter, like King Shark raising his arm and saying ""Hand!"" (for that matter all King Shark scenes were great). Many deaths come up unexpected, and the movie gives us enough reasons to care. So it's always a flinching moment whenever someone dies.My favourite character in this movie, which must have become obvious by now, is King Shark. Whenever he is on the scene we know something good is going to happen. Even when he is not doing anything he just stands there adorably. I also like Peacemaker. His dialogues are great, and every time he speaks it's something funny. Bloodshot also has some really great action scenes along with him. Ratcatcher II and Harley Quinn were also hilarious when needed. The team that comes in the start really sets the mood and I really hope they do something great with Weasel. He looked interesting.I have only read one Suicide Squad comic (Rebirth) and watched three movies (the 2016 one, this and Hell To Pay). So I won't call myself an expert on the franchise. But seeing how Kill the Justice League is also seeming to be in similar tone, I believe Suicide Squad is supposed to be this hilarious rollercoaster. And this movie absolutely stands by it. I'd really hope we get to see at least like, ten Suicide Squad movies and shows in this decade.",The Suicide Squad

Both movies suffer similar issues, which I find disappointing considering they had a second chance correcting the first movie with a reboot. The Suicide Squad is horribly paced. It starts off incredibly fast, then slows down for about an hour, then slowly ramps up again. The second act is the slowest, and it also happens to be the worst act too. The main plot of The Suicide Squad gets completely forgotten and it shifts to a completely different plot. This chunk of the film is just really off-putting for some reason, and honestly, it really ruins the movie for me.But I do like how the film isn't taking itself seriously, with goofy characters in goofy costumes, with goofy jokes. With a film like this, you really can't create a serious atmosphere, so at least it's self-aware and light-hearted. There's also a bunch of really likable characters that's hard not to grow attached to; like King Shark and Poke-a-dot man.The Suicide Squad is a funny, light-hearted movie, but it suffers from a lot of technical issues, like, disconnected editing, uneven pacing, and a script that completely forgets its main plot for about an hour. I was really hoping for this movie to be great, but it ended up being okay. But the future of the DCEU does look somewhat promising, so I'm still interested for what's next in this extended universe.",The Suicide Squad
144,x_manicure_x,"A lot of fun but too similar to ""Guardians of the Galaxy""",7,26 August 2021,"Pulpy, ludicrous, and sardonic superhero film that is absolutely perfect for its main characters. Everything that happens is patently ridiculous, but at the same time, coherent with the self-aware atmosphere of the film. More than telling a story, it's all about triggering the interaction between characters and connecting the highest possible number of iconic scenes.However, while the visuals, direction, and editing are constantly exuberant and inventive, many verbal jokes fell flat. The themes and characters are also too dangerously close to Gunn's works with Marvel. Same outcasts with a golden heart, same structure of the team, same cinematography, etc. The only significant differences are the uncontrolled use of gore and the fact that almost no character is immune to collateral damages. With its own personality, ""The Suicide Squad"" could actually become the better, more mature alternative to the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but for now, Gunn is still playing it safe, sticking to an already proven successful formula.",The Suicide Squad

director: James Gunn
Starring: Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, Sylvester Stallone, Pete Davidson, Peter Capaldi, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Michael Rooker, Viola Davis, Nathan Fillion, Jai Courtnay, Flula Borg, Mayling Ng, Sean Gunn, David Dastmalchian, Alice Braga, Daniela Melchior etcThe Suicide Squad is about a group of supervillains including Harley Quinn, Bloodsport and peacemaker and a bunch of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super shady Task force X. As they are dropped off at the remote, enemy infused island of Corto Maltese. Wow what an absolute thrill ride from start to finish.My first few positives would be the cinematography, gore and fun set up. As well as the fantastic cast chemistry and performances, and fantastic action. This film had some of the most creative cinematography I have seen. It had its own unique visual style and it really showed. With some very creative scenes that I have never seen before, with some very clever transitions and use of text, as well as using flowers and rain to create such an interesting and impactful effect to the action scenes. The gore was also fantastic. It was over the top, gruesome and impactful. It really made the scenes stand out with the obsessive amounts of blood and it certainly isn't for the faint hearted, the film was willing to take risks with its gore and I loved that. I also thought the set up was a lot of fun, they didn't mess about and set the characters up on their mission straight away, throwing you into the action immediately, which set the tone well for the rest of the film. The action was also fantastic. Partly helped by the gore. The action sequences were thrilling, entertaining and brutal. The film very rarely allowed you to stop and breathe, the action sequences all delivered and got better and better as the film went on. The cast also had insane chemistry. Every single actor worked brilliantly together, the team dynamic was unique and fun. And the comedic chemistry between everyone was fantastic.g The whole cast also did fantastic performances here. With my key standouts being Idris Elba, Margot Robbie and John Cena. And new standouts of David Dastmalchian and Daniela Melchior. They all delivered fantastic performances, going all out and you could really tell the hard work and how much fun they were all having.My next few positives would be the fun opening sequence, the fantastic humour and character motivations. With excellent background to the plot, usage of powers and Soundtrack. The opening sequence was insanely fun. It was shocking, thrilling and a completely unique opening to any film I have seen before. The sheer amount of character deaths was shocking and a unique element to the film, you couldn't get too attached to the characters and I loved that. I thought the film was hilarious. This is down to two main factors. Firstly, the insane chemistry and comedic performances from the cast, and secondly the fantastically written dialogue. It was witty, relatable and outside of the box and I laughed so many times. The character motivation for joining the team was excellent, especially focusing on Bloodsport. Amanda Waller was a fantastic villain. And the introduction of Bloodsport's daughter and the threat and increased stakes she added for Bloodsport was excellent, and really shined a light on how the characters didn't really have much of a choice when joining. I also thought the background into the plot was great. The film went into a good amount of detail with the characters mission, explaining the political situation in Corto Maltese well, as well as setting up the main plot point and final act excellently. The characters powers were also diverse and unique. It was amazing to see so many superheroes with such a huge range of powers. Ratcatcher and Polka dot man in particular were great. Finally, the soundtrack was also amazing, it fitted the films tone excellently, with perfectly times songs that were entertaining, created impact and was even used for some fantastic comedy.My only slight tiny little nit-pick would be the Separate Storyline with Harley Quinn, you will see that's it's also a positive. But the film spent slightly too long in making you Think Harley was falling for the same old tricks with men as she has in the past, so therefore it felt out of place for her character now. It was fixed but I am still slightly undecided on whether it was needed.My next few positives would be the development to the plot and how layered it was. The fantastic plot twists. The separate storyline and great villains. The plot was paced really well, it developed excellently and wasn't one simple straight forward story, I loved the layers to it. At first it seemed like one simple mission, but I loved how the film would suddenly add a new layer and a new mission for the characters to complete, it always kept me invested. The plot twists were also excellent, there was always fun twists where the film would make you believe one thing and then turn it on its head. The twists were a mixture of comedic and very dark. And the final act twist with Amanda and Peacemaker was excellent and added another fun new layer to the film. I also did like a fair amount of the separate storyline with Harley. It bought some great visual and comedic moments. Gave the audience more information on the villains, whilst also giving Harley her independence. Setting up a lot of great things for the second half of the film, and continuing Harley's arc of independence. The villains were great. I loved the fact that there was multiple. The generals were evil, cruel and did their jobs within the film well. And Starro despite being wonderfully absurd was also a fantastic edition to the film. With very dark and unique powers that paved the way for an insanely fun final act.My final few positives would be the great character depth, the films unique tone. The excellent final act and rising of stakes, as well as the satisfying ending. I really liked the character depth sprinkled throughout the film. Especially for Ratcatcher, Bloodsport, Polka Dot man and Rick Flag. The film had nice personal moments between a lot of the characters, as you actually grew to connect with them as you learned more about their past. The bond between Bloodsport and Ratcatcher was one of the key standouts. I also loved the films unique tone. This film was completely different to any superhero film or any film that I have seen. It was never afraid to cross some boundaries, it had its own visual style and way of storytelling. And I really commend James Gun for his work here. I also thought the final act was incredible. It was entertaining, thrilling and completely unpredictable. With so many surprises. The building of stakes was excellent, so much so that I genuinely didn't know who was going to survive. But I loved that feeling of unpredictability. Finally, the film ended in a very satisfying way, with the characters free and having stronger relationships. As well as setting up a couple of fun things within the post credit scene.Overall, The Suicide squad is a thrilling, outrageous and over the top masterpiece. That isn't afraid to cross some lines. It's a completely unique and insanely fun experience. James Gun you have my full support with any film you do from now on. This is my personal favourite DC film.Overall score 99/100.",The Suicide Squad
146,thebricks,"Mediocre, Daniela Melchior best thing about the movie shockingly",5,8 August 2021,"Not a very good movie. Lost a lot of faith in James Gunn after this. I also think Margot Robbie needs to be replaced after this film. She just has no passion for the Harley Quinn role. She phones it in along with John Cena and Idris Elba. Elba's performance was so bad, they renamed his character Bloodsport to leave the door open for Will Smith to come back, which is hilarious.The most interesting characters leave the movie at the very beginning, a very bizarre decision that left the rest of the movie with very boring characters to carry the film. It was very disappointing to see how much the trailers basically lied to the audience. Not sure if these decisions were COVID influenced, but it made no sense.The plot and villains were just not very threatening, which led to me playing with my laptop and phone quite a bit. I just didn't see a reason to care, especially when you know someone in the US government can just press a button and make their problems go away.Daniela Melchior is the best thing about the film. She upstaged Big Money Margot Robbie. Really embarrassing stuff. Whereas the film's loss of Will Smith hurt the sequel quite a bit, Margot's removal from the movie probably would have improved it. Daniela is so good in the role, I'd argue that she should replace Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. She's simply better than the Ratcatcher role.Watch this on streaming if you can, don't waste your time in theaters.",The Suicide Squad

149,MogwaiMovieReviews,"12 Minutes of Fun, 2 Hours of Tedium",5,8 August 2021,"Well, it must be said, it IS an improvement on the first one (which is not that much of an achievement, all things considered) and I think I would agree that it might be the best DC movie the past 10 years (again, not that hard). Though tremendously hit-and-miss and generally hard to like (especially the first hour), The Suicide Squad is still genuinely funny and (almost) fun at points, and that is what has been most missing from that studio all this time.The biggest problem really is that it tries to mix a Guardians Of The Galaxy type humour with the callous gore and cynicism of ""The Boys"" and then expects just doing that will be enough to make us invest in the story and want to see what happens next. It doesn't, and the comedic violence very, very quickly just becomes predictable, repetitive, depressing and... deadening. There's no gravity to any of the characters or events: almost every moment which might mean something or cause us to care about someone is depth-charged by a dumb joke, which more often than not isn't even funny. And there is not a single likeable or relatable human being onscreen the whole 2 hours and 12 minutes. It doesn't matter who lives or dies.The Harley Quinn character is noticeably more annoying than before, though Idris Elba isn't too bad, and the shark guy and the cute rats are okay. I guess I liked the quirkiness of the Polkadot Man and his visions of his dead mother.But when I tell you my favourite part of the whole film, and the only bit that actually made me laugh, is Elba's daughter screaming ""IT DOES OTHER THINGS TOO!"" while arguing with him about an Apple watch, you might start to get a picture of how slim the pickings are.",The Suicide Squad
150,Brooklynsmagicmike,It is a little overrated in my opinion but it was still a good movie.,7,10 August 2021,"After in my opinion was a massive dissapointment from the first suicide squad I diddn't know what to expect from this one. So I waited few days upon release to see what the general consensus would be. The reviews were overwhelming positivw across the board and I was more then excited to see this one based on that. But upon conclusion while I did enjoy the movie, I was left scratching my head as to why the reviews were really high.First off the pros, the cast is very good and the acting was to across the board. The visuals were great, and for 2 hour plus movie the pacing wasn't bad by any means. The movie did contain alot of action and good amount charm too. It overall was big step up from its predecessor.With all that said though there was quite few negatives. First there was hardly any plot at all and at times the story did meander around. The comedy aspect the film tried to obtain was cringeworthy and very awkward. I also just felt the film direction was odd. The movie was kind of campy at times. It diddn't have that darker, more serious tone that the prior film had which I felt was about only thing its predecessor had done right.Would I recommend this film? Absolutely its definitely fun and good time killer. I just wouldn't personally see it again and don't agree with the excessively high reviews.",The Suicide Squad
151,ayoreinf,If we see you on screen we'll learn about you,9,16 August 2021,"I remember the previous installment in this franchise and how I complained that only three roles had real character written down for them. That's not the case in this one. Almost every one getting real screen time gets a character. Even Savant who's barely there gets his character - think about the opening scene with a bouncing ball. Even King Shark, who's mainly CGI, gets a character (and kudos to Sylvester Stallone) and more than just getting a character - they're all getting a human character without getting cheesy (almost) so we get to like them, we get to care and the actors get a real feast. They all get something to sink their teeth in, and they do.Viola Davis is still short of real background - she does get a character, obviously, but if you don't know the comics you know nothing about her but the callous bureaucrat you see on screen. It's a deliberate decision, to leave her as the one without a soul, the ultimate pawn master. James Gunn also made a conscious decision about blurring the lines between good and bad. Which, in fact is necessary when our heroes are all villains, but think about his heroes in GotG and you'll realize James Gunn likes them a bit morally ambiguous. This way their humanity comes shining all the brighter when they let it show.Bottom line - everybody has said it already - it's violent, it's fun and it makes its point as straightforwardly as possible. If you don't mind the quantities of blood - this might be exactly for you.",The Suicide Squad

153,dommercaldi,"Overall, It's Pretty Entertaining And Far Better Than The First Film",6,5 August 2021,"Pros:
1. The editing is slick, vibrant and creative which not only helps to infuse the film with these qualities, but they make the transitions between the differing story-lines to occur smoothly.2. The special effects, for the most part, hold up really well, and unlike the first movie, the lighting isn't lowered to enhance them.3. The comedy largely works in cementing the relationships between the characters, for example, the initial back-and-forth between Bloodsport (Idris Elba) and Peacemaker (John Cena).4. The heavily saturated lighting reinforces the over-the-top and comical nature of the film.5. The fight scenes are fast-paced and fizzling with energy.6. The blood and gore, although mostly reliant on CGI, again helps to reinforce the crazy and ludicrous nature of the movie, as well as making for some truly uncomfortable viewing.7. The film is, for the most part, just mindless superhero/ super-villain fun, and in that regards, it's very entertaining.Cons:
1. The last 30 minutes of the film descended into a Godzilla-esque scenario with the monster running around and destroying buildings, which became tiresome after the first 5 minutes.2. The movie is a little tonally confused at times when it tries to insert humour in somewhat serious and tense moments.3. There were too many characters, and as a result, a lot of them were poorly developed and given nothing to do. Some were just introduced just to serve as cheap laughs and deaths.4. The theme of hawkish American foreign policy creating far more problems than it solves is heavy-handed in its execution to the point where it induces eye-rolls frequently.",The Suicide Squad
154,movieman6-413-929510,"Because of the given freedom, James Gunn knows how to put the film together in his own entertaining way.",7,8 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is the sequel to 2016's Suicide Squad. This sequel is directed and written by Guardians of the Galaxy and Slither director James Gunn.In the film, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles another group of super-villains for a dangerous mission in exchange for a reduced sentence. This time, the team is led by assassin Bloodsport (Idris Elba), who must lead the Squad through the jungles of a remote island filled with enemy soldiers.The first Suicide Squad movie was put together in a rushed and chaotic way and later reworked by the movie studio, ending up with a messy movie. With this sequel, they've given director James Gunn more freedom to make the film his own way. For example, James has chosen to fill the Squad of this film with the more unknown and unloved villains from the DC series. He tries to build up most of the characters in the film well, but even though they have been given a good backstory in the film, as a viewer you are not sure who will survive the film. He also provides good entertainment and tension, because your favorite character can suddenly die in the film. He often does this in a brutal and bloody way.James Gunn has also chosen to use practical effects as much as possible in order to use as little CGI as possible. This makes the action scenes of the film more realistic. Where Gunn does use visual effects, things like CGI characters still seem credible in the film thanks to an eye for detail.The acting is also well done by the film cast. Despite the size of the cast, every actor gets a chance to come forward with his role. James Gunn also wrote the script in such a way that you get to see strange combinations of characters together, but he still knows how to bring them together. You have the alpha males Bloodsprot and Peacemaker (John Cena) who both try to lead the Squad in their own way. Then there's the innocent Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) who tries to befriend the CGI character King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone) so they can better work together as a Squad to complete their mission.",The Suicide Squad

DC has been characterized by making real garbage destroying the reputation of characters who were designed in the same way: all shady, traumatized and with severe internal weaknesses (except Shazam). Here we see a series of characters with extreme abilities except the ex-girlfriend of the Joker who instead of using a stick uses a javelin as a weapon and has as much or better aim than Bloodsport or Peacemaker. There is an adequate choice of characters and it is obvious that the protagonist is carried out by those who impose trends in clothing or makeup (things that men do not care at all).

OK they don't look so bad, but, they are mostly pointless and highly inconsistent. The fight scenes are bad. The action, in general, is bad, though, admittedly less so than most other things. It's so weird it's bad. Really, it's an almost endless spring of badness. Hell, it's not even a ""so bad it's good"" movie...Essentially, this is like a promising young high-school student making a movie to ""show all the thing that he can do"". OK, impressive, but, the end result is useless for anything else.See, in bits-and-pieces, there are some spots that are OK. Sure, I may be poking some fun on the polka-dot man, but, still, it's true. A few nice shots of Margot Robbie's eyes, or her hanging figure-four lock of her captor and torturer, some nice pieces with the Ratcatcher 2, who's also very pretty even being dirty all the time, the half-joke that all American women love men with accents, and quite a few more.Can't really say that this is better than the original Suicide Squad. It's just a different kind of bad. For one thing, Margot Robbie looked _much_ better in the original.I can't think of any reason to recommend to anyone to watch this, and that's rare, almost all movies have something for somebody.",The Suicide Squad

I know the plot shouldn't be taken seriously, but for me there's a limit of how crazy a movie plot should be.

The film good along at an amazing pace with a brilliant mix of humour and action.The characters make the film though and there are plenty of characters to enjoy in this film. They are not typical superheros and all come with very different attributes that you don't expect. The plot isn't obvious and builds to a great end.An excellent film to see at least twice.,The Suicide Squad
160,Darkjak007,Bow before your lord and master Starro The Conqueror,8,6 August 2021,"Directed and Written James Gunn jumps into the DC universe with The suicide squad the sequel to the 2016 movie. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) puts together two teams of Task Force X to infiltrate the South American country of Corte Maltese, locate the facility of Joutenheim to find and destroy all traces & evidence of a weapon known as project starfish. This Film doesn't not beat around the bush you are jumped in to the scenario with villains already been selected and sent off on the mission. James Gunn takes advantage of having full control on this film and doesn't hold back on the subtlety and restrictions. The films mixture of dark humor and satire mix with comedic comicbook tone is both entertaining and shocking. This scenario feels believable to how The suicide squad would act in the field and how they are seen as just mere assets. These being supervillains they have no morals ethics the same as a hero. Some would clearly lie, stab you in the back for their own benefit or stick by your side. This movies action it's brutal and all the same it feels appropriate these people have no problem whatsoever in killing whoever stands in their way of completing the task. The story to general audience might sound ridiculous, to comic book fans it's more of how you can actually see the squad being utilized. The movie soundtrack has good songs and unlike the first movie, where they just felt like they were trying to mimic guardians of the galaxy. Here they don't seem as tacked on and out of place it actually accompanies more with the tone of the scenes given. The pacing is done to swap back between the two teams adds to of the mission. It feels as though there's something going on the whole time. With plenty fun moments and the humor given with time to expand on who these people and why you should actually have a reason to care about them and not want them dead. However with 14 villains 15 if you count Starro in this movie you know all of them aren't going to get the same amount of screen time. It's going to make some people upset some of the Choices,but as advertise don't get to attach which you will but you will be surprised. Some that they do choose to focus on more are written very well though. Such as Bloodsport (Idris Elba) who out of the gate you can see that his character's very similar to Will Smith's Deadshot the similarities are pretty there. He's has this reluctance to join the squad,but has a daughter that's his motivation to go. The suit at first glance looks just like a deadshot, but he does have his own personality and style that is different that you see he's his own character. Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has gradually over the course of all these films We've seen Harley's character change to the point that she's not entirely selfish and out for herself anymore, but it does reminds us despite Harley's lovable charm she's still crazy. Margot as harley is great but it's not like previous films where she the one holding everything together. Some of the other villains are really interesting, the chemistry between the squad has actual depth. King Shark doesn't have friends and ratcatcher 2 who is more of the heart of the team she understands him and the dialogue between her and the other's motherly to the point you question how she ended up in Belle Reve. Bloodsport and peacemaker both have this militaristic persona with both of them pushing each other and trying to out stage the other. Amanda Waller is just brutal& vindictive in this film and even managed to make Rick flag a likable guy. You're able to take these more c&d list characters like polkadot man, captain boomerang,peacemaker,blackguard or Comic staples like Starro. Characters that most would never of heard of or even imagine them in a movie and make them entertaining. Overall The suicide squad is a great film offers tons of fun and entertainment with its humor and characters it a film highly recommended for DC fans. Just don't make any mistake of thinking that you know how this film is going to play out with these character's everybody is up for grabs here.",The Suicide Squad

163,zac-04879,No Need to View the Original to Understand this DC Action Flick,7,8 August 2021,"Gunn's gory, silly and completely fresh reboot-sequel to Suicide Squad is a pleasurable surprise, but unfortunately lacks some energy. Basically, The Suicide Squad is exactly what 2016's bummer should've been. It's entirely obvious to identify, but it was tremendously unnecessary to add all the extreme carnage, language and other overdone graphic material to the story. What people truly want is just a fun, comical, ridiculous and entertaining flick packed with engaging action that's worth witnessing in the cinema.Despite the major gore, The Suicide Squad is surprisingly improved and is certainly much better than most sequels we've experienced over the past two years. However, the film owns some weakness that makes it worth warning everyone to not let their expectations move too high. It's mainly just the prolonged climax and the film's whole pace in general. Considering it isn't fast and feels noticeably extensive, the characters, action and jokes make it worth a watch.The creators basically just completely ignore the existence of 2016's Suicide Squad, aim at the fun centre of the target, fire the arrow, miss the bullseye, but unexpectedly achieve a high score. Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Rick Flag, King Shark, Ratcatcher and Polka-Dot Man lead as entertaining and engaging characters, placed in the middle of an action-packed mission. The silliness in the centre is loveable and it's all a really funny adventure, but isn't worth way too much hype.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Suicide Squad
164,darkreignn,A hell of a lot of fun,9,15 August 2021,"When I go to see a movie, I expect certain, specific things. For example, if the movie stars Margot Robbie, like this film does, I expect to be consistently and constantly aroused; ""The Suicide Squad"" delivered. Similarly, if I am paying $16 dollars for a single ticket to watch a movie that is about a group of deplorable villains being forced to undertake a mission that will likely result in their untimely death, I expect to be consistently and constantly entertained; once again, ""The Suicide Squad"" delivered.James Gunn took this material and turned it into what we all wanted to see the first time - a rated-R film about a group of horrible, despicable villains that are forced to band together for a suicide mission that will most likely lead to their demise. Yes, it's safe to say that James Gunn directed a film that is so much fun, and so incredibly entertaining from the start, that it's easy to overlook the potential flaws that are inherently present in almost any superhero film.The first thing that amazed me about this film is how much better it is in every way when compared to the 2016 ""Suicide Squad."" Literally every single aspect of this film is not just slightly better, or somewhat better, but significantly improved. Remember the atrocious soundtrack to the 2016 film that, coupled with the horrific editing, attempted to give the movie a sense of fun that was inherently and obviously missing in the original footage? James Gunn clearly had fun at the forefront of his mind when shooting this movie because everything from the music to the editing to the dialogue and action all combine together seamlessly to create a viewing experience that is as entertaining as it is coherent. Where studio buggery chopped up the 2016 film to something akin to Frankenstein's monster, here you can tell the studio had little, if any involvement; yes, this is a James Gunn film through-and-through, that doesn't shy away from its R-rating.I was genuinely shocked at how violent this movie was. This isn't your momma's Suicide Squad, that's for sure. From the opening scene where someone gets their face blown off by high-powered rounds of ammunition, you know you're in for something special. I admire DC for allowing Gunn to go balls to the wall crazy here; Gunn's almost schizophrenic tone elevates the material and adds an unmistakable sense of style that is so entertaining to watch unfold. However, the violence in this movie isn't just violence for the sake of violence. What I admired most about this movie is that there really aren't many set pieces or high-profile scenes of action that you would typically expect in your average superhero film; everything that happens either services the narrative, or is setup for a joke that simultaneously entertains and builds upon the characters.And the characters are another reason why this movie prevails where the 2016 film failed. Everyone in this movie plays their role to perfection, creating loveable characters who you will genuinely want to root for. And most importantly, Gunn creates characters who are likeable, but also villainous. Yes, besides one or two characters who are genuinely good, the villains that make up the suicide squad are just that: villains. Gunn shows these characters killing without mercy, but yet you won't be able to help but want to see them succeed. There is a sense of naturality at play - where the 2016 film tried so hard to make each character feel ""cool,"" this movie depicts each character as unapologetically themselves, without trying to guide the audience toward feeling a specific way about them. And because of that, the bond you will inevitably begin to form with the characters is all the more natural.The story here isn't anything necessarily special - that said, the goings on of the film truly feel like something you'd see in an 80s action movie. And yes, you guessed it: This just adds to the sense of fun. When you watch this film, you're really watching it for the characters and the scenarios that they get themselves into. And yes, there is a narrative that obviously glues everything together, but it almost comes second to the phenomenal character building. Instead of the characters serving the story, the story serves the characters; as I mentioned earlier, practically everything that happens in this movie plays a role in building up each member of the titular suicide squad. And so, while the actual narrative is slightly forgettable, the unforgettable characters is what you'll remember, and enjoy the most, from this film.I can't emphasize enough how entertaining this movie is. I've watched it twice so far, and I have plans to see it a third time soon - and if my couple of initial viewings were any indicator, I know I will enjoy this movie even more the third time around. Gunn has created a fantastic film, and I really hope that he's allowed to make more because I, for one, want to spend more time in this world and the people who inhabit it.",The Suicide Squad

It has a lot special humour and jokes by mr. Gunn. Secondly, the cast is great. I think, it's the best film for Margo Robbie ar Harley Queen. Idris Elba and John Cena are stars of film. Also it has a lot of cameo of Gunn's friends. Thirdly, the visual effects are awesome, it has a lot blood, brains, and etc. Fourthly, the music is amazing as always.So, it's great superhero movie!P.

The movie is insain, action packed and has some decent gags in it as well. Even If not all of the wise cracking works.It's great to finally see Margot Robbies Harley Quinn actually look like Harley Quinn, but I couldn't believe the real star of the suicide squad is John Cena.

172,digdog-785-717538,absolutely brilliant reversal of the last 20 years of garbage,8,21 August 2021,"A few thought post-viewing on The Suicide Squad;1. It loves to invert tropes. Kills enemies uncerimoniously, heroes dont cut the red wire on time, last ditch efforts fail miserably, and heroics turn out to be blunders. The film is full of this, aaaalmost to the point where it's too much. Forgivable and still plenty enjoyable.2. the action was mostly ok, there are a few slipups of ""guy X is so OP that tension fails"" but otherwise it was ok, and, given the previous point of tropes failing fairly frequently, kept the action scenes interesting.3. high intensity direction and editing, but i didn't get a headache.4. absolutely excellent performances by John Cena (i *never* imagined i would say this), Idris Elba (weirdly, i again never imagined i would say this, given how he's a ""serious"" actor), and okaish performance by Margot Robbie, but at the same time a very interesting use of her character which isn't the same I AM SO HYPER thing they do everywhere else.5. pretty decent CGI
6. Loved the final boss
7. A story that makes sense told in a way that makes sense, with decent pacing
8. Holy **** i love polkadot manwhat wasn't so great
1. The music was hit and miss. Intrusive, and while some of it was good, some of it wasn't. Forgivable.2. runtime a bit too long
3. The ""real americans dont kill children"" bit was cringeyThere's a few real touches of genius here that i won't spoil, even knowing that they may go over your head, but regardless i'm sure that you will love this film. Maybe not as much as i have. Let's say, if you are unhappy with the blatant fanservice-way in which these marketing-department superheroes are being displayed in the last 20-odd years of superhero films, you will then appreciate more TSS because it secretly hates itself, and will let you konw at every opportunity.Oh i didn't like rat catcher girl one bit, but i can live with this one fault in an otherwise surprisingly great film.",The Suicide Squad
173,Olicosmic,"Literally everything the original should have been, and then some",9,1 September 2021,"After seeing so much hype and amazing advertisements to the original ""Suicide Squad"" in 2016, I was excited-not only because it was the DCEU's chance to redeem themselves against the growing MCU, but also because the movie just looked like it'd be a ton of fun. Aaaannndd, it ended up being one of the most uneventful, drab, and choppy superhero films of all time; and while I wouldn't say it was one of the WORST I've seen, it was still a massive letdown where the advertisements were better than the movie itself. Come 2020, we're all tired of the pandemic, I see a teaser for a NEW ""Suicide Squad"" movie, and at first, I didn't think much of it since I was still very disappointed from the 2016 mess. That was until I saw that James Gunn was directing it, and as a huge fan of both the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films, my excitement levels matched what they were in 2016 before they ultimately were crushed by the original. That didn't happen this time, for this movie is not only excellent, but it makes the original completely obsolete (at least, to me). It feels like what the original was going for, while also doing a damn good job at it. The story, while a bit heavy on exposition, has a lot of fun with its characters and settings. So much so, that the exposition is actually enjoyable, and doesn't outstay it's welcome-something the original film struggled with HARD. The reason why it works here is because the overall writing is a lot more light-hearted without being too over the top-something borrowed from the GOTG movies, and it works excellently with the characters here. Speaking of which, they're all very likable. Whether it be the silly, but endearing King Shark, the crazy, but lovable Harley Quinn, the relatable and kickass Bloodsport, or anyone else, everyone is awesome-just like the cast themselves here. Especially John Cena, as, for someone who hasn't been in a lot of big budget films, he did a real good job as the cocky Peacemaker. The writing, of course, isn't just exposition, as it's got many tricks up its sleeve to keep the viewers heavily invested throughout its duration. Whether it be the fun and gory action (that isn't filmed in dark places this time, thank goodness), the unique and fun direction of James Gunn, the amount of fun, and almost absurd, additions and turns to the villains (being vague to avoid spoilers-just don't expect to look at starfish the same way ever again), and the excellent pacing throughout, this film is awesome, and written well, overall. In terms of flaws, while the film is well written, it's not anything overtly new or ground breaking, and while the film definitely feels like it's own, which is definitely not a bad thing, it could have done a little more. Also, this film, unlike the original, doesn't take itself too seriously whatsoever, and while that works wonders for it, anyone expecting a dark and brooding approach of the Suicide Squad may be a bit disappointed, as this is anything but. Though, seeing how poor the original turned out, one could argue that the fact this film isn't dark or brooding is actually a good thing. Overall, this film, much like the main characters, kicks ass. James Gunn seemed to have taken the main concept of the original and actually made a good movie out of it, as this is literally everything the original should have been, and then some.",The Suicide Squad
174,danew13,absolute rubbish,2,8 August 2021,From the opening scene onwards the film is incoherent and a waste of time.,The Suicide Squad
175,TheVictoriousV,"A step up, for Suicide Squad and the whole of DC.",8,6 August 2021,"Keep this in mind everyone, lest you lose track: this isn't Suicide Squad. This is THE Suicide Squad. Why that name, you ask? Well, because it makes the previous Suicide Squad easier to forget, whereas this new production is, as the title promises, THE film adaptation of the DC line of comics. Oh, what a difference a definite article makes.First, they followed up on the hilarious pomposity of Batman v Superman with a film that was only made into a Marvel-aping action-comedy in post (plus one or two reshoots). Then, they hired Marvel regular Joss Whedon to make Justice League more uplifting and comical too late into production. Now, DC continues to be ""nothing like Marvel"" by having James Gunn, the brain behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy pictures, try his hand at a Suicide Squad movie where the tone and style were actually decided on when the camera started rolling.You may crack wise at how much more tolerable these movies become when DC and Warner Bros. Fully lean into the Marvelisms, but honestly, this one's something else! It's proof that Warner, on some level (certainly more than Marvel), get the idea that superhero films are at their most memorable when we let directors be themselves, hence this year gave us Zack Snyder's Justice League and now this.The Suicide Squad isn't perfect - nor is it as fascinatingly, unintentionally disturbing as Wonder Woman 1984 - but it is refreshingly ripe with personality. More than his Guardians movies, The Suicide Squad recalls Gunn's beginnings with Troma Entertainment, as he (rightfully) is no longer held back by a PG-13 rating.We do get Margot Robbie again, still a good pick for the clown queen of crime Harley Quinn (albeit much better written than in her debut), along with Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, and Viola Davis from the first flick, all of them more engaging than before. New to the cast are Idris Elba as the gloomy Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker (a jingoistic parody of Captain America), Sylvester Stallone as the null-witted King Shark, Daniela Melchior as the loveable and loving Ratcatcher, David Dastmalchian as the gloriously pathetic Polka-Dot Man, and Peter Capaldi as the devious Thinker.We also see such actors as Michael Rooker, Taika Waititi, Nathan Fillion, and Sean Gunn, the latter playing a character who somewhat resembles the noisome cat from Bloom County as mixed with Scrat (notably, many of these actors have been in MCU comedies). There's also Flula (of the similarly named YouTube channel) and a giant starfish who no doubt has an elaborate comic-book history.In true DCEU fashion, the idea of seeing all these comic-book baddies team up isn't too exciting on its own, since we haven't yet explored these characters in the same way we'd gotten to know the MCU iterations of Captain America, Thor, etc. Before seeing them join forces. (Time will tell if a similarly weak crossover will result from Warner Bros' Scoob movie, which was already a crossover between Scooby-Doo, Captain Caveman, Wacky Races, and Dino-mutt). Again, is this even the same Harley Quinn as the piece of meat we saw in the first film? Honestly, who cares? I'm just glad we have this one, and that she's now a part of a team that's actually enjoyable.In particular, I'm finding out more and more that John Cena can really act; frankly, everyone involved is doing a better job at generating chemistry here than in the 2016 film. These are some of Hollywood's biggest, fanciest names, yet they all seem at home in Gunn's B-movie call-back - some of the gore in this one, speaking of which, is worthy of his retro sci-fi piece Slither from 2006 (possibly also living up to his Super, which I'm yet to see).The film has a surprisingly grounded visual style that makes the fantastical elements seem more real, and thus more imposing - this is helped by the fact that everything else looks practical, hand-made, and sometimes cheap, especially the willfully shabby costumes of some of DC Comics' most embarrassing D-listers. But the parts that need to look expensive certainly do so, and the hand-held, often documentary-like camera work aids the immersion. There's the usual Hollywood action (plus the aforementioned, unbridled gore), yet we never lose sight of the characters or who's doing what. This is, in spite of its tiring climax, quite the refreshment.Last but not least, the dipsh-t fanboys aren't as annoying as they were back when critics panned the ""original"" SS and they all started bawling over the fact that people don't like it when films are sliced into tiny pieces that are thrown together at random with an equally random soundtrack, insipid lines, various edge-lord visuals, and such noobish editing flaws as black text on black backgrounds. You know, those things only Marvel shills hate?Wait, what was I talking about? Oh right, The Suicide Squad. It's fun, guys. Go see it.",The Suicide Squad
176,ivanmessimilos,Ok but not great movie,6,28 August 2021,"James Gunn was given complete autonomy over this project and decided to have fun to the end. He introduced a number of characters who, at least to me, were largely unknown. I got a little lost there because it wasn't clear to me why the film has 20+ characters, but later everything still makes sense.I don't know if it's up to me, to the numerous extremely positive reviews for which I had slightly higher expectations, but I'm not thrilled with the end product. I got the impression that the film is quite popular because of the many bloody and violent sequences the film is full of. Literally from the first to the last scene, the film records numerous victims, liters of blood and internal organs that are everywhere. In addition, the film is full of humor that often seemed forced. So that combination of blood and humor seems to be popular in the world so then logically the film is also very popular. For me personally, not everything went well, I didn't laugh many times.I would draw a parallel with two similar films that are remarkable to me: Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool. GotG is a film with several main characters who go on a difficult mission and is full of humor. Deadpool is a movie with one main character who constantly talks nonsense and is full of blood. Both films work with their formula unlike this film.Also the film was supposed to have a simpler plot. A team of strange people with powers gather, go on a suicide mission where all sorts of things start happening. Any exit from the main plot or addition was unnecessary for the story and contributed nothing to the quality of the film. The villains aren't top notch either, easily forgettable, and the main villain was a little too grotesque to me.In the end it turns out that I was too negative in this review because the film was not catastrophic for me, but I tried to understand the many positive reviews and enthusiasm for this film, I failed. This was an ok movie for me, nothing special, I would put it in the category of popcorn movies - you watch it to have fun for two hours, and you turn off your brain.",The Suicide Squad

Concise and clear stakes laid out, hilarious character moments, and some shocking bits all coalesced into my grinning and laughing for minutes at a time. The film couldn't maintain this momentum, however, with some character building that teetered on the edge of boring at times.The stand out performance that must be mentioned is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. It was so good that I almost want to go see the commericial failures that were Birds of Prey and the original Suicide Squad just to have more of her.

I think it does get better towards the final act, but just right off the bat there was nothing likable about the film. I didnt find it funny. Most of the ""jokes"" are just making the characters total idiots. Even Waller who is supposed to be the big brains of the operation is treated like an idiot. Some people may love the gore, and thats fine. Im no stranger to gory films either...but I cant say that even that is done well. It's relies way too much on CGI. They have this random B plot with Harley Quinn during the middle portion of the film that absolutely goes nowhere and has no real purpose except to pad the runtime. And barely any of the characters are likable/fun. I only really cared for Ratcatcher 2, Polka Dot Man and King Shark. Even Harley, who I liked in the first one was kind of grating on my nerves in this movie.The movie does have some really cool stylized shots and cinematography as well as a good soundtrack, I'll give it that.

A fantastic comic book movie based on the super villain team of the same name with some interesting characters and an interesting direction from James Gunn.This movie is a blast and one of my favourites from DC.The story in this is simple but effective.It tells the story of Taskforce X being sent on a mission to Corto Maltese to destroy a Nazi-Era laboratory which holds a secret experiment called Project Starfish.The characters are great in this one and they all work really well together.Especially Peacemaker, Bloodsport and Harley Quinn who were the highlights of the film for me.I also really like the new interesting take on Polka-dot Man with him being experimented on with a Virus that gave him his powers its was an interesting adaptation which worked really well for the movie.The action was awesome and every action scene kept you on the edge of your seat.My favourite action scene was definitely the Harley Quinn escaping scene that had some great action and I loved seeing what everything looked like in Harleys mind with the blood being flowers it was a great direction.I also really liked the Bloodsport and Peacemaker action scene with them both showing off to each other that was hilarious.The effects were great and i loved the design of Starro and seeing him in a comic movie was incredible.Also the effects on King Shark were great aswell.My only issues with the movie is I'm not a fan of them copying story elements from the previous movie.For example Bloodsports motivations is the exact same as Deadshots in the first movie.However it is handled better in this one just not a fan of copying story elements.However apart from that this movie is fantastic and one of my favourites in the DCEU.This is also the best performance by Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn she plays the role brilliantly in this movie and she feels more like Harley Quinn.Verdict 9.5/10 a fantastic movie and one of the best from DC great action, characters and a great story makes this movie a blast.Some minor issues with some story elements copied from the first one but it's handled better in this.And it's the best performance from Margot Robbie.",The Suicide Squad

This is one of those movies you need to see on the big screen to get the most out of it, and a couple of friends as well.With Idris Elba leading a group of different characters with various powers and personality traits, the film keeps things interesting and fresh with many gags and dialogue sequences to bounce off on. Margot Robbie returns as Harley Quinn and she gets a good balance here of not being too annoying, and the villain has a good payoff by the end. No scene is wasted and the film strikes a perfect tone of goofy and seriousness.Not only that, it looks and sounds very good as well. The movie never drags, everything is explained well and the action sequences are gory fun and well executed. Soundtrack is used excellently and the special effects are great.

And killing off the group of 'heroes' early on, right after they were assembled, well, seemed a bit too similar to what happens in Deadpool 2.Speaking of Deadpool, they really tried hard to make this a swear fest, but it comes across as pretty juvenile. The gore was good, but all of this could not make up for the fact that the dialogue was weak (humor? I didn't laugh), and the plot made no sense. If their mission was to destroy the evidence, why didn't they just send a drone or fire a cruise missile covertly and blow up the installation. It made no sense, whatsoever.The worst part about this movie was there was no charismatic lead. Yes Harley Quinn took up a lot of screen time, but she was NOT the lead. She was still a side character to the main group of Suicide Squad characters led by Idris Elba. Idris is a wonderful actor, but a lead in a dark comedy, he does not carry it at all. Will Smith, maybe could have pulled it off if he had returned, Idris is just too much like Jason Momoa, delivers the line, looks pretty, but doesn't have much range.So if you're looking for a poor man's Guardian Of The Galaxy meets Deadpool ,then this is your film.

193,sirwillisiv,Pure unapologetic fun...,9,11 August 2021,"Yep, I can vouch: The Suicide Squad is great. Wickedly stylish, delightfully gory and uproariously funny. Has solid writing for superhero standards. It's consistent in tone and balances the bloodshed and humor with expertise. The characters are what I call ""likably awful."" They're sick, twisted, violent people with the lowest possible standards but their banter is so charmingly mean-spirited and offbeat that it's just tantalizing. They're so unpredictable and I couldn't help but grin and laugh at their coarse actions and foulmouthed interplay.I really enjoyed the use of bizarre DC characters like King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, and Ratcatcher. James Gunn has a sleek and smart eye for the flippant and disenfranchised. Weirder characters warrant more interest and opportunities for unique visuals. The Suicide Squad offers plenty of pleasurably oddball moments that could rival Marvel's eccentric side. Some of them had me saying to myself ""well, that happened"" or ""huh, never seen that before."" I'd say my only setback is the film has its fair share of scenes that drag on perhaps a tad too long but it's such an unapologetic romp I can easily forgive that. I had a ball with The Suicide Squad. Pure fun.",The Suicide Squad

I loved the action and the humour and energy of the first film and hoped for the same with the second, and it did not disappoint.Margo Robbie was in fine form as Harley Quinn, Viola Davis was brilliant as Amanda Waller but the real joy was Idris Elba as Bloodsport. The Suicide Squad is a fun if violent ride filled with humour and great music and special effects. I feel that this film is a little more focused then the first one and the story and action is a little tighter. All the actors were a joy to watch, the music was perfect and having Starro The Conqueror was a touch of brillance. One tiny little gripe, I would have loved top have had. Captain Boomerang played by Jai Courtney.in it a little longer. I loved him in the first movie. Also I would have liked a little more Michael Rooker. It seemed like a waste to have these awesome actors offed in the first fifteen minutes of the film, but it's a small gripe and the rest of the cast, including Sylvester Stallone as King Shark more than makes up for it.The Suicide Squad in definitely one of DC's better movies and any fan of comics and action films will enjoy this immensely.",The Suicide Squad

198,papanloveu,DIFFERENT SUPERHERO MOVIE WITH AN UNSETTLING PLOT.,6,25 September 2021,"The movie starts with no kind of character building and just some straight ways of exposition. Slowly each scene by scene the main characters grows on the screen.Many characters we love to see more excitely on the screen gets killed off soon as they are introduced without any obvious purpose.Comedic aspects of the film totally failed. The picture moves along with dark humour and later does drag a little at parts. There are few heart touching moments and emotions which were unnecessary. The movie is filled with funny one liner dialogues which never takes too seriously. We can see more blood and violence at the fight scenes throughout the movie. The plot itself was not too genric and fell flat at most times. And also considering the subplot of Luna was both unwanted and bizzare. The use of music in film was impressive and quite astonish at moments.This movie backgrounds as a new superhero unsettling genre rather than a suicide squad film. Comparing to the first part,this film is better in CGI and Action sequences. Other than it is nothing prominent than some unfocused illogical concepts. This film is suggested for those who love the work of James Gunn's typical superhero movies.6/10.",The Suicide Squad

202,fredschaefer-406-623204,Good gory fun thanks to James Gunn.,9,8 August 2021,"What a difference five years makes, as we finally have THE SUICIDE SQUAD we wanted back in 2016, it just took that long for director James Gunn to give it to us. This new film, which works as both a sequel and a reboot, leans way in to get a hard R rating with its violence, gore, and rough language, is a lot rougher than Gunn's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, though it is similar in that both films are about comic book C and D list characters coming together to form a rag tag team that takes on a desperate mission. In the process, these losers find a way to become heroes. But Gunn isn't making a DC version of his MCU success, as many of THE SUICIDE SQUAD's protagonists are real villains with nary a heart of gold among them. The plot is the same as the previous film, and the comic, first written by Jon Ostrander (who has a cameo in the film) in 1987: a group of incarcerated super villains are recruited by the formidable Amanda Waller for black op missions for the United States government with the promise of parole or a reduced sentence if they survive said mission, which is often unlikely, hence the title. These ""assets"" have an explosive device implanted in their necks to ensure their cooperation in the field. In this film, which jumps right into its plot, the mission is to go to Corto Maltese, a politically unstable South American island, and destroy a government project there before its ""top secret"" falls into the wrong hands. I love a good rag tag group on a desperate mission movie, and this one works the formula to the maximum.One of the big reasons why this reboot works so well is the casting of charismatic and quirky actors in the main and supporting roles, starting off with John Cena and Idris Elba as The Peacemaker and Bloodsport respectively. Both are a pair of mercenary killers with very different ways of going about their business, you know right from the start that these two are on a collision course despite being on the same team. Some of Gunn's regulars, such as Michael Rooker, Nathan Fillion, Sean Gunn, among others, join the cast, while newcomers Pete Davidson, Peter Capaldi, Daniela Melchoir, Mayling Ng, Flula Borg, and David Dastmalchian, fill out other roles. Coming back from the first film are Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney as Rick Flagg and Captain Boomerang; but best of all Viola Davis, who was born to play Amanda Waller, and Margot Robbie, who will forever be Harley Quinn, return. Robbie's Quinn was the best thing in the first film, as well as the not so great, BIRDS OF PREY, and here she is finally given a script worthy of her character. And they couldn't have found anyone better than Sylvester Stallone to voice King Shark. Two standouts are Melchoir, as Ratcatcher 2 (Taika Waititi has a cameo as her father, Ratcatcher 1), one of the least likely heroes, and Dastmalchain, a veteran of a number DC Comic projects on TV and the big screen, manages to make Polka-Dot Man, a minor Batman villain, into to something memorable. Nobody should get too attached to any character, because this film lives up to its title, and there is a very high body count, including some heroes and villains who seemed destined to make it out alive.The main reason why this film works is James Gunn, who not only directed, but wrote the screenplay, and his ability to ""get"" comic book storytelling. Gunn possesses an uncanny talent for taking characters and concepts that only work on the comic book page and make them work onscreen. A creature like Starro the Conqueror, a giant alien who resembles a walking starfish, is right out of a bad '50s monster film, yet for the purposes of THE SUICIDE SQUAD, Gunn makes him a terrifying antagonist, and part of an awesome finale where the surviving members of the squad must somehow stop his rampage. A huge walking shark could be ludicrous in a live action movie, but as with Rocket Raccoon, Gunn makes a CGI creation live and breathe, and be integral to the story's success. Gunn succeeds where other very talented directors who have jumped into the super hero genre have failed. While the film doesn't have an overtly political angle (unlike almost every other movie that comes out now), it seems to have a message that fits the pandemic era: in the face of an imminent threat, authority will look after its own interests before those of citizens.Of course there is an end credits scene, which points the way to future endeavors in the DCEU, which I do hope will lead to other hard R superhero films. It's doubtful that Disney owned Marvel will embrace such projects, but there is nothing stopping Warner Brothers, which owns the DC Comic universe, from going down this road again. And even if not, I'd like to see more comic book films centered on bad guys from both of the Big Two; maybe Marvel ought to rethink green lighting that Sinister Six film project Sony was going to produce.",The Suicide Squad

204,Slarkshark,Rare Example of Sequel Superiority,9,11 August 2021,"It's not often that a sequel is superior to its predecessor. This will become one of those rare examples as it's without a doubt better than 'Suicide Squad'. It has clear direction unlike the first one, which just seemed all over the place and visually dark. This was vibrant and loads of fun. One of the biggest differences is of course the rating. With this type of movie it's just better being rated R. The over the top gore and expletive language just seems more suiting.Everyone from Margot Robbie to John Cena seemed to have upped their game in the acting department. Cena and King Shark were hilarious. And the movie was filled with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' esque humor as one would expect from James Gunn. Daniela Melchior is a welcomed new comer to Hollywood, and provided just the right amount of emotion to the ludicrous shenanigans from all the other characters.With many hits and misses from the DC extended universe, this was definitely a hit. It's a bit of a mixed bag and a gamble when going to watch a DC movie, but 'The Suicide Squad' pays off.",The Suicide Squad

210,hunter-friesen,"A disappointment, but better than the 2016 version",6,7 September 2021,"Jumping ship from Marvel to DC, James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" is a much more cohesive enjoyable film compared to David Ayer's 2016 version. There's a lot to respect here as Warner Brothers seem to slowly be learning their lesson and letting filmmakers do what they were hired to do. Apart from just adding the ""the"" in the title, Gunn takes a celebratory stance towards the craziness of this concept where supervillains are tasked with performing missions for the U. S. government in return for not having their heads blown off.Gunn still shoots a low percentage with the jokes, many of which are retreaded several times to lesser effect. And the whole thing dissolves into a CGI mess in the third act. Still, this DC property was much more memorable than what Marvel was able to offer.",The Suicide Squad
211,mirwais-orbit,"Unauthorized GOTG Vol. 3, sort of...",5,13 September 2021,"Previous movie was kind of watchable because Margot Robbie has this incredible powerful presence. She stole all the scenes and carried entire movie on her back, making all the others as supporting as they could be. If wasn't her, surely would be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. So it's kinda understandable why her character is in a so supporting role this time, clearly because Gunn wanted to give space to all other characters to shine. But that didn't work as well. The movie tries so hard to give a deserved attention to each one of them that they all lack of a good development, and great potentials are wasted, in a way that they get in and out of scenes so randomly as Louis Lane in Batman v Superman.King Shark is Gunn's attempt to bring once again a CGI character of few words to be used as a comic relief the same way he did with Groot in Guardians Of The Galaxy. The result is that Shark's dumbness is weird and annoying and he's only there to fill gaps between scenes. In the beginning is told he was crucial to the mission, but turns out to be the most useless of them serving basically to make audience feels just entertained by his clumsy personality instead of a true importance he should have to the story.They didn't bring Deadshot back this time, but Bloodsport works alike. His background family drama issues with his daughter is also very similar. More of the same stuff, but fortunately story doesn't spend so much time on it more than a couple of scenes. But on the other hand there's Ratcatcher 2 to squeeze some unnecessary drops of drama from the plot working as this lovely sweet tie that bonds everyone together because they are crazy and suicidal but they will all live happily ever after.The biggest problem for me this time is pretty much the same of previous movie, the need to turn villains into likable trusty heroes, giving plenty of moments to make audience feel empathy by their endless moments of redemption, making their villainess be completely forgotten even when they are killing innocent people, which isn't exactly what some would expect in a R rated movie considering their nature. In other words, it's a teen movie filled with free violence and gore, far from being a dirty action packed comedy flick as interesting, clever and entertaining as Deadpool is, a character that is likable even though having no morality at all.I see the movie as a completely fan service so Warner and DC can desperately avoid the departing of what's left of their cinematic fanbase, which is ok, and that's why the movie's being so overated. But for those ones who know only the few necessary of the comics, like me, and are interested to have a great time and feel intrigued by their story, it isn't exactly what it offers. It's not memorable, nor entertaining. It was really hard to keep on its 120 minutes, not fun at all also because all the jokes felt flat. I could see the jokes were there and they could be really funny, but somehow they were very bad timed and didn't work most of the times. And the dialogs were painful when there were some. Mainly because there are no chemistry between characters or actors. Of course they have different personalities and they don't have any motivational intent to work as a team facing the fact that all of them are doing the work because otherwise their choices are limited to a life in jail or death sentence if Amanda Waller feels like it. But either way, writers should have created a better reason that could make them realize at some point that their efforts on working together - even at first hating each other's presence - could turn into something they could stand to rely on.I really enjoyed both volumes of GOTG and Gunn is a very talented director, but his attenpt to reprise the same formula, now using DC characters, have not worked for me as I expected.",The Suicide Squad

brother???The thinker is the stupidest man in the world, when the original character is totally the opposite, in the comics he's so smart that he can predict every
move and future event, here he just had screws in his head as an ornament, no powers or skills at all.Harley quinn is basically useless, it's there for nothing, just like
in the first one, she's too weak and has no powers so I don't know why she's still in movies, comics and cartoons,
the most deplorable and useless character ever created.King shark should have been called KING SHORT, cause it was like a dwarf, and weak, when in the comics, it is strong, tall, giant, powerful.And the rest of the characters were like meh, many explosions, some dumb fights, dumb script.

213,arabnikita,King Shark MVP,8,7 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad (2021)Are you still having horrible flashbacks about the horrendous 2016 Suicide Squad? Well, it's time to wave them goodbye because James Gunn is going to blow them away with this cocktail of dysfunctional individuals. This is what Suicide Squad was always meant to be about: a bunch of psychotic villains shooting, slashing and bashing their way through countless enemies while trying to stay alive. They are a sick bunch that definitely enjoys violence as many have legitimate issues and yet, many are portrayed in a way that made me genuinely feel sad for them.The film gets off to a fast, bloody and unforgiving start as the prologue aims to show that this is no PG 13 kindergarten. Asides from Harley Quinn, who gets an excellent rebranding, every other character is brand new and nearly all are well written brining something unique to the table. What's more, their team ""chemistry"" is portayed very well. While I expected Idris Elba and John Cena to be entertaining, I certainly didn't expect to connect with Ratcatcher who added genuine humanity to this dysfunctional gang.However, the greatest standout for me was King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. Only James Gunn can make you genuinely care for a walking shark, much like he did with a walking tree in Guardians. The movie was highly unconventional and I barely felt like I was watching a formulaic story. The action was fun and a lot of the humor was natural and hit the spot. Sadly, there were moments where the film could have used some juice to energize the dullness and the narrative needed a few tweaks. Besides that, I was thoroughly entertained by this wild ride and I will be waiting for the sequel if Gunn were to direct it.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",The Suicide Squad

2) I liked that the film didn't feel the need to have lots of pointless exposition at the start; it's pretty much straight into the action
3) The banter and relationships between the Squad really worked for me; you really felt like they were a team learning to work together
4) The action scenes were very well done and very fun to watch.NEGATIVES:1) The tone often felt confused to me by going from serious to funny very abruptly
2) The constant pop songs became excessive and a bit irritating for me, it reminded me of the first film in that sense and not in a good way

219,royhectorkabanlit,"Could've been great, but still a very entertaining one",8,13 August 2021,"A pretty good Movie overall, but I do have some reservations about it. First off, James Gunn proved that just like the Russo Brothers, he truly is a Master of handling an Ensemble Cast.He is a gifted Storyteller, and his Characterizations and Dialogues are just truly amazing, it is what made this Movie work.He has fine attention to detail, with superb little things like the Ratcatcher's cute Pet Rat, Bloodsport's fear of Rats, or Ratcatcher wondering what an Overhead Projector is ...I also liked what he did with Harley Quinn, all that long build up at romance, only for her to show how really sick in the Head she is later. Also great Escape Scene, it showed us how much of a Kick As* Character she is also.In a way I am sort of glad that Marvel fired Gunn so he can work on another Ensemble Cast (and of course they hired him back).My Beef about the Movie though is that Gunn himself might have ended up too close to the Characters he created that he was hesitant to kill them off.This is supposed to be a ""Suicide Squad"", and yet only one Member of the Core Team was killed off. One Character I thought died, only to be revealed as still alive in the End Credits.Another Character was killed off, but he wasn't really a Member of the Core Team, he just sort of joined the later.The fact that Gunn killed off so many of the other Team at the start of the Movie doesn't mean he can get away with killing off most of the Core Team later.And that is why I thought this is just a good Film, and not a Great One. Still highly recommended, very entertaining.",The Suicide Squad
220,MovieBuff11732,Surpassed Majority Of The Superhero Films Released In The Last Decade,9,8 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is a 2021 superhero film from James Gunn. He has been behind The Guardians Of The Galaxy and not much else. The only similarity this film had with Guardians Of The Galaxy was the verity of the song choice. Otherwise, this film was completely different.The Suicide Squad is about a problem developing on the Corto Maltese. The new government is incredibly secretive. The only thing to get out is this certain project called ""Starfish."" The Suicide Squad is then sent to solve the problem lead by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) and followed by Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Peacemaker (John Cena), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchain), and many more. Also lead by from behind the scene by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis).I was pretty excited for this film. Right when it start, I had one of those this is really happening moments. I ever read many of the original Suicide Squad comics and watched the Dirty Dozen because James Gunn said it would be sort of like that. It ended feeling like both of those things. The Suicide Squad had the same feeling as The Dirty Dozen because you had no clue who was going to die and it had somewhat of a familiar setting, It felt like the comics because of how wacky some of the villains were. It also had Starro appear in the end which it is hard to not giggle a bit when he is trying to be menacing. This film just nailed the feel. Halfway through the movie, I was trying to figure out who would live and who would die but I really couldn't. I just came to the conclusion, maybe they all will. It is just a really unpredictable movie. The story also made you feel for many parts of the characters. They did have some randomly plugged backstories for some of the characters which one of them felt plugged but the rest felt natural and gave some much needed background to some characters. When it came to the end of the film, that really helped make the characters not feel as expendable as they have felt early on. James Gunn also used some of the characters from the first that were actually good characters. He also used that as background for some character too. Overall, the characters were fantastic.The action was some of the best I have seen in a superhero film in while. Marvel has just been making all of their action look like cartoon or some hand to hand combat that gets boring after a while. This film did all kinds of stuff, gun action, fist combat, and just had some fun scenes of just tearing through many villains. The action ended up feeling fun and stylized unlike some movie series like Fast And The Furious and Marvel films. Sometimes they used CGI blood which I have never been a fan off and sometimes it does end of looking pretty bad. The action is incredibly amazing though.The acting obviously had to be good so the characters would also feel attachable which they ended up feeling so that means the acting was also accomplished. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was obviously good as it has been in the last few movies. Some fo Jai Courtney and Joel Kinnaman. John Cena has started to become a way better actor since Playing With Fire. Idris Elba as Bloodsport was also a fantastic choice. He has honestly never been bad in a movie. Everybody else also did a pretty good job.The Suicide Squad is the movie I was looking. It was incredibly fun and also had some really fantastic characters even if one of their backstories felt plugged. I would recommend this film to anybody who has fun with action movies and wants to have a good time.",The Suicide Squad

Of course, casting was good too. The storyline somehow was the same as the first one (just the squad having a battle with a new villian). However, this time the movie was way more intense and unexpectedly very bloody (especially, some kills were ""Mortal Kombat"" inspired). In my opinion, one of the top scenes of the movie was ""Harley's escape scene from the bad guys"", it was EPIC. The plot twist was nice. Anyway, I don't think that movie is better than the original, because both movies are awesome. Also, even though the movie's duration was 2 hours and 10 minutes, I didn't get bored at all, because it was extremely intense, that it didn't let you to rest at all.",The Suicide Squad
222,Spartan_1_1_7,"Well, there is no competition on which version is the better one. James Gunn certainly delivered.",8,10 August 2021,"Well, there is no competition about which version is the better one. Sure, the execs at WB are still to blame for a lot of what happened with David Ayer's version as well as the DCEU, in general. Their incessant pestering and moronic need for control ruined a lot. This time, James Gunn got to do what he wanted and the result is a solid comic-book flick.Using his experience from Guardians of the Galaxy while also having to ""redo"" this property, Gunn doesn't waste much time and jumps into the Squad and keeps it focused on them. Tight writing combined with charismatic and, in general, great performances from virtually everyone gives nuggets of development, small or large, throughout the runtime. You get attached to the characters rather quickly and small moments here and there build upon it in a smooth flow. I can't name one character from the Squad that I didn't like and it was genuinely tense when things got hairy between them.Then you have the violence and gore in well-directed colourful action sequences with top-notch CGI for the most part (King Shark looked awesome), which was glorious and just FUN to watch. I'm so glad this was Rated-R and Gunn used that to its full effect. It also aided in the humour that worked well with its dark undertones for the most part. Sometimes it did kinda fell flat on its face but those occurrences were spread out. The soundtrack was pretty good overall with some tracks elevating the scenes/moments superbly.The plot itself, while most of it being standard affair, the end goal of it, though, was interesting. Although the final act is where I would say the movie faltered a bit with some stuff giving a feeling of being rushed, at the same time, having that Kauji up in this story was a great decision and made for one hell of a finale as well as having this mystery that kept you hooked early on.Having all these wacky characters and making you care for them is no easy task and it just goes to show how much a good writer and director matters. Hell, this is THE BEST Margot Robbie's Harley Quin has been in any of her appearances.Overall, it's the best comic book/superhero movie I've seen in a while and is one of the best from DCEU. And compared to what Marvel has been putting out recently, this easily stomps on all of it. I'd definitely recommend it regardless of if you liked the previous Suicide Squad or not or haven't even watched it. It's just a bloody good time, proper escapism. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10.P. S That Rat quote around the end hits so well, one of my favourite scenes from the movie.",The Suicide Squad

224,isaacochoterena,Something different,7,14 September 2021,"This movie is unlike any other superhero movie.It is different in terms of the violence it handles but I feel that it falls into many things previously seen. The beginning of this film is brutal but as the second act progresses it becomes a bit tedious and there is a lot of sentimentality that ends up overshadowing the violence. The special effects are good and the sound is good too, most of the performances are convincing. The ending feels very long, it is very strange and it is predictable, it did not provoke as much emotion as the beginning did, some jokes feel forced but there are also some well achieved.For me the second act is very long and I don't know very well what to say about the ending, but I think the beginning is good and it's worth watching it to vindicate the thought we had of these characters with the previous film.",The Suicide Squad

228,phoenixinvictus,What a way to kill a franchise,1,8 August 2021,If Suicide squad means to kill a franchise then this is aptly named. A giant starfish from out of space? The villain of this movie is a starfish with an eyeball? Give me a moment to sigh and roll my eyes. Doesn't DC have any good writers or stories? When I saw Peter Capaldi I thought I was watching a two hour episode of Dr. Who... This is so confusing because I don't know if this is a reboot or a remake. All the senseless killing and deaths try to come out as funny but it's just sad and pathetic. This movie is even worse than the first movie... Maybe the third reboot will be the one because people are going to want to forget this.,The Suicide Squad
229,hoernkeem,"The Suicide Squad (2021, James Gunn) While better than Ayers' film this is still a mess with a misguided premise but not without its charm",6,18 August 2021,"Next up for DC is another Suicide Squad film. While this is not really marketed as a sequel, it does essentially function as such as it relies on the first one to already have established the theory behind these expendable teams as well as how Amanda Waller, the chief good/bad guy, lords their freedom and their very lives over them. This outing returns four of the previous film's cast including Viola Davis as Waller, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. As if DC wasn't continually trying to be Marvel they actually reached out and nabbed one of the MCU's more famous directors; James Gunn who directed both 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movies. He was fired by Marvel due to some questionable tweets that surfaced but after the tumult died down was hired not only to do 'The Suicide Squad' but also rehired by Marvel and reattached to 'Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3'. To separate this film from the previous one they strategically installed the word 'the' at the front so to recap the 2016 film is 'Suicide Squad' and this 2021 not sequel sequel is 'The Suicide Squad'. Nobody will get that confused. This is another of the Warner Bros. 2021 lineup of films that was released simultaneously in theaters and on HBOmax.'The Suicide Squad' takes on a much different vibe than the 2016 one although it is kind of hard to pinpoint. It is certainly less dark and ominous in tone. This takes a more outlandish, less serious approach installing James Gunn's propensity to utilize potty humor wherever he can. It is like the film realizes how ridiculous the premise is and leans into rather than taking itself too seriously. Waller is back at it with another crew of B list villainous antiheroes culled from Belle Reve prison. They are tasked, quite simply, with infiltrating a hostile base on foreign soil and destroying all evidence of a project called Starfish. It was nice to see that this film truly embraced the Suicide Squad moniker and pretty much decimated the team introduced in the first sequence right away. We pivot to another team that was also dispatched and this becomes the primary team we follow for the balance of the film, nominally led by Idris Elba's Bloodsport who is a thinly veiled replacement for Will Smith's Deadshot from the the last movie. Elba actually works better in this role as Smith is just not believable as a bad guy. The team realizes Flag and Quinn, from the previous team, are still alive and set to saving them one at a time. This supplies some fun, stylized, bloody action sequences. They find out Starfish is a literal Starfish; a giant alien mind control beastie ready to unleash havoc if released from its bonds. It was, of course, ultimately the Americans who brought the creature here trying to adapt it into a weapon of war and are now are just trying to cover it up. Peacemaker, played with extreme mean mugging, by extremely jacked John Cena ends up turning on the team in order to destroy the evidence when the team decides they are going to expose it. After he is exposed he kills Flag in about the only somewhat meaningful death in the movie, but Peacemaker is ultimately shot by Bloodsport. Then the team has knock down drag out with Starro the alien starfish narrowly managing to save the day, the world and all that.This certainly has James Gunn's signature style all over it from the way the characters walked through a scene to musical choices. Gunn was over the top here with his stylistic choices, but it could be argued that style works well for this specific movie and band of miscreants. It is very vivid with a vibrant color palette very in keeping with the style we have seen in the 'Guardians' movies. As far as characters most think of Harley as the marquee character being one of the few holdovers from the first 'Suicide Squad' as well as being featured in her own movie, but while she is prominently featured this film belongs more to some of the newcomers. Bloodsport was the clear alpha and leader of the team and he did well. I greatly enjoyed Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man, and even Sylvester Stallone voicing the CGI King Shark. His role was a bit jarring having watched King Shark on the Harley Quinn cartoon and there he is not the monosyllabic, Groot style entity that he is here. If you didn't know that though this would seem like a completely appropriate direction for the character. Also let us give a shout out to some great cameos as Taika Waititi shows up as Ratcatcher's father and Michael Rooker as Savant. Gunn is very loyal and loves giving his people, including his brother, work even if the roles are tiny. It is funny that those are two other MCU talents showing up in a DC project. I always love seeing Nathan Fillion show up even if he is almost unrecognizable and dies in the first minute. Funnily the worst character is the only character we know will continue on from this movie as John Cena's awful Peacemaker has an HBOmax spinoff series. I did not like this character or the portrayal by Cena, but perhaps that was intentional as not all these characters are designed to be loveable.Filling a team full of antiheroes and building a film around them is a tough line to walk. Most of antiheroes wind up just turning into hero heroes, as it is hard to write someone who is consistently bad yet has redeemable or inspiring characteristics. Most recently the best example is probably Loki from the MCU until his most recent show where he basically turned hero. Here we didn't delve any of these character's backstories, but some of them I have no idea why they were even in prison. Again this concept seems to flounder in theory to practice. These are supposed to be BAD guys thrown into a hole with the door locked and the key thrown away. Polka Dot seems weird and perhaps crazy but not bad. Ratcatcher 2 is downright benevolent. Bloodsport seems gruff, but not really bad. King Shark is childlike. Funnily the only one who really seemed bad was Peacemaker which as Flag exclaimed with his dying breath was such a joke as he was much more of a warmonger. I think they even realized that was not necessarily a good sell which was why we didn't get much preamble and instead it was more like look at this ragtag team. Let's watch them go on a mission and pay no attention to how they got here.This movie is a bit bizarre in my mind. While I was watching it I was thinking, I don't like this for this and that reason. Now as it has had a chance to marinate and I am going back and writing this review I find myself thinking of it a bit more fondly. I wouldn't say that my mind is completely flipped, but I can see how this is entertaining and enjoyable for people, but I still think it suffers from a lot. DC's decision to plow forward without an interconnected universe makes these movies more disposable. The over the top James Gunn style is a bit much, but what is really too much is his love of vulgar, potty humor which he adores, but will turn off many who don't have the mentality of an adolescent boy. Overall though this film has mellowed in my mind a bit, and I think it has its moments and some enjoyable characters and some genuinely funny moments so you can definitely sit down and have an enjoyable time watching this despite some flaws.Eric's Grade: C+",The Suicide Squad

232,cadillac20,Hard To Think Of Anything Wrong Here,10,4 August 2021,"For everything the first Suicide Squad movie was, this new one is seemingly the total opposite. Gunn works the same magic he worked with Guardians here to make the major characters something special and unique. He let's all of his huge cast shine, with some making only a short appearance, while others we follow for the duration. He makes the entire cast work (even John Cena) with a great script, gory, R-rated violence, and even a few emotional moments that actually make us care for some of the characters. Polka Dot Man, in particular, gets a crazy, satisfyingly emotional story that turns him from a joke of a DC character to one of the films best standouts. James Gunn has managed to deliver what I could easily call one of my favorite DCEU films. While I understand that not every DCEU film can be, or even should be, like this film, this is another in a line of few films within the DCEU that not only demonstrates what giving the filmmakers greater control over their film can do.

Being R-rated, the films violence and Gunn's pension for it shine through and with the astounding group of actors he has under his belt, he creates one of the best comic-book films for possibly the decade.

The editing, the pacing, the story.I rated it 6 because I do think it is a better movie (I have the first 1) and it is a good movie but I feel like some things dragged it down.Even though the pacing was better I would have still tightened it up ever so slightly.Some of the characters I had issues with mainly John Cena's. He was terrible and so annoying.

Some good performances here and there, but the actors aren't given a good script to work with. Some of the action is good, but it's mostly way too over the top. I think I get what they were going for and I get the whole weird obsucre character dynamic and sometimes it kind of works, but it never really did it for me.All in all, I was mildly entertained by this movie, but nothing more, so I wouldn't really recommend it.",The Suicide Squad
238,theredsky,The Suicide Squad Review,8,11 August 2021,"Absolutely shocked at how much I loved this film. There are some logical errors here and there and sometimes the story takes a back seat but I excuse it a little bit because the information and jokes they present more than make up for the slow pacing most of the time. All of the characters are interesting, even the ones that only show up for 5-10 minutes. They may not get a ton of development but their interactions with other characters is great and their dialogue is snappy and funny. The characters that get a lot of development and time on screen are all great. While there are definitely characters I like more than others, I really liked all of them with Harley Quinn, King Shark, Polka Dot Man, and Ratcatcher 2 being standouts. My only minor nitpick is that I do wish Peter Capaldi's Thinker was in the movie more but that's mostly because I adore Capaldi. All of the performances are great even from John Cena which I was kinda surprised about. The humor hits pretty hard a majority of the time. I found myself laughing out loud at points because the film knows how to use its comedy properly. The use of gore is incredibly over the top and I think it makes the film better. It helps it stand out from other hard R superhero gore fest films like Joker and Deadpool because of Gunn's directorial style. The soundtrack here works a million times better than the original film. It works with the scenes and adds to the comedy and tone. The visual effects are pretty great most of the time with some awkward moments here and there and the cinematography was surprisingly great. You could definitely tear apart this movies flaws in terms of story but it doesn't bother me that much. This film is too much fun to hate.

The story is not overly complicated or wordy, nor is there much to distract you. Although I feel like the writers intentionally put some dialogue in to cover for James Gunn's comments which landed him in trouble a while ago with Twitter! Margot Robbie was the standout star; her acting was incredible. There are some twists and turns which might leave some people angry. You also have to contend with the ""Pulp Fiction"" sort of jumpy, although not out of order, storytelling.

242,martinpersson97,The Suicide Squad is beyond redeemed,10,5 August 2021,"(This movie premiered a few days earlier in Sweden than the U. S.)I remember so well when the first trailer for the 2016 Suicide Squad droppes during summer of 2015. It looked incredible, a fun Tarantino esque dark comedy with lots of pop culture references. What we got in August 2016 was to put it simply, a disappointing mess. We thought it was all over after that, the Suicide Squad would never get the movie they deserved and just be another failed DC Cinematic Universe lineup.Enter James Gunn's complete reboot 5 years later and it not only redeems the franchise, but also turns out to be a masterpiece on its own.Like the original film should have been, it's sort of a Tarantino style of film - you have lots of scenes taking place out of order and delightful dark humour, filled with gore. The R rating is utilized fully and it has the feeling of a gritty war movie, like The Dirty Dozen or Save Private Ryan.Amidst all this action, humour and gore though beats a heart. As always, Gunn nails the character exploitation - the entire squad, both leftovers from the original squad and the new members, are complex, colourful and interesting characters that are very well acted. It throws in some interesting messages about the government being corrupt that feels very much like a Vietnam or Cold War story.Overall, this movie not only redeems the Suicide Squad logo, but stands out as one of the best comic book, dark comedies or war movies around!",The Suicide Squad
243,ssvfolder-1,Neither here nor there. Not a DC movie.,6,17 August 2021,"After watching the movie, it left me a bit confused. It wasn't usual DC movie, with dark themes and overpowered heroes. It was a Gunn movie with Marvel colors and DC characters.The movie desperately tries to replicate the success of the ""Guardans of the Galaxy"" with adult rating. But where the latter succeeded big time, the squad had failed in a majority of scenes without actual glue to keep it together.I guess Gunn was right about the superhero genre needed change, but I doubt he will be the one who can achieve this goal.Plot doesn't' make much sense in terms of the world filled up to the brim with overpowered superheroes, they choose the worst possible team to take out gigantic alien creature. Amanda Waller suppose to be a ruthless and brilliant character that chooses the right people for the job, but here she seems ridiculous evil character who is guided by her ego and not strategic calculations. I think that everyone who understands strategy and tactics a little bit would devise a better plan to complete the mission.She sent a decoy team (which suppose to be a shock value for this movie) and actual team who is so underqualified to take down the creature, that it's amazing how they managed to survive almost up until the end.The movie desexualized one of my favorite characters, Harley Quinn, which is simply rolling with a ""woke"" times, but Margot Robbie managed to pull this off. Though I liked her much more in the first movie.With all honesty I don't know how this movie got such a high ratings of 7.5 after a lot of reviews.",The Suicide Squad

247,yongkang-27205,A nice surprise,8,8 August 2021,"Truth be told, I came in with zero expectations. While the movie on the surface seemed a little like gory slapstick comedy with a touch of the ghostbusters remake, it was the little things that really brought it to a whole new level. Every character had a place in the film. And surprisingly, Harley Quinn wasn't my favourite this time! Instead, it is Nanaue the King Shark. His character takes that of a man baby of sorts which really just wrapped the whole thing up nicely leaving your heart warm and fuzzy inside. The polka dot man did not disappoint. While his mommy issues character arc is nothing we haven't seen before, it is a well executed one and it simply works.While I know I have not touched on the elephant in the room, well, starfish really, in this film, it felt more like a backdrop to know the characters better rather than the meat of the story really.And so I say, give it a try. It's a whole lot better than the original (which was great, but average great), and not your run of the mill action movie.

My attention span was like why is the fighting a Monster Starfish so boring?Your use of Polka dot man has some great ways to defeat the monster. However, what happened next made me feel very upset.I liked Iris Elba and his character, but I hated what happened to John Cena's character.I did enjoy Harley Quinn being great anti-hero warrior.

What's also incredible is how many of them die, it doesn't even hold back on highly famous actors. The plot, is pretty standard...nothing new but certainly not bad in any way. I think the movie could have done better with comedy, it had its moments but many one liners were poorly timed which left the brutal gore to be the funny parts. Now, the gore is very fun to watch...disgusting but absolutely brilliantly done. The characters also have development unlike the last suicide squad, this means the audience has a connection with the characters and feel emotion when something bad happens. I think the beginning of the movie is the highest point of the movie, it sets the tone of the movie so expertly well and is simply amazing, from the pacing to the over the top action. The ending, while still good, was actually too light hearted for a movie about death. The soundtrack was also decent...I was expecting more music from the director of Guardians, but he held back a bit. Anyway DC heading in the right direction by hiring a marvel director :)",The Suicide Squad
251,haydenluz,The Suicide Squad,8,7 August 2021,"Wow, this was a BLAST! James Gunn had his hand all over this film, stylizing it like Guardians of the Galaxy, DeadPool, and Birds of Prey, but also having it's own unique personality. Right off the bat, this was a gorgeous film to look at. There were so many great shots, with some top notch editing. I'm not too sure if this is a sequel, or a straight up remake to the 2016 version, but James Gunn improved every single aspect! This feels like The Suicide Squad, done right, utilizing it's R rating to the fullest! Knowingly, Gunn incorporates a lot of good risks and stakes in his films, he cranked that aspect up to eleven, giving this film some serious spine, while also involving some good tones throughout. The plot itself was rather simple, but the way the story was told, was what gave this film the separation from the bunch. With a runtime of over two hours, this film kept me engaged the whole time, moving at such a brisk pace, while the story evolves with every scene.With this being a beautifully made film, the characters is what took it to another level. Although these are legitimately bottom of the barrel heroes (being one of my few issues I have with the film), James Gunn brought every single one of them to life, giving them each, great character moments, and decent development across the board. They all had their own personalities, and likabilities to them. You can tell everyone on set was having a good time, because every piece of dialogue felt genuine. The script was super witty, and ridiculously funny, but the characters are what sold each scene - There was nobody who overshadowed anyone. The one take away from having a surplus of likable characters, its hard to balance everyone, and make them equally important and worth caring about.The action was another high point to this film, having so much gore and grit! With a film like this, you can expect somewhat of a body count, but James Gunn wanted to show off his gritty style, and everyone became an option for death. Gunn added so many casualties to this film, but keeping things at a certain level, so it didn't look like Night of the Living Dead. With a James Gunn film, you can expect a great soundtrack, and the soundtrack and score here was phenomenal! It enhanced every single sequence, really sucking you into what's going on. The few take aways I have with the action; granted it was probably one of the most entertaining part of the film, but there were parts that felt a little too over the top, while some over the CGI came over a tad hammy.Overall, The Suicide Squad is a smash hit!",The Suicide Squad

254,isaacsundaralingam,"Nothing too groundbreaking, but fun nonetheless",7,7 August 2021,"I think the best compliment I could give this movie is that it is exactly the way I thought it was going to be based on the clips and trailers. And given how frequently movies in the DCEU have not met my expectations, I thought this being adequately enjoyable was a massive plus point on its own.The casting in particular was perfectly done; especially that of John Cena, who I thought was the best of the group. The characters were very memorable and (unlike the previous SS movie) didn't totally suck. Another major plus point for this movie is its pacing; helped very much by the editing that stands out from the get go. And technically, it's a very colorful and visually pleasing experience.The story however, was kinda shallow, with no stakes as much as there should have been, and one where the ending is as cliché as it could have gotten. But it was stupid and fun, so who cares.Overall, I actually enjoyed it more than I did any previous DCEU movies that tried to be as funny and easy going as this was (The original Justice League, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam and WW84), so I'm glad I didn't feel disappointed by the end of it.",The Suicide Squad

Beforevwatching I was thinkinh that what kind of character this peacemaker is,it is more like a cartoon character of baby poems. But after watching movie my most favourite character was peacemaker,seriously Cena did a great job. But they just did a rubbish thing,killing peacemaker as a bad guy,it was really a shit. BTW other than all this acting was really great plus everything was perfect. Yeah one more thing I also hate the role of Quinn in this part.",The Suicide Squad

257,witra_as,Sickeningly entertaining DCEU (standalone) movie,8,7 August 2021,Sickeningly entertaining DCEU movie you should enjoy as a standalone. James Gunn delivered stylish action comedy with copious amounts of gore and zany horror. Some returning characters and new ones pack a punch in absurd mission to let audience having lots of fun.,The Suicide Squad
258,rohanumpleby,The Real Deal,9,2 August 2021,"This movie was really Funny. The Action Sequences were amazing. The music was not to bad. Better acting + script from the previous Suicide squad. If you want to watch this movie watch it on Tuner Radio where you can find movies on there after you've watched a bit like 10 minutes it will then say £1.99 which is annoying but cheaper then having to buy it on DVD and cinema, right that's enough of that. But this movie is one of the greatest movies of all time deservedly in the top 250. With a great cast that were at there A game. Watch it you will love It.",The Suicide Squad
259,jindann,Redefines what pure garbage is,1,21 August 2021,"Unfortunately this is no guardians of galaxy. The story is totally empty and idiotic where it bitterly fails trying to humor the audience by bringing the dumbest elements in movies ever possible, it's doubtful if a 5th grade child would find this funny. The first suicide squad was silly but watchable, birds of prey is terrible, but this sequel is so much worse, it redefines what pure garbage is. The suicide squad is just incredibly gross and stupid beyond imagination, with awful acting and directing I couldn't find a thing that's even worth commending. What's actually funny about this movie is the ridiculous amount of paid or moronic reviewers and critics overrating this trash at a 7-10.",The Suicide Squad
260,tresm87,"An improvement over the last scattered SS, but still an abundance of forced comedy/cgi, and a hollow story.",6,30 July 2021,"I honestly don't get why they keep trying to force suicide squad to work in film form when it just doesn't translate well to screen. Gunn tries his same GOTG style with the DCU and while visually and stylistically it's an objectively fun film to watch, the comedic overtones never land well. I may even prefer Ayer's brand of humor and even that wasn't even serviceable for the most part. The cast has such a weird dynamic and once again Margot Robbie is scathingly annoying but a bit more tolerable . Joel Kinnaman and Idris Elba are the standouts without question but they feel way too above the rest aside from Cena at times which can be unexpectedly brilliant in parts. The action is pretty well sequenced and delivered but as I said earlier the CGI can get down right bombarding in its delivery. The brutality is highly welcome however and satisfies unlike any DC film does in that aspect. And probably the most predictable yet ridiculous thing about the film is the audacious soundtrack choices. Sure you can play a novelty song during a specific scene to throw off tonal perspective but at this point it's just cliché. Overall I'd have to say it's a zany and enjoyable film but an overall scattered re-attempt to adapt a great comic.",The Suicide Squad
261,kaden_lewis,The Suicide Squad,10,12 August 2021,"I personally thought this movie great. When I left the theater I thought this movie deserves a 9/10, but now that I have had a couple days to reflect on the movie, I feel it deserves a 10/10. This movie had everything the scattered mess of a first movie didn't have. Although the plot for this movie was similar to the first movie's, this one just felt so much better. I think the reasoning might be because unlike the first movie where they walked around a city for an hour and a half, this movie felt more like an adventure. The story for this movie was also much better. The story of infiltrating a corrupt foreign country to prevent the world from a giant alien starfish named Starro was completely insane but exactly what we needed from this movie. We also got a surprising twist regarding Starro that made members of the team fight each other. When James Gunn is the head of any movie, you know it is going to be good. But this movie was beyond good. The action was amazing, the dialogue was hilarious, and I loved how he made some shots look like they were straight out of a comic book. Lastly, I loved how there were so many characters. Before the movie I thought this might be a problem due to it being too overcrowded, but they fixed that right away by killing off half the cast. That is the only negative of the movie, I wish we got to see more of the characters who got killed. Especially Captain Boomerang, we didn't get to see what he can do in the first movie, then they kill him right away in the second one, I definitely wanted to see more of him. However, out of all the characters that survived, I though they were all great and their actors played their roles to perfection. My two favorite characters were Ratcatcher 2 with Sebastian, and King Shark. King Shark was hilarious and Ratcatcher 2 was just a super likable character. I also thought Polka Dot Man was hilarious, and the constant bantering between Peacemaker and Bloodsport was amazingly funny. Really all the characters were great, those were just my favorite.This movie was a great action comedy that I would gladly see again. I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it, it was great. I would love to see these characters back in future DCEU projects.",The Suicide Squad

I thought Marvel really screwed up letting James Gunn go. Then, IT happened. The pace became stunted. The exposition was arriving about 30 minutes late. Scenes began to drag...and sag for the sake of CGI.It was at that point I remembered that Guardians of the Galaxy really wasn't very good. I could not believe the box office it scored.Perhaps The Suicide Squad 2 will be better. God knows Guardians 2 was.",The Suicide Squad

I hope that more superhero films take this approach.",The Suicide Squad
265,Filmdokter,James Gunn knows how to handle the material,7,5 August 2021,"2016's Suicide Squad was a disappointment. Director Ayer took the source material way too serious and delivered a film that was not funny and too dark. But DC realized the idea of Suicide Squad is good enough to give it another try. So they kept some characters (particularly Margot Robbie's delicious Harley Quin and Oscar winner Viola Davis) and hired the mad director that made Guardians of the Galaxy a smash hit: James Gunn. And boy he was the right man for the job! He hits the perfect tone for this film, in the story, its script, the costumes, casting, special effects, music...everything. This is a blockbuster that doesn't take itself serious, fittingly for The Suicide Squad. That is why at the end when we finally meet the bizar big antagonist we fully embrace the ridiculousness of the whole thing. It is a colorful, violently funny and at times absolutely crazy film and therefore a perfect night out in these dark times.",The Suicide Squad
266,NicolasTheWolf,This is The Suicide Squad!,9,4 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is what Suicide Squad should have been. A hilarious and brutal film with lots of deaths.

I'm so glad they did The Suicide Squad!",The Suicide Squad
267,Wililjam,Very James Gunn-y...,8,6 August 2021,"This film has a lot of the same humor as previous James Gunn films, such as Guardians of the Galaxy, but R-Rated.It wasn't bad, it was really entertaining throughout the whole film, but it did have some weird parts to it. Amanda Waller felt extremely different and out of character. I think the first Suicide Squad nailed her character, being calculating, composed, ruthless, and feared. In this film, she was sloppy, her coworkers seemed to find her annoying, and she was not composed at all. The fact that she let her coworkers live, after what they did to her, was another thing I didn't like.Rick Flag, Harley Quinn, Ratcatcher (2), and Peacemaker were the best characters, and the most fleshed out. Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn. Every single second of her on screen was a joy. I feel like James Gunn would make a great Harley Quinn-centric movie.All in all, it was really entertaining! 7.5/10.",The Suicide Squad
268,Endless_01,This is THE Suicide Squad,8,12 October 2021,"The previous film is considered one of the worst films of the genre, and I agree, but, luckily and thanks to the brilliant skill of a good director added to an excellent dose of extravagant performances, we have as a result a reboot worthy of the name. This is a movie that knows how to be artistic and entertaining at the same time. I'm not a fan of the superhero genre, and I usually watch them for the simple entertainment factor, but they often fail even at that. This movie is not that case.Entertaining and well designed. It offers constant non-stop action and at the same time keeps us encapsulated thanks to a good character development that manages to maintain a precise balance between being funny and serious. It's not a super dramatic end of the world movie, but it's an intense scenario that offers excellent variety and a story that, while not super original, is well executed.Probably the most unexpected thing for me was the choice of unexpected artistic shots. Like excellent psychedelic scenes that play with the visual effects or camera transitions that break the 4th wall for a moment. Add to that a good selection of indie-rock music and we have a colorful movie, full of personality and hilarious.Even if you're not a fan of the superhero genre, this movie treats it both satirically and seriously, combining just the right elements to deliver something entertaining. In that case it reminds me of Thor Ragnarok, but of course, with much, much, much more violence.",The Suicide Squad

271,BijeshNagesh,"Entertaining, Exciting, Electrifying",8,8 August 2021,"Splurge of blood and gore, sensationalism, Rambo-ism, kamikaze fighting, and probable character wastefulness... These were some of my initial impressions of what I assumed was going to be a dive into the genius of James Gunn's storytelling skills. I love Gunn's work, so I kept watching to see in which direction (pun un-intended) he took this film. Part of me also wanted to know if this sequel would turn out better than David Ayer's 2016 ""The Suicide Squad"".Gunn's skill with misdirection and patching together seemingly random sequences into a wholesome fabric of wonder and awe truly came to the fore with HBO Max ""The Suicide Squad"" 2021. What I (wrongly) assumed was an over-hyped and excessively reviewed, probably paid-for, set of promos and marketing gimmicks was turned on its head the longer I kept watching this film.It was cleverly directed and masterfully executed. The movie felt 'in the moment' and real, with so much to see and experience with each passing sequence. The concept of ""Project Starfish"" was at once ominous and intriguing - a nod to the original comic book element(s) that inspired it.Every character was aces, their performances just as amazing. VFX, music, costume, makeup, special effects, fights and stunts, screenplay, musical scoring... Nearly every category played their parts to perfection.Lynne Ashe as Polka-Dot Man's Mom gave a seriously under-rated performance. She made his (Polka-Dot Man's) character for him, if you ask me. That out of the way, my four favourites in ""The Suicide Squad"" 2021 are Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, Viola Davis's Amanda Waller, Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher2 (special shout-out to her father, played by Taika Waititi), and Sylvester Stallone's King Shark.But come on, let's be honest, that humongous Starfish (""Starro the Conqueror"") - and its mini mind-control minions - stole the day. And rats saved the world! Peter Capaldi's Thinker truly had some thoughtful points to make in this film. I enjoyed everything to do with these elements in HBO Max's ""The Suicide Squad"".The movie is pure entertainment. To read too much into it would be to court artistic disaster, because 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"" is essentially a mish-mash of thrills, frills, and chills that are all designed to make you sit back and feel entertained, and a tad uncomfortable. It was flamboyant and often over-the-top, but all of it in keeping with the theme and spirit of this IP.As anti-hero movies go, this one is a gold standard in the cold-cruel-calculated adaptation of some of DC comic books' greatest baddies. The so-called villains are unashamedly themselves, and that's what set this film apart from anything else like it. More than being your typical 'action movie', James Gunn reminds you time and again that each of these characters are being compelled - death upon disobedience - to carry out 'suicide missions', and that they're essentially criminals looking to reduce their sentences upon 'mission success'. By the end of the movie, Gunn even made a compelling case for their humanity.This is an extremely risky film. It is unlike the usual fare viewers are probably used to seeing when it comes to DC, or even Marvel for that matter. 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"" also contained a distinct vibe, pace, and story-structure. Not everyone will be drawn into this film, in fact some will leave confused (""what did I just see?"") after watching it. But that's the James Gunn allure right there. That the man was willing to take such a colossal risk and still deliver on several, if not all, counts is a testament to his progressive directorial thinking.The first half of the movie was great fun, and the latter portions were simply mind-blowing. If this particular IP wasn't inspired by the original comic books, it wouldn't be enjoying half the success it currently is. Entertaining, exciting, electrifying... I liked it, and most of you will too.",The Suicide Squad
272,ferreiranazli,Brilliant Fix-up,9,20 August 2021,"This is a brilliant fix-up of the fist Suicide Squad. James Gunn brought the comedy, murder and the action that we were expecting. The special effects, make-up and the costumes looks like taken from a comic book. Hope we see more of this on DC.",The Suicide Squad
273,emryse,The DCEU's Best Movie to Date,8,30 July 2021,"James Gunn has managed to finally give the DCEU a genuinely good film, the cast is all great, the cinematography different and the editing was really interesting. Gunn manages to take some lesser known DC villains and craft an entertaining story around them, similarly to what he did for Guardians back in 2014, talking of Guardians I feel it's important to compare the two films.I found Guardians much funnier and more emotional than The Suicide Squad and I think this is due to their being to many characters introduced in one movie. There are tons of villains and ""heroes"" being thrown around meaning there is less time to form a connection with any of the characters, I also think that while the music in Suicide Squad is good it's no match for the music in Guardians, lastly I think the CGI in Guardians was better, I don't know if there were time constraints or budgetary reasons but neither King Shark or Weasel looked as good as Rocket did in Guardians which was released 7 years ago.While all this may come off as negative The Suicide Squad was still great, my last criticism though would be the villain, without giving any spoilers the villains in this film are like the characters, numerous and ever changing and similar again to Guardians and Ronan we never get a good feel of what the villains are about, all I remember about them was that one was sexy, one was a General and one was big.These grievances may sound like a lot but on the whole the film was fun and kept my attention throughout and I am nit-picking here, give the film a try and make up your own mind but I would say that this feels like a fresh new take on a genre that is quickly becoming tired, a breath of fresh air after the disappointment that was Black Widow, if DC keeps this up with The Batman they may even have a chance and defeating Marvel.",The Suicide Squad
274,TreeFiddy53,Decent 'sequel'. DCEU still needs to fix the overall mess.,6,7 August 2021,"The previous DCEU movies (and the previous Suicide Squad) had set the bar so low, that even a mediocre movie by itself would end up being a really good DCEU movie.This was just that. Average by itself, but a decent onetime watch as a DCEU with several positives and negatives. If you're a DC fan and are into the comic books, you're gonna LOUVE this. I'm not that invested in DC, so -Pros: Great acting by some of the leads. Comedy (for a DC movie) worked well in parts. A bunch of stuff you wouldn't expect to happen, happens. A lot of the characters seem to get enough screen-time.Cons: Starts off well, goes downhill. Will require cinematic liberty and you to not paying attention to things you'd roll your eyes about. There was a lot of scope for Dark comedy, opportunity missed.Decent sequel. DC still needs to fix the overall mess and they're far from it.",The Suicide Squad
275,Harry_Gleeson,A Breath of Fresh Weirdness!,8,5 August 2021,"Overall, The Suicide Squad was an absolute bonkers film, but in a good way. Considering the 'first' film that David Ayer made in 2016 was a big mess on many way, this iteration of The Suicide Squad was a welcome breath fresh of air.The biggest standout was the action. Yes it can be exaggerated, but the way the action was done was so entertaining and it reflected James Gunn's vision for how he wanted the film to look. The fact that almost all the action was very bloody highlights how much creative freed Gunn had.Chemistry between the characters was important here too. Idris Elba and John Cena's characters had a great relationship throughout. Margot Robbie shone as Harley Quinn and David Dastmalchian was surprisingly hilarious as Polka Dot man. (Yeah I don't know how that is either)The only hiccup for me was the writing, in certain stages, and most related to the humour. I thought some of the jokes didn't quite land, which are consistently strong in Gunn's Guardians films. But very minor negatives.A very enjoyable though, one I'd recommend without doubt. A second viewing will solidify my love for the film, a real breath of fresh weirdness.Quote - 'Nothing like a bloodbath to start the day' - PeacemakerRating - 4/5.",The Suicide Squad

277,Dello_,Love you James Gunn,8,5 September 2021,"I liked ""The Suicide Squad"" a lot, it's super entertaining, violent, funny and it has great characters. Going into the theater I was expecting a violent comedy and I found a funny massacre. This movie is super violent but in a Kill Bill way in which the violence is so exaggerated to be funny and in general, except for two or three instances, is depicted with the purpose of make the viewer laugh. The plot is well written with great dialogues but is simple and what really makes this movie so enjoyable are the characters. Some of them are more ""regular"", other like King Shark are stranger but have their moments too. I am sad that this movie is not going too well at the box office because is very good and deserved better. If you are interested watch it because you'll probably won't be disappointed.",The Suicide Squad
278,hfreinoso,I enjoyed it,9,14 September 2021,"I have nothing to say but... BRILLIANT. James Gunn loves doing comic book movies justice. And he did it with The Suicide Squad. I enjoyed this film way more than the 2016 Suicide Squad (Even though we haven't seen David Ayer's REAL Suicide Squad). Every single moment of this movie and this is a movie that's different and done in its way...this is nothing like any other movie based on comics. HE went all out, and he wasn't kidding when he was given the freedom to do whatever he wanted in this movie. HE did make a movie never seen before for a movie like this star power like Idriss Elba, Margot Robbie, John Cena, and Sylvester Stallone; it was a movie to see on the big screen.The one who stole the show was King Shark and Polka Dot Man as they were both hilarious and heart felt villians. But Ratcatcher 2 was the one who stole my heart, and I begged her to stay alive until the end of the film. I loved her in this movie, and I loved her every time she was on screen, and I could not be happier when she lived until the end. And it was, in fact, crazy that he did kill a lot of people in the end. Especially when Rick Flagg and Captain Boomerang died, those two are essential to the suicide squad in shows and other comics and films, but Gunn chose to end these characters, and I was shocked when he did that. I can go into detail about this film, but I won't because we all know this film was done under the vision of A director and NOT a studio. James Gunn, I tip my hat to you. You did a brilliant comic book movie again after Guardians of the Galaxy 1. 9/10.",The Suicide Squad
279,jeannefrancoise,thank you James Gunn,8,25 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is overall funny and entertaining, having some kind of story plot related to James Gunn taste, sometimes with dark comedy, hard dialogues, unpredictable love story, and beautiful ending. This is not just super hero movie, but also a little bit drama with psychoanalysis assumption of theory inside it. For example how they are connected to each other with a same vision and mission, how is the appearance new comer King Shark can change the way of group thinking, and the dramatic scene of Harley Quinn with her new lover, are compacted one to another to be a great plot to be smoothly watched. Several times I can laugh. I never read about comic book of Suicide Squad, if this had been written, but I assume that this movie can describe what the author wants to see on the big screen.

286,ha77y73ad97,DCs Guardians of the Galaxy....... More like DCs Deadpool,10,2 August 2021,"This really was a ride, from start to finish there was a paranoia that none of these characters are safe. Created a feel of anxiety that James Gunn even said in interviews that he was allowed to kill any one of the team off during this film.We open up with Savant being drafted to the team with Rick Flag returning Harley and Captain Boomerang with so many other new characters heading off to the mission. Being dropped a few 100 meters from the shore line we get the first casualty and it couldnt have gone down any better as the Weasel cant swim and just dies..... The ensuing scene can only be described as chaos! Deaths left right and center for character that we may have come to love. Then this is where compartmentalization comes into the fold with a second team being led by Bloodspot arrives on the beach under the cover of a diversion caused by the chaos on the other side.The story is simple as this film really focuses on all the characters involved and each of them have their time to shine! From the trailer everyone knew the big bad of the Movie is Starro but this isnt the person you come to hate by the end of the movie. Starro was used well and gave the team a 'big league' villain after being introduced in Brave and the Bold #28 comic back in the 60s. If I have to say the First 2 thirds are better than the fight with Starro.Harley played to perfection but Margot Robbie, Idris Elbas Bloodsport, John Cenas Peacemaker and Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher are just amazing throughout this movie from the fighting to the heartfelt moments behind enemy lines. Harleys manically violence and calm assurance cant be faulted! Idris Elbas performance as a grumpy ex military captain caught for shooting Superman just has to be commended and throughout this movie there are moments where you are truly routing for him! John Cena, what can be said for this character, just a complete Patriotic mad man that can kill anyone. Finally Melchior's Ratcatcher has that innocence to her performance of a Z list DC villain that is terrible as being bad she is just to nice by the time the movie finishes. These were the standouts but mentions have to got to Viola Davies Amanda Waller and King Shark! Davies brings the same energy as she did in the first film with being far more ruthless and without the cheesy lines but the presence of someone who believes is doing the right thing for the country with the help of Peacemaker!With the hope that James Gunn returns to the franchise after Guardians of the Galaxy vol.3 this wont kick start any major changes for the DCEU but there is a different way to attack comic book movies other than PG-13 movies. One thing that can be dined this is a hyper violent movie that may have warranted an 18 rating if it wasnt for one flower filled violent exchange with Harley and a bunch of soldiers this may have slipped into that category. Very much the same as Kill Bills black and white scene for that to be allowed in cinemas not just the rating. Theres a lot of reviews using the term 'Edgy' as a bad thing and i think these are the same kind of reviews hating Joker, Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman and the true Zack Snyders Justice League where they want a cookie cutter Marvel Movies that always have the good guys winning and the bad guys either Russian or a bad version of the hero i.e Black widow!",The Suicide Squad
287,DeadMansTrousers,Enjoyable mindless entertainment,7,7 August 2021,"I expected it to be amazing with all the hype surrounding it and it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything extraordinary. I would've liked to have seen a little more character development, some of the characters were thrown away so quickly and were extremely underdeveloped. There were so many great actors and potential to have more story/substance to the film but that was all thrown away in the first 20 min of the film.It's an over the top mindless gorefest filled with lots of perverse humor and if that's what you are looking for than clearly you will enjoy it.",The Suicide Squad
288,drawlife,Bloody fun.,9,9 August 2021,"The violence in this movie is visceral and I loved it. As a comic fan, I do love the MCU, but they have formula to them and from time to time can feel stale with the same reliance on humor and tone, and I savor it when they go serious like the CAPTAIN AMERICA films, INFINITY WAR and the first IRON MAN.So with that being said I admire that DC/WB do take chances on the R-rated material. It doesn't always work out, but here it worked out quite well. James Gunn does not hold back. He provides glorious violence for us to consume throughout the film. He literally pulls off a DEADPOOL 2 and kills off half the cast in the opening of the film, including Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang whom I was sad to see bite the dust so early. Kinda hoping that one day we'd see Ezra's Flash really go up against Jai's Boomerang.King Shark for me is a highlight. I think he will be a fan favorite, I would compare him to Groot as he kinda is the Groot of the group. Sylvester Stallone does a good job evoking his voice to the character and throughout the film there are moments without dialog where we just learn more about him as a character. David Dastmalchian's Polka-Dot Man is also unintentionally hilarious. I also clinged on to Idris Elba's Bloodsport. Loved his overall look and his weaponry. He together with Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 are the anchors of the film.I also greatly appreciated Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag. I personally didn't feel he was handled properly in the first David Ayer film, but here he was more closer to the counterpart that I recalled in the comics. It was sad to see him go by the hands of Cena's Peacmaker. Speaking of Cena I was quite impressed with him. He asshole-like charisma oozes off the screen and bounces off the cast very well.Harley Quinn here is the best adaptation of her so far. Not to say Margot Robbie wasn't great as the character cause she is, but you can clearly see when there isn't too much studio interference and in the hands of a capable director who knows what he is doing you get good results.The Starro angle on the film was disturbing and yet saddening. Seeing Starro spores used on human test subjects truly did bring a shiver down my spine. However, boiling it down, Starro really is a victim in all this and did nothing wrong. Yes, he absolutely had to be stopped as he killed a lot of people, but he was captured and experimented on for nearly thirty years and he had every right to be upset and angry. I feel the real villain overall is Amanda Waller. Viola Davis really brings the meanest side of the character very well and she does a good job making you hate her.If you had a collection of checkboxes to mark off, chances are the film will check off a lot of them: comedy, warmth, elements of horror, action, spoof and commentaries. Often movies try to do too much at once and it collapses on its own weight, but here Gunn manages to balance out all these things with ease, and not to mention with obscure characters that might be a hard sell to most, especially ones who never have read the source material.I do feel awful for David Ayer's first SUICIDE SQUAD film with whaat happened behind the scenes, but this clearly the superior product over the theatrical release. Unlikely, but fingers crossed one day Ayer's cut could see the light of day.My only nitpicks is I felt some of the Harley stuff with the dictators felt dragged out here and there, I did feel the length at some times, and as this film is apart of the bigger DCEU, I do feel like the continuity is still very vague and because of that I feel like some characters can show up again with no explanation. If you follow behind the scenes stuff at all, any movie buff or comic fan would know that behind the scenes, DC was an absolute mess. There was mention of Superman, but no minor reference to BIRDS OF PREY or JL. Perhaps this will all eventually be addressed at some point. This is the problem of having a shared universe, but I do think WB is intentionally ignoring some of that to not be so hamstrung to the previous IP's that were poorly received.Overall, a solid DCEU entry, I personally would rank this third best behind ZSJL and MAN OF STEEL. I do think this movie will have hurdles to jump over as the pervious film's lackluster reviews, same day HBO Max access and the pandemic might hinder some of the success which is a shame, but here's hoping for more. Good soundtrack too.9/10.",The Suicide Squad
289,tvdefrancesco,Best DC Movie Since Dark Knight Rises,9,11 August 2021,"I really enjoyed this film. I would have given it a 10 if the Star Fish was done better but I understand why they did it. You can only mass murder so many people before the audience turns on the characters so making the villain more cartoonish made it easier to butcher everyone lol.Firstly the Harley Quinn movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In her first two movies the voice drove me nuts and all her fighting was very gimmicky and dumb. A baseball bat? An over sized bop hammer? In this one they scale back on her stupidity and voice and up the crazy. I love it. But in this one we see Harley can really fight and is an absolute killer. The best scene of the movie was when she breaks out and starts killing everyone in a variety of different ways. About half way through we see it from Harleys head and the blood is flowers. I thought Margot Robbie proved she can fight and put in the work. I walked away thinking finally they made Harley Quinn awesome!John Cena stole the show. He was fantastic. I was dying laughing. Also the Polka dot guy was so funny and the scenes of him seeing his mother were hilarious. Idris Elba was great as always. The opening scene was soo good and I had a feeling it was going to happen but when it actually did I was so pumped. Javelin, TDK, Sevant haha.Great music, pacing, cinematography, etc. All in all great movie. James Gunn is becoming one of the best Directors on the planet.",The Suicide Squad
290,ryanpersaud-59415,An Unbelievable Improvement. From the worst to possibly one of the best superhero films ever made.,8,23 August 2021,"The Good: Why do we like superhero stories? Is it the characters - the archetypes that give us comfort and help us make sense of right or wrong? Is it the imagination, the zany weird world that is created and the endless possibilities? Is the violence? The style? The layers of history that is perfect fodder for parody, deconstruction, and examination? The iconic visuals? Trick question: it's all of the above and guess what, The Suicide Squad captures all of this.The best way to talk about the filmmaking aspect of 2021 SS is to contrast it with 2016 SS. Whereas that film was ugly, poorly edited, confusing, poorly paced and packed with throwaway characters and plots, this one is literally the complete opposite. It's bursting with colour and style, it has a non-linear storyline edited and arranged with such precision, it seems like an ""easy"" thing to do. You know exactly where characters are and what they're doing. You get to understand them gradually throughout the film as it goes from fast paced and high octane to slowing down appropriately. Every character has a point and purpose; they all get great moments and you grow to love them by the end of it.Like with comic books in general, the characters MAKE this movie. Harley Quinn, Rick Flag and Amanda Waller (from the original) are VASTLY improved here; not much has really changed about them, they just have sensical motivations and act how they're supposed to, with enough time devoted to them to understand. But it's the new characters who really shine here. Ratcatcher, Polka Dot Man, King Shark, Peacemaker...all played to perfection by their respective actors, are funny, irreverent, interesting and so, so surprising. Even the most minor members of the Squad (Weasel, forever!) are so interesting and layered. Gunn is a really smart filmmaker, and if it's not the writing, it's the subtle visual or audio aspects to the characters that imbue them with a sense of personality. He's literally one of the best filmmakers out there making ensemble pieces and getting great, memorable performances from his actors.I haven't even gotten to the writing. This movie manages to balance the bizarre, the dark, the meta, the serious and the funny to perfect effect. I just love this film's tone and how the script seems to be hitting the right beats and the exact right time. This movie manages to explore comic book movie tropes, make d**k jokes and seriously critique the ruthlessness of American foreign policy towards the Third World all at the same time (disturbingly relevant in relation to the ongoing situation in Afghanistan) and never skips a beat. There is almost no poor choice made here, in writing, performance or filmmaking. Honestly, it's one of the best superhero movies in recent memory.The Bad: The movie does drag a little bit in the middle and there are some questionable decisions made here, particularly with the ""villains."" There are at least 4 (possibly 5) antagonists in this movie, and only two (Waller - whom Viola Davis absolutely NAILS and Starro - whom is a big scary monster that you actually kind of feel bad for) are really fleshed out. I felt Capaldi was a little wasted here.I also just don't find Harley Quinn very funny. Her lines always feel awkward and forced. But thankfully, there isn't much of that.(I know this is meant to be the ""negative"" section, but Viola Davis' Amanda Waller might legitimately be one of the most terrifying villains in comic book film history, and it's precisely because you know there are tons of people like her in real life. )The Ugly: The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly hard on superhero films: they're expensive, really on massive box office hauls to recoup production costs and hence, reliant on theatres, which have understandably been...difficult to operate these past 18 months or so, to say the least. But what I hope for is with less of an emphasis of big budgets and billion dollar returns (as studios seem more interested in having good content for streaming), we can get more weird, out there movies like this. Let's hope THE Suicide Squad is a sign of things to come. I finally feel like with Aquaman, Joker and now this, DC-on-film finally has an identity and honestly, it's far more exciting than Marvel right now.",The Suicide Squad
291,Benslie,This movie redeems for the 2016 version,9,8 August 2021,"One thing that should be common knowledge now is that James Gunn is an incredible director and writer. This movie could've easily been another disaster but James Gunn brought so much to this movie. He made sure that this movie never felt long or boring. There is so much creativity in this movie that you can easily forget at times that this is a DC superhero movie. Aside from the directing being much better than the first movie is the acting in this movie. Everybody in this movie just connected really well with each other and felt like an actual team. The standouts for me were easily Daniela Melchior, who plays Ratcatcher 2, and David Dastmalchian, who plays Polka-Dot Man. Everybody in this movie brought their all with their respected roles but those two easily stood out for me especially Daniela Melchoir who people could easily relate to and feel for. I'm definitely going to shot out Jaws and Crisp Ratt who played Sebastian that sure they might've gotten CGI'd in postproduction still were amazing. Also, I know John Cena is supposed to be in this movie but I didn't see him. On the topic of CGI, I have to admit that the visual effects for this movie were honestly really good in this movie. I'm not saying I was expecting it to be bad but it honestly surprised me. I also got to say the cinematography in this movie was really beautiful. I also want to say the music in this movie was really well done and unlike with the 2016 movie fit with the scenes appropriately. The Suicide Squad movie is easily better than the 2016 version by a landslide and continues to prove how great of a director and writer James Gunn is.",The Suicide Squad
292,tyesonbebee,It was eh lagged in some parts some jokes eh,6,7 August 2021,"It was a fun movie, My only true complaint is they killed off Rick Flag and not Peace Maker. It was better then the first one that's for sure probably the last 30

293,Master_Strange,Joyride from start to finish,10,7 August 2021,"Similar to the emotional feel of Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad creates a lovable band of a-holes that Gunn gleefully plays with your expectations, and revels in the anarchic narrative he has created and and It's the exact same DC-comics-based concept (a bunch of incarcerated supervillains must undertake a highly deadly black-ops mission). All the cast are great fun to watch on screen with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn getting the big stand out action sequence.

Very few movies these days manage to stick to the main plot without veering off to some unnecessary subplot and this movie was one of them. It was on topic from start to finish and gave us exactly what we wanted to see.Coming to the performances, Idris Elba outshone everyone else in the movie with his wonderful performance. This man is the highlight of the movie. Margot Robbie as usual was amazing! John Cena and Joel Kinnaman were suprisingly good too. The movie did not have a single moment of boredom. It manages to keep the audience entertained the whole time. The VFX were mind blowing and the pacing was fast as it should be. This is exactly what happens when the director is in full control of the movie making. James Gunn did a fantastic job and I hope DC hires him for more movies in the future.Although I'm not a DC fan, I found this movie to be highly entertaining. I would definitely recommend it for everyone!",The Suicide Squad

It hits exactly the same beats, although cleaner, and its strength remains its excellent cast of characters, four of whom return from the first movie. Where it differs from Ayers' editorially savaged movie is in its flow, its more organic humour, and in its willingness to kill off its big name characters and cast, sometimes rather surprisingly.",The Suicide Squad

301,Criticalstaff,Refreshing,8,11 August 2021,"I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this film the way I did. I had a very good time with this movie. It is fun. This film is far from perfect, yet it just works. There is something very satisfying in watching this film. Not only because of the story, the characters, action scenes etc... but also in the way all these elements are put (smartly) together.The movie does nothing extraordinary; it is in essence similar to the previous Suicide Squad. Similar plot, similar themes. But, the mere fact that there is someone behind the helm, with a clear voice and an unobstructed vision, feels like a lost art. The film is very reminiscent of Guardians of the galaxy but with a bit more of an edge. Although Guardians was very irreverent already, it feels that this movie goes even further. Takes an even bigger risk and is bolder. On the other hand, it is reusing a lot of superhero tropes and device that simply are effective. Nonetheless it is great. There is a hundred ways I could describe how this movie is superior to most of the superhero movies we are subjected to again and again. I'll just mention the moment with the bullet sizes, there is an early setup and later there is payoff. It feels like it is something we've never seen in this genre.This film is refreshing, it is fun, and it is original. You could nit-pick some things, like the weakness of the action scenes, or the blandness of the setting. (a lot of it reminded me of The Expendables). But that is so minor compared to the joy this film displays. You can feel that the film has been made with love and care, but still with a self-deprecating distance that allows it to not make the mistakes these type of films fall in. The film is sincere and heartfelt, yet at the same time it knows how tongue-in-cheek some of it can be.This film had no right to be as good as it is. It is a remake/sequel of a film everyone hated or made fun of, its creative voice had been arguably been fired and disgraced, never to work in movies again. Even the star-studded cast looked like a recipe for disaster à la Cats. And lo and behold: the concept when executed cleverly, and without dismissing the earlier film no less, is compelling and engaging. James Gunn it turns out is the only one in Hollywood to get the superhero genre, to understand its grammar. After the success of Guardians, everyone started cramming pop-songs in their movies. Gunn once again shows the world; it turns out, the needle drops need to be relevant to the stuff on screen. Who knew? The acting and the characters developed start as generic and boring as possible, yet they build into something unique and memorable. I loved Bloodsport, I related to Harley, I understood Polka Dot.I can't recall the last time I was so delighted by a comic book superhero film. There was Logan, which was a bit more melancholic, the first Deadpool movie which was more nihilistic, or Shazaam. But none of those really hit the spot the way this film does.",The Suicide Squad
302,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Fun comic book insanity to the point of sensory overload,7,22 August 2021,"With its cast of disposable D-list characters, bright color palette, and jukebox soundtrack, The Suicide Squad is blood-splattering, perverse, comic book insanity from writer-director James Gunn. While it's a vast improvement over the first film, this sequel (yes, it is a sequel) indulges in its R rating in the spirit of maximizing all the fun and the nasty but falls short of delivering deeper emotional resonance like the first Guardians of the Galaxy.James Gunn puts a lot of goodies in The Suicide Squad and it is an assault on the senses. At times, it feels like watching Gunn bashing his action figures together. To think how much money was spent making a perverse violent comedy off of C-list comic book characters is astounding. The film is quite niche.Everyone is having a blast. The cast is all reveling in the central gag that any character could die at any moment. The throwaway one-off nature sets the actors free to be as outrageous as they want with their characters. There's no pressure of holding back cause they need to carry the character across a multi-picture franchise.Idris Elba's Bloodsport, whose character and backstory are glaringly similar to Will Smith's Deadshot from the first film, is a charismatic lead and makes a great straight man to all the other crazier characters. Elba shares a hilarious macho rivalry with John Cena's Peacemaker, a murderous version of Captain America. It's the perfect part for Cena as it combines an action hero element and straight-faced comedy.Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and understands the part inside out. In a sequence devoted to developing Harley, Robbie shows Harley's consciousness of her madness in true scenery chewing fashion. If someone is 100% insane, they're home-free. But being aware of that insanity implies that there is trauma lurking underneath. It's too bad Harley hasn't been consistently developed over three films. I still deeply crave a Joker and Harley Quinn solo movie.The standouts were the lesser-known characters: Ratcatcher 2, Polka Dot Man, and King Shark. Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 is quite charming as the team's empath and the heart of the team. I hope to see her in other films. David Dastmalchian's Polka Dot Man, a failed experimental subject with mommy issues, was tragically funny. King Shark, a dim-witted man-eating shark voiced by Sylvester Stallone, was endearing, adorable, and steals every scene.There's a lot of humor in various tones. It's ironic how Gunn was temporarily canceled for his offensive tweets and yet it is the same twisted humor (albeit toned down and refined) that people are raving at now. Gunn designs entire setpieces as jokes and these gags were laugh-out-loud funny. The verbal banter between the team started funny but as the movie went on, most of the bickering didn't land and felt dragging.By the third act, I was lost wondering about what the film's theme was and it just didn't all gather together for me. The character elements were all in place but they worked better as individual pieces than as the sum of its parts. I wanted to feel more for these characters.With both Suicide Squad films, I just don't fully buy the central conceit of these supervillains becoming a family over the course of one mission together. Yes, they're criminals doing a dangerous mission to cut down sentence time. But, what does accomplishing the mission ultimately mean?The movie did feel long as I tired out from sensory overload watching it on an IMAX screen. I look forward to rewatching it on a smaller screen.Despite the warm critical reception, it is unfortunate to see The Suicide Squad perform poorly at the box office. I can see how people disconnected with the Suicide Squad property and this sequel certainly deserves better and in some ways, I wish this was the first Suicide Squad film in 2016.",The Suicide Squad

His imprint on this movie is so obvious and it's such a breath of fresh air in this universe. He really has made DC interesting again with this one, the writing in this is fantastic and all the actors are doing such a good job and clearly are enjoying themselves. The comedy is second to none, this film is hilarious and all of the characters work so well together. Some scenes are literally just all the characters taking the mick out of each other and it's so funny. The special effects are amazing in this and some scenes genuinely are beautiful and with the amazing sound track it just makes for a great viewing. The new characters are great aswell and there will 100% be some fan favourites. This film is just so fun and I'm so glad James Gunn has hopefully set DC on a good path to success now.

305,hotrobinproductions,"The ""REAL academy award winning"" Suicide Squad",8,29 July 2021,"I remember as if it was yesterday my utter disappointment in 2016 when I purchased my tickets to watch Suicide Squad back then. No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I'm VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I'm also glad the studio acknowledged that. I'm VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn't feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry's this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that's where this movie shines. It's VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.*Pros*
Well written characters / performances
Comedy/Action (is not repetitive)
Effects/CGI
Story / plot / script*Cons*
Thinly written Villain
Climax for the ending felt just a bit thin wish it would have required more ""teamwork"" and not one character being the reason they won (you'll see what I mean)
Some Characters I felt died a bit too soon and would have liked a little more depth before they went.WB needs to keep this up and we will continue to want more. If they understand the character they should know the direction needed to continue the character. Superman doesn't need to be dark and suicide squad should never be PG13. Not saying these are ""impossible to do"" but just saying if you REALLY understand the character you should know what works and what doesn't, and as far as I see it... this is the RIGHT direction for The Suicide Squad Peacemaker show is something to look forward to! And I will be more than happy to call this Film an ""The REAL Academy Winning Suicide Squad"" because it deserves the title more than the 2016 one... #releasetheayercut.",The Suicide Squad

307,waltermwilliams,Standing Ovation Worthy,10,10 August 2021,"This truly is ""THE Suicide Squad"" thanks to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Director, James Gunn.The pitiful attempt at bringing these characters to life 5 years ago on the Silver Screen is but a distant nightmare.Like a bad ""Ghostbusters"" sequel ""Suicide Squad"" 2016 is the ghost of Christmas past, whereas this new release is where the serious fun begins.Oh and it is F-U-N!In fact, Gunn puts the fun in Fantasy.However this film is so much more it's action, adventure, war movie, sci-fi, social commentary, dark comedy etc.It literally defies pigeon holes for any one genre.All your old faves are back with more original stories plus plenty of new characters to cheer or jeer depending on your political agenda.Aussie Margot Robbie embodies Harley Quinn.I can't imagine any other actress playing her now.If you loved her in ""Birds of Prey"" hang onto your baseball bats the rides about to get real.So many great names signed on for ""The Suicide Squad"".Sly Stallone is a frickin man eating ""King Shark"".The ""Rookies"" star is being honoured in his own home town with the renaming of City Hall as ""Nathan Fillion Civilian Pavilion"" for his role as ""TDK"" ( watch the movie to find out exactly what those letters stand for)
Will Smith couldn't make the reunion so English actor Idris Elba (the man who should be Bond) is in a similar role as ""Blood Sport"" with the coolest Superhero costume.I know at my age I shouldn't be so into this world of Heroes and Villains, but it's what I grew up with as a 60's baby...70's made me.Back to my review...

as ""Savant"" proves you should never mess with birds...and while we're at it what's with his hair.He looks like Edgar Winters love child.Viola Davis is back as ""Amanda Waller"".""Rick Flagg"" fans won't be dissatisfied either.Wrestler turned actor John Cena is hilarious as ""Peacemaker"" representing the American Dream.Be prepared to witness gory carnage and a very high body toll.If you are looking for escapism this roller coaster ride will satisfy that thirst.""The Suicide Squad"" treads happy middle ground between both the Marvel and DC Universes with its mix of dark as dark chocolate humour and blood letting.Not recommended for children.Don't leave till the lights come on or you'll miss the Easter Egg.This movie is why I go to the cinema!",The Suicide Squad

315,TheMysteriousReviewer,Much More Epic Than The 2016 One,9,5 September 2021,"Who knew this would make a great improvement from the 2016 film. The Suicide Squad succeeds on doing so. As the title says The Suicide Squad, the movies does very well on how it would work as a group of supervillains. They abandon a specific mission, they die. And they must take order to save the world. But the story has proven how it can really make up for last time. It was gory, more intense and even has funny moments. In this film, this isn't mainly about Harley Quinn. It's actually about the entire team of superheroes. And thanks to a great execution, the action scenes are exciting and interesting to watch. There also has a lot of surprises the movie can offer. The visuals are greatly edited. And even the characters are enjoyable. It has listened to the criticism and gave them development. Feel let down by the 2016 film? This film will definitely make up for that and would contain a lot of things the last time it could've have. I would recommend giving this a watch. This is not only better than the 2016 film, but also one of my favorite DC Extended Universe films next to Wonder Woman and Shazam.",The Suicide Squad

Had a really blast with the first one - the cast, its' originality, the characters, storyline. It was adventurous, entertaining and real fun.This one felt really boring except for some really small instances that you forget midst all the rest. What a waste.The story unfolds painfully slow, don't know if I can blame the new characters. Feels none of their stories were developed like they deserved, some could have not been made (occupied space without adding anything).Can not understand the great ratings and reviews.",The Suicide Squad

Great mixture of characters, just felt the pace was a little slow but liked there was more gore than the first movie and not following same pattern as most comic movies where everyone lives!Plot was a little sketchy but some great action, gags and set pieces just felt something was missing but a decent enough watch.",The Suicide Squad
318,j_movie,some feelings,8,16 August 2021,"It is indeed the most pleasant viewing experience in recent time. The funny and evil taste of plasma is only packaging, which is essentially full of extremely strong romantic color. The growth choice and even death of each character are full of a sense of destiny and tragic feeling in a sense, which is only partially diluted by joking. In the post ""women's Federation"" era, we are tired of watching superhero films that go online, which is also the reason why it is difficult to produce good works in the future. Starting from this film, I hope to find some new creative methods and ideas. Even though it has the same ending and theme as previous works, all kinds of interesting attempts are better than nothing.",The Suicide Squad
319,RubyMouse,Bonkers,8,8 August 2021,"I think you have to go into this knowing it's cheesy, bonkers, fun and just go with it. I mean it's completely ludicrous: like a nonsensical John Wick on acid with monsters, but it made me laugh out loud several times.",The Suicide Squad
320,RobTortureWright,The Truth.,6,8 August 2021,"I see a lot of 1/10's and a lot of 10/10's but truthfully 'The Suicide Squad' is just a very average superhero movie. It tries to do something different with the ""losers"" of the hero world being thrown together and trying to make up for the mistakes of the first film by saying bye bye to the worst Joker ever. That for sure helps the film and makes it instantly better.The villain is a giant starfish (not bad, just stupid) and adding things like a CGI shark and a polka dot man just didn't work for me (I know people are truly in love with the shark, sadly I don't get it) never once did I laugh in this film and each to their own but if you were laughing out loud at any of this film then your standard for comedy is 2/10 at best.Where this films works is the action sequences which are fairly good, typical CGI overload but it plays out well enough with some nice visuals here and there. The story is the most basic story of any film you'll ever see but it has enough star power with Idris Elba and Margot Robbie to carry it along. (Will smith was like nah I ain't doing that again) Nathan Fillian makes an appearance but dies within 5 minutes, so does Michael Rooker and he too dies instantly. If you want to see Michael Rookers true potential then watch Guardians of the Galaxy.Honestly there's just nothing special here, nothing awful but if you didn't watch this film at all you're really not missing anything, I'll forget about this film in a few days just like I did with the first (had to rewatch it again recently because it genuinely left my brain it was that forgettable).All I'm seeing online over the past few days is die hard fans berating anyone who doesn't like it, as if its the greatest masterpiece of cinema. Its FAR from a masterpiece. If this is your thing that's great, but remember people have the right to disagree and say it isn't for them, and if you viciously defend it, it says you're insecure because you know it's not that great. For me it's a very average film that doesn't give you any real takeaways at all. Oh and that post credits scene was the worst thing I've seen all year.",The Suicide Squad
321,catdogmanfish,7.9? Let's be real folks,7,6 August 2021,"Right off the bat this movie does the thing I hate in movies where it introduces a bunch of characters and then kills them, along with a character I liked in the first Suicide Squad movie. Then they do the ""3 days earlier"" cliche, so what little emotional currency they built up is now gone. Idris Elba having a back and forth shouting match with a teenager is a scene I did not know I didn't need in my life until now. I think the filmmakers decided they need a new Diablo for the audience to care about so they brought in Polka Dot Man, way to do the same thing two movies in a row. This being my third Harley Quinn movie, I'm really tired of her long monologs on her love life. This movie has some good parts and some James Gunn styled funny beats but this is not a 7.9 film. Is it better than the first Suicide Squad? Yes, but not by much.",The Suicide Squad
322,otnememento-2,The entertainment squad,7,7 August 2021,"I believe that the previous version is not the real version of the director, kind of Justice League, so it is unfair to compare. This film is not related at all with the previous one. Gunn took the Guardians of the galaxy style into the suicide squad. The result is a mix of action and humour almost as good as the first guardians' film. Great entertainment from a director that has again shown he knows how to get the best from cómic books into a big screen.",The Suicide Squad
323,Mike_O_Dwyer,As Watchable As It Is Forgettable,4,7 August 2021,"If the previous film was a humourless trudge with lacklustre direction and a villain no one cared about, this redo is something of an improvement. Just not by much.I'm not a huge fan of Guardians of The Galaxy, but it's definitely a league above TSS. GOTG certainly looks a heck of a lot better and feels bigger, more cinematic, with characters that are far better written and more than a sprinkling of humour and imagination.The Suicide Squad feels like a glorified TV movie in comparison. Throwaway action lifted from a midweek Chuck Norris / A-Team lite series. The visual effects in The Suicide Squad look ropey as damned, there's something very second tier about them. Ditto the fight scenes, nothing particularly memorable at all - lots of meaningless red coat deaths.Idris Elba is one of those actors who seems entirely personable and charming and lovely and you want the best for him because Stringer Bell, but I've never seen him command the big screen. He tends to come across as stiff and ill at ease with whatever role he plays, whereas on the smaller screen in more rounded characterful roles he's a powerhouse. Weird.Margot Robbie is great, this is the best version of Harley Quinn she's done yet and almost the highpoint. But Polka Dot man is an easy favourite.There are a lot of other characters but they're all fairly flat and one dimensional, delivering so-so dialogue in a way that seems like they know it's so-so and have ever so slightly lost the will to live.It's fine, as watchable as it is forgettable.",The Suicide Squad

The acting is really bad. I can understand the acting was intentionally depicted in that way, but its execution hurts the viewer intelligence.Some action scenes are solid, but the majority are just mediocre.Yes, there are some jokes... but they won't make laugh my 10 year daughter....and finally the story and character development... was there any? Just a series of events and silly delusions to spend more than 2 hours of your precious life.I've raised my vote by one just because it's slightly better than the version of 2016 and because of some good gore/bloody (R rated) parts.And last but not least:

They shared the same awkwardness, without substance and meaningless scenes and plans. They exaggerated with many things that annoyed me. I expected that but it was above the limit. It wasn't even that funny, I had only very few laughs, thanks to John Cena. This Waller version I don't like. The previous was better, serious and professional, but that's me. Not to mention it was predictable. The ending, because the beginning was a not pleasant surprise, like at all. They deserved more, but nevermind. One thing was good, the soundtrack, but that's not enough for me. The cast was too good for this under mediocre movie. #ReleaseTheAyerCut.",The Suicide Squad

The worst of this somewhat trilogy, comes in last due to the boring portrayal of the thinker and some dumb giant starfish as a big bad. Lame, incoherent and silly. I actually liked the first one but Will Smith was a believable alt-hero. Idries tries, Cena can't act (we know this and don't care), actually not enough Harley and everything else was pointless.

334,hiraishinnojutsu,"Well, it's quiet fun",8,10 August 2021,"Gunn definitely brings his signature directing style for DC just like he did with Marvel with the two previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies, added with what is quiet possible a little homage to Tarantino's shooting style, Snyder-esque slow mo's, and both directors' R rated violences, this is something of a delight for comicbook movie fans in general. Can't say the same thing about all of the humors tho, some may be funny, others are cheesy and forced, like many that we can find in the MCU. The CGIs are pretty good, especially for the overly grown Patrick Star. This movie makes my interest in David Ayer's cut of the original Suicide Squad grow, so please HBO Max, the guy (and us, the fans) deserves it!!",The Suicide Squad

337,risbyceonna,Exciting.,8,7 August 2021,"This movie was actually pretty entertaining, if you just view it as a fun action film you'll love it. If you view it as a dc universe film that'll contribute to future films then I don't think you'll like it much because this movie felt like it didn't take itself as seriously. I absolutely loved Harley Quinn in this movie, her actions scenes were so good, it had me on the edge of my seat. I was sitting there impressed and in awe, Harley truly felt like herself here. The outfit and the hair was a good upgrade, I love that the crew didn't need to save her. Bloodsport was alright, I liked that he had a conflicted relationship with his daughter. It's not something I see in many hero films. I LOVED ratcatcher, her character was really sweet and a bit naive. I wasn't annoyed with her character at all and I loved the backstory this character had. The character John Cena played was interesting, at times his jokes fell flat but I loved the twist that happened to his character at the end, it was really good. Lastly, I liked that rick flag wasn't just a love interest in this movie. He had an actual personality and I really liked it. He became this really interesting character and I like it.King shark is an adorable gem I love him, that's it. The villain was a bit underwhelming, I loved the big fight at the end but the villain wasn't all that interesting. I just wasn't feeling the conflict.Overview: If you're looking for an action, comedy with some funny jokes and some and jokes, I recommend. This movie may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it entertainment wise. If I were a hardcore DC fan I'd rate it a 4 probably because it doesn't fit universe wise.",The Suicide Squad

Likewise when I seen the trailer for this movie I was hyped because it looked just as zany.But this time around there were a few times I looked at to see if it was close to the end yet. It felt to long really. Especially with the ""end person"". And there were alot of things that felt like they could have cut out. Some of the comedy sort of fell flat. It also tried to squeeze in some emotional moments like the last movie, but they felt out of place.The only reason I even have it was a 5 was King Shark, Quinn and Weasel. The other characters were interesting but obviously more of B or C tier guys from the comics. Am I saying this is the worst movie ever? Nope. But its far from the best.

340,sfinancing,Mixed feeling,6,8 August 2021,"So this one is much better than the first, however that is a pretty low bar to start with.So the good first:
Special effects were good if overdone. Robbie was good as HQ, though she doesn't stand out as much as the first(not sure if this is because the writing for her isn't as good or that the actors around her do better). I like Elba and thought he did well enough. The rest at least held there own. King Shark added a few amusing moment and honestly TDK's brief moment of glory was probably the most amusing. Good soundtrack.The not so good:
Pacing was okay, but the movie is overly long with a few slow spots. Writing was mediocre at best, probably want to avoid writing at a 5th grade humor level for a movie with a hard R rating.Overall it was okay and we already had HBOMAX so it was free. Not one I would recommend paying for but not a bad choice to kill a couple hours.",The Suicide Squad
341,blackoutH,Deadpool gone wrong,3,6 September 2021,"It seems DC have a troubled relationship with cinema.. I read one comment about this movie that I believe sums it up perfectly: this seems to have been made by a movie student fresh out of college with a huge budget to spend.I have no clue why this movie has such high praise, this feels like a teenager flick, a failed attempt at comedy with some gore and violence, they brought some good actors to give it some credibility, a small political statement so that it doesn't look so bad and the end result is this...
The story is laughable and the plot is over used, the comedy is based on over the top violence, maybe it works for some people, personally it feels boring and unnecessary, they try so hard to make the kid jokes work I felt constant cringe with the actors delivering it..Zero connection with any of the characters, it seems like the movie was made with absolutely no care for the story, it's just a dumb storyline that heavily relies on the jokes and the violence you are basically watching a freak show, what's the point of making it a ""super hero"" story, this is pretty much a Scary Movie type of thing.It feels like they tried to make a mix of Guardians of the Galaxy with Deadpool and it just failed, simple as that - I am surprised with why the A list actors agreed to this, how James Gunn messed this up so bad after such a good previous work on Marvel and why the high scores? DC needs to get a grip, their movies are so inconsistent..",The Suicide Squad

343,Wirxaw,Yet another DC reboot...,5,11 August 2021,"In fact... I can't really say that it's better than the original... which I personally didn't dislike as much as some. Because it had a few things that probably shouldn't be mentioned on IMDB. And some soul. And some coherency. Yeah, imagine that. And it had much better action. Like damn, it really says something about the regress of DCU when you find positive memories about some of their worst movies after watching their reboots. Yes, the Josstice League was better than the Snyder Cut, as far as actually making a coherent and enjoyable 2 hour flick goes. And so was the original Suicide Squad... better in some ways than this... Pfft, I don't know. It's like a Deadpool 3, but without any substance. You can't really latch onto anything. Except for the jokes about american war crimes, their... N-word(the four letter one) foreign policy and the punchline of restoring democracy.The movie goes for almost two hours and, damn, you really feel those two hours. It starts nowhere, it has no build-up, no development, because... I guess it's assumed that everyone has watched the original and we don't need to kill Batman's parents for the hundredth time, figuratively speaking. In fact, the opening part of the movie is literally a waste of time. Instead of at least trying to build up the story, they just give you trailer material right away as if you had ADD and needed to quickly be occupied with action, if you could call it that.And, speaking of democracy - that plot line is totally worthless. Just a punchline for a joke. And Alice Braga's character is... well, rather insulting. Why was it included? The democracy fighters really, ""really"" have no impact on the plot. It's like... a mandatory backdrop to rather... like I said - criminal foreign policy activities that are being conducted. Except for these crimes are turned into a joke. And I won't even mention John Cena's character.I can't deny that the core of the actors did their job, because... well, they're actors. Robbie, Elba, Davis - they did their best to outdo Ryan Reynolds. But even 3v1 this is a lost battle, come on guys. The antagonists were not even joke-worthy. I suppose I have to commend Daniela Melchior, she was cute af. So cute that Robbie felt rather... plain in comparison. I have said it about the trailer and I do not stand corrected - Robbie has exhausted herself as Harley Queen. She is a good actress, and she can portray HQ, but... Let's be honest here, if you want to watch movies for Robbie - go zip your pants and drink some water. At least the King Shark was fun, Gunn employed yet another stale celebrity to voice a dumb character for meme value. And he's good at that, no complaints. Oh and David Dastmalchian really shined here. He looked and felt like he... actually had to play a part in this movie. Ew.Finally - I'd like to talk about the action. It's terrible. It's actually surprisingly terrible. Remember how you were cringing at the opening helicopter nonsense from the original Suicide Squad? Well, prepare to cringe for almost two hours, because... Either the action is joke for the sake joke, or it's a slapstick homage to better movies. I don't mind joke action, but it has to be about the characters. And, ironically, only the secondary characters had any form of relevant action. Now, some might say that ""Robbie killed"" in this one, but I will repeat what I said before. And I would like to remind people that she is supposed to wield a hammer. She is not John Wick. She is not John Rambo. She's agile, useless and good with a hammer. That's it. Making her a Mary Sue doesn't mean that she good. It means, again, that the writers didn't know what to do with her. Again, if not for the secondary characters, I'd dare say that this movie had PG13 violence.So... it's a bad attempt at Deadpool, a bad attempt at fixing Suicide Squad and it has politics. It starts nowhere... and goes nowhere. That's DCU for you...",The Suicide Squad
344,a_sad_cow,Haphazard but fun,6,23 August 2021,"The two most fun to watch were John Cena and Viola Davis. Cena's just got this presence that brings a certain comedy and...surrealness? I found myself eager to see what he'd do next.Viola Davis is easily the best Amanda Waller we've ever seen. All the intensity, pragmatism, and utter devotion to her cause. Perfection.There was an underlying ethical line that revealed itself at the clutch point of the movie. It might've been too subtly hinted at throughout the movie, but it did bring a nice sense of closure at the end.Outside of that it just seemed like a lot of shock value. Character does comic book thing that is usually survivable, but dies this time. Check times one thousand. A couple instances were fun, but most came off as lazy.Bad guy was again incredibly contrived. We could've had Lex Luthor, Vandal Savage, any member of the Justice League.... Superheroes are in part judged by how compelling of a villain they rise against. When that villain is this abstract, it's really rough to show ethical development.",The Suicide Squad

Margo Robbie steals the show yet again as the one and only Harley Quinn, but this time around she's much more mature, developed, and brutal. You really get to see what she's made of and how tough she really is.But Margo is not the only one adds to this films greatness, Idris Elba plays and excellent Bloodsport, adding a real sense of purpose and reality to the story. And who could forget John Cenas 'Peacemaker', what an awesome job he did of adding the dark comedy and unexpected shock and twist to the movie.And let's not forget the heart of the film, Daniela Melchior aka Ratcatcher 2. She really balances the team out, being what see as the real ""heart"" of the team.

Director James Gunn pulls off a dark, witty, action packed superhero movie to please fans of the comic books and gives the DC universe a much needed hit after the disappointment of the first attempt of bringing these characters to life with Suicide Squad (2016).Having scored success for Marvel with Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) Gunn was an obvious choice to do justice to this ensemble piece. It's imaginative, creative, bold and fun and Gunn doesn't hold back on anything, seemingly given free rein to give fans what they want. There's plenty of crazy stuff going on with killing sprees, blood letting, violence and dark humour to please adult audiences.Margot Robbie shines as Harley Quinn as does all of the cast, and despite all the action, gory moments and thrills, it's also got plenty of heart and Gunn makes these superheroes three dimensional to make us care about them and their plight.It's a summer blockbuster that really delivers and his choice of music are at times inspired, surprisingly effective and not what you'd expect. There's not a dull moment to be had and James Gunn is to be applauded for producing a spectacular balls out bonkers badass action movie that brings the Suicide Squad well and truly back on track.",The Suicide Squad

Some great talent given horrific dialogue, horribly choreographed action, and just a lot of mistakes all around.This movie is a complete 180 from that train wreck.The actors do a wonderful job. Great performances all around. And the dialogue and banter is simply wonderful. Yes, it's idiotic, often absurd, but that's the point. This really gave us that off the wall lunacy that you would expect from a bunch of messed up villains trying to play at being heroes. There are some wonderful moments that are gut bustingly funny, as well as some honest touching moments.The action scenes in this one are great. Vast improvement from the blurry, cut filled, jumbled mess they did before. The action is intense and gory and over the top. It feels like a superhero... or villain... movie should do.The special effects are also top notch.

353,chris-h-3,Another formulaic superhero action film with some terrific performances.,5,9 August 2021,"My heart sank when the film opened to the Johnny Cash song, not another movie full of classic songs attempting to give some gravitas to a series of bland video montage action scenes I thought.Well, yes, it is just that. It unoriginal, lacks any kind of character development, is slightly cruel in tone and lurches from one action set piece to some uncomfortable but necessary plot exposition and then to the next action sequence. That all said the dialogue is well above average and the performances by all the lead actors are terrific, worthy of a better film.Its not a bad film at all, and so much more involving that the first, but you do feel you've seen it all before. And it just gets dull after a while. I found myself getting bored at times, I'm not sure why but I think its because you just don't care about anything in the film, nothing or nobody it in matters, everyone is replaceable at any time.I also thought that in some of the action scenes it was hard to track what was going on, lucky we get so many time line flashbacks!Overall I kind of enjoyed it for the performances but I do think this kind of movie has been done to death now and really wish they would try to make more original films rather than these identikit franchise movies.",The Suicide Squad
354,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,Wild and crazy,7,27 August 2021,"Gunn directing The Suicide Squad was somewhat a dream come true for DC fans all around especially after seeing what he did with the Guardians of the Galaxy. His signature style is noticeable almost instantaneously as well as a lack of any kind of studio intervention (I guess they learned after ZS's Justice League).This flick is violent but entertainingly violent. The violence is not there to shock but to amuse. It is incredibly cartoon-like. This flick is dark but still never up to a point that it has to be taken seriously. It is bloated but never bloated that it feels overstuffed. Gunn managed to pull of just the right amount of dosing of everything he wanted and what he audience requested.Even though the movie has a stunning idea and serves as much as a sequel as a reboot, and certain narrative decisions will not be everyone's cup of tea, The Suicide Squad aims to be as ludicrous , entertaining and flamboyant as possible. And in that department it actually succeeds.The star cast is phenomenal and all praise has to go to Elba (even though it is painfully visible that the role was written for Smith and Deadshot), Cena, Dastmalchian and Melchior for bringing the heart and soul of this movie to life. Other members, most notably the old squad are decent in their respective roles but Robie steals the scenes again without any remorse whatsoever. Kinnaman was much more likable and entertaining as Flag but the departure from his original portrayal was a bit too distant and should/could have had more connections with the original version.On the other hand, the narrative is all over the place. It is incoherent, crazy, jumps from one segment to the next, sometimes is even hard to follow, and the editing was sometimes incredibly rough. But all of this, interestingly, didn't harm the movie as it contributed to the overall lunacy that this movie actually is. Could a bit more cohesive story and less twists provide a much more stable and coherent narrative? Yes. Was it recommendable? Yes. Would it have made a better movie? We don't know. Unfortunately, the movie should not be watched as a single story-line with a cohesive narrative, but should be approached as a theme-park roller-coaster that should be admired for it's really stylish and visual attractiveness. Henceforth, if you are looking for a simple and straightforward story, avoid this as much as you can.Musically speaking, this was a complete and utter disappointment. There are interesting catchy tunes but none of them are pushed to their limits nor are they developed enough. There are no main tunes to be found nor character themes, which is a shame. Also, the lack of the original Ayer suicide squad theme is just criminal.The Suicide Squad clearly was Gunn's project with no restrictions from anyone anywhere and it actually functions as a decent and entertaining movie. The cast was solid and the entertainment value is high. However, it lacks the one segment that makes DC movies important and that is the primary question of what makes us human. It is an interesting addition to the DCEU but overall is not something that should be heralded as a masterpiece. Its good, better than the Ayer flick, but not even near the ranks of Aquaman, ZS's Justice League or Wonder Woman.",The Suicide Squad

Its too bad they killed most of them because they would be fun in a sequel. When they mistakenly killed all of the freedom fighters, I thought it was hilarious. But the climatic battle was unoriginal and showed shades of the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man. The Harley Quinn character is old. John Cena and Idris Elba carried the rest of the cast. Kinneman was okay. James Gunn movies are fun, but he needs a spark of originality or he's in danger of becoming cliche. It felt a bit too much like Guardians at times.",The Suicide Squad

Idris Elba and John Cena have very good chemistry as rivals. Margot Robbie is excellent again as Harley Quinn, a shame they didn't have Gunn direct Birds of Prey.The movie shines at what it is, a comic book movie. No great political statements being made. We didn't have to put up with anyone's virtue signalling in the run up to release. A movie with a cast and crew that knew what their job was, to entertain, and hit the mark. Too bad Marvel forgot how to do this. Hopefully now that DC remembered with their last couple of releases they won't forget as well.",The Suicide Squad
360,drahulrajjsd,The Best R-Rated DC Movie In My Opinion!!!,10,6 August 2021,"I have seen a lot of awesome movies this year, but so far, my No. 1 film of the year is James Gunn's The Suicide Squad, the sequel to David Ayer's film with Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney and Viola Davis reprising their roles as Harley Quinn, Rick Flag, Boomerang and Amanda Waller. It's a non-stop ultra-violent superhero action film filled with great actors bringing these dark characters to life, tons of gore, lots of fun and dark humor, amazing cinematography, realistic CGI and special effects with a badass soundtrack. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker and David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man are some of the best characters and the highlights of this movie. Also Sylvester Stallone's King Shark, Michael Rooker's Savant, Nathan Fillion's TDK and Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 are awesome. Overall great performances from the entire cast and hats off to James Gunn for making the best R-Rated DC movie in my opinion. Love this movie so much and it's a hundred times better than the first one. Really hope to see another sequel and it definitely has to be made by the one and only James Gunn!!!",The Suicide Squad

365,severindringel,All over the place and a pleasent surprise,8,17 August 2021,"DC has dared to do what Marvel would never dare in this lifetime: creative freedom for the director of one of their films. James Gunn has fully drawn from this given freedom and completely turned the Suicide Squad franchise on its head. After the utterly failed predecessor, The Suicide Squad is a true comic book spectacle that comes with facets we've never seen before in a superhero movie. We are taken on this wild ride by twelve criminals who are supposed to save the world.Only three characters from the first film made it into the sequel. First and foremost is Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie. Known as one of the few bright spots of the first part, she plays a very big role here and probably gets the most screentime as an individual character. Because of Robbie's charisma and the irresistible craziness of Harley Quinn, it's mostly entertaining, though her story doesn't really work, especially in the middle of the film. For that, it seems too forced to give Harley her own storyline by any means. That this endeavor fails is due to the fact that the rest of the cast harmonizes fantastically among themselves. John Cena is tailor-made for the role of the Peacemaker, although I would have liked to see more action and character study from him. Others get enough of that. For example Idris Elba as the grumpy Bloodsport, who gains a lot of interest through Elba's usual coolness and intensity. His constant quarrel with the Peacemaker also provides a laugh or two, as well as probably the most exciting relationship in the film. The characters that leave the film as absolute audience favorites, however, are others. For one, the King Shark, who always seems a bit out of place throughout the film and is only directly involved in the action, but simply brings out hilarious and even unexpectedly sentimental moments. Furthermore, there is Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher, even if it has to be said with her that it is rather the sugar-sweet rats that inspire here and less the background story pushed in. Viola Davis is as always unsympathetically brilliant as the slightly evil string-puller behind the mission, Amanda Waller.It's guaranteed to say that you'll have great fun with The Suicide Squad. At least if you don't pay attention to logic holes or other realism stuff. Movies of this genre aren't suitable for that anyway, and this one certainly isn't. Because actually James Gunn has created a work that is all over the place for over two hours. Constant changes of location, infiltration of arbitrary stories and a main plot that completely breaks the simplicity of this film and can not be understood at all. The FSK16 of the film is almost a farce because of the numerous bloodthirsty scenes. The script does have its weaknesses, which is especially evident in the dialogues with completely unnecessary lines. Some side stories are simply not appealing. May not sound too positive now, but somehow this arbitrariness has its own charm. AND: Gunn clearly had fun with the production of The Suicide Squad. And so did I. And that's the main thing.",The Suicide Squad
366,verminhater,Tries to be a cartoon but without the animation,4,7 August 2021,"It's a comedy without humour.Absolutely everything is disposable, from the characters to the plot. There is nothing that this movie takes seriously and that absolutely includes the viewer. I did not like it one bit. The entire film looked like a parody of itself but without the comedy. It took nothing seriously yet failed to produce any laughs. This whole mess would have been better served as an animated feature as the actors simply couldn't make sense of it and therefore this viewer couldn't either.Ignore this quasi-parody and instead go for the full on animated effort that is the Harley Quinn cartoon series. At least the writers there can tell a joke and no actors are harmed in the production.It gets a 4 because Margot Robbie is a great Harley.

Aside from the goofiness, this feels like the Snyder cut of the Justice League in quality of storytelling and quality. The movie is just fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. With DC's (mostly) standalone movie universe, the characters and a the movie actually get a chance to shine. To contrast, the last funny Marvel movie was Thor Ragnarök which was one of Marvel's better but still relies on Marvel connections like the Hulk to enhance it. This felt akin to Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy movies which are among Marvels best and (the mainline movies at least) don't rely on the Marvel Universe and its supporting characters to make the viewers interesting. Each of the main players on the Suicide Squad were good and interesting additions to the team, with special props going to John Cena's Peacemaker who was good for a few laughs. All around a very solid superhero with the main knock being that it is probably a little too goofy, and one of the better DC movies.",The Suicide Squad

This film is one of if not the best DCEU films to date. However this film does rely on your limits and can cross a line so just make sure you know what you're getting into before you watch it. James Gunn does a great job directing and the whole cast do an amazing job. It's quick paced, it has a good plot it does however drag on a bit in the middle.

Mostly though, the action was fantastic, the characters were likeable and the comedy was on point. The movie never drags and the way the story plays back and forth from past to present was a nice touch.

378,FilmChamp20,Just wasn't that good.,5,6 August 2021,"I don't have anything outright that bothered so much so to rate it like a one, but the movie just wasn't very good.It was shot well, good acting on most parts. The action was definitely cool. Just nothing landed for me. Felt like a carnival ride. Not quite the amusement park ride a marvel film is, but the more affordable carnival type ride. Was that a lame joke? Well it's in spirit of the movie because the jokes don't do very well or there's too many of them that fall flat. I watched this movie without a single expression change in my face. It's not terrible and it's definitely not good.I found myself not really caring about the characters. Like at all. Besides the pet rat, I was vigilant on watching him praying he didn't die in the movie. Did he? You'll have to watch and find out. The only other character who looked cool was Bloodsport, he should have his own movie or something. I'd like to see more of him. However, Idris Elba wasn't enough to save the movie. The movie felt too corny, too dependent on dumb humor or one liners, and too try hard with the R rating. Harley was overused in this and was clearly Gunn's selling point and eye candy for the movie (just look at who's number one in the top billed cast). She almost could and almost pretty much did the objectives on her own, with help from Rat Catcher 2. Those are the only two that were actually needed to win, according to how the movie went. Everyone else was just there for our entertainment and for us to ooo and possibly ahh at. But the only two people who actually made any sort of difference in the movie were, of course DC's most favorite last resort, Harley Quinn, and Rat Catcher 2. I feel bad for Margot Robbie, her Harley deserves a good Batman and Joker movie.Of course you have your typical America is the real villain all along, the political tyrant (Waller) is bested by the average desk worker, and a not so good nod to Covid with the banter of covering your mouth when coughing. It's not offensive, it's just very boring, banal, and tiresome. These things, however, are no where near the issue of the movie. Just they didn't help and they weren't used more intelligently or humorously.In conclusion, the movie just wasn't anything to fan about. Just a pretty spectacle to flash in front of your eyes and then forget about in a day or so. It was for entertainment and to show off CGI and movie effects. Nod to a couple of characters in the comics and point at the screen going ""oh hey it's *insert actor/actress*!""The previous suicide squad wasn't a good movie either, but at least I felt something for the characters and it had a more comic book type feel. Superhero movies today need to stop over seasoning the movies with humor/one liners. It's like at least 80% of the dialogue. It's okay to have more serious and developing dialogue in the movie making recipe for comic book movies. Not every single character and scene need a joke.I hope you enjoy it more than I did. I was excited for it, but like I predicted, it just wasn't anything note worthy.",The Suicide Squad

381,bodhi-13262,A BloodSport of a GOOD Time!,8,9 August 2021,"With writer/director James Gunn at the helm this time around to reboot the critically panned 2016 film, 'The Suicide Squad' manages to encapsulate and deliver far beyond what the first film failed to do.1. Idris Elba (BloodSport) and John Cena (Peacemaker) absolutely steal the show above all the other villains in the film. Said characters have the most screen time and are absolutely hilarious whenever they interact with each other. Fan favorite Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) does have her moments to shine but ultimately takes a back seat in terms of the craziness one would expect from her. Robbie is still perfectly fine as the character but just not as dynamic as the other leads.2. The other supporting headliners of the film includes Polkadot Man (David Dastmalchian), Rat Catcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) and King Shark (Sylvester Stallone). There is a reason I failed to mention the rest of the cast, but if you've seen the film......you know exactly why😉. Each aforementioned character is given their time to shine and are written well enough to where you actually care about their respective well-beings when the stakes get high.3. The comedy is executed much better this time around and there are genuine laughs to be had. However, some running jokes land flat and are outright unnecessary at points (i.e. Polkadot Man's ""Mom"" joke). Other times it feels like the film could have been trimmed a bit as there are some forced scenes just to give certain characters extra screen time (i.e. King Shark and the aquarium of strange creatures/Harley Quinn's brief romance).4. By now (if you saw all the trailers) we all know that Starro the Conqueror is the main antagonist who makes his appearance during the climax. I personally enjoyed the last sequence in parts but was expecting a more grandiose/hyped finale given the fun yet bloody tone set in the first two acts. However, Starro (despite having minimal screen time and no dialogue) is leagues better compared to what they did with the Enchantress in the first film.'The Suicide Squad' is a fun and exciting blockbuster that I personally was dying to see again after it was over. Chances are we won't get another sequel for a while but I certainly want to see more of this villain-focused world expanded in the DCEU. All credit to James Gunn as he was certainly the right man for the job in fixing what was previously broken.",The Suicide Squad

383,Bek204,THIS IS HOW A SUICIDE SQUAD FILM SHOULD BE,8,7 August 2021,"Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008's Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are hiding with the characters, stories, and films, and how to do right, and that's why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruing this beautiful universe that's filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC chose James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you're not familiar with, he directed Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder's) that when having the right person/people behind a film, he/she will kill it. And THIS IS HOW ""The SUICIDE SQUAD"" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that's all thanks to James Gunn.So happy that the film got an R rating because the suicide squad story should be like that. It should be full of blood, comedy, craziness, violence, disgusting action scenes, and curse words. Thank god they didn't care about the film being PG 13+ or whatever so more people could see it. And I feel like James Gunn was behind that part. It's not a suicide squad film if there were no sexual, bloody, violent, and disgusting content.The cinematography was beyond amazing and the film presented some new ideas. Like, in one scene (dw no spoilers) two characters were fighting and we were seeing it through the reflection of a helmet. Or in a specific fight scene, instead of ""blood"" coming out of the bodies, it was ""flowers"" which made the 3 or 5 min scene very colorful and fun to watch. The camera movements were also great and felt they sometimes were steady handheld which was so unique. Also loved how the film picks slow motion in certain times only to show the chaos that's happening around and they were very limited which is a good thing.For the third time, Margot Robbie proves that she is the best portrayal of Harley Quinn and I cannot imagine anyone other than her as Harley Quinn. She presents the beauty, craziness, and wildness of the character. Idris Alba really surprised me. His character was very well written and Idris played it so right. The real surprise was John Cena. Personally, I don't like Cena's acting. But, in this film his acting was alright and the thing that helped him is how hood his character (Peacemaker) is written. Especially that Peacemaker has a huge impact on the story of the film and the future of DCEU. Daniela Melchior gave the film such a warm/soft vibe and her acting was well done especially in the emotional scenes. The whole cast was just amazing and each actor/actress played their role perfectly.Really loved the music in the film. And if you have seen Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) you'd know that it has the same style/vibe. The costumes were brilliant and loved how James kept the original costume of each character from the comics which made the film/character even more special & real. Also, loved how the film jumps back in time suddenly to explain where a specific character is or how things ended up that way and there was something different about it which I can't tell what it is.My rating is 8/10

It was weird, it has scenes that were so strange and uncomfortable I didn't know what to do with myself. And I get that that's the point of the Suicide Squad. They're all a whacky, incompetent band of misfits. But I'm not sure that that translates well for me on screen. Even with James Gunn's excellent work and some solid performances by Margot, Idris, John, and Viola it still feels... Too kooky.It might be that it's just not for me. I'm not the audience it's meant to appeal to. Maybe no matter how much they ramp up the violence, the action, the swearing, or the special effects, SS will never be my cup of tea.

""Suarez killed my family"", second after the suicide squad wipped her entire camp, ""we saved the city"",momemt after killing half of population and destroying the whole city, and for 120 minutes we were waiting for an epic battle to happen, not for the most dangerous moster die by some rats.Overall the movie was good but nothing close to marvel infinity war or endgame.",The Suicide Squad

Margot Robbie is the only one who appears to enjoy her small part in this truly unrealistic over 2 hour killing spree. I fast forward this, tired of senseless graphic brutal murders by films own defining freaks or serial sociopaths that ""save the world"" by gleefully kill because they all enjoy murders without any morality.Notice all bad movies that need to make $$ get plethora ratings of 10 here, but Marvel classics like X- men 1st trilogy, or recent Logan, & John Wick 1&2 receive much lower scores due to millions having already paid to enjoy good films, thus fulfilling profit goals.This film creates susceptible youngsters into sociopaths, proven that those on the edge are greatly influenced by violent garbage films like this.

The 2016 film is unwatchable, all the characters in the film are terrible, even Will Smith was hard to watch, all except for Margot Robbie as Harley, regardless it was unredeemable. This movie takes nothing from the other one, except for a few faces that had big roles, and makes it better in every conceivable way, the humor and graphic violence, the interaction between characters, just brilliant. John Cena is my favorite part of the movie as Peacemaker, excellently cast and he's freaking hilarious, I also loved Margot Robbie retuning as Harley, and Joel Kinnaman who was way more enjoyable this time around as Rick Flag, even Idris Elba as Bloodshot was awesome, And King Shark, he looked amazing.

But after hearing James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) was directing it I was intrigued. There's so many ways this movie is better than the first. It's comical, you end up caring for the characters, the film progression and development flows great, it's just all around a great movie.Also, no one can make animal characters like Gunn either (I.e Groot and Rocket the Raccoon). They always seem to steal the show in every scene they're in. King Shark is that character in this film. Every scene he's in is amazing.Overall, great film.

420,craigthomas90,Better than the 1st ok..good as a stand alone...NO!,5,7 August 2021,"This movie is unethusiac. I was hoping it would be a rated R, Earth bound Guardians of The Galaxy but, it does not come close. It lacks suspense; you really don't care for the characters(even the limited amount that have returned). Amanda Waller, who is the most compelling character and played by Viola Davis(an excellent actor) is barely seen. Idris is no Will Smith! His character is a watered down version of Deadshot called Bloodsport(A watered down version of Marvel comics Bullseye). Margot Robie's Harly Quinn, is stale at this point. She is phoning it in. A crazy woman somehow has developed the skills to take down a Battalion of armed guys without getting shot once? Batman couldn't have pulled that one off. I would love an explanation as to what happened to the original Suicide Squad. There are some gory aspects that are pretty bloody with solid CGI. With that said, some movies, most movies, do NOT benefit from sequels; this statement holds true. Thank you HBO for allowing me to stream these movies without having to pay theater prices and risk my health potentially. I enjoyed the original more. I'll give this movie 5/10. It's flat out boring with zero rewatchablity.",The Suicide Squad
421,wgeddings,Definitely better DC movie,7,7 August 2021,"First, I love comic books and comic book movies. Most DC movies have disappointed me (when Zack Snyder does them) by changing characters badly or having people in dark outfits fight in dark rooms. Thankfully this movie avoids both and is fun. Not unbelievable fun but good enough. Viola Davis is incredible! She does the perfect Amanda Waller. Bloodsport and Peacemaker have great chemistry and work well together. Almost all of the characters work really well but it is hard to beat King Shark since any scene he is involved in seems to be stolen by him. I felt Harley was just in it to pander to people but she does become an important part of the movie adding the right amount of crazy (like in previews where she tells a captive ""and if you have personalized license plates, you die"" while Bloodsport is trying to threaten the captive).I wish we got more of several characters but there are none I wish we had less of for the most part. It is worth seeing.",The Suicide Squad
422,yoyopa,Underwhelming. I Blame Marketing.,6,12 August 2021,"I can't tell if THE Suicide Squad is a better movie than SUICIDE Squad or merely different. The best parts of the film... and I mean ALL of the best and would have been I suppose eye popping moments were all seen in the legion of promos prior to release. So much so that I felt like I had already seen the movie several times.With regards to the first SS - I love David Ayer. His gritty, dark, LA crime world style is right up my alley and at the time very in line with Snyder's vision. The first film should've been awesome if not for a meddling bunch of executives. However, I absolutely cannot stand Will Smith. I was bummed as soon as I heard of his casting bc I knew that Smith is a 90's era mega star. He doesn't share... even in an ensemble piece. Which means the film would mostly focus on him and a boring b-plot(his daughter). Unfortunately I was right.With all of that said, I like Gunn. I'm not a super fan by any means but I think it takes a bold director and real creative vision to make movies like Guardians of the Galaxy as fun as they were/are. I appreciated what he did with this film... didn't love it but I appreciated it bc the entire film had creativity, vision, personality. That's rare these days, esp on the Marvel side where it seems to be ""enter any director/showrunner here"" they're selling lunchboxes not cinema.I saw James Gunn in this film. This is why I love Zack Snyder's work in the dceu... his films were HIS. A realistic Superman, a Batman that went off the rails and kills, a truly awesome Wonder Woman with a sword who carries the heads of her enemies and chops off Steppenwolf's!!! These Fellows Have Some Soul!Gunn, Snyder, and Ayer are not directors to hire when you want to make a film by committee! With corporate suits who don't have an ounce of creativity in them!Pros: Idris Elba, one of my favorite actors working today. I'm a huge fan and it was joy seeing him do his thing here. I was so happy when it was announced he'd replace Smith.Joel Kinnaman, I'm a huge fan of his also. His work in the first season of Altered Carbon was incredible and made me want to see his other work. He's always turned in solid performances. Rick Flagg's death was actually a bummer(more on that later).And, of course Margot Robbie. She's just amazing. Plain and simple. I really don't know what else there is to do with this Harley Quinn though. The character is just not a protagonist. She doesn't work as the heart and center of a film and I'm glad Gunn and Robbie played her as a wild card outlier instead of trying to follow her every beat. I think it's time to let Quinn go and look into a more rounded out character for Robbie. The woman can do anything.Daniela Melchior(Ratcatcher 2): Thought she was great. I love when Hollywood tries to make some of the most unbelievably beautiful women in the world look bummy. Melchior is so beautiful that even wearing dirty rags and rats crawling on her she still had me swooning every time she was on screen. And when she kept falling asleep hahahaa that me.Cons: John Cena. I'm so tired of Hollywood trying to make this guy a star. The industry is trying to force Cena on us the same way they keep forcing Kristen Stewart on us. This dude is in everything. Every giant tentpole that doesn't already star The Rock, Cena is right there. And he sucks. Stop Already. I will say, probably the best moment of the entire film was Elba shooting this fool through his throat... man that was nice.Amanda Waller: Viola Davis is one of the greatest actresses of this generation and Waller gives her next to nothing to do. She's great in the role no doubt. Plays her to perfection... so much so that I realize every time Davis is on screen the entire film could be centered around her and it might be alot better.Someone needs to explain to me who exactly the villain was in this movie bc I still don't know. Was it Waller, Thinker, Peacemaker? Couldn't have been Starro! When Starro died I actually felt sadness. Especially at his last line. This thing was an alien literally just floating through space looking at the stars and had no aim to hurt anyone when HUMANS. Starro was literally an abused animal that escaped its cage and that sucks.Lastly, I think killing off Flagg was a bad play. Kinnaman managed to do more with the character this time around. I wanted to know more about him, his background, and to see where he could go in future films. I was rooting for him. He and Quinn seemed to be getting closer and it could've been interesting to explore a friendship/relationship with such opposites. Instead we're getting a Cena Peacemaker series...All in all, The Suicide Squad was fine. I don't why the industry seems surprised it didn't do bigger numbers. Listen, before COVID, movie theaters were a dying beast. Who the hell wants to watch a movie with a 150 strangers, some with kids, getting up during the best parts to go to the bathroom, coughing, sneezing, talking! Phones ringing etc! When you could watch in the privacy of your own home?Now add in the element of a pandemic plus you're releasing it online anyway?!? Why in the hell would you expect anyone to see this in theaters?! The movie wasn't great. Not really memorable. I don't expect anyone to be clamouring for another... but I did appreciate it and maybe next time tell Marketing not to give away the best parts a year before the movie is released!",The Suicide Squad

It could have been cooler - but it was enjoyable!",The Suicide Squad
424,iamianiman,The Dumbest Squad Just Made the Greatest DCEU Film EVAHHH!!!,8,6 August 2021,"Remember when James Gunn was 'temporarily' fired by Marvel Studios and we were all disappointed by the decision? Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!The most outstanding thing about this latest squad is the way they blend and mix in everything into the recipe. It's like you're watching a bunch of genres; comedy, dark comedy, fantasy, action, thriller, drama, superhero, spoof and commentaries; political, social contexts, world revolving issues all together and yet, it tastes très bon! Often enough, movies that try to do everything together fail big time but not this one. This is a cinematic achievement.James Gunn, who also directed Guardians of the Galaxy, knew that the Marvel/DC films have rehashed their materials multiple times; basic origin, romance, giving up, final battle. Hence, Gunn develops a non-formulaic approach that seems suicidal at first but triumphantly creates something unique and unpredictable. From the get-go, Gunn's vision is unconventional but polished, enough to make the audience feels they have never seen anything like it before.Talking about unpredictability, it indeed is what it is. You never know what will come next, who will die or survive. There are a few times that Gunn uses the head fake technique to deceive viewers from its sequential but engaging storytelling. Like Deadpool, something unexpected happens at the moment when you least expect it.The juxtaposition of both the 2016's and 2021's is evidently visible. While 2016 has its moments, almost everyone could agree it was disappointingly bland af. The 2021 entry has a strong direction and far better pacing, let alone twists that are fully captivating. The only couple of things that 2016 did it better were the trailers and the soundtrack.The Rated-R is straight up hardcore to the face. It's superbly gory, darkly comical and unabashedly funny, all without pulling its punches. This is how DC films should be, not as dour as Zack Snyder's but not as light as Marvel's either.When it comes to flaws, albeit its powerful opening scene, I feel that they waste many of the potential characters here insofar some of them never even got the chance to show their abilities, skills, talents or superpowers.I am also not impressed by the intensity of the movie's brightness particularly on the background in some scorching white scenes. It defaces the texture of the film and should dazzle some viewers, left distorting of what could have been an iconic scene like the slo-mo segment.All in all, 2021's The Suicide Squad makes for a suicidal task with flamboyantly sheer colourful characters that collectively sign up for one thing amidst this pandemic chaos; blasting out loud the volume of fun and violence, subsequently climbing to the top as the best DCEU Film ever made.",The Suicide Squad
425,piggulu,Okay I guess,7,7 August 2021,"To say it's better than the other one is an understatement, this one cranks everything up from a more interesting mission with higher stakes to the gory bodycount. But when I saw the Snyder name pop up in the intro, my expectations sank a little, especially coming off of Army of the Dead. Seemed like my fears were rightfully realized when all was said and done.What holds it back is a lot of cheesy, inorganic humor and a fairly underwhelming big bad and final showdown. In the early scenes of the helicopter ride toward the team's objective, we see Davidson's character struggle to attach a standard seatbelt. Is that really supposed to be a cool joke? Later we get introduced to Ratcatcher sleeping in bed and unwilling to get up when summoned. ""Millenials,"" Cena quips. Hilarious, right? There's a few more of those where that came from. There's also the many time jumps that interrupt the flow.Then there's the end boss, which is too campy/cartoony (both in style and substance) and uninteresting for the tone of the movie, which ranges from sarcastic to serious. It might fit in the comic book universe and those fans might get a kick out of it, but it didn't jive with a layperson like me. Almost ""Galactus"" as a pink cloud kind of thing.Overall, I found it to be a ""one and done"" kind of deal. Not terrible but nothing that floored me to be craving another viewing in the near or far future. James Gunn's name gets broadcasted for ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but I felt this was the opposite of that franchise with all the wrong ideas.",The Suicide Squad

Harley Quinn is a close second. Who knew that Starfy would be the villain, I guess he wanted revenge since Nintendo hasn't made a new Starfy game in years. I love King Shark he is awesome! The Harley Quinn scenes were the best scenes in the movie. Some of the action was really cool. I also like the character Javlin but he died like right away. Bloodsport was a good character too. The Polka-Dot man is ok but I kind of like him. I also like how the movie is directed. Besides that this movie isn't great the villain, which is a starfish (Starto) is terrible. I hated John Cena. I didn't like the plot very much. The Rat Lady was useless but I liked her pet rat. This movie isn't very funny. I only laughed a couple of times. The ending is stupid. This movie is just so stupid. I just didn't like most of it. The Harley Quinn scenes were great and King Shark is one of the best characters in a superhero movie ever besides that this movie kind of sucks.

432,gabriel-80,Embarrassing!,3,10 August 2021,"It is pretty obvious DC was hungry for some Marvel success, so they hired a successful Marvel director and gave him free hands. Bad idea! Gunn is in full rampage mode here and absolutely nothing works. At all. The action is noisy and tiresome, the plot is non existant, and the characters are utterly boring. Worst of all; the humor falls flat 90% of the time, being way to juvenile - which doesn't really match the excessive and gory violence throughout. There is a hint of satire buried in the mix, but it is lost in the stupid, kliché ridden plot. I was bored throughout the entire movie, and actually enjoyed David Ayers version much more. I really hope Marvel keeps Gunn on a tight leash during the making of GOTG 3.",The Suicide Squad

We see some familar squad members return, while a new collection of odd assortment of lesser known villians are selected to complement each other in the story. I do not understand why they are calling this movie as a reboot. It is a sequel or the second movie of a plan series (and there is suttle and obvious crossovers to other recent DC films too). Tip. A very brief post-credits to wait for. Yes the directing format certainly feels very different yet bridged to the first movie. And imo, I hope the next will be different feel again with someone else directing (that way each movie has a unique freshness based on the chosen squad team).",The Suicide Squad

Whoever's watching this review, put down your phone and drive to the nearest cinema to watch The Suicide Squad if you haven't already. Massive amount of bloodshed and dark humor, unexpected plot and twists, adds on to satisfying characters, storyline, and action scenes, made this film one of my favorite among other recent action movies. Without further ado, James Gunn sent the audience straight into a battle and sacrificing both Captain Boomerang and Savant (played by Yondu) in the first 30 minutes of the film, as we realize the actual protagonists successfully performing plan B. Amusements brought out by gores and gunpowder unleashes the raw and violent comedies in the original comic series instead of slicing feces people transformed by fricking kisses of Mesopotamian princess. Talk about action scenes, despite the well-planned battle with Starro, Harley Quinn has presented me one of the best and creative (personally) hallway battle dance, the idea of turning Harley's imagination into brought-to-life cartoon is just fantastic, which reminds me of the head explosion scene from Kingsman, but even better. The movie also mentioned a little of the bureaucratic schemes versus right of people, but honestly it was a little confusing that the resolution solved this major conflict in a neutral way, btw Peacemaker's villainy was quite unexpected. Two try-better-next-times I can think of is the imbalance of narration (mostly regarding Harley's faction), as well as the discard of characters (the death of Rick Flag and Cap Boomerang was quite intended in my opinion). In all, great direction, jokes, characters, and storyline.",The Suicide Squad

Writer/Director James Gunn brings relentless energy and personality to this film's core that oozes out of its every pore. From the biting wit of the script to the flashy style of the presentation, The Suicide Squad constantly captivates its viewers with stunt after stunt. Everything from the eclectic soundtrack to the quirky humor showcases what can happen when a film franchise is put into the deft hands of a seasoned pro.Meanwhile, the exquisite cast is given the perfect amount of room to play, showing off their instincts in humor, vulnerability and fire. Elba, Robbie, and Cena shine as they relish in the cunning writing. It is clear that everyone involved in this production truly enjoyed the project. The joy pops off the screen.

440,pickle-92642,"At last, The REAL Suicide Squad!",9,6 August 2021,"Finally! The DCEU has finally made their first genuinely GREAT movie! (I haven't seen Zack Snyder's Justice League yet). This is what we've been waiting for from the DCEU. I had high hopes coming into this considering all the praise it was getting, and I was not disappointed at all. This film is the most James Gunn thing I think I've ever seen. It does NOT hold back at ALL in terms of sheer absurdity and impossibly chaotic moments, which is just amazing. It is very reminiscent of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, but it wouldn't be a James Gunn flick if it wasn't. It's super funny, lively, and knows how stupid it is, which is why it works. I mean, this has to be one of the most absurd concepts/story scripts ever written. And we love it. It also has some truly great flashback/backstory moments for some of the characters (one in particular) that really give a sense of humanism to them. Not to mention some beautiful shots/cinematography throughout and some great performances that add to the supreme vibe of the movie. The first Suicide Squad movie has none of this, and remains one of my least favorite movies. I don't understand how THIS movie manages to just be so much better and less cringe than the first, just goes to show that when treated with care, ANY film can truly be great. This is the REAL Suicide Squad!",The Suicide Squad

S by stoping project 'Star Fish', in return their prison sentence is reduced by some years.Don't expect this version of the Suicide Squad to be anything like the previous. It is a stand alone film, with the return of Harley Quinn's character.An adequate yet strange plot develops into a comical action packed adventure with some cringe moments. Nevertheless, with a well put together cast, the film does an effective job in delivering an ample film. Each character is wacky enough to portray a silly product. So much so that it works.Verdict : if you like easy going, comical films, with gruesome fatalities that doesn't necessarily follow a strong plot then this is worth the watch especially for HBO Max users. Seeing it in theaters isn't necessary!",The Suicide Squad

445,Victor_Fallon,"Fun, Irritating, Entertaining and Stupid.",7,1 September 2021,"It's the epitome of a brainless popcorn flick and easy to recommend if you just want a fun couple of hours. It's vastly superior to the first Squad movie, unsurprisingly.When broken down, there really isn't very much to praise. The story is 'government conspiracy' claptrap, the humour (outside of a couple of decent visual gags) is almost entirely sarcastic and postmodern, regardless of which character's turn it is to be 'funny'. The dialogue is often mumbled in a variety of bizzare accents and difficult to make out. Peter Capaldi is dreadful as the 'villain' who looks like he got his prosthetics from ebay and has an accent that's apparently from everywhere.The soundtrack is loud, intrusive, repetitive and disrupts the flow of the movie every five minutes. The action is weak, over-choreographed and very stagey. CGI is relied upon, heavily, for absolutely everything.However, it's held together with good performances by Elba and Robbie who prop up the rest of the (average) cast. It also has a great monster that lights up the screen.The Suicide Squad is shambolic and sometimes charming, but ultimately gets it right where it counts - entertainment value.",The Suicide Squad

This coming from someone who was concerned about the ""big bad"" (seen in the trailers) but, nope - even the sight of that enemy didn't ruin anything for me.James Gunn has given us The Suicide Squad we deserved. If only they'd let him have first crack at it and we could have avoided the last pitiful attempt.PS: You don't need to see the first film to enjoy this one so my advice is - if you haven't seen the first one, just skip it and go to this.",The Suicide Squad

Hulk ripoff and they didn't even blush while copy-pasting.Harley Quinn whenever she opens her mouth. God, this movie would have been better if she was a mute.Movie being obscene from time to time.

The direction was not necessary since the actors basically were seemingly told to act like cartoon characters. Which they all did badly.Zach Snyder along with Writer / Director James Gunn should be replaced with anyone else if the studio intends to produce anything else from the DC UNIVERSE.This was boring with predictable and unnecessary violence pursuing a goal that is totally unbelievable for an organization that does not make one proud to be an American.I won't watch this mess again.",The Suicide Squad

Even the minor characters are funny. I wish they would have shown more of the Rat, but maybe next time.

458,Daviteo,Pushed too far.,2,8 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad finally did it for me. Congratulations, Hollywood. You pushed too far. I'm a middle-aged man that's not squeamish. I've seen my share of horror movies, many of which will stand the test of time as actually good works of cinema (and many that aren't). I don't get rattled by much. But The Suicide Squad pushed too far, and it wasn't necessarily because of the brutality or the violence or the absolutely disgusting show the filmmakers put on but the fact that they want to strip empathy from viewers.As I've grown up, I've read and learned about the absolute cesspool LA is. I've heard all the horror stories about newbies going out and entering a city of sharks, people who don't give up their morals get eaten and spit out. I've heard that that city is ""fun on the outside and absolutely cutthroat on the inside."" It preys on the weak and ensconces those morals on viewers. I had pushed this notion away as long as I could, but The Suicide Squad did me in. It pushed too far. It finally let me see the man behind the curtain and that man wants to peddle violence and brutality and sociopath and a revelry of cruelty. This movie encompasses all of that. It's the first film in a long time that I didn't feel right watching, possibly like watching someone kick a dog to death while trying to get you to play along.The film gets 1 star for technical competency (cinematography, stunts, etc.) and 1 star for solid acting and that's it. But in a way, I kind of thank this movie. I thank it for finally bringing to light what I've felt of the entertainment machine that is Hollywood: it's a garbage city that makes garbage products and peddles garbage ideals. Because of this movie I'm backing off from that nonsense and voting with my wallet. Life's too short to fill with this kind of junk.",The Suicide Squad

The screen isn't pitch black throughout, there's jolly good music and murder at the same moment and a very very strong cast. The movie is proof that the criticism on The Suicide Squad (2016) was marvelously handled.Idris Elba (Bloodsport), Viola Davis (Amanda Waller), and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) are wonderful, I'm even proud of John Cena (Peacemaker) and Daniela Melchoir (Ratcatcher 2). Oh and Peter Davidson plays himself, well almost. The jokes are great, the timing is better and it is violent. None of that PG-13 crap we've been getting served so much. There are so many surprise elements, it's difficult to predict what will happen and that's the best part. And I loved seeing so many characters, they deserved their screen time.I just have a minor complaint, why didn't Weasel get good CGI?

I think James Gunn has done a great job directing Guardians of the Galaxy so I had high hopes for this movie.What does it get right? The actors are great, the top final villain is suitably over the top idiotic and the visuals are mostly great.So that leaves the bad..
Writing: we expect clichés in a movie like this, but most of them feel so old and over-used that it hurts to watch and the dialogue is pretty bad too.Humour: if you laugh when people are stupid and hurt themselves then this is probably your kind of fun, but it didn't do it for me - I think I smiled once.Violence: I don't have a problem with violence in movies, but it often feels unnecessarily graphic and brutal and wants the audience to laugh at it. I didn't.Directing: This had a lot of what I call Michael Bay syndrome.. when the characters constantly survive impossible odds without any good explanation. It also uses graphics in similar ways to Bay at times that is so much clutter moving on screen that you can't really see the action.Music: I didn't like any of the music (except a Cash song). If was like they consistently chose bad songs from good artists.When you put all that together the result is a terrible movie that is only slightly better than Wonder Woman 1984 - and I hope DC never sinks lower than that stinker.",The Suicide Squad

DeadpoolDisclaimer: this film features some brutal violence, a ton of offensive jokes, foul language, and a dangerous amount of fun. Keep away from children and Christians.A hell of a comeback after the appallingly bad part one. This ""continuation"" of the first, 2016 ""Suicide Squad"" is in no way similar to it's ugly predecessor, except for a couple of reappearing characters like Harley Quinn. Part two was written and directed by James Gunn, the incomparable (despite his stupid tweets), crazy fun writer-director of both Guardians of the Galaxy films. This was the best person they could have ever possible chosen for the creation of such a movie: in short, this is just the most outrageously crazy and fun film I've watched probably since Deadpool 2 three years ago. Described by Gunn himself, the film is ""a 1970s war movie action comedy"" and is filled with uncensored, unlimited and unburdened creativity. You can just feel how first Gunn and then the whole crew were having a blast creating this hilarious gem with it's absurd, Drax-Starlord style dialogues and crazy, dumb (in a good way) action scenes. The pacing is simply perfect for such a movie, the introduction is shortened into oblivion to like 5 minutes; and we instantly get the action we came to see. The film also features cool little cameos in the faces of Sylvester Stallone (voicing King Shark), Pete Davidson, Josh Brolin, Mahershala Ali (I think?) and Taika Waititi.

Please consider my suggestion for suicide squad 2021, comedy scenes were okay for me but don't put its all throughout the movie.",The Suicide Squad
482,ed-503-465183,I guess I'm aging out of the comic book movie genre...,7,9 August 2021,"I don't enjoy them as I did 15 years ago. If you're taking the time to read user reviews, you know how these movies work.Throw in some comic book heroes, lots of action, some bad guys, and an ultimate boss character, mix in some dark humor, and make sure the good guys win. Or, in the case with the Suicide Squad, the psychotic antiheroes win. Don't take yourself too seriously and entertain your audience.This one did all that fine. I appreciate that the movie didn't try to push any social agendas or identitarian politics and instead focused on making the ride entertaining. For that, it gets an extra star.The Suicide Squad (2021) is one of the better DC comic movies I've seen. Not up there with Nolan's Dark Knight series, but not terrible like Birds of Prey. I think it was much better than the first Suicide Squad movie and put it on par with Zack Snyder's cut of Justice League.With that said, I didn't see this one in a theater. I watched it on HBOmax.",The Suicide Squad
483,Millennialprince,Now this is a Suicide Squad movie!,8,2 October 2021,"I was one of the few that didn't mind the original Suicide Squad, but I concede it has a multitude of problems. Namely, the fact that the studio got gun shy and decided to re-edited the movie with a trailer company to make it more like Guardians of the Galaxy. As a result, you got a movie that was not the sum of its parts; it felt more like an assortment of music videos than an actual movie. It's only saving grace for me was the charismatic performances of Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Fortunately, this soft reboot The Suicide Squad, is leaps and bounds better than its predecessor. For starters, it's not afraid to make these characters criminals.Sure, they have flashes of humanity here and there, but these guys are a bunch of criminals and mercenaries. The most human character is Rat-catcher 2, who throughout the movie has a bond of sorts with Bloodsport. It's not a romantic relationship per se, it's more of a surrogate father-daughter relationship which I thought was nice. It gave the movie much needed humanity in my book. Rat-catcher also gets a nice moment during the culmination of the big battle with Starro. This movie is also unpredictable . You never know who's going to die from one moment to the next.For example, Harley Quinn has a certain dalliance with a Corto Maltese President that plays not the way you think it would. It's not a perfect movie by any means. It suffers from too many characters and subplots, and there's some spotty CGI here and there, but it has a certain irreverent charm that I like in a blockbuster. This is Troma James Gunn not Disney James Gunn, so be prepared for a lot of gore and sci-fi weirdness that you wouldn't expect from a mainstream movie. I got the sense that Warner Media left James Gunn alone and allowed him to make a 185 million big budget Grindhouse movie. If it were not for the success of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, I don't think that would have happen. So count your lucky stars that a movie as audacious as this got made.",The Suicide Squad
484,opinionated-alchemist,Better but...,7,8 August 2021,"I don't get it. Sure - this Suicide Squad is better than the previous ones. It is bright, violent, crazy and surprising.However I don't get the overly positive reviews, when previous reviews were far less enthusiastic.Pacing of the film is pretty good - and while it feels reasonably long, it doesn't really become boring - this is probably to the unexpected movie deaths of side characters - even by important supportive roles.But there is one issue, which seems to be always missing in Suicide Squad: a realistic motivation. Sure, they all deem to die, when they don't follow the rules and desert and sure - there is additional pressure on some of them. But don't anyone realize that they are portrait by ""normal people"" who are just a bit more crazy?Violence is random - and just portrait absurdingly funny!My problem is this: the Suicide Squad supposed to be disturbed and sick people. People who don't have an issue to kill people. But also who might celebrate their disconnection to normal rules. There is a cool Jaguar ad around since some years: ""It's good to be bad"" - but this is missing. Again everything seems to be a joke. Also: danger seem to be a joke. If the characters would be portrait as sick and psychotic alas miss their sense of self preservation, it would be ok. But again - it seems to be a violent comedian. Club in this movie.And the boss villain is also disappointing - yes Suicide Squad tries to say, that the US government is responsible for that - and that the Starfish just intended to float in space. But it is not even clear what the starfish intended to do...
Sp yes - a good movie, which doesn't have too many technical flaws. But the movie is equally problematic and lazy, when it comes to script and character development.",The Suicide Squad

There seems to be insufficient display of some members' powers, and the focus was a bit overladen on humor. What's wrong with that? Simply the fact that some of the humor were kind of iffy, and some jokes seemed to be forced into the screen, and kinda out of place.Overall this is a great film but gore and humor were overemphasized over action and excellent dialogues.",The Suicide Squad

And that's just speaking to the plot incoherence, not even touching on every single other facet of it being unwatchable.I was skeptical. I knew it would be better. Because Warner has decided to try to turn the Suicide Squad into Guardians of the Galaxy, but they actually hired James Gunn to do it this time.If you like James Gunn's take on Guardians of the Galaxy, this is fine. I don't particularly care for those, but they (and this) is stellar compared to what the first one was.As with every single one of these DCEU (or whatever it is now) movies, it's way too long. This one could have the last 30 minutes lopped off and it would have been a more satisfying experience than the obligatory final CGI battle/cut-scene.",The Suicide Squad

491,S_dot_M_dot,The Squad is Back!!,8,9 August 2021,"Task Force X, being led by Bloodsport, Idris Elba, and accompanied by Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie, The Peacemaker, John Cena, and an array of anti-heroes, are on a mission in Corto Maltese behind enemy lines. The unit has to put their differences and egos aside in order to save themselves and the world.James Gunn was perfect choice to write and direct this version of the Squad. It had the feeling of reading a comic book; all of the time transitions, dialogue, over the top violence, and crazy set pieces. I was a little weary of the cast of characters they were putting in there but fell in love with The Peacemaker and King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. King Shark is sure to be a hit for years to come.You can tell a lot of practical effects were used throughout the runtime which I am a massive supporter of. The CGI that went along with it blended very well and all seemed to seamlessly fit together. I was also very high up on the score and song selection. It followed the pace of the film and fit the mood.I will admit the final act was a little much for me. It took away a lot of the grounded aspect of the film I was particularly fond of. One could argue more well known members of the team would have been more appealing but I think the film benefits from having a more obscure lineup. It felt like there was no clear antagonist, but each act had one and the team themselves acted as their own antagonist.This was a fun film that kept my attention. It far surpassed its predecessor and should be a good starting point for future Suicide Squad films. I am a DC fan but have not been high up on their films so this was a breathe of fresh air. It is one that I will watch multiple times and can't wait for more.",The Suicide Squad

Easily the best DC film (admittedly not a high bar), it's huge, it's silly, it's irreverent, it's what big screens are for, with surprises from start to finish. Ace!",The Suicide Squad

494,TheOnlyOwen01,Exactly what the first film should've been,10,6 September 2021,"In 2016, movie theaters were polluted by one of the absolute worst films based on a DC comic property ever. Suicide Squad (2016) is an absolute disaster in every since of the word and I don't think anyone who understands the fundamental basics of filmmaking would disagree with that so The Suicide Squad had a lot going against it.Thankfully with the help of a more talented director, lack of studio involvement, cast of mostly new (and significantly better characters) characters and a smarter script, The Suicide Squad not only joins Shazam (2019) as the only good movies about this disaster of a cinematic universe but is also one of the best comic book films in recent memory.It's a movie that is oozing with style and underneath all that is a good amount of heart similar to that of the Guardians Of The Galaxy films while the tone is more like James Gunn's previous films such as Slither (2006) and Super (2010), two movies I would highly recommend if you haven't seen them. The film is boosted by phenomenal action sequences that hold no punches back and are completely unpredictable.But what makes this movie so memorable and wonderful are the characters. Bloodsport is essentially a likable version of Deadshot who's significantly more relatable and feels more human than he has any right to be. Rick Flag is miles better here. Instead of being the boring, macho man, no nonsense character who feels like he's from Call Of Duty that he was in the first movie, he actually gets a chance to develop here and has better chemistry with the team as well as a more likable and interesting personality. It makes you wonder where was this guy in the first movie. And Joel Kinnaman gives a significantly better performance.Margot Robbie in this film is the best she's been as Harley Quinn. This is the first time I actually like this character because she feels like an actual character instead of the fan service icon she was in Birds Of Prey and Suicide Squad. She has range and is actually entertaining to watch. Polka Dot Man seems like a goofy character (which he admittedly is) and could just be a throwaway character just there to die but nope. Instead he's actually a good person at heart and is very useful in the film. King Shark has the design of a giant squeaky toy that also happens to eat people. The CGI for him was really good as well. Very appealing, very memorable and very scary when he needs to be. Peacemaker was just awesome. I used to rag on John Cena and claim he's a bad actor but here, he's actually terrific. Do more roles like this and less crap like Playing With Fire please.But my favorite character would have to be Ratcatcher 2. She's this innocent teenage cutesy girl who is really kind and is easily the heart of the film. She's instantly likable and the actress is absolutely fantastic. Without her, the script would feel so my more one dimensional but if there's anything James Gunn isn't, it's one dimensional. He manages to do what he does best with these characters: take people nobody knows and make them fan favorites among the mainstream audience.The music is also fantastic and the use of the songs fit in so much better than that ""movie""from 2016. James Gunn outdid himself here and this is easily his best film with Super being a VERY close second. Anybody who says the other DCEU movies are better, you are smoking a lot of crack. Then again, DCEU Fanboys don't know anything about film and all they care about is fanservice which is why they praise stupid garbage like Man Of Steel and Batman V Superman over gems like this.",The Suicide Squad

I can imagine the style of this being how David Ayer originally wanted his film to be. But James Gunn has done an impressive job. Throwing so much at us all at one, action, gore, comedy, drama, and it all works together perfectly. Acting is great. Margot Robbie again does a stellar performance as Harley Quinn, and all the newcomers add great moments in the film. It is worth seeing in a theatre if possible, you'll enjoy the action much more and the comedy is great with a crowd. Definitely recommend, even if your not a big comic book fan or haven't seen previous DCEU movies, it's a film that can appeal to a wide audience.",The Suicide Squad
496,JoelAlexanderr,A breath of fresh air for the superhero genre,10,22 August 2021,"When Suicide Squad (2016) was released, the whole world, including me, was eagerly anticipating what looked like a manic and colorful adventure with a stellar cast. So when it ended up being an absolute dumpster fire, it was only natural that Warner Bros. Would try to make another one. However, this time director/writer James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) is at the helm, which may be why THE SUICIDE SQUAD is everything fans could have possibly wanted and more. It not only provides the R-rated pandemonium that the first film failed to deliver upon, but it also has a devilishly hilarious sense of humor and a beating heart that invests viewers in every single character.From the very first action scene, Gunn lets fans know that the movie is entirely different from every other superhero movie. I won't give anything away, but the tone Gunn sets for this film is one of over-the-top violence, dark and borderline-offensive humor, and grand risk-taking from a story perspective. From there, the incredible cast takes us into a high-stakes (and highly unethical) adventure involving international espionage, broken hearts and aliens. Not one member of this incredible ensemble falls short, unlike the last Suicide Squad where Will Smith and Margot Robbie were the only good performances. Idris Elba is given the leading superhero role he's always deserved, and he predictably crushes it. Same with John Cena, who plays off of Elba in a manner that I could have watched for days. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is the best she has ever been in the role, managing to be funnier than ever before while maintaining the unhinged charm of the last two films. However, the real breakout performance to me was Deniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, a character who is the heart and soul of this film and has the most emotionally affecting scenes in the film.Not one plot point felt out of place to me for the entire runtime. Perhaps this is partially because the entire point of the story is the mania and madness, but I credit it to Gunn's amazing screenplay, which builds the story in a fresh, yet familiar fashion. The final fight scene is one of my personal favorites in any superhero movie due to the jaw-dropping visual effects and the high-stakes tension Gunn maintains throughout. There are times where it felt like a Godzilla movie on shrooms, and I couldn't have had any more fun watching it.THE SUICIDE SQUAD is the unhinged superhero saga fans were craving in 2016, and now that we finally have it, I couldn't be more satisfied. Other than a couple jokes that won't be for everyone, the film never misfires on any aspect of the movie that is integral to its success, which is rare to see in big-budget superhero filmmaking. THE SUICIDE SQUAD is a breath of fresh air, and I would take a ride into this world many more times with Gunn at the steering wheel.A.",The Suicide Squad
497,WhatcanyaDo,"Irreverent, Goofy, and Violent. This Movie's a Blast!",8,6 August 2021,"The first Suicide Squad was a good movie, but it made the mistake of taking it itself too seriously. The sequel takes the opposite approach and churns out a two hour, slightly humorous, non-stop action movie, a fun adventure from start to finish. It's certainly no masterpiece, but if you like bloody movies, it's hard to beat the mindless violent entertainment this movie offers. Check it out.",The Suicide Squad
498,AnAverageNerd,A vast improvement on the original,7,17 August 2021,"This version is significantly better than the first in a number of ways. Firstly, the comedy is the real star of the show and many of the jokes land throughout the film rather than being met with awkward silence. The characters are also brilliantly crafted, not realistic in the slightest, but brilliantly crafted nonetheless. Unlike the first film, the limelight is shared fairly equally between all the cast which means each character's personality is explored properly. The weakness of the film is the plot itself which is slightly too similar to the original for my personal liking. However, i feel that this isn't the focus of the movie and that the comedy and action are the key selling points. If nothing else, this version of the suicide squad is a sensational parody of itself and there are a number of self-deprecating moments throughout the film that show this. I would definitely recommend this film for the comedy if nothing else and if you go in not taking it too seriously you will definitely have a better experience.",The Suicide Squad

This movie really gets in your face, but in a good way.There are tons of nice and exquisitely cheesy, but wholesomely heartfelt character moments, that give every last one of Suicide Squaders an opportunity to shine.

Won over Ayer's vision of the movie.The Suicide Squad (2021) is way better than Suicide Squad (2016) because it has great humor,a better script,the violoence/blood scene are beautiful(kinda like Mortal Kombat)and the characters are more likable as well as better crafted by James Gunn.I loved every characters,but my favorite ones will be:Bloodsport,Rick Flag,King Shark,Harley Quinn,Ratcatcher 2,The Polka-Dot Man,but my biggest surprise was John Cena character The Peacemaker.I never thought I would say this but John Cena is made for playing Peacemaker and it proved us that it can be a great actor just like David Bautista.As for James Gunn...he' the greatest director of superhero movies,he should be allowed by both Marvel and DC to produce more films about unknown superheroes.So now...I'm waiting for The Peacemaker HBO Max show as well as seeing James Gunn making another Suicide Squad movie.Overall,The Suicide Squad is a better version than its 2016 prequel and you should see it because it's funny,bloody violent,dark and because it is the 2nd best DC Comics film ever made(The Dark Knight will remain the best).",The Suicide Squad
506,jaredkjacoby,A Gory Good Time,8,8 August 2021,"Amanda Waller has set two groups of convicts to an island in South America where there is a secret experiment known as Project Starfish. Some of the convicts are not so willing to go. Robert Dubois, better known as Bloodsport, is not willing to go until Waller threatens to send his 16-year old daughter to Belle Reve instead of juvy. He teams up with a manshark, a woman with the ability to control rats, a man who will kill to keep peace and a man in a polka dot suit. Together, they journey through the island to stop the experiment while running into Rick Flag and Harley Quinn.James Gunn's The Suicide Squad was easily my most anticipated film of the year. He was behind my two favorite comic book movies of all time and I wanted to see how this version of the film would portray the villainous squad. I was pumped for the movie... and yet, I did not want to get too excited for it. There have been a few movies recently that really disappointed me and I did not want to overhype my excitement for this film until I saw it. Does it live up to the hype or is it another disappointing entry for the DCEU?One thing I want to point out is that The Suicide Squad is among the most graphic and gory films I have ever seen, even moreso than Mortal Kombat. This movie is filled to the brim with blood and gore. Guts are spilled and nearly every death is shown in graphic detail. Seriously, this movie is not for younger kids or for the faint of heart. This does not mean do not watch this movie, but just know you are getting into a bit of a gorefest here.With all that said, how is The Suicide Squad? It is a bloody good time! At first, I was not sure how to feel about the movie, but by the time the squad entered the bar, the story won me over. The best part about this version of Suicide Squad is that these villains act like villains. They were in Belle Reve for a reason. One scene has them slaughter a whole village over a misunderstanding. These guys are bad guys and they show it. I noticed that the tone is both more comedic, yet darker at the same time. While it is more colorful and there are several funny moments, it does not get in the way of serious or intense moments except for one particular scene in the climax. Otherwise, it focuses on the consequences of villainy especially with Peacemaker, science experimentation and growth. Rick Flag and Harley Quinn are both much better people here than in the first Suicide Squad film. The opening scene is rather shocking and sad. If you were a fan of Captain Boomerang, you may not be happy here.The squad in this film has a much better dynamic and as individual characters, they all shine. I was worried that Bloodsport was going to be the same character as Deadshot, but they are quite opposite. Bloodsport is much more stoic, he wants to be away from his daughter and he is more affable towards the squad, particularly with Ratcatcher 2 and Rick Flag. As a result, he was a much more compelling character and it felt like he grew throughout the journey. It also helps that Idris Elba brings another killer performance. Among the new characters, John Cena as Peacemaker surprised me. It seemed like he was going to be a hammy comic relief, but he was a surprisingly dark character and he played it well. He gave an effective performance for a peace-loving maniac who has conflicted feelings about his actions. I love King Shark for being a hilarious and heartwarming comic relief. He is my favorite character here. Polka Dot Man has an awesome power and a tragic backstory around it. Ratcatcher is a thoroughly likable person who I am not sure should be with such dangerous villains. What makes this squad work is that each character has hidden depths to them to make them fleshed out so when the action begins, we root for their safety. It helps that each performance is terrific for every character with John Cena, Daniela Menchior and Idris Elba being the standouts. Even Sylvester Stallone was great with his comedic timing.As for the older characters, Amanda Waller returns and she is much more ruthless and cunning here. Viola Davis steals any scene she is in with her eerie presence, but she does get one comedic scene. I loved Davis as Waller and I was overjoyed when I found out when she came back. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is great as usual. She displays more standards here, but she has a sense of playfulness and maturity. My favorite scene with her is offering to go back in the predicament she was in so her team could still rescue her. That is Harley Quinn's personality. Even Rick Flag is much more likable. He feels more human and conflicted with his alignment. He is also much more of a team player this time around. It helps that Joel Kinnaman's performance is a lot better here. He emotes better and he generally has more fun with the role and the tone of the film. The villains are not the best, but Starro is a better antagonist than The Enchantress could ever be. It has a sad backstory and one of the coolest character designs in the DCEU. A Kaiju-sized starfish with nightmarish powers is definitely cooler than a villain who seeks world domination and creates a beam in the sky. His defeat is as graphic as it is gruesome. All in all, most of the characters are great in this movie. A huge step up from the first film.Visually, the movie looks stunning. It has such a cool style that reminds me of something that Quentin Tarantino and Adam Wingard would co-direct. It is so gleefully violent in its style, yet it is so colorful in nearly every shot. There is a lot of red in the mix as it shows how much bloodshed is here. The cinematography is impressive. One fight scene was shot on the reflection of Peacemaker's helmet and it looks incredible. Even the first shot of the movie is a solid looking reflection shot. Some of the lighting during the nighttime scenes could have been better though. It was hard to see the characters at times. The action scenes are over-the-top and spectacularly gory. They are inventive and messy while utilizing the powers and skills of the squad to the max. One scene taking place near the top of a building had me on the edge of my seat. Those are the kind of scenes I love to see on the big screen. The sets and costumes are great, and the special effects for King Shark make him look real. I also want to say that I love the story transitions. They were clever and inventive especially Operation Harley and Jotunheim. The soundtrack is good and it is better utilized here than it is in the first film's soundtrack, but it is not the strong point of the film.The Suicide Squad is bloody awesome. It got me attached to characters I never even heard of until this movie. It fully utilizes the premise of a villainous squad while showing how gory a comic book movie could get. Most of all, it has a lot of heart. It is definitely a win for the DCEU and I highly recommend it if you don't mind the gore.

But the first half felt like a chore to sit through.Another drawback, the failed execution of comedy. It was pretty cringey...!And also the poor pacing contributed in lagging the first half.But everything was just smooth and fine in the second half.

Also Harley's side plot felt mis-placed from the rest.To be honest the whole film feels mis-placed. Tonally all over the place, one moment all comedy, then sudden all sentimentality. In a heartbeat. And as for plot - the story. Total rubbish.

And Starro's starfishes were so Sharknado. I am shocked by the super gory violent shots, and yet WB wouldn't let Snyder and Ayer do their thing with ZSJL and Suicide Squad which I am pretty sure is more tamer than this movie.

520,ksharath1999,What happens when a comic book is brought as a movie to the screen itself!,7,13 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad(2021)Rating:82/100What happens when a comic book is brought as a movie to the screen itself. Suicide Squad is the most weirdest movie that can happen in a superhero universe. The film is a different ride when it comes to CBM's which is nothing more than a bizarre violent death filled ride which displays James Gunn's wicked ideas on screen.The Suicide Squad felt like the weirdest movie of the year the first time. Second time it felt extremely different..if you observe closely the movie has its own character depths,heart and is enjoyable when it comes to a new take. The acting performances of the major cast is praiseworthy especially John Cena's Peacemaker and Margot Robbie's gorgeous and crazy Harley Quinn stands above all. Danielle Melchoir's Ratcatcher is cute and feels like the heart of the movie while Sylvester's King Shark provides the emotional moments which contribute to the light hearted part of the movie. Cinematography,adult content,violence, frames and BGM is another praiseworthy factor of the movie. Action sequences are scattered here and there still used only when necessary. Personal favourite moments were too much to mention still One on One fight, Camp Fight, Harley Quinn's solo fight and final act all elevate the movie to new levels. VFX/CGI at most times where unidentifiable especially King Shark, Weasel and Starro and their minor details is beyond words. Artistical chapter division is the biggest factor to watch out in the whole movie followed by the bizarre surprise goosebumps worth comic book level third act which brings James Gunn's wild mind to the screen. Last but not the least the evident politics used in the movie and the wild post credits adds to its long range of pros.Coming to cons,Major alienation moment of the movie was the opening b grade island sequence and milton joke which felt absolutely weird. Personally, Viola Davis's Amanda Waller felt over at times and felt like a miscast this time. Final act's rushed death felt pushed and too generic.In the end,James Gunn delivers an absolute R rated versatile ride which is a win for both Gunn and WB when it succeeds in becoming one of the biggest CBM entertainer of the year.",The Suicide Squad
521,worksmart-58506,Nom nom!,9,22 August 2021,"Hands down the best DCU movie since the Christian Bale Batman trilogy. Sooooo much better than the 1st Suicide Squad. CGI was used exactly as it should be...for ridiculous, over the top gore and mayhem and so Sly Stallone can be King Shark. As insane as it sounds, I loved the realism and humanity in this movie. The cast was all fantastic. Each character was given some great lines and moments to shine, and they all delivered perfectly. Not one wasted moment or scene. Well done!!After reading some of the other comments, I need to add a few things. I saw as many people complaining that nothing was explained, as I saw people complaining everything was too spoon-fed. How can it possibly be both? Clearly a bunch simply can't get past themselves to enjoy what's in front of them. I read people complaining the humor was forced and ""didn't land"", except that it wasn't and absolutely did. If you can't laugh at Stallone as King Shark saying ""nom nom"" when looking at an alien to eat....you have no sense of humor.In conclusion I'll just say this....before watching this movie (and you absolutely should)...take a deep breath, clear your mind of all preconceptions and wtvr nonsense happens to be eating you at the time, and prepare to be entertained.",The Suicide Squad

524,unkommon,A Welcome Return to Form for the Superhero Genre,7,24 August 2021,"Suicide Squad (2016) was a dismal showing, which honestly worked better as a comedy, but encapsulated everything wrong with the genre at the time: shallow popcorn flicks focused on action and gore. The real issue with it was that it tried to present itself as something deeper than a shallow popcorn flick focused on action and gore.What is The Suicide Squad (2021) if not a shallow popcorn flick focused on action and gore? Not much, but it didn't take itself over-seriously, it didn't try to be more than what it presented itself as: a (somewhat) feel-good, action-heavy popcorn flick. It suffered no rebuke and is all the better for it.Since The Dark Knight (2008), superhero films have been playing a balancing act between grit, drama, comedy, and action; the latest few Marvel installments are a perfect distillation of that. Infinity War (2018) and Endgame (2019) were canonically overproduced distillations of a miasma of emotional dogwhistles offering very little in the way of legitimate substance, and, of course, they took themselves way too seriously. The most substantive aspects of The Suicide Squad were the action and the humor. The action was about as tasteful as a Superhero movie can provide - Superhero action in live action films is often spectacle over aesthetic: tawdry displays of CG explosions offering the audience no real emotional or intellectual emoluments; spectacle for the sake of spectacle. The Suicide Squad didn't suffer that pittance and the action sequences were immensely gratifying (following the stylistic blueprint laid out by 300 (2006)). Likewise, the humor put forth in The Suicide Squad was largely tasteful in the face of a rise in edgy humor and toilet humor (Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018) are great examples within the Superhero genre), in fact almost all of the jokes landed and relied mainly on self-relevance.What we, the audience, were ultimately left with was a largely unserious, gut-busting, action-heavy popcorn flick, which is as Superhero films should be, lest they fully commit themselves to the stylistic (as, I imagine, The Batman (2022) will, much like The Dark Knight and Batman Begins (2005) did).As I see it, there are only 2 modes a Superhero movie should earnestly operate: the mode of deep grit and societal statement (a la Watchmen (comics)), or the mode of unabashed entertainment. Blurring those lines leads to shallow, hokey, and outright tropey spectacle-heavy self-parodies. In this sense, Endgame and The Dark Knight Rises (2012) are some of the least accomplished Superhero movies within the genre, while movies like Iron Man (2008), The Dark Knight, The Avengers (2012), Black Panther 2018), and now The Suicide Squad are some of the more accomplished movies within the genre.All-in-all, The Suicide Squad was a revelatory return to form for a genre that as been diluted and disillusioned by the tropes that have been markers for success (surface-level emotional depth, over the top spectacular action, irrelevant tie-ins to modern societal happenings, and shallow characters who exist merely plot devices necessary for said action). It was a very welcomed shallow popcorn flick focused on action and gore. In a sense it took everything that makes Superhero movies stale and unexciting and breathed into them fresh life, it really did itself justice by shamelessly diving headfirst into the pit of tropes and came ahead a stronger piece for of it.7/10, better than most of late, but still a typical Superohero movie.",The Suicide Squad

526,helghast-1337,Complete opposite of the awful first suicide squad movie,8,7 August 2021,I think most sane people agree the first suicide squad movie was terrible and frankly due to how awful it was I was apprehensive to watching the second one but I'm glad I did.If I had to compare it to a movie I would say it's along the lines of Deadpool with violence and swearing. Not enough nudity but a ton of awesome violence. Superhero movies need to be rated R to be a proper movie. Pg-13 movies are too hard to pull off but in some cases it does with Spider-Man.Spoilers below.Pete Davidson is in it for some reason. He dies in 5 minutes and is never back again thankfully. What a terrible choice or cast. That's a deduction for me.John cena is alive at the end. With superhero movies always fast forward through the credits. The scene at the end of the credits shows cena is still alive and possibly doing a spin-off or the bad guy in the next suicide squad movie. That's unfortunate and worth another deduction because there are 100 other actors (hate to call him one. The marine was dreadful) that would have been better suited. He probably came cheap though.,The Suicide Squad
527,razzakahmed,Vibrantly brilliant .. F-word style 😅🤣,8,25 August 2021,"Well The Suicide Squad is back again .. this time with a different set of anti-heros under Amanda Waller with yet another operation up their sleeves .. ever since the release of the first Suicide Squad, fans have just been crazy to have another one . The unique moves, personalities of each player diversifies the colorfully artistic theme of the whole body of this film . This movie turns out to be better than the first Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn .. I always had in mind that they showed Joker so many times in the Batman Live action movies, cause Batman has by far the best Rogue's Gallery compared to many other super-heroes, so where was Harley Quinn, that's what I thought, they should've shown her too? So when she showed up in the Suicide Squad I was surprised, and wow .. what a comically vibrant sensation it turned out to be . And the point that I was right about this . Is obviously her un-hindered appearance in all three consecutive movies . There's no movie without Harl, her funky style, funny accent, hilariously charming ways make her a fan-favorite .. Anyhow this movie is very comedic, pleases the audiences with humourous action which The Suicide Squad stands for . This time theres : Bloodsport , Rick Flag , Harley Quinn, Ratcatcher 2, Peacemaker, Polka Dot man 🤣 and Nanaeve , as the main team, cause the original team which which was sent on the mission dies in the start. And another stylish different thing about this movie is that it's r-rated .. which normally superhero movies aren't . Same as the Harley Quinn TV-show.",The Suicide Squad

It's a big improvement from the first movie which was trying too hard to be edgy and dark (an overall big problem with DCEU, but not relevant to this review). THE Suicide Squad embraces the colourful, goofiness of comics beautifully with vibrant colours and silly, but entertaining characters. James Gunn went for a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe with a dysfunctional group of strangers becoming a team, just with more violence. There's ALOT of over the top gore that is done amazingly. The CGI in this movie is fantastic, despite the typically low budget for a film of this calibre. It shows what you can do with a great team and a clear vision.Can't wait to see what James Gunn does next.",The Suicide Squad

There's nothing redeeming about this movie. The humour, characters, plot, etc. Are all well below par.",The Suicide Squad
532,afrocut,A Fun second outing,7,6 August 2021,"""The Suicide squad"" is an interesting beast. It's set pieces, like characters running across falling buildings and Kaiju devestation, are big and hilariously brought to life in crazy cinematic ways. Gore, while some times cheesy, is also shot boldly artistic at times. Director and writer James Gunn always seems to be trying to out do himself with set pieces. The same goes for his passion in the lesser known and unloved characters that he spreads throughout his movies, the man can make even the worst character endearing. Here, characters like Rat Catcher 2, Polka Dot man and king Shark become one's you want to see and root for. There's a particular scene in which Idris Elba's Bloodsport and John Cena's Peacemaker bicker while one upping each other's kills, that is hilarious and character building. There's also a great use of scene transition being experimented with that feels very Wes Anderson like. This is where the problems start though. The entire movie feels a little to experimental. Those transitions, while inventive and beautiful to look at, don't feel like they fit. The structure of the film plays with time in a misused and strange way. Random flash backs to characters stories feel strangely forced in with cliche dialogue. A character even says ""that's my father"" while watching a news break on TV. Some characters are just bond villains with little reason or explanation. Peter Capaldi's Thinker seems criminally underutilized. Elba is good in the movie, but his Bloodsport is a total swap out for Smiths Deadshot. Margo Robbie has a bunch of funny scenes as Harley Quinn and one hell of a fight scene, but is to heavily used and her characters path in the film is hugely obvious. Speaking of obvious, you can tell just by the roster of characters who will make it out alive and who will have only moments of screen time. Gunn seems very hell bent on making this as far from what he did with ""Guardians of the galaxy"" as possible, even if it means sacrificing structure. The movie is fun though and it gives plenty of love to comics and comic fans , it's just no where near what the early reviews claim.",The Suicide Squad

But I saw that there was a lot of positive reviews for this one and more importantly, it was directed by the amazing James Gunn, and I said I'm 100% gonna watch.And oh my goodness, I got absolutely blown away from start to finish. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in months. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I am not afraid to say it and I don't care what some pretentious people think.The cast and characters were so good and so funny and so unique. The visuals and especially the gore is absolutely awesome. I'm so happy this is an R rated movie, it makes it 10x better. And the humor is really funny in this film. I never was a fan of Harley Quinn but I liked her in this one, she has beautiful scenes in the movie. And oh man I absolutely adored John Cena, he needs to be in every movie I don't care lol. The man's charisma is off the roof.I really don't have anything negative to say, mostly small insignificant nitpicks, as the case with all movies really.James Gunn makes fantastic movies, and in my opinion I really would love to see him make every single other DC movie from now on.WB made the right choice by making James Gunn do whatever he wants with this one. I'm really happy that a DC movie is actually really good for a change. I mean the only Marvel movies better than this one were Infinity War and Endgame, and I'm a huge Marvel stan. I'm really looking forward to seeing The Suicide Squad 2 if it's coming out. And future DC movies too if this is how WB are making their movies.I don't want to spoil anything, all I'm gonna say is this movie is a 10/10, absolutely amazing, fun, beautiful, brilliant.

Love its approach to characters and its combination of violence and humor. Gunn also fixes the flawed character introductions in the first Suicide Squad, by dropping us into a bunch of characters in tons of action, then flipping the switch to another group of smaller characters. Another thing is how Gunn takes these goofy characters (Polka-Dot Man) and take them seriously to an extent. I'm also glad Elba owns his role as Bloodsport, proving he is a versatile actor. Another thing is the camerawork in this film. It utilizes a slow and light shaky cam while also panning. You need to see it to know what I'm talking about, but the escape scene with Harley Quinn is a beautiful example.

Amazing performance from Daniel Melchior, also from Idris Elba, and the others on the poster. Rick Flag too.Loved the well built depth between all of the cast. The heartfelt moment make us so in the stories of the characters and the plot always keeping us in tensiin and suspense.Amazing, emotinal, crazy ride and also, yeah, heartwarm and heart......something!!!",The Suicide Squad
547,veritybingo,Dumb Fun,7,11 August 2021,"The first portion of this film does away with a handful of cast members seen promoting the film in recent junkets, so that was surprising...
The next half hour is peppered with juvenile humour seemingly scripted by a twelve year old,
but what we are then left with is endless exciting, dynamic, crazy, colourful and rather graphic kick-ass entertainment.Apart from an amusing Groot-like shark-man with an insatiable hunger for human meat, we are once again dazzled by the crazy and violent exploits of one Harley Quinn, who once again all but steals the show (and this is by far her finest showcase yet).Add some truly bizarre characters like a polketdot-wielding reluctant assassin, a twitchy weasel and a giant hive-minded starfish et viola - you have a fun piece of popcorn cinema.Also, there are some impressive apparently in-camera practical stunts and effects which elevate it somewhat.. and John Cena hamming it up to the enth degree.Well worth sticking with to the end (and even after the end credits, for a quiet but rather amusing if slight moment).",The Suicide Squad

This is by far, above and beyond, a huge improvement and incredible accomplishment. I'm thrilled. Best two hours of my life in the past 6 months was being absolutely captivated by this art.

550,ajax-kumar,"You might enjoy it, if you may switch off your brains before viewing",5,16 August 2021,So many plot holes that you may wonder if this movie was ideally targeted for kids and later switched over to a more mature audience. The movie has got The Suicide Squad's spirit for sure with the characters shaping up as they should. Great performance by all the cast. Margot Robbie as Harley is real fun to watch. It would have been great if they had spent more time on script. Good for one time watch.,The Suicide Squad
551,Drawmort,Let Gunn have his own comic book movie universe!,8,29 August 2021,This is the movie that the MCU always wanted to have in their sagas. James Gunn got it all. This is entertainment cinema for children in adult bodies. This is the new generation of action movies with gore and absurd humor. We were also fortunate to have disposable characters to unleash crazy ideas for unpredictable deaths.The Boys marked the path that Invincible cemented for James Gunn to paint it with this delicacy that does not need the excuse of a good script to rub shoulders with the great adaptations of comics.Remarkable movie.,The Suicide Squad

Acting is surprisingly rough, the actors are just shooting phrases that were supposed to be witty or funny, but that sounds too made-up and doesn't work either. It gets better in the second part of the movie when it turns into a more straightforward action flick, but it's not that great then either - somehow all the ingredients are present, but the result is odd and underperforming. The rat's great though.",The Suicide Squad

There was nothing except ridiculous jokes on top of jokes. Starro's screen time was limited, and this was the character's undoing. The film lacked emotional depth. The motives for the characters' action were absent. Idris Elba was good, and John Cena's performance was excellent.",The Suicide Squad

Even some of the acting was bad,John Cena was so wooden! And don't get started on the poor characterization of Harley Quinn who is suppose to be a genius,psychiatrist,psycho but comes across as a blonde,ditsy,bimbo!!! Suicide Squad,which got alot lower rating,was a far superior movie.",The Suicide Squad
561,stereo_1999,Finally DC got a good writer and director,9,8 August 2021,Harley felt as crazy as she should have been and it was entertaining. When they jumped times and places they actually told you in creative ways which is an issue with other movies. The fights were intense and very creative instead of doing the same stuff over and over again. I think it is safe to say Bloodsport was the main character of this film. As much as I like Harley I believe it was a good choice. Bloodsports character and his weapons were also imaginative and cool. All in all it's a good watch for adults (it definitely has the R rating for a reason.) There is also just enough humor sprinkled in to make it that much better.See DC you get what you pay for with writers and directors. Stay away from d rate horror film directors and writers.,The Suicide Squad
562,heath-jeffrey,"Amazing first half, okay second half.",7,12 September 2021,"For someone who didn't grow up on comic books and didn't know the history aside from the first Suicide Squad movie a few years back and bits and pieces in Arrow...The first half of this movie was absolutely amazing. Funny, interesting plot developments, cool characters, high quality, and done with loads of style. Reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy and the first Deadpool.And then it kind of petered out and become a pretty standard action movie. It kept the visual and most of the acting quality (miles ahead of the recent Justice League movies), some of the wit and a tiny bit of the style, but there was no more plot or character development and the 'end boss' was a childlike attempt at either humour or style or both.I liked the first Suicide Squad, as a really solid, fun, and often funny action movie. By comparison, the first half of this one was still so much better; and the second half of this one was marginally worse, but in roughly the same league.",The Suicide Squad
563,ryanwesthamfan,Perfect in every way,10,30 July 2021,"James Gunn does it again as 'The Suicide Squad' is one of the best comic book films made and is just amazing in every way.The Good- this film is a fresh film in it's genre and honestly I want more comic book films like this. This is one of the best blockbuster films probably since Avengers: Endgame. This feels exactly like a comic book exactly and I mean that as a positive. James Gunn nailed the action, there were times I found myself at the edge of my seat because of how amazing the action really was, weather it was the final battle or Harley Quinn and the best we have seen her. Margot Robbie absolutely kills it as Harley Quinn. The movies pacing flies by and doesn't spend too much time away from the action. The comedy is all great throughout and I was constantly laughing throughout this movie. Every character has that one moment to shine throughout as well weather it is that one joke or an emotional moment every has something about them. James Gunns writing here is so whitty that it feels so unique in a genre that realistically has been very overcrowded over recent years where there is a new film every couple of months. Honestly I think Margot Robbie is the perfect casting for Harley Quinn as well and personally I think it's time we put her in the top tier castings for comic book characters. The cast here is all amazing and you can see there passion for this project within there roles.Overall Thoughts- 'The Suicide Squad' is everything I wanted and more it is hilarious, entertaining and surprisingly emotional. Between all that the action is brutal and bloody and one of the most brutal films you will see for a while. James Gunn created a flat out creative and wacky experiences every character has its moments and honestly I cannot wait to watch this again. This film is perfect in every way. Overall I'm going to give 'The Suicide Squad' a 10/10.",The Suicide Squad
564,kuner-59029,Complete garbage,2,6 August 2021,"I expected this to be bad, but the final film exceeded my fears. James Gunn struck gold with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and the attempt to repeat that formula is apparent here - only it's amped up to the nth degree. The plot, if one can call it that, is one long exercise in subverting expectations. But Gunn is no M. Night Shymalan and no Monty Python either. This is pure randomness and lack of structure masquerading as subversiveness and edginess. I found myself reminded of the old Ren & Stimpy cartoon show at times, the bad later seasons, not the good early ones. Trying so hard to be edgy that it just becomes cringe worthy.This film reeks of studio desperation. It's Homer's makeup shotgun from the Simpsons in movie form. A bizarre, unfocused and pitiful smear of concepts, moods and sounds.Speaking of sound, the use of music in this film is awful. Different genres of songs are used randomly like in a late 90s Tarantino rip off. Most of the pop songs don't even work with what's happening on screen. Harley's escape is such a case. Frequently the score is interrupted full stop by sound fx or jokes. Again another attempt at ""subverting expectations"" and a simple trick at that. People expect music to go on, so when it's suddenly interrupted, they feel surprised. It's a dumb man's clever movie.It's not entirely without merit. Some of the photography is nice. Some of the acting performances are good (Polka Dot man, Idris Elba, the Shark and Rat Girl stand out) and some are awful (the villains, the nerds in front of the computer screens who do nothing but comment on things). Some of the character interactions are funny. Most are not.The first 20 minutes are amusing. The movie grinds to a painful halt in the middle and never regains its momentum. It's one exceedingly long, constantly interrupted, unfocused stew. Worst of all is the blatant disrespect this film has for its audience.I compare Marvel movies to fast food. Simple, safe, unhealthy junk food for the brain with very few nutrients. This is worse. This is vomit cooked up with artificial flavoring and sold as haute cuisine to people without taste buds.Bad as the original Suicide Squad was, this made me nostalgic for it.",The Suicide Squad

I don't know what normally do when filming but the colors look fake in their movies but here it looks natural. The characters don't fit the usual stereotype of the day and the intro sequence is atypical.Characters die and good guys die, definitely not your usually cheesy with overblown cgi ending DC movie.However, the big bad guy at the end is a little silly but not enough to ruin the movie.",The Suicide Squad

Borderline unwatchable.It's amazing to think that great actors and a great director could come up with this garbage. Surely, this and the other recent DCU films are pointing at the fact that DC themselves are negatively influencing the end result. Maybe it's time they handed the characters over to Marvel and let them fix the mess they've made.",The Suicide Squad
570,myignisrules,The Suicide Squad DON RIGHT!,8,8 August 2021,"Talk about a complete 180! How do you go from the a generic, problem riddled movie with some likeable but ultimately wasted characters, to a story that's equal parts unpredictable, funny, surprisingly heartfelt and darkly comedic with the kind of over the top violence you'll never see coming? Why you hire James freakin' Gunn of course!I don't know what I was expecting when I sat down to watch DC's The Suicide Squad (2021) but it certainly wasn't this and I mean that in the BEST way possible. Gunn's near perfect blending of the more fantastical elements you would find in the pages of any comic book and the realistic (almost insanely brutal at that) depiction of violence and madness come together to make a comic book adaptation the likes of which no one has ever seen before. The closest thing I could compare it too is the television series The Boys and even then, this is not that.Gunn and his team also make the smart choice of choosing to highlight characters that most everyone would be unfamiliar with. This way we start with a clean slate and an open mind. With the exception of a few returning faces like Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) and of course Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), we're invited to join an entirely new squad of D-listers on their impossible mission. This time around we also have main players Ratcatcher II (Daniela Melchior) Peacemaker (John Cena) Bloodsport (Idris Elba) Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian) and Sylvester Stallone, yes you read that right as the cutest murderer ever brought to screen King Shark and when I tell you you're gonna fall in love with each and everyone of these people, I am not exaggerating.I don't want to waste time comparing this movie to the one that came before, but I just have to mention how absolutely bonkers it is James Gunn made the time to give us one-on-one moments with each and every single one of these squad members without bringing the pacing or the energy in this movie to a halt. I teared up over Polka Dot Man and that's a sentence I never thought I would ever write.It goes without saying the actors here brought their A-game and more to their roles with the aforementioned Polka Dot played by Dastmalchian bringing both laughs and real emotion to his part. Equally so was Melchior in her role as Ratcatcher, excuse me Ratcatcher II. A very important distinction since the one and only Taika Waititi plays the role of her father, the man she takes her name from and the player who also made me choke up a bit with his/their tragic story. I would be remiss in my review if I didn't stop to talk about Robbie absolutely slaying it as Harley Quinn. She has some of the coolest, most memorably stand out moments in this movie with her monologue on why she did that thing she did (no spoilers) showing us a side of Harley that has never effectively been brought to the screen before. And can we talk about her action sequence? Are you kidding me?!! This is one of those moments I mentioned where Gunn uses his genius to blend the comic world with the real one. It gave us a ""look"" into the way HQ's mind works as she blocks out the truly horrific things she's doing in a way only Harley can.John Cena as Peacemaker was intense and I honestly didn't expect such great things from him. His role was the one that made me think most of Garth Ennis' series The Boys and I genuinely look forward to seeing more from this character. Last but never ever the least, let's talk about the cutest thing in the room. No I don't mean Sebastian the rat, (although, yes, he's a cutie in his own right) No my friends I wanna talk about King freakin' Shark! Gunn and Vin Diesel made Groot the character everyone wanted to take home with them and now the same can be said about Stallone's King of the Ocean, or in this case, a possible Demi-god named Nanaue. The choice to play him as a child-like creature, with the appetite of a great white was brilliant and there was never a scene where Shark with his inquisitive nature and his need to have more ""nom-noms"" didn't steal the show. I can't wait to get my hands on a plushy version of this guy!With one memorable action sequence after another, Gunn keeps audiences on their toes and made sure The Suicide Squad lived up to their name. There was more than one moment where I was shocked by which character died next and I loved every minute of it. From that opening scene that felt like a replay of D-Day to the final act of our last remaining anti-heroes going up against the unthinkable and unstoppable (by the way I'm so glad I avoided the trailers and articles as I honestly didn't know who the villain was supposed to be) every one of these scenes out did the next and I was never left wanting. And can we talk about that soundtrack? Such a HUGE difference from Ayer's choice to just stick every single iconic song in his movie, whether it worked in the scene or not. Here Gunn once again shows his love for the obscure but fitting songs, the way he did with Guardians of the Galaxy. I have a couple of friends who are gonna be loving themselves with this soundtrack and its scores.So are there any negatives? Well it's always hard to pin these down after just one viewing when you're all hopped up on adrenaline and excitement, but if anything comes to mine for me it would be the first act. It took me a minute to adjust to the tone of this new story and it felt a bit jarring as things settled into a rhythm. But that might just be me as I wasn't expecting a movie such as this to have such a wonderfully weird tone. I also wished we got more Amanda Waller. Viola Davis is as elite an actress as they come and she was one of only two things I enjoyed in the first movie so I was hoping for more time with The Wall. Although to be fair, what I got was everything you would expect from this character (for those who know her well) and once again Davis proves there's no person more terrifying than the woman with her hand on the literal red button.Last but not least was Idris Elba's Bloodsport. Easy now folks, put down the pitchforks and torches, I'm not saying I didn't like this character. What's not to like?! That has to be one of the coolest looking suits I've ever seen and the way it works was all kinds of awesome. Idris also delivers on some powerful moments in this movie especially when we're talking about the more emotional stuff. I just felt like compared to the rest of them, Bloodsport got a bit lost in the background. Maybe it's because he sometimes feels like you're seeing Deadshot in another form or maybe because with so many memorable characters to choose from, Bloodsport just falls a bit lower on the totem pole for me. The villains (with the exception of the big guy himself) didn't leave any impression, as well as the freedom fighters who sadly were only in this movie as scene stoppers and cannon fodder. Poor Alice Braga. Will this woman ever find a role in a comic book adaptation that isn't forgettable?Again, this is just my personal nitpicks and as of right this second, I can't think of any reason not to call James Gunn's The Suicide Squad a home run of comic book movie making. I could go on and on about this but then I would be writing a novel and not a review, so I'll just say I loved the tone, the music, the action, the characters, the editing, the pacing, the visuals (OH MY GOD, THE VISUALS!) and of all the comic book movies out there, this one in my opinion will be one of the most rewatched in times to come.Good luck to future Directors of this series who has to take up the baton and run with it.

572,erikarcher,A Graphic Opportunity for DC,8,9 August 2021,"Basically this movie is what happens when some DC exec says ""hey, let's make a MCU-style movie with a Deadpool sense of humor"". The result: an over-the-top, graphic, slapstick, ensemble-cast bloodbath that's targeted for ""adults"" and hits home way more than it misses. (which isn't a surprise since it was The Guardians of the Galaxy's James Gunn directing from the beginning...)But here's what's more interesting: this could be a formula DC uses to carve their new niche: one that blends the camp, pop and humor of Marvel movies, but also leans into the graphic violence that a lot of comic book fans (who are largely in the 18 - 34 crowd) will likely enjoy, but will never get from the combined Disney + MCU machine.If DC keeps up this angle, they just might breathe new life into their Franchises.",The Suicide Squad

The movie reminded me of Japan in WW2 where two officers competed to see who could kill more people in an hour. And it goes on and on and on.

Gunn's reboot fits the purposed tone of the original, John Ostrander ""Suicide Squad"" comics. His revamp brings everything to the table that 2016's fun, but flawed ""Suicide Squad"" lacked while its new R rating allows for the film's notorious characters to be presented as the rowdy group of mercenaries under compulsion and blackmail that they were written to be. This time around, they're really not afraid of being ""the bad guys"" and nobody is truly safe. A perfect balance of dramatic comedy, adventure, and heroic fantasy, the film utilizes wall-to-wall action, gory violence, epic set pieces, impressive visual effects, and awesome stunts. Gunn wastes no time getting to the point and deploys his charismatic, cleverly engaging, all-star cast of Hollywood veterans and acclaimed newcomers in shockingly inventive ways. Gunn offsets his renowned vibrancy with DC Comics' traditional grim and calamitous style and let me say that it works FAR better than I expected. This is what modern hero pictures should aspire to be. If you're a fan of fun, extravagant Marvel movies and can also enjoy the darker, more realistic DC films, then this is the perfectly balanced comedic action film that you've been looking for.

What's the ""lesson"": that even the worst psychopathic criminal has more of a moral compass than the US government secretive agencies, that the idea of ""all is permitted in the interests of the country"" is inherently wrong, that Latin Americans are either oppressed revolutionaries, or privileged, ruthless totalitarians?The entire premise is based on one factor - milk the franchise for as much as money as possible. There is no original theme, no novel insights. It would be cartoon ""black"" humor, if it tripped over tossing everything in to ""shock and awe"" viewers who must be stimulated with a new camera angle, movement, or violence every half a second.On the other hand, the cinematography was excellent, and Edris Alba, and the Ratcatcher 2 actress provided the sole redeeming performances of nuance, with character development.10 for cinematic production values and the performance of two of the lead actors (What a waste of Mr. Alba's charismatic presence!5 for shock and awe appealing to armchair warriors3 for originality1 for narrative consistency, moral compass, and productive use of millions of dollars.",The Suicide Squad
589,Leungzy,Exceeded my expectations,8,29 July 2021,"""I cherish peace with all my heart. I don't care how many men, women, and children I need to kill to get it.""The first thing that came to mind in the opening sequences of the film was wow there is a lot of gore, especially compared to the first film. I feel like the film makers took on criticism from the first movie and put improvements into this. To me, this was basically like an Avengers movie aimed at adults with violence, gore and swearing.The film is filled with a great cast who all do a terrific job, especially Margot Robbie, I couldn't see anyone else doing the role of Harley Quinn. She is to Harley what Heath Ledger was to the joker. The movie is filled with funny one liners and never takes itself too seriously. I felt the first Suicide Squad was bordering too much pretty humour and seriousness and wasn't sure what it was. This reboot blends humour and seriousness perfectly. Some of the scenes between John Cena and Idris Elba were hilarious, as well as the lines from King Shark.I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this to be honest based on the first film, but this delivers exactly what you would expect from a team of anti-heroes, it's funny, entertaining and aimed at a mature audience, and for me it's an 8/10.",The Suicide Squad
590,hawkeye-sid-ifti,The hype did not make it onto the screen,4,10 August 2021,Its just a very hyped movie. Sure it has funny moments but there is no WOW factor to it.I dont know how to get into the nitty gritty stuff of it but it was just blahhh this film.Watch it at home.,The Suicide Squad
591,curtinleslie56,First half better than last half,6,6 August 2021,The beginning of the movie is very funny however and then became too serious and then it became silly so unfortunately as much as I was anticipating a fabulous movie it disappointed.,The Suicide Squad
592,shabanavdulaj,Nothing new.,4,24 August 2021,"To the people that loved or even thought the movie was ""OK"": Please read no further. I'm going to avenge my wasted two hours, and I don't need enemies at this point in my life.In my defense: David Ehrlich rated this 7/10, and also - and I've yet to comprehend how is this possible - the movie has a 74 Metacritic score. So, that's that for what it's worth. Now, I should've ditched this the moment I heard James Gunn had defended Marvel from the ""accusations"" Scorsese made toward it almost two years ago, saying that Martin did that to publicize his movie, which I think it's true. A guy making movies about mobsters all his life has to be a mobster himself. But that's beyond the point. Bringing that up after this long means only that is Gunn, the one who's in desperate need of some press. And, I get it desperation pushes you to do silly things. But it's embarrassing to ""go against"" Scorsese in such a lame and ignoble fashion when you have a perfectly well-constructed fanbase filled with rednecks that are going to love the movie and even complain of why isn't it longer. You have to be satisfied with that.I might have gotten a migraine watching this movie, so bear with me while I try to explain it. This movie felt like some children were playing with their favorite action figures, creating these very random, mindless play scenes. - The giant star at the ending crashing the buildings reminded me of when Stitch from 'Lilo & Stitch' creates his play scene and destroys the cars and other toys. - And then someone who saw the children playing sat down and decided to put all those play scenes together, and that's the movie. - ""Embrace the senseless action and the gorefest!""
Some of the scenes have something severely wrong with them on some level, be it the writing, the acting, or the over-the-top action choreographies. Something else they did which is unforgivable is that they raped some of the songs they used here by playing them in the most unfitting moments possible. So, there is a lot they did wrong with this movie, and they had no right to because it hasn't been long since the last dumb 'Suicide Squad' film. The comics on which these characters are based must be phenomenal for these guys to attempt to bring them into the film realm this often because I don't want to believe they're making these films only because they know there is big money behind them.",The Suicide Squad

595,AhmedDaReviewer,NOW THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A GREAT SUICIDE SQUAD MOVIE!,8,13 August 2021,"I remember when the first Suicide Squad movie came out and how excited I was to watch it..And how disappointed I was when the movie was.. Let's just say it wasn't very good, From the awkward writing and character's dialog to the very dumb and weirdly convoluted storyline.. There's a 10 thousand years old witch that wants to destroy the world, Let's send a boomerang guy, A crazy clown lady and Will Smith to stop it, Yeah.. It was pretty dumb, Even for a Suicide Squad movie and the PG-13 rating didn't help it either..Birds of Prey wasn't as bad as Suicide Squad but still, It was pretty bland too with so many bland and underdeveloped characters and a predictable storyline about some little girl and a diamond with a good but (again) unfortunately underdeveloped villain..All hope is lost.. Nobody interested is a new Suicide Squad movie and it looks like It's the end of an era, Until.. 2021 A new Suicide Squad movie is coming out with an R rating okay okay, With a whole new cast of characters with some returning from the first one okay this is getting interesting, DIRECTED BY JAMES GUNN.. TAKE ALL MY MONEY, So you're telling me that the guy who made GOTG and Super and wrote the two cinematic masterpieces that are Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is working on this film, I am hooked and Gunn thankfully didn't disappoint!The Suicide Squad is one of most fun comic book movies I've ever seen in a long time, This movie is everything I wanted the first Suicide Squad movie to be and more, Where do I even start with this one, This movie got James Gunn written all over it, From the amazingly hilarious intro to the end of the movie, The movie never made me feel bored or uninterested, The action scenes are so cool and creative and felt very alive, The story is still pretty dumb but It's dumb fun unlike the first one..And the characters.. Oh my lord the characters, Where do I even start with these guys, First of all Idris Elba did a great job playing Bloodsport, He's so awesome and charismatic as the lead and he's way better than Will Smith, Not to say that Will did a bad job in the first movie or anything, It was the director's fault more then anything really, but Bloodsport and his interactions with the other characters are PRICELESS, Let's just say that the scene with him and John Cena's character Peacemaker in the forest was so creative and fun, I had to stop the movie because I was laughing so hard, It's that good, Polka-Dot Man was aldo very funny and endearing, King Shark is so wholesome and hilarious, I seriously love everything about him.This movie as a whole is just great fun, It's exactly what a Suicide Squad movie should be, A bunch of stupid criminals go on a quest to fight a big bad evil monster guy and I loved how different and distinct every character's weapons and abilities are, Makes every character feels more unique and special and I really loved how surprisingly emotional the movie was, Like seriously, I didn't expect to actually.. care about these characters, Like some scenes I actually found myself on the edge of my seat because of how tense I was watching it and let me tell you this movie is BRUTAL.. Like brutal BRUTAL, You see the R rating and this movie takes full advantage of it, The kills and deaths are very creative and bloody, It's actually very amusing.My only problem with this movie was how they handled Amanda Waller's character, I felt like she was very one-dimensional and predictable and that's weird because this movie is everything but predictable but other than that, The movie was awesome, You don't even need watch anything before it, Even though It's technically a sequel this movie is really It's own thing, Really shows how good this movie is!A crazy, hilarious and fun movie with surprisingly heartwarming moments, This movie is the REAL Suicide Squad movie, and you can thank James Gunn for that, Go watch it, You won't regret it!",The Suicide Squad
596,zaidmnomani,A Rare Achievement,5,10 October 2021,"The Suicide Squad is my personal favorite movie of the DCEU. After the terrible Birds of Prey, the disastrous WW84, and the abysmal ZSJL, I feared DC was slipping back into their old habits, pumping out awful movies like clockwork. The Suicide Squad isn't a huge departure from these films, as it still has lots of bad writing. But what saves it from being a 3 or even a 4 out of 10 is its fantastic character work.Let's start with Idris Elba's Bloodsport. He starts in a similar position as Deadshot from the original, being a mercenary with accurate aim who cares about his daughter. Except in this movie, the father-daughter relationship is not handled in a clumsy, heavy-handed way. Bloodsport insults his daughter because he wants her to stop coming back to him, while also making sure she doesn't follow in his footsteps. Deep down, he does care about her, but understands it's best if she stays away from him. Later on, he spends time with Ratcatcher II, and sees his daughter in her. Bloodsport and Ratcatcher have a heart-to-heart talk, with the two describing their childhoods. It's a scene filled with exposition, but the dialogue makes it feel so natural.Ratcatcher is the heart of the film, and she's incredibly endearing to watch. Earlier on in the film she says: 'If I die gambling on love, then it's a gamble worth taking.' This describes her character perfectly, that she's open, heartfelt, and trusting. Ratcatcher isn't even a villain, she got thrown in prison for just bank robbery. She and Sebastian have a great dynamic, and she helps bring out the best in everyone.Peacemaker is surprisingly great. He starts out as dead-pan, down to earth, straight man, who's obsessed with peace to an unhealthy degree. Earlier on his comments on peace are treated as jokes, but these things end up being very meaningful to his character. Peacemaker is willing to kill Rick Flag, whom he considers a hero, for the greater good. His rivalry with Bloodsport wraps up with an earlier line in the movie being paid off in an unexpected yet satisfying way. He also doesn't want to kill Ratcatcher, but feels he needs to if he must preserve peace. Peacemaker's ideals constantly conflicting with the people he cares about, making him fascinating to watch. Overall, Peacemaker serves as an excellent twist villain, and I, for one, can't wait for his T. V. show.Rick Flag himself is much improved. In the original he served as an exposition dumping machine. In this movie, by the third act, he stands up for all the families and children that were slaughtered because of the Starro experiments. He ends up dying for these people, which adds so much more pathos to his character. Rick Flag went against his country's interests, his team's plan, and Peacemaker because he wanted justice. In many ways, he's the unsung hero of the film.Polka-Dot Man and King Shark don't get too much development, but they're strongly characterized regardless. Polka-Dot Man had a traumatic childhood, as his mother experimented on him and his siblings to create superheroes. Ironically, by the end of the movie, he becomes a true hero, and helps in defeating Starro. Despite this, I do think his death was quite sudden, and I feel like it could have been handled better.King Shark serves as the comedic relief of the movie, but even he has a few good moments. Him watching the people on the streets while they were in the bus, makes you realize how much he desires to be accepted as a normal human, and adds an extra layer to his personality. Starro also has a great line by the end of the film that recontextualizes his character, and actually makes you feel bad for him.The cinematography and editing are impressive. The movie has several chapter titles dispersed in the environment, and several shots that are unique and fascinating. The Peacemaker and Rick Flag fight being reflected on a helmet was particularly impressive to watch. In many ways, the filmmaking felt like a blend between old and new James Gunn movies. It was big budget film, but it also had the over-the-top gore and dark comedy of James Gunn's earlier projects. The soundtrack had excellent musical choices, but that's to be expected from the same guy who made the Guardians of the Galaxy.Despite all this, the movie still has its fair share of problems. Harley Quinn's character is still incredibly annoying and paper-thin. She's had three movies, and yet she still lacks any personality beyond 'quirky'. It doesn't help that almost all of her jokes fall flat. The other characters deliver some great punchlines, but whenever it comes to Harley the film drops the ball with comedy. She also has a bizarre subplot with the first villain, which drags on for way too long and damages the pacing of the movie.There's an astounding amount of plot armor in this film, especially for Harley. All the characters never get hit by bullets, Bloodsport falls right through a building, completely unscathed; Harley somehow avoids all the carnage of the opening fight scene, and the starfish conveniently never attach to any of our heroes faces. The military villains are surprisingly incompetent.Peacemaker survival makes no sense either. While I'm glad he's alive, since he's a great character, one has to question how he lived with a bullet in his neck and a crumbling building falling on his body. The plot also has an unforgivable number of contrivances and holes. While these don't destroy the movie, they do severely tank its rating.This film is far from perfect, and it tends to stumble when it comes to the plot. Thankfully, a lot of the characters are still really well written, which is more than I can say for the rest of the DCEU. I'd highly recommend this one, despite it being a somewhat polarizing movie. There's a lot to appreciate here, and when it comes to a DC movie, that's a rare achievement.",The Suicide Squad

Bloodsport, Ratcatcher 2, Peacemaker, Polka Dot Man, Nanaue, and of course Harley Quinn were all so great.-Pretty sure Margot Robbie cemented herself as THE Harley Quinn, even if there's no other live action portrayal of Harley. Just like Hugh Jackman is with Wolverine.It definitely was creative and fresh, but it also was very predictable at times, that's why I didn't give it the full mark.My favorite scene is probably Harley's whole solo fight sequence in the building, along with the flowers and all.",The Suicide Squad

Loved the chemistry between Idris Elba and John Cena. Cena is really trying to establish himself as an actor and his efforts bear much better fruit here, than in F9 Saga. Margot is GORGEOUS than ever, and really shines on her own, more so than her ""solo"" film. Goes to show that an actor is only as good as the script that they get.Great watch for a fun weekend.

604,jdowney-57-371157,Starts badly but Dazzles in the last 45 minutes,8,7 September 2021,"I'm not obsessed with comic book movies, but I grew up reading comic books. So, I truly enjoyed Iron Man, Captain America and the other Marvel Characters being brought to life so well with amazing special effects that truly brought Marvel to life.But I never got that thrill from DC comics (which I read as much as Marvel as a kid). There is an inherent problem with Superman, which is the basis of Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen. An immortal all powerful being would have a universe to play in...would Earth and it's petty humanity really be worth his time in the long run? And when you put that character into the hands of people who don't understand the comic world, but are just movie makers doing it for a buck... you get Superman's creation story and Lex Luthor over and over. You get the Joker and the Penguin over and over. There is no vision and no love for the characters, they simply pick the surface. This is what makes Man of Steel standout...a spin...He is an alien trying to fit in unnoticed. Snyder got the character. In the same way, Nolan went to Ra's al Ghul and Bane....realizing that following up the Joker with the Riddler and Penguin was just treading in shallow water.All of which brings me to 2016's Suicide Squad. Let's get Margot Robbie (the Hollywood It girl of that moment) and pair her with (everyone likes) Will Smith. But then...they made a movie with a story, graphics and monsters that seemed to come from Resident Evil. The entire effort seemed to be made by people who just didn't care. Marvel got GOTG to fly...time for us to go a little weird. But when Suicide Squad walked down a set street and shot up the goo-monsters I thought I was watching a movie made in 1985.Seeing they plucked Gunn to do a mulligan and that shanked tee shot...I was hesitant. Suicide Squad has a problem. The audience doesn't know or care about who these people(?) are. The concept is the Dirty Dozen. You're rotten bastards and we will give you a chance at redemption, only we are really sending you to die. Ha Ha.In GOTG, Gunn's first movie overcomes that problem...he introduces us to the characters and the entire purpose of the movie is to show us the shared events that turned them from strangers into a family that we rooted for. That remains the biggest flaw of this new movie. Although we've seen an origin story of Harley Quinn in previous DC movies, that can't be said about everyone else. It is somewhat compounded by the film's beginning misdirect...which assumes it is funny or clever to whack a load of crazed Squaders that we don't care about before revealing the true story line. It eats some time, has a few chuckles, but ultimately it has nothing to do with what is going on.So now, I'm finally with Dead Shot and a couple of others that I don't care about. The biggest drag down now becomes John Cena, who simply can not act. It is not easy to make one consider how well Dwayne Johnson and Dave Bautista actually deliver their lines, but Cena does it.So, I'm now 45 minutes into this movie, and the enemy is a bunch of stereotyped 3rd world Hispanic Oppressors guarding a Tower that is the target, and Harley Quinn is their prisoner. I'm sitting here not impressed, and not all that engaged. Gunn is obviously a step-up in special effects and cinematography but I don't know who this girl with the rats is, or care about the polka dot guy. Everything seems jokey and overly attempting to be clever. Idris Alba does the best he can, but I don't see anything special.But...then the 3rd act begins. Harley Quinn escapes captivity in a bloody, stylish an choreographed escaped that seem to be out of a page of Gunn's GOTG. And from that point on, every thing I was waiting for happens. This movie then becomes one stunning visionary visual experience after another. The comedy lands, the characters become compelling, the action builds and builds, and the whole thing becomes a crazy beautiful explosion of crazy colorful movie magic.When it was all over I shook my head and said...'That was awesome'. I enjoyed it, it delivered. I hope Gunn comes back to this one and makes a sequel.",The Suicide Squad
605,MiroslavKyuranov,Wild And Bloody Spectacle,8,29 July 2021,"Without a doubt, this is the best DCEU movie to date.The story is good and very well executed.

James Gunn has found the perfect point and combined things great in ""The Suicide Squad"".This is definitely the best DCEU movie for me and I believe it will become the one for many people too.

606,benmundie,James Gunn has Saved this Franchise!!,9,12 August 2021,"'The Suicide Squad' is the latest DCEU film and is written and directed by legendary filmmaker James Gunn in his return to the genre after his 2017 movie 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'. This film is a soft reboot from 2016's 'Suicide Squad' with only a few cast members reprising their roles after that movies poor reception from fans.This films cast is absolutely immense. It is mainly made up of frequent James Gunn collaborators and friends: Michael Rooker ('Savant'), Nathan Fillion ('T. D. K.'), Sean Gunn ('Weasel') and Steve Agee ('John Economos' and the on-set 'King Shark'). Also, they have some huge names in the main cast, Idris Elba as 'Bloodsport', Margot Robbie as 'Harley Quinn' and John Cena as 'Peacemaker'. However, the standouts are Daniela Melchior as 'Ratcatcher 2' and David Dastmalchian as 'Polka-Dot Man'. They're the heart of the film and their very personal performances bring a different aspect to the movie. The two of them encompass the emotion and the core themes of the story.The pacing feels very deliberate. Gunn almost splits this up into chapters with title cards materialising out of thin air to more closely relate this to the comic books that the story is loosely based off. Gunn always knows how to choose and implement fantastic licensed music and this time around is no exception, it links effortlessly into the plot and is clear that the songs chosen were written into the script from the start. Along with the licensed songs, there is some beautiful original music and scores from composer John Murphy. The best is the song titled 'Ratism' which is a moving piece that echoes the key message that Gunn is trying to emulate with this film.The script is very character centric, which is perfect in a story that has such a huge ensemble cast. The writing makes you care about absolutely everyone, which is impressive when most of the lineup are nobody's from DC Comics that were near enough unknowns before this films release. Also, I don't think I have ever seen a comic book movie that looks this beautiful. The visuals are absolutely stunning and Gunn pays so much attention to detail that I don't think a normal filmmaker would pay.James Gunn was given full creative control with the studio having very little input in the final piece and it shows in the difference of quality between this film and it's predecessor. For instance, people actually die in this film, which may not sound like a good thing but for a film that is called 'The Suicide Squad' you would hope that people do actually kick the bucket at some point, sometimes in emotional ways but mainly in a funny and comedic fashion. That does relate to the 'R' rating (UK-15) that is attached to this picture as quite a few of the deaths and kills are incredibly gory which definitely adds to the style of this film. It is such a relief that this movie is able to make fun of itself and doesn't take itself to seriously which has been the downfall of other DCEU instalments. Some of the kills in particular display the cartoonish and over the top tone that perfectly mirrors the source material.Overall, I love this film. It is clear that this is a real passion project for James Gunn and he takes huge amounts of pride in his work whilst making this movie. I can't wait for the spin-off 'Peacemaker' show that is coming in early 2022 and I hope we get to see more origin stories for some of the characters in this film.9.5/10.",The Suicide Squad

608,baracuda1974,Why?,4,7 August 2021,"Just finished watching the movie going by some people's reviews saying that it was better than the first movie. Sorry to say but don't pay money to see this movie. The plot was forgettable, it was not funny, and a waste of talent. They made this movie to be R rated for no reason at all, and way too long without any payout. TAIM Gunn tried so hard to make it edgie and some what like GOTG with using old music but it was music that I have never heard before and inmemorable. This proves to me that WB and DC has no real plans to be better than Marvel.

But during this movie, I just had to fast scan through 80% of it.

611,PhatManBad,"Too Long, A Few Problems Here And There, But Still Good.",6,13 August 2021,"For me there's a lot of ""I love it, but I hate it"" attached to this movie.I like the main characters a lot. The conflicting personalities are not only fun, but seem very natural. The movie did a little more than ""he's the fat one, and she loves shopping."" But I don't care about their origin story. Every scene designed to add depth to the characters was pointless. I'm not concerned about so-and-so's mommy issues or why such-and-such is afraid of rats. It's been done in so many movies, and each of their problems are solved in seconds.I appreciate and enjoy the excessive (and sometimes creative) violence in the film. But I'm extremely tired of CGI blood in action movies. It makes every death look artificial.It's a more unpredictable movie, which is definitely a plus. You never know which main character is going to die next. But it's still the same exhausting comic book movie plot as always: a group of kooky superheroes band together to destroy a giant whatever.As much as I loved the banter between the ""heroes,"" a bunch of mismatched super beings setting aside their differences and learning to work together isn't exactly unique (every Avengers movie, every Guardians of the Galaxy movie, etc.).Hollywood doesn't seem to understand that comic book stories can be told in a variety of ways, as long as you stay true to the material. It may sound difficult, but both the DC and Marvel Universe have an immense variety of characters and places to work with. With the right story (an actual story from the comics), you can make a scary movie, a romantic comedy, a crime drama, and so on.Most of the non-action scenes were interesting, but way, way too long. The romance (?) between Harley Quinn and some evil dictator (the villains were very hollow and boring, by the way) went on for hours.And the words between the movie's chapters (there are actual words placed throughout the movie that only the audience can see that are either the title of the chapter or ""8 minutes earlier"") were very irritating.Honestly, most of these problems can be solved by making the movie shorter. A movie like this should not be 2 hours and 13 minutes.I still had a good time.",The Suicide Squad

When it's done wrong, it's like having an audio dub kicking in half a second too late, it just feels weird, and you carry this feeling with you the entire movie. I can't believe we went from Shazam to this in the DCU. There are some good though, the story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. I like most of the actors.

625,evan_lassi,DC is a Joke,4,7 August 2021,"This movie might be a little better than the first but that doesn't make this a good movie. The ""DC Universe"" is an absolute joke and mess and this is just adding to it. Gunn claims he had the most fun making this movie? Please stick to Guardians.I liked Man of Steel but ever since then, I just keep having to tell myself these must be strictly for DC fans. Or maybe I'm spoiled by Marvel. Those movies and shows have definitely had some misses and may not kill it every time but it's definitely better than all this crap and they still find a way to tie it altogether in the ""Universe."" Going back to Batman vs Superman, WTH is DC trying to accomplish? None of this makes sense and definitely doesn't tie together.Even if I looked at this as a stand alone movie, no DC Universe, I can't get over how bad this movie is. What is the hype with Cena? Is it because the Rock and Bautista already staked claim for wrestlers who are acting now and Cena is just too late? I don't know but Cena just doesn't work no matter what movie he's in. Most of these characters HAVE NO POWERS but somehow have special abilities and can kill everyone without even so much as getting a scratch! Harley Quinn has NO ABILITIES AT ALL, not even like some stupid crack shot or being able to communicate with rats but she kills how many people in how many different ways? And Cena going ""rogue"" (I guess,) what happened to the bomb in the back of his neck? And of course the Starfish and little ""alien"" like spawn which is basically the Night King and White Walkers from GoT.The jokes, the language, the characters, the story, the ""universe,"" it just doesn't work at all.

626,grahamvandyke,Absolute Redemption,7,6 August 2021,"The first Suicide Squad (2016) tried to be comedic, quirky, badass and violent, and managed to miss the mark completely on all accounts. It was a complete mess of a movie that was easily forgettable and lost in the wind of better superhero films. The Suicide Squad (2021) followed the exact same formula, but this time, stuck the landing.It did a great job of telling the story in a way that led you down the conventional path, only to throw the plot on it's own head and subvert expectations with the unexpected. It also seriously stood out in it's comedy; I'm a stickler when it comes to humor and I'm not easily impressed with most comedy in movies, but this film had me laughing out lead many times. Did I also mention it's brutally violent? From the first moment of the first action sequence I was in complete shock of how graphic some of the fight scenes are. This just further cements in my head that the days of PG-13 rating in superhero movies are numbered.I highly recommend watching The Suicide Squad in theatres.

She is a tad bit toned down and has more layers, if that makes sense. Bloodsport, polk-a-dot man, King Shark, and Rick Flag were all pretty cool that had nice moments.I just thought it was a bit long, like the pacing was a bit off. Also, the humour was a tad bit overboard. It felt like there was a new joke every minute.

I don't know where they were trying to go. It's much more gruesome then the first movie with a worst plot.

Many of the characters don't make much sense, all are expendable, and the ride the movie takes you on is FUN!Because that's the point, right? Having fun?

Sylvester Stallone even killed it as a mono-syllabic shark.

You would never think that the same director for Guardians of the Galaxy directed this film. I am really disappointed with this movie but it's not the actors at all, everyone was great.

660,diffguy,Moral of the movie - Collective Action,8,10 August 2021,"This is a fantastic movie with a few shortcomings.The opening structure of the Suicide Squad was brilliant in the way it dropped you right into the action without introductions. Where Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead spent quite a long time reviewing who the main players of the heist team were before we ever saw them inside the zombie zone, Suicide Squad instead almost immediately shows you the Suicide Squad storming the beach of Corto Maltes. And it doesn't overly explain the stakes or mechanics of being on the squad. Like the kill switch that makes your head explode. It very succinctly illustrated why no one will abandon the mission - you die.The funniest sequence of the movie was maybe the pseudo-competition between Peacemaker and Bloodsport in the rebel camp. When John Cena casually stabbed a sleeping guy 14 times, I lost my mind. The biggest belly laugh.Now, the ending hour is the bread and butter of this movie. It is heralded by Harley Quinn blasting the wannabe president in the chest after they bone. This half of the movie makes up for all the shortcomings of the first. The conspiracy of Project Starfish really takes off. The Suicide Squad starts working together to save Harley. They enter the Jotunheim. Ugh. So many good scenes in here with real world implications.The defection of Peacemaker and the fights that ensued between him, Rick Flag, and Ratcatcher had high stakes. They pulled at your heartstrings and your allegiance to right vs wrong. The fight between Peacemaker and Rick Flag had an insane amount of emotion coming off each actor. I knew Joel Kinnaman was great before this movie, but John Cena? Incredible emotion as he kills Flag.The finale shows the meaning of this movie - Collective Action. They initially lose to Starro because the Squad is splintering off and are told to come home by Waller (Viola Davis). They collectively agree to not abandon the mission and fight Starro together. That's the first C. A. Second, as Waller is about to hit the kill switch, the tech team knocks her out. Third, you have Starro's hivemind of a horde of starfish drones, which ultimately proves to be too powerful for the Squad - we watch all members nearly die by Starro.But fourth and finally, Ratcatcher uses the rats. A horde of individual rats, in contrast to the hivemind of Starro, bests the villain because it was millions of minds working together, instead of millions of bodies with one mind. The film's message is that many must work together to achieve a singular goal - with no one splintering off.",The Suicide Squad
661,ayojerkinskarega,Bad Movie,4,3 October 2021,"Production: Solid writing. Solid script, but at times, the film's tone is off. This is because the moments that are supposed to be serious and/or heartfelt are underdeveloped. Solid editing. One less ""cool"" slow motion shot would've been better. Also, again with the location font telling us where we are. When is that going to stop? It's like filmmakers think that the audience is too stupid to follow the story without them. 7/10.On screen: The actors and actresses did all they could do with that undeveloped script and that was pretty good. They were believable for the most part. If the serious/heartfelt scenes were developed better, then the acting could've been better. Cinematography is good enough. 6.5/ 10.Content/Impact: I really don't like Amanda Waller as a character at all in any of the DC mediums. Her character is a reinforcement of the sapphire Black Woman stereotype, more currently dubbed Angry Black woman. She's forceful, angry, stubborn, and malicious. Also, they don't give any backstory to this character which creates this belief that she's born a ""ABW."" This portrayal is problematic because it dehumanizes black women by teaching the viewers that this is all black women are, the Angry Black Woman. Also, I wasn't feeling the scene with other black man in prison (Bloodshot played by Iris Elba) screaming curse words to his daughter (Tyla played by Storm Reid) through the prison glass. Terrible reinforcing stereotypical imagery. 1/10.Overall: Decent movie would've been better without reinforcing stereotypes. 4.8/10.",The Suicide Squad

667,nicky-43953,So this the famous James Gunn.,10,10 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is what a full James Gunn blockbuster film looks like. Gunn's expertise in writing memorable quirky characters is what The Suicide Squad needed in the first Suicide Squad (2016) and now is mastered in The Suicide Squad (2021). Warner Bros. Decided on giving directors full creative control on their DC movies since Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) was the best they've made in decades. Which gives the DCEU a winning streak this year against the MCU I don't even feel like I wanna watch Shang-Chi since the disappointment of Black Widow.All of the characters in the opening were used for an example that the characters can die and shows the status quo of everything.The characters' positive, disillusionment, flat, and other arcs were great. Bloodsport's positive arc from being a bad role model to becoming a proud hero to his daughter. Peacemaker's disillusionment arc of obsessing over the peace of America like psychotic Captain America continues to the Peacemaker series. Ratcatcher II's flat arc of believing that even the most horrible creatures in life have a purpose and are worth valuing really rubbed off on the characters and theme. Polka-Dot Man's arc from living as a tragic and pathetic psychopath to died a redeemed and appreciated superhero to the audience. King Shark's arc from untrustworthy to faithful and he got many nom-noms. Harley Quinn's change from Birds of Prey was tested and was fulfilled satisfyingly.",The Suicide Squad
668,Lone_Mh,Loose and childish...,4,11 August 2021,"I was really waiting for this movie and now that I watched it, literally I feel like I never wanted such a thing!!It's so so childish with loose script that a lot of violence and gore has been added to make it a movie for adults! And with so much bugs if you focus on every moments; Like the combats in jungle that were arranged as if the camera shows every single soldier relaxing even while their friends are getting killed some inches behind them and no any sound attracts them to look around till it comes for them to die(!!) and then it begins really harsh!! The extra and Supporting actors(soldiers and ordinary people) were acting like NPCs in a video game who just walk around with no purpose and some times do wrong postures with so much low artificial intelligence cause as an example in jungle scene they're friends were being killed and shouting out(even two of them were on fire shouting!!), and literally none of the other ones show any reaction until ""Peacemaker"" and ""Bloodsport"" put some steps more and the camera gets there!!! That's not the way that Hollywood movies are!! These are way too bad for such a great professional industry! Don't look at the high scores! Can't understand what they've obsessed with(other than great actors that I admit, too)!The looseness of the script adds more bad effects on the experience of watching! It's really really childish with characters deciding for a task in a foolish way like when a guy shows toughness and act like a gangster but then suddenly becomes friendly with no reason and even not in a funny way!!! Or the whole story of killing a big starfish(!!) which has been brought from space(!!)! Real colorful intelligent starfish? Like an alien!! From Space?! What the actual heck is that?!! There's no any connection between them! That's totally childish but with a lot of violence and blood and combats and stuff to fake it for adults!!In one seen ""Bloodsport"" tells ""Harley Quinn"" to take the high ground and Harley jumps up around 10 feet distance on her legs to go up a building with an artificial physics!!!! Like those Chinese movies that Kong Fu masters levitate like they're flying!!! What was that actually?!!! Harley is not Superman to point out his fist and go up in sky!! She is an expert in sudden fights, no any super power!! That made her strange in that momentThere are way too much than that, seems like superhero and villain movies are getting foolish with so much budgets as the time passes on...I was so excited for this one to watch Margot Robbie(Harley Quinn) and Idris Elba(Bloodsport) playing in it, but that was not what I thought it would be...
only Margot Robbie makes it funny and tasty to watch and just for her, thats all...",The Suicide Squad

Gunn hit this one out if the park and I hope WB will stick with him for future projects. The movie was fantastic. I really came into it remembering the first one and how disappointing it was and thinking ""how could the sequel be any better?"" Boy was I wrong.

671,damon503,Suicide Squad 10x Better 2nd Time Around.,8,9 August 2021,"And why?? Gunn that's why!Suicide squad has all the makings of a great brand now thanks to James Gunn! & his unique trademarks he adds to this franchise that started out horribly wrong with David Ayer.This time around we just get a great simple storyline with amazing add-on casts in John Cena (who knew Cena could do comedy) Idris Elba, David Dasmalchian, Daniela Melchior & a lot of jaw dropping special effects.Reminiscent to his GotG films, there are plenty of comedic scenes & dialogs throughout the movie, along with his trademark music selections, & wacky weird characters i.e. King Shark (a half-man half-shark voiced by Sly Stallone himself LOL.)The film does drag a bit in the middle but once the action restarts, the movie just gets better, funnier, & weirder! Like the starfish & his army of starfish face huggers similar to Ridley Scott's Alien film. Or better yet, Polka dot man! Who shoots polka dots at his enemies...& then there's TDK! (The Detachment Kid) who simply detaches his arms in a fight and does nothing else but slap & tickle the enemies to death with lol.The movie keeps introducing us with funny, fresh & original ideas with their supporting characters that makes the audience laugh out loud literally in the movie theater. I must've heard ten different audience laughs within15 minutes.I was also very skeptical with Harley Quinn's character because the 1st Suicide Squad film, she was just flat out loud & annoying. Wasn't even funny at all, then all of a sudden she was nothing like that in this film. Credit Gunn for understanding Harley Quinns character and making her funny, interesting, & loveable in this one.This film right now is my favorite summer movie of 2021, we still got 1 more month but this one takes the cake in all aspects of summer movies.

Things I enjoyed were the characters which had a little more depth this go round as far as their back story,the action,the gore all were on point,my favorite characters of the film hands down was KING SHARK & BLOODPSORT,story plot was pretty easy had some thing's that didn't click for me,but overall the film was put together much better & a good number of Easter eggs especially John Ostrander,some scenes pulled straight out the comics which surprise me,this film is most definitely rank up there as far as top DC films for me,with W.

It's violent - make that VIOLENT! - gratuitously so in places and I wasn't overwhelmed by Starro the extraterrestrial star fish (don't worry, it kinda makes sense when you see the movie). Like I said, sometimes it almost manages to out- weird itself. Thankfully, it just about holds itself together until the end.

Best possible opening for a movie titled ""the suicide squad"". Characters are developed right from the start. But the movie wanders off for some 30 minutes without Quinn in action. During this time the main characters engage in pointless drama (reminding of Suicide squad-2016) and unsettling gore. But it picks pace once Quinn is back and there is no turning back. The whole second half is high octane. The starfish scenes are surreal.It's more like Quinn is the central character.

Disappointed viewers of the original Suicide Squad film are sure to be pleased with this completely outrageous yet clever and, surprisingly enough, very artistic piece of cinema action.As a bonus; It doesn't feature any distracting agendas and focuses 100% on just delivering pure entertainment.

702,thecanadian-23317,"Not without issue, but much better than the last attempt",8,7 August 2021,"The biggest issue with this movie is one that most ensemble movies face - there's just not enough time for each of the characters. Some get some good development (I liked Ratcatcher 2, for example), but others felt fairly lacking (like Polka Dot Man). And as much as I love Margot Robbie as Harley, Harley as a character felt kind of out of place in this movie. I feel like WB felt like they ""had"" to include her because she was basically the only good part about the 2016 Suicide Squad. And it's kind of complicated because her individual scenes are generally good, but she spends more time on her own ""adventure"" than with the rest of the Squad.Narrative issues aside though, I've basically got nothing bad to say about the movie. Gunn directed the hell out of this movie - it looks great, and his visual flair is all over it. The movie was generally funny without being cringey, and there were a few scenes that were surprisingly emotional. Acting was solid, special effects were good. I would 100% watch a sequel.The movie is definitely in the top 3 DC movies, but that's really not saying much.

I was shocked with all those deaths at the start, but my god it was funny to really see just how unimportant they all were. It's a bit of a shame that some characters were cast really well, like The Thinker, Captain Boomerang and Savant, and seeing them die was saddening, but in a very hilarious way. This movie also proves that James Gunn can make you feel for characters, even minor ones (For example, Ratcatcher 1, who in my opinion was cast really well) while still keeping it light and humorous.

To erase the threat, the government sends a collection of cons to Maltese island where they find the enemy was prepared.Is It worth the watch?The suicide squad, though not a great movie is indeed worth the watch.

712,MJL_Uncensored,Fantastic Fun But It's Not For Everyone,8,7 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is an exhilarating entry into the comic-book genre that takes the best elements of past James Gunn films, other comic book adaptations like Deadpool, The Boys, any combination of Tarantino films, and turns it into a high-caliber exploitation film. That's not a negative; it's an observation that is crucial to understanding the creative choices that drive the experience of the film. This is a film about horrible people trying to save the world, and they never let you forget that they are awful people. In the process, we, as audience members, are tossed into an equally hilarious and vile world that makes you question the limit for comic book movies.From the opening scene, Gunn makes sure you're well aware of what you've gotten yourself into as he injects a vomitorium of violence to desensitize you early on. Then he spins the narrative around to introduce you to the titular characters and establishes what's at stake. This is a film about the risk for everyone involved in the story to the film's actual production. The Suicide Squad swings for the fences, and in the process of delivering a home run, the ball lands in a fan's eye and bloodies them good. No one is safe in this film except for a few. As shocking as many of the deaths are in this film, a savvy gambler could still see the foreshadowing behind the deaths of most characters.Gunn does what he has done well with the Guardians of the Galaxy, taking a group of misfits and helping them find synergy in the most unconventional of ways. But along the way, there's a tragedy, betrayal, and real stakes that make the film's absurd big battle thrilling to watch. He also manages to give the film heart by taking the easily most likable member of the group and giving her a story that makes you care for her. But as the film explores her roots, the film literally takes a dump on the type of people she represents in a weird social commentary about capitalism that feels like satire from Team America World Police.There are choices made that are juvenile and brilliant, all at the exact times. There are other tasteless and unnecessary choices, even for a film that establishes its extremes early on. So it's not hard to surmise that this film will be a hit with one segment of moviegoers and a turnoff for others. That's how polarizing this film is. But no one can deny the brilliant cinematic style on the screen. Gunn paints the canvas with some of the best cinematography I've seen in a comic book film. It's gritty yet colorful. He exudes mastery over the camera angles in this film, literally framing every scene in an artistic and kinetic way. And while audiences may split on their feelings about this film, everyone will walk away thinking about the lovable scene stealer that is King Shark.I can't say more about this film without rolling into spoilers, but what I can say is, The Suicide Squad is without a doubt one of the most creative comic book movies in recent years but it's also the most disturbing.",The Suicide Squad
713,Naive-fox,Deliciously goofy and hopelessly flawed,5,8 August 2021,"Even if it's starting to become a trend and basically expected of every superhero movie, there's absolutely no doubt the amount of goofiness in a movie like 'The suicide squad' is gonna be pretty much off the charts. And even if the comical situations and the humor feel forced at times, it still makes a really enjoyable experience once you make amends with the idea that nothing in the film is gonna follow a coherent script. Some scenes like the initial landing or the assault on the camp are as absurd as they're hilarious. The jokes and dialogue leave a bit to be desired, but in most cases they're not terribly out of place (except for the overuse of some of the comical elements).Visually and acting wise the much better sequel to the terrible first Suicide Squad appearance on the big screen is not bad either. The visual effects feel too lazy at times, making it look like you are watching an indie flick with a slightly better budget, but fit the overall feel of the movie and the acting is good enough for a movie of its kind. It even sparkles at times with its cinematography and some interesting takes and camera angles when they're not trying to overdo it.But it's on its story structure that 'The suicide squad' fails more noticeably. Nobody expects a great story or a perfectly polished script from an anti-hero movie. But so many scenes and subplots -and even characters- feel so unnecessary and out of touch with the main story it feels like watching four different movies that aren't related to one another. Harley's whole ordeal with the dictator -and almost Harley's entire story arc-, the whole resistance militia group subplot that has no impact whatsoever on the story, the Polka-Dot-Man (or whatever) mommy issues... There are plenty of moments taking up too much runtime that do nothing for the film but take you out of the main thread of the story -which doesn't have a satisfactory ending itself either-. In the end 'The suicide squad' is a bag of mixed puzzle pieces that fail to connect with each other to form a whole picture.James Gunn's take on the franchise is definitely a huge improvement from the forgettable first instalment, but wasted to much time trying to be funny and too little making the film go in the right direction.",The Suicide Squad

Yes it's rated R... yes it's got some violent scenes which are creatively toned down, and yah VERY adult themes... WHICH IT SHOULD, it's a Suicide Squad movie...That said, this movie is just pure fun. You're invested in the characters.... not gonna lie, it felt like an Avengers movie WITHOUT actually introducing the characters one by one.

It had the same problem Ayer's movie got: it didn't manage to make me care about the characters when they died, or otherwise. Insert tragic melodrama backstory with one scene blah-blah-whatever. Harley Quinn was very annoying and all of her scenes felt forced. The humor needed a lot of work too. I can't even talk about the plot because it was so very predictable.",The Suicide Squad

722,iamdcontingency,"Boring Begining and middle, great ending",6,11 September 2021,"Honestly, I didn't like The Suicide Squad when it began. Most of my favorite characters from the last movie (Suicide Squad 2016) were missing, new colorful and cliche characters were added and the movie was flled with unnecessary humor. The Suicide Squad looked more like a reboot than a sequel.And it was boring, like the first one hour of the film was dull, filled with silly melodramatic and comedic tropes and didn't have the charm and drive of the previous movie. Plus the character's personality were different, Flag seemed more naive and slower, unlike his tacic self-willed amoral self and Waller seemed uhinged. An hour and half into the movie I had dosed off multiple time. To me it was the worst movie in the DCEU.However the movie slowly started being interesting and 2hrs into the movie I was intrigued. The Suicide Squad is really a good movie filled with heroism, satire and unapologetically violent action scenese. Just that the beginning 2/3rds of it is very forgettablele.I still prefer the 2016 original movie tho!!",The Suicide Squad

Director James Gunn uses his talents to inject the film with his trademark comedic style. Over-the-top violence and physical comedy carry The Suicide Squad (2021) far, but sometimes too far. Poor writing creeps in with lazy crude humor, and due to the dedication to non-stop action the film often feels hallow.

It's the kind that has you asking ""what am I watching?!?"" through the entire movie yet you are on the edge of your seat. James Gunn did it again. He is essentially the only reason I bothered to see this and I will be seeing it again.",The Suicide Squad

And holy crap does it make the previous Suicide Squad look like crap! Yes I've said crap 3 times Lmao but THIS is his BEST film and honestly the BEST DC movie thus far!Think of Guardians of the Galaxy, but bigger, better, stronger and on crack lol! Every single character in this film is enjoyable to watch from the very start to finish. Even the main antagonists are enjoyable. Gunn got the perfect cast of Michael Rooker, Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Sylvester Stallone and more! Couldn't be a better cast, but I will say this, Idris Elba steals the show in this one in my opinion and it shows! Everyone else is phenomenal too, but seeing Elba's performance in this film kinda blew me away. I think it's his best acting performance I've seen in a movie. He's good in a lot of other things, but he shows so much emotions in this. There was a prison scene in this where he just knocks it out of the park, but of course I'm not gonna spoil it. Didn't know the main focus would be on him, but you really feel for his character, his fears, his struggles, etc. You also get to know everybody else's stories and you care enough for them as well! And the Shark and the Weasel LOL funniest and best characters in this! From going on crazy adventures, to being in due or die situations, badass gory executions and emotional conflicts throughout the film with these characters,
Gunn has established it extremely well to where you cannot be bored with this film.If not for the R rating, it probably wouldn't have been as fun, but the gore/blood in this is INTENSE! Be prepared! I was surprised how much gore I saw before my eyes and it's way more than the New Mortal Kombat! Visually stunning effects of the weapons, the scenery, the powers and abilities, the fight choreography, the random text in scenes, the cinematography, the soundtrack, just HATS OFF to the whole entire team on everything to make this masterpiece a FUN ride for the screen for the DC fans and regular audiences.

The Suicide Squad followed the horrible footsteps of Suicide Squad (2016) by killing off most of the cast within the first 15 minutes. The movie was filled with jokes that were told by actors who had no comedic background. The film lacked substance, plot, and it felt dry. I was majorly disappointed when I finished the movie and realized the 2016 Suicide Squad was actually better. Other than a few shots and scenes of amazing cinematography, it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life.",The Suicide Squad

739,sflanagan-47676,"Some Things Were Better, Some Were Worse",6,7 August 2021,"Overall the story was good even with all of the added silliness. The only real problem with the story was the lack of seriousness they gave Rick Flagg and Amanda Whaller in the film. Even though this style is a hallmark of James Gunn's latest films, I have a hard time believing the same Amanda Whaller who didn't hesitate to kill her staff in the first movie would put up with crap of her staff in the second film including being hit over the head with golf club. Add to that the fact Rick Flagg was played kind of like Draxx for comedic benefit.The body count pile up was fantastic to see even among the squad, although i was disappointed that Captain Boomerang, Savant and BlackGuard played such minor roles and bought it early in film.I do wish they would have explained in the film why we don't see Deadshot, Katana and Killer Croc in the film. They could have shown what they were up to or the squad had been doing between films as its implied they have been on many other missions. Maybe some short glimpses at the beginning of the film to flesh this out like in the first film would have appropriate as I also kind of miss the music video feel of the first film.Overall I'd say it's on par with the first film in my opinion and I'd personally like to see more of these made especially with this version of Harley, not the Birds of Prey version.",The Suicide Squad

The best way to explain the experience is a Marvel movie for a more adult audience.If I had one complaint it would be that the plot had some troubles pacing towards the middle with some weird jumps in time, but this movie in no way deserves the 1 star reviews I've been seeing and I suspect these reviewers haven't even watched it based on what I've been reading.Overall, I recommend watching The Suicide Squad.

1. The white alpha males turn bad or die. Even the white beta male is killed off. Or starts tough and ends up being a whimpering coward that runs away.2. Despite the two white people in the office having a problem with waller they do nothing and it takes a black women to stand up and do something.3. The bad guy president is also an alpha male.4. Bad guy scientist is also a white male.5. Waller, who is obviously a bad guy, is stopped but isnt punished in any way because she's black.6. Harley quin is bulletproof, I guess. She's a marry sue that no one is concerned about dying because we know they won't kill her off since she's female.7. Can't save quin because she's female so she has to save herself.The writing
1. The opening scene was pointless except to get quin and flag onto the island.2. The guard turns his back on quin close enough to be killed.3. In the club, they could've just killed the soldiers and moved on.4. The van shows up exactly where they crashed.5. This was an episode of Rick and morty.6. The bullets couldn't penetrate the eye but a spear could?7. Polka dots could've just killed the starfish early on at the base of the tower.8. Harley quin is a Mary Sue. Somehow all bullets miss her. They could've started with removing fingers but nope because the story.Other issues
1. The only characters that were both unliked and unnecessary were waller and quin.2. The reason the other characters deaths had an impact was because they were liked. If waller or quin died, no one would've cared. People actually might've been happy about it.3. A single rat is not gonna do much against a person.4. Harley quin. She works as a side character to The Joker and that's about it.There's probably more but that's what I got for now.",The Suicide Squad

752,2001mmFilm,They're Dying to Make You Laugh,6,17 August 2021,"There's a few good chuckles in The Suicide Squad. I think it's a given, since the movie is trying to pull off a gag for 99% of it's runtime... Isn't that a common appraisal of this movie though? That it's fun, and doesn't take itself too seriously? It's self-aware? That's great. All well and good. So why then, at the same time, do you have these forced emotional beats that totally play it straight? It's a clash, tonally, and the movie feels at odds with itself. It just becomes another superhero movie that tries to shove contrived, unearned gravity down your throat. It's like, didn't I just witness King Shark (Sylvester Stallone) devour a human being whole not two minutes ago? See Robert Rodriguez's Machete (2010) for a true self-aware action film that knows exactly what it's doing and how.The Suicide Squad (candidate for the most ridiculous sequel title of all time) is directed with great visual flair by James Gunn, of the MCU fame. He injects wild scenarios and bonkers profanity into this film. And yet, despite the R Rating, the movie feels reserved. It never takes the leap into something worthy of the rating, thematically. It's just an excuse for excess violence, which can start to wear thin in the wrong movie... This is one of them.There's a good cast however. John Cena is memorable as Peacemaker, Idris Elba gives his usual solid performance as Bloodsport, an obvious holdover for Will Smith's Deadshot of the 2016 film. I prefer Bloodsport, simply because his character wasn't completely squandered by the studio heads like Deadshot's in the compromised original. Daniela Melchior is specific and quite likeable as Ratcatcher II - although the forced backstory with her father (Taika Waititi for some reason) is typical superhero movie tripe. Margot Robbie has become increasingly annoying as Harley Quinn, downright insufferable on occasion, which is odd. She's a terrific actress and one would assume she could infuse the same charisma from The Animated Series into the character, but she doesn't, because the filmmakers don't want her to. It's 2021 now and they have to push an empowering female lead, who walks down a hallway in this film and literally slaughters twenty security guards with a javelin. She also has super-human leaping abilities now. It's like, what? What am I looking at? She's not a superhero. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is killed off in the opening ten minutes. Then later on, so is Rick Flagg, (Joel Kinnaman) the best character of the series for me. I guess James Gunn really disliked the original film, but couldn't get rid of Harley because, y'know, 2021, gotta have the fan-girls scream bloody murder in excitement whenever Harley snaps a soldier's neck with her thighs. Also, David Dastmalchian's Polkadot Man, a genuine humorous highlight of the film, at random reveals he's homosexual. It adds nothing to the character or the story, and I assume it's just there to fill Hollywood's new political quotas, or to stereotypically infer the reasoning behind his colourful polka dots... Either way, bad play, DC.There's an entire dialogue early on in the film devoted to Weasel. Pete Davidson inquires as to what ""breed"" it is, then one of the other guys suggests it could be an Afghan Hound. Why? They then reach the conclusion that it must be a werewolf, and Pete Davidson tries to squirm out of his seat in panic. The whole time I'm sitting there thinking where cinema went wrong, and just how much the superhero genre can suck. Ah well, seems regular audiences and ""film critics"" alike really dig this thematically hollow and extravagant action movie. I thought it was okay based purely on entertainment value. You can watch it, sure. Smile a couple of times, take in the visuals, but that's it. Should it aspire to more? Maybe not. Again, it's 2021, what do I expect?",The Suicide Squad

This is a silly, fun, comic book movie but it also has a lot of heart. Family and found family is a strong theme throughout, as is the power and value of the downtrodden, the marginalized, and the underdog. It also has a surprisingly strong anti-imperialist bent to it, and while James Gunn isn't afraid to offend or push boundaries, he also delivers a cohesive message that makes it clear who the real ""supervillains"" are. For a movie with such a grim title and prequel, it is uplifting and has a satisfying ending.That being said, there is a LOT of gore. Like, gratuitous, cross-section-of-a-person's-head-getting-sliced off-like-a-coconut-in-the-first-ten-minutes gore. Be ready for blood and guts exploding all over the screen. For the most part, it works with the tone of the movie, but I did find that some of the deaths felt wasted-that is, they added neither emotion nor humor.

Almost every second of this was just fun and emotional. I actually cared about the characters and I finally like Harley Quinn. There wasn't too much really bad about the movie, but I can admit that it may be too much craziness for some people. There is a lot of gore, so just be aware of that. Don't make the mistake that this movie is for kids because it isn't. It's a very heavy R rating. My main criticism is that not everything was executed perfectly and the movie does slow down a bit in the 2nd act, but the 3rd act definitely makes up for that. King Shark is fantastic!

780,Edward_Daniells,This is a James Gunn movie!,9,7 August 2021,"After the disappointment that was Suicide Squad 2016 I didn't put any faith or hype for this one to be good, but news that it would be James Gunn cheered me up a little since I like the director's work, but still I didn't put hype, but amazing because as soon as I had the opportunity to go watch it, I just loved the movie, the script is well constructed, the characters are charismatic and well developed, the direction is magnificent from the first scene, and the soundtrack is impeccable, even in the third act when it bursts is just wonderful with the scene and the color palette more vivid.I thought the movie's CGI would go downhill since almost every movie has CGI, but incredibly it stayed constant throughout the movie, I was shocked when I saw that, I didn't expect it.The unpredictability of the script is wonderful, because they are villains and Waller is a character who does everything no matter what to follow the rules given to her, it's just impossible to predict what will happen, several times I almost got up from my chair for the tension was so great that I was on tiptoe with anxiety.The humor is something much more acidic, because it's villains, some jokes are big or small, because some moments there are sexual jokes that end up being childish but it's so few moments that it happens that you still laugh because the movie's humor it's very good, I don't recommend seeing it as a family.In general I loved the film, you see it's a James Gunn film, that comes out when you put someone who knows how to work to direct a film where Estúdios doesn't stop the director from doing what he wants, I thought it was spectacular, so far this is best movie of the year, it was so good that i'm curious for future DC movies, whether it's going to take that new route or continue the mediocre old one.

Each one of the characters are so well written and are great in their way. In the previous Suicide Squad, the film was totally carried by Harley Quinn only, but this film, each character are so well written and brilliantly portrayed. It's funny, action packed and whole lotta fun. Really enjoyed it a lot. The action scene is also well choreographed and brilliantly executed while the comedy is genius. Peacemaker is just hilarious. Loved every characters. Ratcatcher 2 is one amazing character. Her relationship with Bloodsport is really good.The screenplay and direction are really good. And the soundtrack and score is brilliant. Every character is brilliantly portrayed. King Shark is adorably deadly. Amazing characters.The character, Bloodsport is similar to Deadshot but better in every possible way. Bloodsport > Deadshot.This is what the other film should have been in the first place. Would have loved to watch this in the theatres, but still enjoyed it at home.Would be great to make a sequel to the film. This is real fun.

783,ostlerb-02853,DC fails to take this movie seriously,1,7 August 2021,"I am flabbergasted by all of the positive reviews for this movie. Who in the world actually thinks this movie was done well? This movie has so many production issues that I can't even take this movie seriously.First of all, the ""humor"" is childish - the kind that would make teenage boys laugh (such as constant references to male parts).Secondly, the music never fits with the action taking place, thereby eliminating the element of suspense. When light-hearted music is being played during killing scenes, it doesn't give the feeling that any main characters are in any real danger.Third, the plot is confusing and disorganized. Half the movie does not occur in chronological order. The plot does not lead well from one scene to the next and does a poor job of building up suspense. Additionally, it has serious pacing issues (within the span of 60 seconds, Harley Quinn goes from meeting a guy to being engaged to him).The meta-human counterparts now on Task Force X are also plain silly, including a woman who controls rats, a man who throws polk-a-dots, and a shark man (yes, seriously). And get this...the enemy they are tasked to destroy is a ginormous, colorful, blue & pink starfish.Poor humor, a disorganized & confusing plot, and lack of suspense are some pretty good criteria for a bad movie. I think fans are just blinded by how much they love Harley Quinn.",The Suicide Squad

James Gunn knows how to write female character leads. The women within the suicide squad were among the most interesting characters within the team. I think the difference in writing is because if the female leads were male, we wouldn't notice a difference; in comparison to movies where the female lead's gender is too focused on, or writers don't make her struggle at all.I enjoyed all the violence, so I am going to re-watch it later on.

Harley Quinn got what she deserved. Margot Robbie proved again she's the expert playing as HarleyI expected actions from the civilians conquered by the Starro. Because of that Starro felt like a not properly used threat .

786,Polotovar,Better than back in 2016,7,5 August 2021,"After the above average Suicide Squad comes a new one, this time from James Gunn, and I can tell you it's good. In the first few minutes, we're introduced to the characters. They are, in my opinion, better and much more memorable. The best for me is still Harley Quinn, who could not be played by anyone other than the wonderful Margot Robbie. As for the new characters, I quite liked King Shark there. Next up are some excellent action scenes, which are unusually frequent for DC. Aside from being frequent, they are really good and Gunn's hand has made his mark on the CGI here, as Weasel like this reminded me slightly of Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. Where else the change in the director's chair was felt is without a doubt the music, which was really great and I devoured some scenes because they were epic, although I would add that there's not much play on any epicness here. In fact, the film throws in one joke after another. If you found 2016's Suicide Squad too ""serious"", then I have good news for you because the darker atmosphere has been replaced with a funnier one. To sum it all up. For me, a good film that has rectified the reputation of Suicide Squad and I wouldn't complain at all if there was a sequel that built on this 2021 Suicide Squad and forgot about the 2016 one. I'm not a hater of the older one. In my opinion, it had a darker atmosphere and smaller doses of jokes that I liked about it. But otherwise, the new Suicide Squad offered us much more and I can recommend it.",The Suicide Squad
787,Sooner_88,Great adaptation that redeems the true essence of these characters,9,17 September 2021,"**SPOILERS**Back when Suicide Squad (2016) hit theaters I was elated to see a comic book film that is finally getting a movie adaptation and of all things, it was DC's Suicide Squad. What can go wrong with Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Killer Croc, Katana, and Captain FREAKING Boomerang?? Well, a lot can go wrong with it. And not just go wrong. Terrible wrong. So wrong that I'm in the club that wants a directors cut to see what the actually vision could of been so I can change my mind on such a horribly plotted movie.Several years go by and now we get James Gunn's ""The"" Suicide Squad. And oh boy, was this a ride to remember. I loved the use of many villains as canon fodder, and the attention to detail that each character truly develops as the movie progressed. As far as negatives go I can touch up on a few along with the positive.THE POSITIVES:
The Team - I didn't have an issue with most the characters like some others would. This line-up and the cannon fodder team (comprised of c-list villains that die in the first 10-minutes of the film along with Captain Boomerang) was a joy to see brought to life.Harley Quinn - As always she's Harley, and having her flamboyant personality (love it or hate it) gives the other characters something to play off of. And in the case of the polka-dot man, it's quite hilarious. Like the scene with the death of a character named Milton as Polka-Dot man is distraught with fear that a good allied has perished and Harley only responds with ""Who's Milton?"" and later on remembers him by his deceased corpse that's played out in a scene of raucous. I got a dark sense of humor out of it.Blood-Sport (who's completely new to my knowledge never reading about him in the books) is a good replacement for the now AWOL Will Smith's Dead-shot.King Shark - Enjoyed the innocence of his revised and retooled character that Gunn presented. A more innocent King Shark compared to the books and CW Flash show. And he is also the comedic relief if not for another character that is just as bonkers as Shark is.Rat-Catcher - She is the heart of the film. Her personal relationship with Blood-Sport is like that of father and daughter. Her powers are also that on the side of the disturbing. (Hate rats)Rick Flagg - I enjoyed watching Joel Kinnaman back as the leader of a bunch of villains. A sort of man amongst monsters scenario that was put to good use in the first film that carried over to this film.THE NEGATIVES:
Peace-Maker - I don't personal care much for John Cena as an actor, but over time he's starting to come on his own in major roles that have put him in some major franchises following the Rock and Batista footsteps. What I'm upset about which is nitpicky is the LOOK and Aesthetic of Peace-maker himself. He resembles his comic book counter part fully in decorative form, but it comes off so goofy looking that I couldn't take him serious. And maybe that's the point, but the character was a always suppose to be taken seriously. He was created as a parable of Captain America where he would enforce peace with force if necessary (which I like that concept a lot) but for him to die and be brought back was a cop out. Brought back as in his show for HBO Max. I'll be checking it out but I hope somebody decides to give him a more cooler looking costume and ditch the corner looking helmet.Amanda Waller - Like the first movie, I thought she was the best thing to come out of it. Only this time there was little of her, and it was as if she was made out to be an idiot with a happy trigger finger who accepts mutiny by the end of the movie. Could of been used better and hopefully if there is a sequel they can do that.Captain Boomerang - Not much to say, other than the 2 minutes he's on film, he will remind you why he has the chops to make you laugh and why you might be disappointed that he dies really fast and sudden.All in all there might be somethings that I didn't like, but the plot and pacing where never an issue for me. I enjoyed the characters and the crazy, bonkers interactions they all make along the way to a very ironic end. They're Suicide Squad. There's going to be deaths along the way. Surprising ones. Unlike the first one that you knew from the trailer who was and wasn't going to make it.Great film, and recommend it to fans of horror and comic book movies alike! Just don't let your kids watch it.",The Suicide Squad
788,deny-966-237037,Awesome movie,10,8 August 2021,"I thought the first Suicide Squad was horrible, pretentious and badly written, and acting wasn't very good either.When someone told me this one was better I wasn't expecting it to be *this good*, so I felt I had to write a review.The Suicide Squad is incredibly entertaining and the jokes are actually funny, heck I laughed more than in some actual comedies. It's well written and directed with a lot of heart so you do get invested in the characters and cheer when they succeed at something, which is what superhero movies are all about. I don't really think it deserves a 10, but because I see a lot of idiots giving it 1/2 stars (why do you even watch superhero movies to begin with?), I felt compensation was in order.Worth a watch without a doubt, go see it!",The Suicide Squad

791,pooz_the_gun,I realize now why producers are often hesitant to kill off characters,7,29 October 2021,"Let me preface this review by stating, that I wasn't a big fan of the first movie for obvious and often previously mentioned reasons. However, for the first time in his career Jai Courtney managed to act in a way that was believable and likable at the same time. This resulted surprisingly in him being my favorite character in that movie followed by Rick flag and the crocodile whose name I don't remember.Coming to this film. This movie is doing a lot right that the original didn't. Give some gruesome deaths to members of the squad. The only problem is that if you kill off a character that the audience is invested in you should actually focus at least a bit on his death like it happened with rick flag in the latter part of the movie. That was an emotional, well paced death scene. Another small issue with killing off everyone at the same time in the beginning, while the idea is great of surprising the audience by it so that noone's safe, is on the other hand that you can't kill off anybody else until the finale hits which then goes back on that notion that everyone is fair game, which just isn't true. You don't feel any urgency until the final act. Now coming back to the beginning of the movie and killing off half of the cast that was promoting the movie. By killing off Captain Boomerang with all the others without giving him even more than one line of dialogue actually diminishes the first movie even more. He survived that movie only to die on an almost off screen level. His whole character arc went nowhere which is OK, but should've been handled at least in some kind of a meaningful way. Let him die 10 - 20 minutes later in a funny and gruesome way in the jungle maybe through a trap or however you want to. It would keep the audience in the edge and give the character a solo death which he deserved.Coming back to the overall movie. It's a funny movie with some minor pacing issues. The direction is nice. Cinematography is great. Acting is OK. The main characters are fun or serve their purpose well. The final battle wasn't quite my taste with that giant monster and it's miniature versions but I can see their appeal. The ending was alright, even though having peacemaker be the only one to survive something that should've killed him easily is questionable. That idris Elba and the Rat Girl survive was actually obvious but she turned out to be my favorite character in this movie so it didn't bother me. Silvester Stallone as the shark was astonishingly effective and funny.To summarize, fun movie with minor story issues and on a personal note I couldnt forget about Captain boomerang until they got out of the jungle at around the 1 hour mark because I was quite angry about the character's departure.",The Suicide Squad

There isn't much plot, the jokes mostly missed for me, and the action scenes were just your standard affair. Even Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn didn't really hit the mark in this like she did in the first movie. You could tell they tried to focus on her a lot in an attempt to save the movie, but the character wasn't given enough to do to justify the screen time. They stretched Harley Quinns/Margot Robbies act to the point that it almost became annoying and repetitive. Which is weird, because she was such a highlight in the first movie. I dunno.

I like Idris Elba, but his character ran pretty hot and cold throughout. So, overall, it could have been much better, but it wasn't really bad either.On second watching, I have to lower the score. The director seeemed to be trying way too harrd to shock us or surprise us with dumb gimmicks. Killing off most of the first suicide squad wasn't subversive. It was cheap.

804,Grey_rainbow,"Better than the previous one, but not a good movie in absolute sense.",5,6 August 2021,"I had high expectations since this was from James Gunn and because the trailer looked dope. However, the movie is disappointing. The first half is a mess and gets better near the end. There are some really good moments and sequences. But overall the movie feels superficial, hollow, forced, and disjoint, from the start till the end. At many points, one can clearly see misfit/out-of-place dialogues and scenes, which were made specifically for the trailer and then the makers failed to organically splice them into the rest of the movie. Why the Squad members start caring for each other so much (except Harley and Flag) remained a mystery to me (or might be it was all rushed and doesn't connect). The cuts at several places look disjoint and abrupt, and makes you wonder if the director (or anyone else) even watched the movie after the final edit. And to make it worse, the humor falls flat half the time. The movie is quite derivative too. It strongly reminds you of Deadpool-2, The Boys, and (maybe it's just me) Taika's Hulk.The best movie so far in DCEU is the Snyder Cut. And at the very bottom, there is the infamous Whedon's JL, Suicide Squad-1, and WW-2. This Suicide Squad can be ranked above the latter, ranked alongside Shazam, but
definitely far below Man of Steel, BvS, WW1, and Aquaman.",The Suicide Squad

The action was engaging and visually appealing. The cgi wasn't distracting which I've seen in past DC cinematic universe movies.Here's why I didn't score it higher. The exposition in the middle was boring and I lost interest. Ended up picking up my phone and it didn't pay off it the end. Some of the resolution felt forced which was unfortunate b/c up to that point they did well w/ moving the story along and having great chemistry between characters.

This film reads like it was written by a committee of 12 year old boys, in all of its immature glory. I don't think personally that there is anything wrong with films like this occasionally, but the film industry is now completely dominated by this sort of inanely childish ""content"" (because that is what this was, this was not a film).The cast was fairly likeable when they where given something to do, but the only character that had any sort of real arc was the daughter of Bloodsport (who had all of two minutes of screen time). Polka Dot Man was easily the most interesting on screen, but of course Gunn's need to shovel in as many pointless ""expectation subversions"" left me rolling my eyes during ""that"" moment.Even despite the occasional fun and gonzo creative moments, a lot of the humour just absolutely did not land. A lot of that had to do with how adolescent the jokes where, and how the entire thing felt like it was trying too hard.

809,Penis_in_the_butt,Quite good,8,1 September 2021,Very funny and very fun all around. James Gunn is at his best when he lets his freak flag fly. I'm almost disappointed that he's going back to working with the super restrictive Disney.,The Suicide Squad
810,snowadian,A bit overhyped,7,15 August 2021,"I enjoyed the direction Gunn went with this outing, it was different and I enjoyed the Rated R storyline. The characters were no where near as likeable as Guardians of the Galaxy which was a missing element for me. I found I wasn't really invested in any of them. Humour was really lacking as well, I found the majority of the jokes to be old and tired. My other gripe was the colour palette of the movie, extremely bland and boring. Robbie looks like Harley Quinn, but just can't seem to nail the character, I always feel like she's trying too hard and/or over acting.Beside that, I welcome the freshness for the genre and hope other directors get a chance to be totally unleashed like Gunn was.I will end by saying that even though this was an okay outing, I have no want to see a sequel or any spinoff stories. I hope this is a one and done situation and DC gets back to its better characters.",The Suicide Squad
811,tqmybbwr,FUN STUFF,9,8 August 2021,This was far superior to the 2016 version and Birds of Prey. Warner Bros did what every studio should do... Give complete freedom and surplus of cash to a creative genius like James Gunn. Fox pretty much did it with Deadpool and ''twas amazing. Disney you better take note and scratch The version of Star Wars you gave us and fire Kathleen Kennedy and give us what fans deserve. Good job Warner Bros and James Gunn!,The Suicide Squad
812,Kerry_Bradford,MUCH better than the first!,8,19 August 2021,"""The Suicide Squad"" was much better than the first. Characters are fleshed out better, the story is much more cohesive and there is gore that definately was missing from the previous film. James Gunn has a vision and he executes it damn near flawlessly.Idris Elba did a much better job than Will Smith as the leading character and this is coming from someone who isn't that much of an Elba fan. You tend to fall in love with all of the characters as they all have their own motives for what they do. I feel like Harley didn't get as much shine in this one as she's had a solo movie and the first suicide squad practically revolved around her.My only gripes are that, there are a few scenes of animal violence that could have been left out as they were unnecessary. My gf who is an animal lover was thankfully out of the room during that time or else she would have stopped watching right then and there. I also would have preferred the ""smart intellectual"" version of King Shark from the Harley Quinn animated show. I think he could have been an even bigger icon and had much funnier and witty conversations with his crew rather than being only able to utter a few words at a time.All in all, I highly recommend this movie if your looking for a good popcorn action filled time. Much better than the first and everyone involved from cast to behind the scenes did an amazing job.",The Suicide Squad
813,Mr_MickyKnox,Disappointing,4,8 August 2021,"Going by the reviews here, you're either going to love this, or hate it . Well I'm in the latter category to be honest .I wasn't a big fan of the first ""Suicide Squad"" movie but I thought it was entertaining at least, and i loved the psychotic Harley Quinn, so I was hoping for more of the same but maybe a better storyline , but this one is just so ridiculous ! The actual characters are nowhere near as good as the previous ones , even Harley Quinn has been toned down a lot, She's no longer the psychopath she was in the other movie, she's a numb version of her former self, which is a big shame .And John Cena's outfit is just sad btw .. end of . The story just doesn't go anywhere, its pointless and boring in very big patches throughout the film and I was tempted to switch it off . It would have got less than 4 stars from me if Margot Robbie and Idris Elba weren't in it, they keep this movie afloat... Just !",The Suicide Squad

815,briz_boy_10,Better than expected,8,17 August 2021,"I quite enjoyed David Ayers SS film, but i liked this one quite a bit more.From the trailers i thought it looked too overcrowded and extremely silly, making me think this would be some cringey kids version of SS. I was pleasantly surprised though after checking the film out. The Ayer version felt more like just a squad, than a suicide squad. Gunn changes that here.James Gunns films (minus Guardians) have always had some gore as an ingredient and it is definitely heightened in this movie and i am all for it.The opening scene is one of the best ive seen without giving too much away. It has humour, gore and just acts as a great premise for the movie.Its a slight shame we dont see some of the old crew from SS around but a few of the team come back. Margot Robbies Harley Quinn again is fantastic. Some of her action sequences are great and she is always funny but the whole squad has their funny moments. One person i liked a whole lot more this time was Rick Flagg - you could see the tone shift change with this character from the previous movie.The new additions are great - Cena and Elba have a fun and comptetative relationship, and PolkaDotMan and Ratcatcher 2 are also fantastic.The villain in the movie is maybe a bit bizarre and silly but i had such a blast anyway, i just had to embrace it. The only other minor flaw perhaps is that is goes on for maybe 15 minutes too long.Overall, a fun, gory rollercoaster ride. Hopefully theres a new SS film to queue up for soon.8/10.",The Suicide Squad

817,prateek-omaxe,A slight improvement,8,17 August 2021,This remake is slightly better than its predecessor though story is messed up as always. Why can't DCEU make movies like animation. With a sudden beginning and ending DC ruined this movie. This is why Marvel's is on while other level.,The Suicide Squad
818,ammoncrossette,The Suicide Squad (2021) is gross.,6,7 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad (2021) is gross.It could have been good. It could have been great. But the gore leaves you empty and makes all its whimsy fall short of laughter.Visually the film could have been magical. But for every disneyesque cartoon flower spilling out where blood should be, for every over exposed walk into the sunset, for every bad**s John Wick moment, there are at least 2 heads graphically split open or exploded, 3 bodies torn apart or splattered, several F words, and about ten or twenty civilian casualties ruthlessly gunned down by automatic fire or collapsing buildings.Given the option to rewatch this or the original I'd watch the original. At least I can watch all of that movie without disgust. Heck, I'd probably even watch Birds of Prey again first and that movie sucked.Aside from all the gore, what was left of the film is rather bipolar and disconnected. It doesn't flow great, and seems a bit of a chore to get the full story to unfold ( I guess that's why there are so many liberties taken with visual effects to keep it from being a total snooze.)In the end there is a great story there... but it's really only about a half hours worth of film.Characters are pretty good considering they are almost all filler. But the lead, played by Idris Elba evolves pretty interestingly and gives you a little bit of a good feeling in all the discombobulation. And Harley Quinn is a good support without being too much (except for one scene where her bad**sery is given a little too much liberty, but it works.)Over the top is what you should expect here, and that includes everything from villains to heros to gore. The campiness is that of a bad horror film against a backdrop of scene after scene of the most gruesome moments from Amazon's The Boys & a few Disneyesque moments to soften the impact.In some ways it's better than the first and in others it isn't even close. As far as continuity it's closer to Birds of Prey than its namesake predecessor, but story wise it fits more with the original.Great performances all around. Crap dialogue. Gore dominates over anything nice in this film. Resolve is as usual bittersweet.",The Suicide Squad

First time ever I have a 1 rating, would be a 0 if I could.",The Suicide Squad
820,ephilburn,Okay NOW we're talking!,7,13 August 2021,I hated the other suicide squad movie. I hadn't felt disappointed like that in a long time. But THIS. This fixed all of that. And I no longer hate Harley Quinn. Bonus. It's definitely has a guardians of the galaxy feel but it's DC and it's rated R. So yeah. THIS movie. Yes.,The Suicide Squad
821,simon-658-238496,"Predictable ""humor"" - wasted time",3,16 August 2021,"Predictable pseudo humor in most of the scenes, repetitive, nonlogic - no, sorry, this is just a gory piece of nonsense for kids.Expected better, actors (doing their job great) deserved better than this waste of money and time.",The Suicide Squad
822,grim2005,"Flawed, but Better than the First",6,6 August 2021,"The R-rated violence was entertaining and the humour was decent. Idris Elba and John Cena were great (especially when interacting with each other) and Margot Robbie was as entertaining as usual. In fact, the entire Suicide Squad were entertaining characters, at least after given some time to shine.Unfortunately, the movie is a bit dull when it doesn't focus on the aforementioned aspects. As per usual, the story is basically a vehicle to deliver action set pieces and jokes, so it offers little in and of itself. Almost every significant character outside of the Suicide Squad is uninteresting, and there's not a particularly interesting villain.The first half or so of the movie really falls pretty flat. The start of movie is
far less interesting than I'd want from something trying to convince you to stick with it for 2 hours (with only the beach scene being particularly good), Elba and Cena feel like they don't get enough dialogue (even if they likely have the most), and Robbie plays a relatively minor role.Had the movie just been a series of high-octane action scenes filled with graphic violence followed by comedic downtime scenes, it probably could have reached an 8/10, but there was far too much uninteresting downtime with little-to-no humour to help, and it took half the movie for it to really find its footing.",The Suicide Squad
823,dcoke25,"IS IT PERFECT, NO...But damn good.",8,21 August 2021,"I love it, and thanks to AT&T, I get HBOMax for free. NEAT. This was worth that bonus perk.James Gunn CLEARLY likes comics, and it shows in this movie and showed in Guardians of the Galaxy; none of the characters were insulting (outside of Harley, we'll get to her), and Gunn, nails it with the weird side character; The Weasel. And it seems DC/WB/AT&T allowed him to make at least ONE superhero character up, TDK and he's great for how worthless and awful he is.The movie is great, well paced, and timed. I've watched it 5 times now, also the soundtrack is pretty strong, but to be expected from James Gunn.Harley Quinn, what a botched character in both versions of this attempt to bring this group to the screen. Now, I'm not a comic reader, watched the cartoons as a kid, where she made her appearance. MY understanding is she was a REALLY skilled psychologist, who knew how to use her sexuality to manipulate criminals to help them, extract info out of them, etc. Was tasked with trying to rehab The Joker, he broke her, she became infatuated, etc. THOUGH, even as a sidekick, she still retained her intelligence and used it at times, even appearing as her Doctor form in the series. Yes the Joker Serum did some damage but not enough to make her an idiot like in this movie. The jokes for her are terrible. Rat Catcher 2, at least, is a well written character. There is ONE scene in this movie that harkened back to the GOOD Harley Quinn. When the dictator is trying to woo her. Then ultimately fails to.Also, no female nudity in this film that I can think of, some male nudity, weirdly enough, but not female. HUH. It's gory but earned. Never gratuitous. I didn't realise the Shark was played by stalone, didn't really know the cast, so when I watched it the second time, with that fact, it was easier to see that. But Gunn kind of pulls a Groot (which is a fitting comparison, two lumbering maybe special-needs characters), where ther is an effect on the voice that masks it.The characters were good, the action was great, amazingly controlled-chaotic camera work. LIKE, IT MADE SENSE, the camera movements. It wasn't like a ""Taken"" film. The camera moved with the characters in a fluid way. Seriously, those people were amazing. So many great shots.Only major issue I had with this film, was addressed in the ending. There is always that one character on the team that is so GROSSLY OP-ed in these films that could literally end the film, in this case, (about) an hour in. When that person's power was explained, that was my first thought, then they close proving my point in the end battle. It's not Polka Dot Man, though it did seem like those dots can literally tear through anything. SO maybe. At least with the end battle; they kind of explain away why his Dots don't do what they should do, due to an extremely fast regenerative ability.90% of the humor works, but again, for whatever reason, they gave all the worst gags and jokes to Margo. It's like DC actively hates that character. She was literally one of my favorite characters from the Animated Series.In conclusion, this marks the 2nd REALLY GOOD DC movie, the first one being Shazam. THIS, again, is a great lesson in, LET THE DIRECTOR MAKE HIS MOVIE, and STUDIO STAY OUT OF THE WAY. Wonder Woman 1 was okay. And I'm not sitting through 4 hours of Justice League. Normally, I'm a marvel fanboy. And while slightly ""MARVEL"" formula-lite, it doesn't come off as trying to APE marvel. They're having fun, and that's what people want, FUN superhero movies, put on the stupid costumes that would be impractical in the real world. Make they silly and colorful like Polka Dot Man's outfit. This was a nice happy median between modern superhero movies and comics classic.",The Suicide Squad

829,puzgolac,Completely ridiculous - and not in a fun way,3,7 August 2021,"I am aware that this is a superhero movie - i.e. The movie equivalent of a junk food, but I still expect it to have at least a coherent plot, which it doesn't. Aside from the completely ridiculous plot which makes absolutely no sense, here are just some of the things wrong with this movie:Uninteresting, undeveloped characters. No reason to care for any of them. Any depth can only be acquired from previous knowledge (i.e. The comics), not the movie.The bad guys are actually good guys cliche. Never mind the horrible things they did earlier that got them in prison in the first place, now they are selfless good Samaritans.Harley Quinn apparently has superpowers now - super strength, agility, endurance. We are not talking about ""peak human performance"", she is effectively a meta-human here. Also, her character is extremely annoying and cringeworthy.Then, there's the cartoonish villain that wants to do... what exactly? I'm not sure that anybody, including the people who made this movie, knows that.Also, government has been experimenting on the monster villain for 30 years and made exactly zero progress. During that time the monster grew several hundred times bigger and, presumably, stronger and more dangerous, yet nobody at any time thinks about killing it? Even when the monster gets loose and starts wreaking havoc the American government is like - just let it be, we don't care. Isn't it reasonable to think that it could pose a threat for the rest of the world?Especially ridiculous is the fact that the monster is invulnerable to bullets, grenades and any kind of high powered weapons, but is at the same time extremely vulnerable to bites and pokes with a pointy stick.Add to that the obligatory lame jokes and one liners that plague every superhero movie nowadays and you have yourself boring and unpleasant 2+ hours of cringe.",The Suicide Squad

I hope all these huge Hollywood stars felt proud of their work, pocketed the money & ran as the finished product after they'd left the set was totally unworthy of their talent.

Jmes Gunn did his thing in terms of letting us care about the characters, the story was very interesting, it's bloody, unapologetic, has a sense of emotional weight to it and it has badass action sequences that screams awesomeness. The cast is great as well. Loved all of the characters in this team but there is not one, not two, but 5 standouts here, including John Cena as Peacemaker, Sylvester Stallone as King Shark and of course, the heart of the movie herself: the lovely and amazing Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2/Cleo Cazo, so much of the team's emotional and great character moments come from her and I can't wait to see what else Daniela does next because I love her and not
to mention, Sebastian was adorable. I do want to see more of Ratcatcher 2 in the future. Also, Viola Davis, Steve Agee and Jennifer Holland were amazing.

834,FreddieLee04,An Edge-of-your-seat gore-fest that more than tops the first movie.,8,2 August 2021,"James Gunn might just be the most reliable comic-book movie director working today. He just gets the sub-genre so well. His own spin that he puts on these movies- that mostly feature less-known comic-book characters- is so comedic and filled-to-the-brim with mad action, that you can't help but connect deeply with these characters that unless you were a die-hard comic reader, you'd have never met or perhaps even heard of, before. Credit to Mr. James Gunn, and credit to Warner Bros for realising that a Suicide Squad movie needs to be unhinged, and props to them for finally understanding that in order to get that, you need to give the director full control- sorry David Ayer!Idris Elba's ruthless mercenary 'Bloodsport' leads this band of mad bad-guys, with Joel Kinnaman's returning 'Rick Flag' and the fan favourite 'Harley Quinn' (played brilliantly by Margot Robbie) act as his second-in-commands. However, the two characters that shine best for me were John Cena's 'Peacemaker'- a violence-obsessed hitman always looking to one-up Elba, and David Dastmalchian's 'Polka Dot Man', who is a quirky, quiet supervillain who longs to be a superhero but is tragically plagued by his traumatic past (involving none other than his own mother).Despite the cliche plot and underdeveloped villains, The Suicide Squad builds to an awesome third act that is actually the best that the DCEU has produced yet! What stops it from toppling 'Man of Steel' as the best DC extended universe movie is the slightly less impressive score and, obviously, a villain that is nowhere near as memorable as Michael Shannon's excellent turn as Zod.Still, a damn fine movie. An excellent one- by comic-book movie standards.",The Suicide Squad

836,OwensDad1,Expectations too high?,7,7 August 2021,"Slightly disappointing, and not as fun as I had hoped. I preface this with, my expectations may have been entirely unattainable. It's a good film but one that could have been great.Let Down: The African American assassin doing it all for his daughter. Didn't we see this in the first Suicide Squad? I loved Idris Elba's performance, it was excellent. But the arc is the same as Deadshot's. It felt like rinse and repeat. The soundtrack didn't seem to flow like we see in other Gunn films. Some of it felt a bit forced or out of place. I felt Gunn loved the Rated R aspect entirely too much. Some of it worked, but in other places I was saying to myself 'ok we get it'.The movie felt disjointed for a good portion of its run. When they cut between the scenes with Harley and the scenes with Task Force X, for an extended period of time, it felt like two separate movies. Not the typical 'when they finally get the team back together it will be incredible' feeling you get when we have these set ups. For example, GOTG 2. We couldn't wait for Rocket, Yandu and Groot to get back with the main team. There was build up, excitement. Here it just felt too disconnected.The Good: Again, Elba's performance is great. The heart of the movie for me was Ratcatcher 2 and Polka Dot Man. The emotion and the feeling with these two characters truly resonates. And Robbie as Quinn is great, unfortunately we don't get enough of her.The Surprising: I am not a John Cena fan. Something about his smugness really bothers me. He's great here. Does a great job as a sadistic Capt America or Homelander for our The Boys fans. Loved King Shark as well. I thought it would be as a ridiculous as a talking tree but, as with Groot, I was wrong. It absolutely works and Stallone was great! Finally, Flagg's ending. I couldn't believe how much I felt in that scene. I didn't love the iteration of Flagg in Suicide Squad. But here, Kinnaman brings it in a big way. And Waiti, for his short time on screen was brilliant.Overall, 7 out of 10.",The Suicide Squad

This movie is certainly in the top 3 DCEU movies in my opinion. And to be honest In my list it will come on TOP in the DCEU movies list. Its characters and actors are strong points. Story too, is well written. No doubt far better than the previous Suicide squad movie. Casting looks perfect for me and actors/actress has done their job very well. Peace maker whose ways for making peace are very violent, Bloodsport who is a bad guy but somewhere good is in him. Our beloved Harley Quinn is also there to annoy or better say entertain us and the best thing in this movie is King Shark. Polka dot man and ratcatcher you just name all characters are written very well, dialogs are good and memorable. Little bit of backstory/introduction is also given for all main characters, except Harley as we have already seen her backstory in previous DCEU movies. So non comicbook fans will also not be confused. Not just superhero fans, casual watchers can also enjoy this movie who don't know much about DC. And I loved the Humor/Dark humor.

This movie was definitely energetic , fun and a nice improvment for DC overall.The visuals are great and there are a lot of really nice effects and gore effects that really make this movie stand out and that is why I am glad this movie is R rated.Idris Elba and King Shark were a standout for me . I think Elba was a perfect casting choice.Harley Quinn was also a nice improvment from Birds of Pray.With all those positive things being said there are a lot of things that in my opinion could have been done much better.In my opinion , not a single character in this movie was really relatable.I kind of liked Idris Elba and Rick Flag but honestly I still think Will Smith as Deadshot was way better and his relationship with his daughter was much better done in that movie in comparison with Elbas character.The second thing that I hated was how this movie plays in the first hour. The whole first hour plays like a comedy. Just joke after a joke and some of them were honestly not funny at all.After an hour I really enjoyed more impactful action and unexpected twists that really made this movie a unique experience in my opinion.Overall I rated this movie 7/10 just because it was fun , visuals were great and plot was interesting enough not to bore me but in all honesty it will be forgettable in about a week.

Highly recommend for any DC or comic book fan.",The Suicide Squad

I thought it was wack.It tries too hard to be funny, and with the exception of maybe 1-2 occasions, it isn't.One thing it did get right though, was the US fawking up yet another Latin American country (albeit a fictional one).At least John Cena was better here than in Furious 9 (not saying much).

Ever since James Gunn was announced to direct I had a feeling it was going to be good and it did deliver.My favorite part of the movie has to be the brilliant cast, a lot of big names and they all worked well together.Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn once again is my favorite character. Idris Elba played a leader and did good. John Cena delivered and I am excited to see the new Peacemaker series. Sylvester Stallone as King Shark has to be one of the highlights. Daniela Melchior was one of the people who made the movie so good. David Dastmalchian another gem had a really good performance.When are we getting a Ratcatcher 2 and King Shark movie/series? I loved the two of them together.Don't get too attached to any of the characters, some were gone too soon, others at the right time.Violent and funny, although some of the jokes felt forced and didn't land for me.Overall it is a good movie, enjoyable, fun, and one that balances a dark and light mood.

By that time, the one you truly care for were still safe anyway.Idris Elba was great. Margot was great too. I do like Rick Flag more in this movie compared to the other suicide squad. Thank goodness they throw away that silly romance.Amanda Waller's character... was even worse for me. She's even more annoying in here but at least less dumb with her grand plan.Overall the plot wasn't bad. Runtime went a bit too long for my liking. Some more tight editing would be nice. The back and forth gets bit tiring, and the sequence with saving Harley Quinn (that they stupidly reveal in the trailer... talk about killing your own joke) should have used the flashback instead of revealing the escape and then continued on with the trying to save her joke sequence...Tdlr. It is watchable with lots of blood and killing. Also Sebastian is the goodest boy.",The Suicide Squad

The theme of suicide is so prevalent the direction and writing is great. A lot of James Gunn type things in this movie similar to guardians of the galaxy but you can tell he had a lot of freedom to do whatever he wanted with the Rated R tag on this film. Very fun and entertaining movie and a great film for DCEU.,The Suicide Squad
863,s-63051,What a load of crap,1,10 September 2021,I watched the suicide squad the other night as it was my husband's turn to pick a film. This film isn't even worth one star. I feel sorry for the actor's who agreed to be in this film because if idris elba( who I like watching) hadn't already made it in films and tv this would have finished his career.

I don't pay much attention to that so I just watched it because I like a lot of the DC and Marvel movies. The first suicide squad was better than this one. The squad doesn't act like villains at all. I also feel like everyone (including Harley) was watered down. Sure the movie is gory, but no one is menacing (the squad or any of the villains). The comedy was just ok. I love comedic breaks in action movies, but these were just meh. (Harley trying to figure out who Milton was was actually really funny though). For me though this is one of the stupidest movies I've seen. There were just too many times I looked at my husband and ""Um that's just dumb."" I like the first Kingsman movie and thought Birds of Prey was pretty good. So I get the genre, but this one is just bad. I feel for the actors because I think they did what they could but the movie just didn't work for me.",The Suicide Squad

Disappointing. Margot Robbie saves Harley Quinn.in both the prior movies. But this one...DC realized why Deadpool and Joker did so well. Because the comic book kids are all grown up now and we don't want some cheesy Disney mush! This was fantastic. The cameos are epic wish they had more screen time (especially Nathan Fillion). Right off this is how a DC movie should be. Only reason a 9 instead of a 10 is they tried too hard to be quirky sometimes. Overall.. GREAT JOB DC!,The Suicide Squad

873,looking_Work,Tries too hard,5,9 August 2021,"I watched this twice and still don't understand why people think this movie was so great. Could be because the previous Suicide Squad was so bad. I enjoyed the rivalry between Peacemaker and Bloodsport. Unfortunately I believe Idris Elba played this character all wrong. Weasel was an enjoyable character and I think Rat Catcher 2 really held the team together as its' heart. I did not find King Shark as humorous as many did but enjoyed him during the pre-climax climax (if you watch the movie then you will know what I mean). Viola Davis nailed it as Amanda Waller. I could just visualize her in the comic every time she was on the screen. Harley's character was given abilities that she does not possess which detracted from my immersion into the movie. Apparently she now has super strength, is as good a 'marksperson' as dead shot, as deadly as Lady Shiva and has the healing powers of Wolverine. Harley was a psychiatrist who happened to lose her marbles treating the Joker. This, plus a story almost as weak as the first, is the reason for my rating.",The Suicide Squad

878,SteveFOX_86,"Much better, but nothing spectacular",6,7 August 2021,"James Gunn clearly knew what needed to be done and did it in almost the best possible way, but still this is nothing more than a slightly above average action/comedy popcorn flick.Editing, screenplay (if there was one besides key story and action sequences, felt like it was improvised a lot) phoned in performances and over the top but badly done CGI gore really kept the movie from getting a higher score for me.It's entertaining, colourful, fun at times, but that's about it. It's an improvement over the first one, but the whole premise is never going to amount to anything more, unless you care for these characters, and frankly both movies missed that point a lot.A lot of it is maybe down to really phoned in performances from lead actors, but the points where they made it so the characters had backgrounds and you were supposed to fill something for them just didn't work at all. I don't know, still can't decide between if that was a parody, or just really rushed script.In cinemas it should be a fun ride, or watching at home with your buds and a few beers, but don't expect anything more.",The Suicide Squad

884,VVirak,Scotch and water. Hold the Scotch.,6,11 September 2021,"The ""Waterboy"" line perfectly sums up this movie for me -- it's a Marvel movie with gore, except it isn't Marvel. Granted, ""The Suicide Squad"" is among the more successful post-Nolan entries into the DC cannon, but it just can't replicate the history we have with the MCU characters (trapped between The Dark Knight trilogy and The Justice League to counter The Avengers, DC is neither here nor there). Still, it's good fun and I had a nice time at the cinema, but not much stays with you afterwards (also, not a fan when a movie expects you to react a certain way and this one pushes you a few times towards certain reaction - one of the ways to break the movie spell is see a formula behind it).

Now that isn't too hard to accomplish since the first Suicide was just a mess, but still, this is a great movie on it's own. This is a semi-reboot because they are so embarrassed of the first movie, which is why I think they didn't just call this one ""Suicide Squad 2.""

889,itzakkunwarak,This one is horribly beautiful,9,6 August 2021,"From the horribly beautiful mind of James Gunn, The Suicide Squad is finally out and is a non-stop joyride from start to finish. The Suicide Squad felt like a love letter to DC nerds everywhere, willing to engulf its main cast in the wacky regalia of their comic counterparts, where many other films of the genre would typically shy away in favour of tactical jumpsuits.Talking about the performance, my darling Harley Quinn's character is portrayed once again by the Margot Robbie and she is always so freaking awesome. It seems as if she was born to play the character of Harley Quinn. Idris Elba, as Bloodsport is good. John Cena as Peacemaker is so dumb good and his chemistry with Bloodsport is extremely entertaining to watch. Daniela Melchior, as Ratcatcher is so cute to watch. The rest of the character are also very good.The background music, cinematography, action choreography, editing are of world class. The story of the movie is horribly beautiful just like the mind of James Gunn. This movie breaks the rule of plot armour and is a perfect standalone movie.This trash poetry of James Gunn, shows its R rating violence in a stylish and comedic way to justify the title of the movie The Suicide Squad.You may be wondering whether this is a remake of, or a sequel to, David Ayer's 2016 Suicide Squad. It's a reasonable question. But one which new writer-director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) answers by effectively saying: 'Don't worry about all that. Let's just have some fun.'

I wish we had Dead Shot for the 1st movie hear but instead we got Edris Elba playing as Blood Sport. He was still brilliant and I am guessing they couldn't get Will Smith back so this was an alternative. I am baffled that they managed to get Sylvester Stallone to act the Shark as this isn't something I would expect to see him doing.

891,Tuefer_Benz,Flawed by overindulgence,7,6 August 2021,"A slapstick comedy in which brain splattering takes the place of pratfalls, it makes the Deadpool movies seem restrained in comparison. Not necessarily a good thing. Turns into a mean-spirited horror-comedy, a big budget Troma. Sadly, most of the best moments are in the trailer, except for a handful like the Ratcatcher flashback.Overreliance on 'Long setup... Sudden reversal!' Examples: the Deadpool 2 / MacGruber-esque false beginning, Flag was a guest rather than a prisoner, Harley Quinn whirlwind romance with the general, the depressive, self-effacing Polka Dot Man ""I'm a superhero!""Nazi research facility and US space program seem shoehorned together. Kind of an indirect Operation Paperclip reference? Why does Waller tolerate deadpool (not the character) betting between the very people who have a conflict of interest between keeping operatives alive and letting them die? Waller kills a roomful of innocent people just for knowing too much in the first one but doesn't disappear employees who let her get knocked out and contradicted her orders? Also, wouldn't Starro, which can keep multiplying extensions of itself, constitute a global threat as grave as Enchantress and Incubus? So pretty dumb of Waller to be okay with that. Was Blackguard's name always pronounced that way? If I had been more into it, these questions probably wouldn't have occurred to me. A lesser DCEU and a lesser Gunn.",The Suicide Squad

893,rokomo,"Colorful, wonderful, just... Unbeliveable - movie that deserves his place in DCEU who is unfortunetaly full of miscarriages. Good news - movies are getting better and better.",7,6 August 2021,"I watched this movie in cinema the day before last. I started to watch movie with low expectations, but I was pretty wondered.James Gunn is great director and his type of directing is really characteristic. The film combines multiple sub-plots, and really, number of characters that worked togheter is really impressive.The film has its flaws, of course. Humor is sometimes really forced, there are some holes in the conspiracy (specifically, it's not clear how Blackguard collaborated with the bad guys and how Amanda Waller came back after they overthrew her), massacre at the opening wasn't really necessary and flashbacks could be a bit longer in some cases because it all seems like this a bit messy (although they are really cute).Despite this being a superhero movie, the characterization of the characters was really fantastic. Their development and relationship and how it all overlaps with their backgrounds and general ideologies. Personally, I liked Ratcatcher II the most because of its touching background and interesting way of thinking. Peacemaker was quite an interesting character who abruptly became a villain later, and his comeback in the end was quite interesting to watch even though let's be honest he was a bit predictable. The character of Idris Elba is similarly formulated as that of Will Smith from a few years ago and it's a clear middle finger to him, but let's be honest, Idris Elba is better because Will Smith as usually played Will Smith while Idris Elba got right into the character.The film is extremely brutal as it fits for one The Suicide Squad, not the pretentious shame we got a few years ago.Finally, this is THE Suicide Squad. This is a movie I laughed at, during which I was almost torn by a couple of heartbreaks, which softened me, but eventually awakened in me a glimmer of euphoria. The film is truly full of life and colors and I enjoyed every moment of it. The second best DCEU movie after also very new Zack Snyder's Justice League, franchise is getting better.Synopsis: Not without flaws, but still extremely entertainming.",The Suicide Squad

895,ayaa1977,As good as reviews suggest,9,6 August 2021,"I had a blast watching The Suicide Squad, which was the best good time I had in cinema in a long, long time. It ia weird, twisted, nasty, bloody, gory, and so so funny. The film opens with fantastic fake out that came from the Deadpool playbook, and it genuinely surprised me. It cleverly introduces a host of new characters, reboots the series, and emphasizes how dangerous it is to be a part of the Suicide Squad. It also reminds you how badass and ruthless Viola Davis's Amanda Waller is, as well as how badass and deranged is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. The latter gets her own side adventure, which gives her the opportunity to have her own short fim within the film, and Robbie proves all over again why Harley Quinn is one of the best DC characters of recent memory.The core of the newcomers squad members consists of a mish-mash of anti-heroes led by a suave Idris Elba as Bloodsport. He is the reluctant leader of the bunch, mirrored by a squad member with similar skills (Peacemaker played by John Cena) who is a spoof of the All-American G. I. Joe type. Ratcather 2, Polka-dot Man, and King Shark round up the Suicide Squad, which is newly branded as ""Task Force X"" (because Suicide Squad is apparently bad for morale), and you could not ask for weirder, more haphazardly assembled yet wonderful team than this one. The mission they are coerced into doing is to destroy Jötunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory in the South American island nation of Corto Maltese. From their craziness ensues in the bloodiest, most visually creative and playful way. The squad's main mission is put on hold at first to rescue Colonel Flag (returning player Joel Kinnaman), which leads to another mission to rescue captured Harley Quinn, and both rescue missions, we found out, are elaborate jokes by writer/director's James Gunn that have hilarious punchlines. The film keeps reinventing itself and changing gear from one moment to another, which made the 2hr+ runtime zips away without a dull moment.I came to this film fearing that there is too much high praise heaped at it, and that it could not possibly live up to the hype, only to be pleasantly surprised of how much I genuinely loved it. The Suicide Squad is cinematic escapism in the most wonderful way possible, and I can't wait to rewatch it again and again.",The Suicide Squad

Of course the good guy will cough twice and then recover.)How many cliches can you pack into a film?Band of misfits with character flaws that will doom the mission? Check.Government Conspiracy? Check.People with no reason to trust each other, trusting each other? Which ends badly? Check.Gang meets in a strip club? Check.

No way, man.They kill off the most interesting characters in the opening act, and they don't come back.The whole caper is to cover up an embarrassing secret US government conspiracy. The suicide squad can reveal it but they don't, because that would be Bad For America. Hunh?The last scene should have been Idris Elba calling Viola Davis the worst insult in the english language (the one the Brits use casually but only Samantha Bee can summon the courage to use over here), then he presses the ""play"" button to broadcast the incriminating video globally, while she simultaneously blows up his head remotely.Nothing that interesting happens.How much was Nathan Fillion paid to be in this thing?",The Suicide Squad
898,Gpanther67,The rare sequel that is better than the original!,7,10 August 2021,"""Suicide Squad"" was by no means a classic, but it was better than your average DC film and now James Gunn has showed how much a DC film can have the heart and humor that Marvel films usually have over thier rival. Sandwiched between an odd opening and ending, the film features a great cast and shockingly Margot Robbie is not the MVP of this Squad as she was the last film. Idris Elba gives the film its most entertaining character and Daniela Melchior its heart.

899,mynros,A Starfish Movie,1,14 August 2021,"Approximately 150 million + USD, 2000+ people as in cast and staff, probably much more uncredited, excellent source potential from DC, unlimited potential and ideas, and this is what they make. Even though you can't blame the cast too much, as they're trained to do what they're told - banausic; however, writer, director, producer, studio should be ashamed of themselves for the monumental waste of time, effort, money, and talent squandered in this production of silliness. I do not understand why this movie can be given anything more than 4 stars, let alone 10 - I suppose some of that 150+ million was spent on hard advertising, ratings, and, of course, stars - I gave it 1 star for its rebarbative effects, and for it being obnoxious and profoundly stupid.",The Suicide Squad

901,Lancechristopher77,I enjoyed it,7,31 July 2021,"I am in two minds about this film.On one hand, I really did enjoyed it well enough.However, I'm in no rush to see it again and it was rather... dull... in places.Not something I thought I'd ever say about a James Gunn movie.The beginning is great fun, and I don't know where else they can take the Harley chatacter after this (other than maybe a prequel?), and there are plenty of funny moments with some great action beats.It just felt a little... I don't know.Maybe because Gunn was clearly let off the leash he didn't have to restrain himself and so moments that may have been handled with more care were allowed to simply explode?There is a lot of blood and gore, which is not necessarily a bad thing.As I said, I enjoyed it, and I will watch it again someday, I'm just in no big rush to revisit it.A generous seven out of ten.I've read the Suicide Squad and DC comics for a very long time, and all the low reviews with the 'restore the Snyderverse' hashtag can go away.",The Suicide Squad
902,sciencguy,When cocaine meets CGI,1,17 October 2021,"This appears to be the result of the writer having unlimited access to very good drugs and the director having an unlimited budget for CGI. No story? No problem. No rules of engagement? Does it really matter any more if people or monsters get thrown around or hit by hundreds of bullets? Not until after the two-hour mark it doesn't. Bad acting? Apparently it's expected. Margot Robbie struts and poses her way through this derivative piece of garbage, spitting out her words like they were covered in excrement, which they pretty much are.

Great action, Harley, Bloodsport, King Shark were great and I liked certain character interactions, large set pieces. There were some political themes that really was done well in this film; when you see it you'll know what I'm talking about and it had a few great emotional momentsWhat I didn't like: most of the jokes didn't land w/me (Gunn's style of humor isn't my cup of tea; I only laughed a handful of times but that's it), when Peacemaker was trying to be funny, it seemed too contrived; still on the fence about him overall. There was also a lot of pacing issues; parts of the film dragged too long as if they were saying ""we'll wait for you to laugh before we move on."" I have a few minor nitpicks but I don't want to spoil anything on here.Overall, while I'm not on the ""one of the best comic book movies of all time"" train, I think it was a solid film.",The Suicide Squad

The content of this movie (excessive gore/violence, crude themes and a dry sense of humour), is definitely not for everyone, but for those that are looking for some extreme guilt free entertainment, this might be for you!There are many jokes/elements that you really wouldn't expect to find in a movie like this, but I just thought that added to the character.By no means a 10/10 film, but I am pretty comfortable with my 8/10.",The Suicide Squad

James Gunn is the ultimate comic book movie genius for team ups that no one asked for but everyone loves. Very few directors can take little known characters and make the audience care for them. His perfect orchestration of emotions, action, and humor is unmatched. This isn't your cookie cutter superhero movie that plays by the rules. Gunn takes a lot of risks but the payoff is fantastic if you just sit back and enjoy instead of wishing for it to be something you've seen a million times.

That is the biggest reason for my low rating.This have the same story, we already know people are going to die so it is not shocking when bunch of them die in the beginning and most of the jokes are in the trailer. So I enjoyed the movie but didn't love it.Everybody agrees on one thing, Margo Robbie is great as Harley Queen however we didn't get enough Harley scenes in this movie and Robbie's biggest action scene is plain boring.

917,berk_ozenc,I've got what I wanted in general.,7,12 August 2021,"I have to admit that at first, I did not care about the movie at all because I thought it would be impossible to introduce around 15 characters in only one film and did not trust DC. However, after I saw that many people liked the movie, I started to expect something. And I can happily say that movie meet my expectations and I liked it. So now it is time for me to say that DC is starting to redeem itself.I expected this movie to have entertaining scenes and characters with some gore in it, so as you can guess, I left the cinema saloon very happily. James Gunn nailed to make the movie extremely entertaining. He also succeeded in introducing many characters to us sympathetically in a single film. I think he has a great style, but I still think that the film got too childish at some moments even though it is R-rated. As I said, I loved his style in general, especially for action scenes, but when many titles show up, and every character is trying to be funny, it just does not feel like an actual film. I also liked that the movie had a clear story. It did not change its focus and still gave us a plot twist, although I still think that they may have worked on that plot twist a bit more. I also think that film sometimes tried to become too emotional but instead killed the vibe. I loved how the film made brave choices, and I will not mention anything further for no spoilers.My final remarks: I think it was a genuinely entertaining movie, and I would suggest you expect something less serious.",The Suicide Squad

935,MoviePeek,The real Suicide Squad,8,18 October 2021,"Many films of recent memory have failed to live up to their title; not a single deadly arachnid was present in Black Widow and last year's big pandemic release Tenet, failed to feature an individual taking residence in rented accommodation, where month in month out he tossed his income into an endless cash sinkhole with nothing whatsoever to show for it, only for his moss-eyed landlord to arbitrarily decides he wants to turn the residence into a breakfast bar and you have less than a fortnight to find somewhere new to live. The Suicide Squad finally puts an end to the long legacy of disappointing titles and fully delivers on the promise of its name.Directed by James Gunn, who previously directed both installments of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, The Suicide Squad, much like Gunn's previous works features a rag-tag group of misfits who must put their personal differences aside and learn to work together for the greater good, saving the world and possible themselves along the way. However, it cannot be overstated that The Suicide Squad is a very different beast from the Guardians series. For one, DC's flick carries a more mature rating (15 certificate in the UK), enabling The Suicide Squad to get away with a hell of a lot more bad language and dismemberment than Guardians of the Galaxy ever could. But The Suicide Squad's real drawing point is the very concept itself, as it features a large roster of obscure D and F list ""super villains"", any of which could be offed at any moment. And without ruining anything, all I will say is that not everyone makes it to see the credits.Without further ado, let's address the elephant in the room, and by elephant, I of course mean the 2016 release, Suicide Squad. That film was a critical and commercial disappointment, and The Suicide Squad acts as a kind of reboot/sequel/let's just not even think about it too much and make an entertaining movie with this cool premise. The predecessor is in no way necessary viewing in order to enjoy and relish in The Suicide Squad. The film sees a deadly squad formed, known more formally as Task Force X, made up of villains, who are given a mission in exchange for 10 years off their considerable sentences. This time around they are sent off to the remote island of Corto Maltese where they will have to fight their way through an avalanche of gunfire and other nasties, on an appropriately suicidal search and destroy mission.Aside from the return of Harley Quinn, Rick Flag, and Captain Boomerang, the squad is made up of entirely fresh characters. Including the equal bizarre King Shark, a Shark-man thing with a tiny IQ and a huge appetite for human flesh. In addition, there is the eerily terrifying Mongrel, whose backstory is unknown and is probably best left that way. With bulging haunted eyes and the appearance of a Wes Anderson puppet that has been left out in the rain and then run over by a sentient car that has a special hatred for whatever the hell this nightmarish thing is. My point is he's weird, in fact, the whole film is weird, in fact, it's outright strange. The Suicide Squad revels in the weird and offputting flaws and shortcomings of its characters, weaving them in the very themes of the story, leading to a satisfying resolution that will not only leave you satisfying but will also tug at your heartstring in a way that feels earned and cathartic.The film's more adult-orientated rating enables it to up the violence to eleven and delivers some truly shocking and gleefully gory moments that only villainous characters could get away with. These action scenes come thick and fast with every member of the team getting more than enough chance to show off their special set of skills and abilities that earned them a place on Task Force X. Featuring a great balance of fast-paced fisty cuffs and shooty-shooty bang-bang action, these scenes are undoubtedly highlights of the feel and never feel boring or a slog to get through. The opposite is true as they continue to tell the story and illuminate the characters.Make no mistake, however, in addition to the over-the-top violence and spectacle The Suicide Squad also features plenty of jokes and comedic moments that prevent the film from ever taking itself too seriously or forgetting that this whole thing is a very silly affair. And the good news is most of the jokes are winners and elicited a round of raucous laughter from the theatre I saw the film in, not 100% land, but a hell of a lot. The balance of humor works well and never felt exhausting or diminishes the stakes of the film, as can sometimes be the case with some superhero flicks.What more is there to say really? If you like so many were put off by the prospect of another Suicide Squad movie, rest assured that this is, in my opinion quite possibly the more improved sequel I have ever come across... yeah I stand by that. The Suicide Squad is a great comic book movie and without question one of the best movies DC has ever produced, and if they continue on this track, they have a very bright future ahead.",The Suicide Squad

The reviews for this weren't bad so checked it out and it's just a bit meh.It is much better than the 2016 film, but that's not much to compare to.I think the reason these films are so bad is because nobody knows the random characters you're using so you have to try and add backstory with flashbacks etc. Like the memory of the rat girl and her addict father was so poorly fitted in.Guardians of the Galaxy did this and made it work perfectly so not sure how Gunn missed the mark so much.Margot Robbie is an excellent actress who I've a lot of respect for, and her performance isn't remotely poor, however the choices made for her character are just odd. Like the part when she sleeps with the dictator served what purpose?Every few seconds there's some bit of forced humour that takes away from any action.Don't really care about any of the characters, no real development more just ""this guy has a daughter who will be hurt if he doesn't help"". No real stakes.I really do feel for DC fans, they'll tell you this is a genuis film with a straight face.

940,KahlilHerring,Everything wrong with the industry today...,1,6 August 2021,"Man oh man. I don't even know where to begin. All I know is once I saw the cast for this movie, it was either going to be sneakily very good, or absolute garbage, and i'm sad to report it's the latter.First off, movie starts off with no kind of character building and just straight word vomit of exposition, versus the stylish ways they introduced us last iteration. And then first couple lines in, you can tell what kind of new age nonsense this was going to be, nowhere near the vein of any top superhero films. Or even strictly DC films lol.Tone, right off the bat felt super weird and try-hard. Almost as if James intentionally made a very bad mock version of Guardians of the Galaxy. A ""blockbuster"" movie with Pete Davidson and John Cena couldn't be destined for greatness imo, and I think I was right. Cast also seemed like they had a hard time with the lifeless script, Idris especially.Another thing with these new-age blockbusters, none of them make us think anymore, feed us everything like we're dumb. Last movie that made me use my brain in an enjoyable way was ""Knives Out"" and that was a needle in the haystack.All in all, this movie comes off as if a new graduate film student had access to a Hollywood budget, and went with his first crazy with his ""idea"". Nobody told him this was a flaming pile of mess. And I personally enjoyed the first one better. Realistic dialogue, meaningful action, some enjoyable characters.Only got up to an hour with this version because I couldn't sit through the stiff jokes/acting anymore. This movie relies heavily on shock factor, slapstick humor, and looking good rather than focusing on the characters FIRST. Which a lot of blockbusters are doing now, because apparently we're dumb and eat up anything. Hopefully this is the start of not rewarding mediocre material, but judging from this rating....Oh and DC always goes overboard with the live-action villains for no reason.",The Suicide Squad

951,taylamell,Squad Goals,6,7 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad gets right what the 2016 film got wrong. The team actually feels like a team, the mission is an actual mission that makes sense instead of a haphazard one that just happens because they needed a villain, and there are some solid dialogues between characters. Margot Robbie delivered a speech in the movie that really highlights the growth of Quinn since she was first brought to life in the DCEU.Where the film falls flat to me, are the jokes. They're not necessarily bad, but they feel unnecessarily juvenile at times (in other words: James Gunn is very James Gunn here).Regardless, this was a solid film and everyone got their chance to shine instead of just Robbie and the sharpshooting male lead. Hopefully this marks the start of a great DC cinematic universe/multiverse moving forward.",The Suicide Squad

Thoroughly disappointed.I just have no idea how DC are making such rubbish when Marvel has put out there the blueprint for modern super hero films. Last good DC was Nolan's Batman Trilogy. Everything since has been bad (except maybe the first Wonderwoman).While watching this movie I was already formulating a review and the statement I kept thinking of was ""I would put money on it that at least 1 recent Nicholas Cage film is better than this"" And that's saying something!",The Suicide Squad
954,trevorblunn-48457,Guardians 2 meets Kingsmen,3,8 November 2021,"Slick, well paced, superficially entertaining. At least you didn't lose interest but the film has a horrific body count like wasting a load of freedom fighters then shrugging it off as a mistake, blowing someone to bits and describing it as ""way cooler"", killing hundreds of civilians. It's just callous, mindless, carnage for the sake of it. Very little character development, weak insubstantial, derivative, linear plot, ludicrous boss alien. No sense of menace.

Sometimes it's dick jokes, sometimes it's character building, sometimes it's violence, sometimes it's liberal geopolitics, sometimes it's heads and guts exploding, sometimes it's ""emotional"" flashbacks.There are times it takes itself too seriously (""we've got to save the people!"". ""the government are corrupt!"", ""lets help restore democracy!"") but then just two minutes later they're stepping over innocent people's corpses and making puns about eating them.Just with the tone, the SFX ranged from amazing to video game too, which was off-putting.I wanted to like it - and there are times when it really entertained - but after all of it, I found myself confused and uncomfortable, and worst of all, sometimes bored.All of the main cast put on a great show though. Margot and Idris especially. Polka dot dude and the weasel were underused. Could have skipped the shark.",The Suicide Squad

I loved the humour n compassion between the characters despite them putting up with each other, if u know what i mean 😝 it was definitely crazy n the gory level is great!! Seriously!! The gory level here should b on the new mortal kombat movie. There was quite alot happening at all once but can still follow the storyline.But here's my negatives... some of the effects i feel is not really needed. For example, the scene where they decide to go save Harley n u get the lettering, ""operation harley"" etc, they don't need to let the viewers know wat they're doing next. They should let the viewers find out for themselves wat's happening next. Make it abit more unpredictable!! Dont spoil it!!

The cast were amazing (even though some had very small roles). The writing was amazing. The song choices were sublime. An all round great cinema experience.The violence fits this movie so well. The comedy is done well. The action scenes are *chefs kiss*.I'd say the only thing I can fault in is the villain, Don't get me wrong it was an amazing villain but it was definitely nerfed compared to the comic version.One thing that annoys me is the fact that people who only follow the MCU have come over and have rated this lowly without even watching the movie. As someone who enjoys both Marvel and DC, This movie is definitely an enjoyable experience and is miles better than the 2016 Suicide Squad. This film deserves a lot higher reviews.Hats off to you Mr James Gunn.",The Suicide Squad

962,iremvidewb,"One great performance, but little else",3,10 August 2021,"I rate this three stars for two reasons. A one star review is for Birdemic and Justice League (2017). A two star movie has at least good production quality to it. The third star is for Margot Robbie's performance. There is very little to consider after the runtime of the movie.On the positive side, I liked the portrayal of the Ratcatcher 2 as a compassionate outcast. I am unfamiliar with the comic version. Above all, I thought Robbie's acting was excellent as Harley Quinn. She changed pose with fluid economy. There were micro-movements you would see for a split second. She used her whole body in the acting, and it helped make the character.There was a certain perspective brought by the Peacemaker late in the movie that was interesting. It could be, and probably is, the premise for other stories.Apart from those, it is a bland action movie that seems to be accepted as art for its desultory presentation of gore and suffering. At least it reminded the viewer that coups can only happen with cruel generales and Bond-villain quantities of mooks.",The Suicide Squad

The jokes added no substance and to be honest they were not funny. The weasel was a good idea but it died too quickly. It had the same comedic relief that the shark did, so it just felt repetitive.I love all the original characters, but Bloodsport? Really? They have been completely open about how they just needed to fill Will Smith's role, but at least give the character SOME unique characteristics.Over all disappointed.",The Suicide Squad

If this mindless drivel is supposed to be better than its predecessor then that has to be one of the worst movies of all time because this one was just dreadful.

988,pointbreakk,Deja Vu,1,3 August 2021,"Will Smith was arguably the Highlight of the ""other"" Suicide Squad. I left great reviews for that one. I wouldn't have a huge problem with Idris Elba replacement but felt like he was using the script that Will left in the dressing room... has daughter, goes to Prison, threatens head lady, joins the group. Harley Quinn- where is her face tattoo? Why did we decrease her value with the dreadful Fantabulous something something movie before this? I saw that the cast was stacked and was hoping that would mean less annoying HQ screen time. No such luck. The killing off of characters for shock value was a huge fail. A bigger fail than killing Diablo in the first one since he might have been a saviour for this trainwreck. You don't get much Shock Value from killing characters that no one is even invested in. But considering that they were cringey to begin with- oh well. We replaced Alligator Man with Shark Man and gave Rick Flagg a dorky greaser hairdo. Haven't seen any Colonels like that. Every thing about it felt off. It was like watching the first Suicide Squad except with a Mandela Effect.",The Suicide Squad

I liked Shark king and Rat catcher 2. If I'm feeling and rooting for characters then the movie is doing its job.Its not a marvel film- personally I think the Marvel formula is running dry to the point that I have to complain about it on Twitter. So far the movies that I've enjoyed from the superhero stable are the movies that are not trying to be superhero films. Logan is more of a western and Joker is a character study. THE Suicide Squad is the dirty dozen film I've always wanted.Its nothing like the first movie- the first suicide squad was terrible and everything that I didn't like about the film was fixed in this sequel.I can't tell you what to like or what to watch; all I can tell you is that this film was not a waste of time and I had a blast watching it. Idris Elba was great, John Cena was charming and the rest of the characters really elevate this movie to eleven.Only one con- Harley Quinn. I was never a fan of that character and am still surprised with her popularity but I didn't think they needed her in the movie. She didn't hurt the film in anyway its just that I don't want future Suicide Squad projects to lean on her all the time.I say still watch this film because these are the types of movies that will get me running to the theaters.",The Suicide Squad

It's a death mission and you genuinely fear that they won't make it out alive. The acting is so good and the characters (many being previously unknown to me) were lovable and funny.

Something about it they're trying to hard to get this characters no one knows to be something they're not. Good characters. Harley Quinn is great, bloodshot good and Rick well I like the actor idk why just always have his movies are an okay kinda movie you can watch and he just plays the characters well. But when you add in the way James gunn shoots movies and his weird way of thinking it doesn't translate well into a movie like this. If don't like action in your superhero movie this is the movie for you, but when I'm told in the beginning of this movie bloodshot put a bullet in Superman then I'm waiting for this mfer to kick some ass and well he doesn't really do that, no one does. The biggest action sequence comes within the first ten mins and then it's just another of the same movie from five years ago. It has it couple of good jokes here and there but I think Warner brothers and others want these movies to work so well and they just don't for some reason. I couldn't get into as much as I would like because I really didn't know any of these comics I only knew of Harley and I love comic books. But hey if you like it that's good just something I wouldn't watch again.

1026,IsThatJoseph21,The best DCEU movie,9,6 August 2021,"Out of all the movies in the DCEU, The Suicide Squad is easily the best one. I'd even go as far to say that it's the first DCEU movie I'd call great. While Zack Synder's Justice League had its moments, I just had more fun watch watching The Suicide Squad.The first thing I want to talk about is the characters. What a massive improvement over the first Suicide Squad. My biggest issue with the first movie was that the characters didn't feel like a team. In this movie, they actually do. The characters here have good chemistry with each other. Out of all the new additions, my favorite ones were Ratcatcher 2 and Polka-Dot Man.Another thing worth praising is the humor. This goes without saying that The Suicide Squad is the funniest DCEU movie. I'd say 90% of the jokes here worked. Sure, there were some duds here and there, but they were few and far between. The funniest scene for me was when the Suicide Squad infiltrates an ""enemy"" camp.As for things I didn't like about the movie, there's not much. The biggest issue I had was Rick Flag's character. I did not care about him at all. When he died, I felt nothing. I feel like there should've been more scenes with him, so his death had more impact.Another nitpick I had was when Amanda Waller's team betrayed her. I feel like it should've been the guy with the glasses who hit her in the head instead of that random woman. After all, he was the one who was questioning her actions throughout the story.Overall, The Suicide Squad is an improvement on every aspect over the first movie. Not only that, it's also the best movie in the DCEU. I give The Suicide Squad a 9/10.",The Suicide Squad

James Gunn rises to the occasion to create a brutal, stunning and accurate depiction of a group of super villains battling against the odds to save the world. Some of the characters from the previous film such as Amanda Waller and Rick Flag are much better in this one and all of the new characters are also given room to breath and develop.This film is also very emotional at times and contains some very heavy themes about government corruption and experimentation. This film is also very brutal with people getting ripped in half, shot in the face and decapitated all of which are followed with explosions of blood.All in all this is a fantastic experience and if you are looking for something good to watch in the cinema this is definitely worth your time.

Their animated films are pretty good because they're based on classic comics and stick to the story but the live action ones are terrible. Seriously, this type of humour went out with the the A-Team tv series. I pray that one day DC will actually get their act together but to date, they've failed yet again.

I think this is basically how a scuicide squad movie should be. I also laughed my ass out in this movie. It was so hilarious. For me, I think it's the best DC movie I watched so far even I still haven't watched ""Justice League: Zack Snyder"" yet. Also the performances, Margot Ribbie and Adres Alba were so great.

1045,therockapoe,"It's everything promised but all dial back to minimum, very low budget looking.",6,21 August 2021,"I think, it must be the pandemic, the budget of the film is not low but the effect are so primitive, the characters wear T shirt, the fighting sequence only use one camera, and they even use a ""roll camera and let actors walk really really slow"" technique for the final fight entrance scene, the heavy rain is in one scene but immediately stop in the next one, that's obviously to cover up the untouched set.However, Gunn did a great job with what's avaliable, keep the comic book spirit intact, the jokes are in, the characters works, the shark SFX is horrible he just straight up bench the shark thru most of the film, that's kinda Troma don't you think? I would like to give him extra credit for making it work, don't think many directors can.This movie is something you can have some fun with, but not worth repeat watching, I hope Gunn can make another one, with real budget, real set,decent makeup and wardore and some good SFX.",The Suicide Squad

Well yeah it's a continuation, but a gaaawd awful sequel. And I hate to even admit this because I do enjoy comic movies and especially love Idris. Even he couldn't save this movie. The movie felt like a parody of the 2016 version. It isn't that the jokes are bad, and they really are, but that the script is written to make most of the squad look like complete idiots. The way Idris and John's characters are constantly in a childish D measuring contest would be cool if it wasn't done in a 15 year old kind of way. It's not bad ass at all.The costumes look so fake; as I'm going to the Halloween store fake. And the lighting didn't help the cheap and cheesiness of them either.Harley is a lot of things, but the way she acted and talked in this movie felt like a totally different person. Harley is bad ass AND plays dumb, but she isn't really dumb. They made her into a typical dumb blond and it doesn't work because we've seen her the opposite. Also her makeup was atrocious in this. It's hard to make this woman unattractive and even her messy makeup in 2016 version she is still very hot, but they just slapped on ugly makeup on her in this.Ok my other issue is that it seems disjointed. The opening scene we are thrusted into action, but all of these interesting looking other bad guys are killed off before things heat up. Then we are transported to this next sequences of the recruitment process, and then back into weak action.I'm only 45 minutes into the movie and I had to pause just to write this review. All the high rating reviews must be paid because there is no damn way this movie is rated higher than the 2016, and the 2016 wasn't some masterpiece either.Overall it's a 5, but I'm rating it a 1 to bring down this artificial 7.5 rating it currently has.",The Suicide Squad

The feeling of this movie is different from any DCEU movie to date, it has the GOTG charm and that's EXACTLY what was needed. The Suicide Squad themselves are enjoyable and surprisingly deep, there are definitely some touching and heartwarming moments but by far the action and gore is the most entertaining part and James is once again an absolute master in the visuals department as well.

Everyone knew that at very least James Gunn would provide a fun thrill ride, no matter the quality. Having seen The Suicide Squad earlier today, I can safely say that description does the film a disservice. That's not to say it's not fun and thoroughly entertaining, but it is also filled with heart, passion and excellent characters. Many have compared this to Guardians of the Galaxy, which I believe is inaccurate as this film has far more of an emotional crux than that one (as much as I love Gunn's former contributions to Marvel). Also, there are some rather tragic, nasty moments in this film that mean the R rating is not just due to the bloody violence (although it is one of the splatteriest splatterfests I have ever seen on the big screen), and can also handle mature themes that couldn't be done in a film aimed at a younger demographic. Everything clicks into place perfectly and you'll go through an emotional journey with these bizarre characters.

But this 2021 The Suicude Squad (r) rated presentation was comparatively better.I'd rate it a full price evening show with extra hot butter. James Gunn has now sort of set the standard for every DC director filming in the future DCEU continuity timeline. I now see that Warner's comic book movies can be hard, gritty, with a dash of dark humor or hilariously funny dialogue, and even some quirky slapstick. It depends on the storyteller (director) and their team of script writers.After a second viewing, I'll admit this movie's rewatchability is 7 out of 10. I'm sure a viewer will find something new and entertaining each time. My most favorite scene, out of ALOT of memorable scenes, involved a cigarette and a well acted conversation on the concept of an attack technique, and ends with a one worded tactical procession that places a poignant exclamation on asian philosophy exacted by skillful assassins.The Suicide Squad (2021) is not that bad.",The Suicide Squad

Watched last week in theaters, it had some good moments and the concept of the movie was fresh and creative, story telling was different and unique, But I feel I didn't enjoyed much because I had huge expectations from James gunn and he somehow delivered a average movie which is still ten times better then the previous sucide squad.",The Suicide Squad

1083,fraserm74,DC finally does it right!,8,6 August 2021,"For years, Warner Bros. Has been pushing out DC films to try and keep up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In all that time, theres was probably one good movie made in the original Wonder Woman. The rest of the films were tough to watch with horrible character development and even worse plot lines. Once Warner notcied that their DC universe was tanking, they needed to find a new strategy. So what did they do? They hired a successful Marvel director!With that being said, James Gunn delivers an excellent take on this anti-hero group and gives us a violent, emotional, and entertaining film that will be called the best DC film so far. The one aspect that really stood out to me was the character development. We are introduced to several new characters that all have great meaning and depth in this story. Gunn wrote these characters perfectly, giving each of them a unique background with the weirdest super powers one could think of. I came out of this film hoping we will get to see more from a few of them!In closing, I think Warner Bros. Has finally come to their senses and allowed a DC movie to be made with freedom and true creativity. This allowed Gunn to use the genius he showed us in Guardians of the Galaxy and apply it to an R-rated title that really delivers. In no way was this movie perfect, but I actually had a lot of fun watching a DC movie, and I could never say that before today.",The Suicide Squad
1084,AthulRamesh,Fun filled gory and crazy adventure that is bloody entertaining and worth every minute.,9,7 August 2021,"This soft reboot/sequel or a complete do-over pushes the boundaries in a really good way. The film's plot can probably be summed up in two sentences, but an interesting screenplay and Gunn's new vision on the characters along with a great cast and chemistry the movie is worth every minute. Every lead characters were well written and we might even feels strangely emotional to these bottom barrel villains. The movie also gives me a Game of thrones vibe since non of the characters were safe and their death is not something the way you have expected.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn as usual was perfect and charming and filled with a lot of fun and surprises. Idris Elba and John Cena as rival assassins were hilarious and bad ass at the same time. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag did a great jod. Sylvester Stallone as King Shark aka Nanaue was an absolute delight. Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2 and David Dastmalchian as PolkaDot man managed to showcase the depth of their characters very well.Overall The Suicide Squad is a fun filled gory and crazy adventure that is bloody entertaining and worth every minute.",The Suicide Squad

Only 'Wonder Woman' and ""Birds of Prey' were worth the watch everything else was just cringe and disappointing.But this movie just nailed it!!!!!I laughed non-stop the entire first half (Weasel!!! The ""Is this thing a dog?"" scene still makes me chuckle) and genuinely felt emotional when Cleo was talking about her father.I wasn't bored for a second!!Costume design and visual effects were also AMAZING.The scene where Harley is in a shoot-out with the flowers spurting out instead of blood. It's like a little glimpse of how she sees the situation and the world.... AWESOME.The music made sense in this one as well. I still cringe when thinking about ""Without Me"" by Eminem being used as the music for the character introductions in the first movie...
I can go on and on but there's really no point.WATCH THIS. It was great!And it's mostly great because the DCEU finally stopped trying to be ""serious"".'Harley Quinn the animated series' paved the way and they should keep going in this direction.LOVED IT!",The Suicide Squad

Peacemaker played hilariously by John Cena - his comic timing is impeccable. Rat-Catcher - who is a modern day Pied Piper and the absolute heart of the film. King Shark - the comic relief, and the most tragic of the characters Polka-Dot Man - who is easily the most powerful and tortured of the crew.Rick Flag and Harley Quinn - the marketable character for cosplayer's - are also back.Deliciously dark humour, hilarious gore, and a streamlined storyline.

It picks up again, then it gets really silly. It just all felt a bit try-hard.

It's no guardians of the galaxy, and it's definitely not a traditional DC film. It lacks the authenticity of what I've come to expect from the DCU, which makes you believe in world of real people fill with super powered beings. Definitely some political leanings in it and irrelevant story telling that lacked impact for the viewer. I'm only emotionally attached to Harley Quinn and Flag, because of the previous suicide squad, which I think is a slightly better movie in a different way. Damn, the degradation of movies sucks.

1104,thecommentarrbox,I Don't Get The Hate !,8,7 August 2021,"Seriously Idk why people trying to hate it. I clearly understand everyone has their own taste to like a film but I don't think you should dislike it not hate it. Surely this movie is not for all, it's a risky project in a market. Creative people will definitely like it, people who wants to enjoy or expect something new from superhero genre and just want to get entertained will also love it but people who don't like silliness and expect it to be masterpiece will definitely not. If you've watched Doom Patrol and you've liked it then this one is for you. To be frank I liked the 2016 SS so much because of Joker, Harley & Deadshot even today I'll watch it for them. I wasn't happy when I watched the trailer for 2021's SS. It felt weird to me even tho it had Doom Patrol vibe. Tbh I didn't Wanted SS coming with Doom Patrol vibe. The characters felt so not intresting to me at that time but......
I watched it and I love it. Yes it has flaws but not that makes you hate it or cringe or even boring. The only thing I felt bad here is here I miss the Harley. At some point you get Harley Quinn and suddenly you feel it's not her especially there's a scene where Harley has a Sex with a guy she met in his place an hour a back which is super awkward. I'm personally a creative person and I appreciate the art & creativity james gunn had put into this. It's definitely not a masterpiece but it will definitely be entertaining and it definitely is a good movie to watch of you're okay with gore, violent blood bath, nudity just like Netflix stuff. If you like those movies then you gonna love this.",The Suicide Squad

There are also some slow bits and the final act comes too suddenly. But it's a good movie overall. I rated it a six but bumped it up to a seven because I appreciate the idea that the rats saved the day in the end-""if rats are special than humans are special""- Taika Waititi. The ending almost made me tear up. Idris Elba was also very good along with the rest of the cast.It was fun, wild, but in the end it was just a fun little movie.

I liked the characters from first suicide squad (2016) better, but the new characters we see in this movie (peacmaker, bloodsport, rat-catcher 2 etc...) are very very good, james gunn really knows what to with the characters he picks! Margo robbie as harley quinn is absolutely the best portrayal of the character, idris elba is awesome, and john cena was made for peacemaker role! Other characters are fine, except for ""the thinker"" really disappointed me! There are a lot of surprises in the movie, don't get spoiled , just watch it as soon as possible and enjoy! Definitely james gunn best movie!",The Suicide Squad
1108,nfunkhouser-06147,Surprised,7,6 August 2021,"I was genuinely surprised at The Suicide Squad. My biggest fear is Gunn would replicate his success with Guardians of the Galaxy, and thankfully, that is not the case. The vfx and action sequences are awesome. I love Margot as HQ, but we also get time with the other characters which is also a huge plus. I think my biggest problem with this film is pacing. It feels super long. Another minor complaint is some of the humor doesn't land well. It's just cringey. For the most part tho, it's funny. I really enjoyed how he didn't let humor overshadow the stakes as they rose throughout Act 3. The tone surprised me too. I expected it to be another superficial comic book movie in the oversaturated genre it is becoming, but it is quite original in terms of spectacle and story which is very refreshing. I definitely recommend.",The Suicide Squad
1109,hectordanielbuelna,Quality film.,9,21 August 2021,"Best DC movie made in the past.. 5? 10 years even!James Gunn got the Suicide Squad right.The movie is hella fun. The humor actually lands. Great characters and fun banter and very good dialogues. They finally showed some respect for the whimsical, chaotic and careless nature of Harley! They get to care for the rat lady!Honestly not much else to say. Ir's not a complex movie, nor is it trying to be. But you are gonna laugh and spent 2 hours having good ol' fashion F. UN.I'd just like for more people to just give it a try and share their thoughs on the movie. Maybe DC will finally star paying some respect to theie main roaster characters after this. God... I'm even gonna go watch it again next weekend.Didn't give it a 10 cause I though they over did it the ""super hero"" movie ending. But you might differ.",The Suicide Squad

While I appreciate how James Gunn did for WB I just didn't really care for it. However I did like some characters like Peacemaker, King Shark, obviously Harley Quinn and so much more.

1112,Terrifying_Tigerfish,Fizzles but ultimately doesn't satisfy,6,28 August 2021,"I had watched this film the moment it was released on HBO Max. I was extremely excited to see this film. I follow most of the cast's activities, and I am a fan of Gunn's early horror efforts (I thought Guardians 2>Guardians 1!). Furthermore, dark, violent DC movies really are my thing. Everything about them is really my thing. AND ALL of the pieces ARE HERE that I USUALLY LIKE! For example: dark, violent characters; subdued/dark blue color palette; crazy, creative violence; massive Kaiju monsters; evil government conspiracies; insane military operations; bonkers mad science. Basically, the more I THINK about this film, the more I like it. It's certainly entertaining, but...I don't know what it is...my friend, with whom I watched, says it best 'For whatever reason, it didn't have the X factor.' And, that's the best proximate answer I can give. I don't know if it's because it felt like Guardians with a dark paint coat applied, or the villains weren't cartoonish enough, or there weren't any emotions stakes involved (all of which I think are certainly true). But, I wasn't fulfilled after watching this film despite appreciating the work that went into it. Certainly, the production design of the film is riveting and excellent. When I say a 'Strong 6,' I mean it. This film is technically very well done. The shot selection aren't rushed or awkward, and the technical quality (CGI, etc) is superb.I don't know what to think honestly. All I can say is: I wasn't satisfied when the film was over. I would watch it again if it was on/my other friends wanted to watch, but I don't see myself seeking this one out anytime soon.",The Suicide Squad
1113,mizbanazir,Ah! This is The Suicide Squad!,8,12 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is the most fun i had, watching a DCEU movie. The movie's trailers kind of give you an idea of what the movie entails - Dark humor, stylish action scenes, tons of gore and great background score and soundtrack. This is what i expect and this is exactly what i got l. Maybe a little more than what i expected.Here are some of the best aspects about this film - Visually stunning shots with amazing cgi (especially the cgi done on king shark and starro), Soundtrack used blends perfectly with the each and every scene, Great performances from each and every actor, The chemistry between the characters is dynamic and complement each other (unlike the first suicide squad film), Action sequences were quite thrilling as it provides a sense of danger to every character, The title cards in the movie are super creative and oddly satisfying to watch.Some of the under whelming aspects of the film - few of the characters were underused due to sudden and shocking deaths, the film paces slowly during its 2nd act (however the pace picks up during the 3rd act).To sum up, The Suicide Squad is a film that is a self aware of its ridiculousness. It is darkly comical and gory to glory. It is the most enjoyable DCEU film in my opinion. Don't expect this to be your usual DCEU movie because it's extremely different compared to other the projects under this universe. James Gunn has totally knocked it out of the park with this one.",The Suicide Squad

(+) the characters are so stupily adorable, almost all of them!(+) this results if you put great characters and actors (just like the first movie)together and just completely ignore every aspect of the the 2016 film and simply do a modern funny Comic movie which doesnt takes itself so serious(+) King Shark(-) u dont really get an emtional connection to most of them, because you already know what happens to many of those guys
(-) a lot of people will hate me for this...but I think Harley Quinn is not necessary for this movie, I love Margot Robbie. But even after the first film I didnt really understand the whole hype. I would rather had more screentime for polka-dot-man and ratcatcher. DC just completely sucks the juice out of Margot Robbies way of Harley Quinn...they shouldnt!DC is so much more than that. And I think with this movie they came a lot closer to the MCU. Overall is TSS 2 wayyy better than the first one, a 180 degree change. James Gunn is just a genius.PLS GIVE ME A KING SHARK OR RATCATCHER 2 MOVIE ASAP!!!",The Suicide Squad

They went with different yes it's a bit bubble gum yes its silly and quirky but you know something, I liked it.

After watching this a couple of times, I think that this movie is exactly what it wanted to be and does it very well. The characters should be the focal point of the movie, and they are all given a great mix of heart and humor. John Cena, Margot Robbie, and Edris Elba are excellent actors and really kill knocked out their characters which was the most important thing. The movie is a little long and the humor does not always hit, with a few scenes that just aren't at par with the rest of the movie. Therefore this is a solid 8/10 to me.",The Suicide Squad

Fun action scenes, fun humour, fun special effects. I had a smile on my face through most of it. Bloodsport is a cool guy, Harley Quinn is wonderful in this, and Ratcatcher is an interesting addition. The cinematography is well done, the music fits perfectly, and the story is fine, but ultimately serves mostly as an excuse for a fun freaking time (though my curiosity has been piqued by the somewhat open ending...). If you're looking for a silly, gory, and not-suitable-for-children anti-hero action flick, then look no further.

1122,spawnreaper,"DC fulfilled expectations again, with this disaster of a movie.",1,6 August 2021,"Okey DC managed to do it again. Taking a mediocre script and making it even less entertaining. Every progress in the story seems like it was made up on the spot by director with too much red bull in his system.For some reason scarecrow now hit puberty. Heimdall is now a hit man who is allowed to say Jötunheim in casual conversation (giving me a marvel migraine), Yandu Udonta let his hair grow out and dies in the beginning of the movie, and and Kraglin is now a mutant for some reason. I thought there where strict rules for MCU actors playing in DC movies, don't. After an hour the plot is still struggling to go anywhere. There are definitely a lot of great actors in this movie but the script does not allow any of that to be shown. The most irrelevant scenes are drawn out to a mind numbingly slow crawl. They even managed to add the Rick and Morty episode Promortyus character in, which was extremely out of place. . This movie was promoted a being way better then the first one and a lot more funny. Halfway though the movie,...I'm still waiting for things to pick up. In the right hands Harley could have been an Jewel inside the muddy waters of the DC movies and this movies proves she can do way more (in the right directors hands). The last half hour I was desperately waiting for it to end and put this movie out of its misery.To finish up, DC fulfilled exactly what I've grown to expect from DC movies, that's to say, not much. With some exceptions, but this isn't one of those exceptions. Maybe DC should stop making movies for a while until they learn how.",The Suicide Squad

I'll give you a brief and simple rundown of why all the negative reviews are true.-All of the dialogue is sloppily written and the comedy is at the level of middle schoolers. There is no chemistry between any characters and the script tries to be more intense and meaningful than what it really is.-The humor is dreadful. Everything is ""state the obvious.""
Character 1: Is that rat waving at me?Character 2: It appears it is.Character 1: Why?Character 2: Because it's friendly?Also there's nothing but dick jokes, middle fingers and bathroom jokes. There is no brain or thought put into the comedy. Ex: ""Mario kart-racing d-bags"" -Harley Quinn.-The movie is horribly paced. First it's fast (which I can get behind) bc it assumes you've seen the first movie, then it slows down tremendously, then speeds up again, and it's on repeat like this for the remainder of the movie.-Gore is cool but they overdo it.-It tries to do something different which I can give it credit for but it's not executed properly which defeats the whole purpose.-I only saw the movie as a true Harley Quinn fan but I hate how they don't know how to write for Harley Quinn in anything since the original cartoons.I expected much better from this movie but it's just extremely disappointing. No wonder no one really saw this movie.",The Suicide Squad

Do not watch this while eating. I normally ok with violence, and call me a pansy but this made me nauseous before we got that far in. Amazing acting! The weasel is very.... awkward. Bad animation. Harley and Idris Elba are a saving grace. The movie has AMAZING actors. I just wish I knew what they were doin... other than trying to put me off my lunch. I know they meant it to be funny, but I would like to know why every movie lately has to have a strip scene. Not what I expected. I wanted comic book amazing. Not just another movie that's violent and sexual but doesn't even look like a DC story. (I admit, I'm not as deep in the comics as I would like but yeah...)",The Suicide Squad

Totally laughable and disappointing. Margot Robbie was the only good part of this movie. Did Idris Ilba say yes before reading the script ? Low point of his career. John Cena is not the Rock and is not an action star. He ruined Fast 9 too ! Everything about this was just horrible. If you loved the 1st movie....just leave it at that.,The Suicide Squad

The painfully absurd back stories of each, trying to switch from typical James Gunn funny over the top comedy (which isn't funny in this context) to a serious scene trying to explain each character doesn't work that well.The evil plot is dumb. Either Rick and Morty ripped it off, or the writers of this ripped them off.I guess I just don't like the suicide squad and nobody can make these silly characters likeable for me.",The Suicide Squad

James Gunn manages to keep the movie a comedy why also having subtle messages that leave a lasting impact. The action in the movie is top notch, extremely gory, and choreographed very well. James Gunn also manages to take B and C list characters and make them some of the best characters in the DCEU. While I don't usually like to compare DC and Marvel, this movie is basically Guardians of the Galaxy on crack! I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a non stop laugh and an amazing superhero movie.",The Suicide Squad
1131,ringsangbordoloi,Fun and just for refreshing flick,7,8 August 2021,This is better than 2016 version of Suicide Squad. Idris Elba is my all time favorite action hero. He is very good as blood sport. Most attractive and very good concept of Starro and also that part of the movie is awesome. But point is that Starro should've been given more details rather than hints.Full entertainment and refreshing movie. Should give a bit of acclaime on Direction and script.,The Suicide Squad
1132,lfcamacho,Another DCEU crappy movie!,2,8 August 2021,Has DCEU ever made a good movie?? Is there a character they haven't ruined yet? They pick a great actor to play Superman and flop. Great Batman after Bale surprisingly with Affleck and fail. Then they do Suicide Squad which was trash.Now a sequel/reboot that somehow is worse. What an abomination. Take lesser know characters and make a gory silly dark comedy. A rated R flic with very forced comedy which doesn't land. Don't know who did the first one but James Gunn didn't do much to lift this second one. Glad it was free. Hope it bombs so they never make another again.,The Suicide Squad

I love and enjoy all kinds of movies, from mainstream, independent, to low budget and trash films just that they perform the function of the first sentence. This was supposed to be action comedy, packed with famous faces and a great director but turned out to be uninventive trash big budget movie with forced stupid jokes and way too graphic violence. So dumb and violent that it's unwatchable. Who did you make this for? How low do you see your audience? This sets a bar high. I never gave a one star or wrote here a bad review but this movie deserves it and if it continues to be a trend where raw graphic violence is a merit for quality that tells us all about what audience we've all become. To compare to all the great action comedy movies done in the past this is a low point.",The Suicide Squad

I was so excited for this and No doubt, there are some things that I loved about this movie such as Peacemaker, Polka Dot Man, kinda Harley Quinn, and Pete Davidson's character. Otherwise, this movie was terrible to story writing, characterization, and just directing in general. Idk what those critics are smoking.James Gunn clearly wanted to show off some beautiful visual effects that had no substantial impact on scenes whatsoever. So many scenes in general lacked depth & substance, so I didnt care about multiple scenes. Is Amanda Waller a joke to y'all? This was just a corny Marvelesque movie in the worst way. This movie carried no weight and had no power system structure so basically anybody could up each other or die in the most dumb or unrealistic way. If you're gonna give your characters paper thin characterization or kill them off carelessly, then don't develop them with lame things like unconvincing daddy daughter issues.I'm so upset. The humor in this was clearly prioritized but in the worst way. I freaking love me some vulgar male part jokes, but I don't think I laughed at a single one. The suicide squads humor comes from them as people just being a joke. So they have to think of lame jokes to make them seem funny and endearing.Straight up I'm convinced this movie was catered for John Cena/Peacemaker so they could drop his TV show on HBOmax.",The Suicide Squad

DC really needed a movie like this, going the R rated direction was what made this a fun experience and having the balls to kill off half the cast was also such a good choice. James Gunn was given the freedom to do what he wanted with the characters and boy did he surprise me. I'd say this movie is infinity better than 2016s Suicide Squad.

It is wicked, madness, whole lotta fun and craziness, and it's an improvement since the first Suicide Squad. Not to offend any MCU fans, but I say that The Suicide Squad is even better than Guardians of the Galaxy.",The Suicide Squad

And the way that dc let James Gunn be James Gunn and go all out with everything was what made it a really great movie. This movie also got me to change from marvel to dc. Marvel was just getting repetitive and even though black widow showed that they were still capable of making movies that where actually good it also showed that there fan base has changed. When I watched this movie I realized that dc has always been multiple steps ahead of marvel and they always will be. I hope that they will let James Gunn make a sequel.,The Suicide Squad
1145,tadeguardia,¡¡An incredible surprise!!,8,9 August 2021,"After the first Suicide Squad movie no one wanted to see another one but when the release of this movie was announced we all knew it couldn't be worse than the first. Also the expectations were not high but this movie far exceeded them.For starters, the humor is much better than in the first and that humor is accompanied by great action scenes and characters much deeper than in the first movie. Idris Elba's character serves a lot as a team leader and complements very well with characters like King Shark, Harley Quinn, and more.The villain is acceptable although not memorable because he doesn't have much dialogue.The final fight is amazing because each character has their moment to shine. John Cena's character twist is very good and he doesn't feel forced. The suicide squad really feels like a team in the end.In conclusion, the movie is so much better than the first one and I think James Gunn does an amazing job directing the movie.Forgive me for the mistakes, I wrote with the translator.",The Suicide Squad

WB spends more money on the trailer and not on the film itself, or better to say: more on the cover than on the book itself. You see, I didn't understand what I looked at at all. What was it? DC? Or something incomprehensible and meaningless? For the first time in my life, I left the cinema in an empty mood. Not with a negative mood, but with none. No mood is even worse than negative, it means nothing.

poor character development and trashy r-rated scenes, just because its r-rated doesnt make it edgier or better-the first film survived due to the characters and the cast performance and making this a peacemaker starting point to start a series on him was a terrible idea

Gunn shows true care with making comic accurate casting choices and combined with a rollercoaster ride of a film..... I just have to smile. This is what it's all about.

I think a clever script which combines humour and action is cool. Look at any Marvel movie from the last 15 years - even Deadpool - and learn from that, please.You can animate a raccoon and give him a bad attitude, and you can paint Michael Rooker blue, and it can still be a good movie, like in Guardians of the Galaxy.But this movie was just another one of those movies trying to be cool, by borrowing stuff that worked in other movies.I pulled the plug on it after 45 minutes of suffering, where it just got worse and worse. Can't DC or whoever is behind this just trow in the towell and admit that Marvel has won that race, and stop trying to make the same thing?I have nothing against dark movies with an angry Batman or a dead Superman, but these trying-to-be-cool-movies are just annoying and does not work.Watch Black Widow instead.

Great characters, an amazing soundtrack and lots of laugh out loud moments.I managed 2 mild chuckles.This films is long and dull. The plot is largely irrelevant and involves a huge team of dull characters travelling to a tower that contains Patrick Starfish on steroids. And no, the writer didn't have the werewithal to reference Spongebob, despite the obvious oppportunity.Feeling more like a bunch of disparate scenes glued together as an afterthough. I sat there waiting for a spark to light the film. I waited in vain.For a film with a anphropomorphic shark, Harley Quinn and a guy who has literal polka dot powers you would think it would be a winner. They have no depth whatsover.It has one good scene. Rat Catcher 2, a.young woman who can control rats, it seen in a flashback with the original Rat Catcher played by Taika Watiti.

Loved every minute of it.,10,5 August 2021,"I've seen this movie twice at the cinema already and on the second viewing I found so much more to enjoy about this spectacular movie.James Gunn as director and writer was superb. He brought us the Suicide Squad movie that we wanted in 2016 to life in 2021. Gunn's humour and story works together amazingly.The R-rating or 15 rating if you are in the UK was needed from the start. A film about villains need to be ultra violent and gory and Gunn gave us that and more.Fight scenes were amazing from start to finish. The actors were superb. Idris Elba was phenomenal as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker was brilliant against Idris. Peter Capaldi was great but deserved some more screen time. You don't often see Doctor Who stars in superhero movies. Polka Dot Man was amazingly funny and a standout character. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was perfect as ever. Viola Davis was fierce, deadly and amazing to watch on screen.Watching this movie in the cinemas in IMAX was an experience I will never forget. A full screen experience for one of DC's best movies to date. I've seen this film twice already and I have to see it again. I loved every minute of the movie and wanted more.

1187,samuelwha,The Spectacle Squad,5,8 August 2021,"When asked if he had seen the films of the MCU, Martin Scorsese said "" I tried, you know? But that's not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being."" Though Scorsese's comments were levelled at Marvel, I think it is fair to assume his opinion would be the same of the DC films. If his opinion is not the same however, then somebody should show him ""The Suicide Squad.""Let me begin the body of this review with the best thing there is to say about the film: it is quite a lot of fun.When watching ""The Suicide Squad,"" one is treated to a film that is ripe with energy, full of creative visuals, unique combat and a playfulness that is difficult to avoid being charmed by. All in all, it is a well-helmed movie made my people who clearly knew what they were trying to do: entertain.The trouble with ""The Suicide Squad,"" however, happens to be the reverse side of the exact same coin: it is never much more than something good to look at.For 2 hours and 11 minutes (which is about 40 minutes longer then the film has any right to be,) ""The Suicide Squad,"" manages to offer up its myriad of gore, visual gags and quirks without ever offering up anything substantive. It is not only that it mistakes gratuity for originality (though it certainly does this often,) but it is that it fails to do what it should be best: provide compelling action.It is perhaps hackneyed to say that superhero films suffer from an inability to heighten the stakes in action sequences. Superman, for example, is so powerful that every combat in a Superman film is more or less predictable until there is kryptonite involved. Part of the promise with ""The Suicide Squad,"" however is that these are not supposed to be all-powerful heroes: these are oddball, underdog criminals whose express use is how disposable they are. Why then, does this film spend two hours and eleven minutes never providing an actual challenge to these characters? Why is there rarely a problem that cannot be solved with the flick of a wrist? How come every opportunity to raise the stakes as they relate to the actual goals of the protagonists in the film always sacrificed for the means of shoving in a cool-looking scene?I do not want to discount the fun that this movie has to offer. As I mentioned earlier, it really does have a palpable energy. Trouble is, by the end of the film, that energy is stretched thin to the point of fraying as the audience realizes that the film has nothing more to offer - it is a one-trick pony, with little to propound
but spectacle.The truth is, I don't think that there is anything wrong with theme parks. They can be a lot of fun. That said, two hours and eleven minutes is a long time to stay on the same ride.",The Suicide Squad

I can't complain about any comic accuracy in the movie because Gunn knows what he does right and picks C/D-list characters that no one ever cared much about this way he can tackle and make completely his own, which I respect.

1216,VBeretta,A funny movie with very good actors but strangely unsatisfactory,7,11 August 2021,"The best thing the ""Suicide Squad"" franchise ever produced was the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" trailer for the 2016 movie. The actual movie, by David Ayers, gave me the impression that there was a good flick buried in the dreck - this even before voices that the ""Ayers Cut"" was different from the studio's one.James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" is a strange experience. I laughed, and a lot, during the many sequences and visual gags. I liked a lot the vast cast of actors and characters (except for the two-dimensional bad guys). The interplay, banter and the comic timing of many sequences was pitch perfect.Yet, the story bored me. It is, actually, a very plain plot. Strip it down from all the funny scenes and concepts and what remains is an also-ran comic book movie. The local rebels were useful for a single very, very funny moment. Was this enough to include a whole subplot about them? IMHO no.This movie also lacked narrative consistency. One moment it is, literally, Scooby Doo & friends; then it becomes a straight comic book movie; then we move in the territory of ""Airplane!"" and ""A Naked Gun""; then all of sudden the level of splatter and violence is off the scale. I have nothing against splatter by itself. I love Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"". ""The Suicide Squad"", however, is not ""Dead Alive"". Characters explode in bone fragments and entrails no matter why, just because Tim Gunn acts like those kids that have fun in putting firecrackers in turds.Which leads to the final BIG baddie, something as funny as hell, but that, once again, does seem to belong to a different movie. The very CG is Pixar-level excellent - but this only underlines that you are seeing something belonging to ""The Incredibles"" spliced into a totally different movie.I loved Margot Robbie and how she is born to play Harley Quinn (even if Harley's big fight scene is so derivative from those in the ""Resident Evil"" movies that I wondered if they hired the same choreographer; she is even dressed like Milla Jovovich in the first RE movie). I loved Idris Elba. I loved Daniela Melchior's narcoleptic take on Ratcatcher 2. I even loved the small team surrounding Viola Davis. Many gags had me in tears from laughing. But ""The Suicide Squad"" is a montage of gags and sights from three different movies, with the resulting plot wallowing in derativeness and mediocrity. I can't wait to rewatch some scenes. I doubt I'll ever rewatch the whole movie.",The Suicide Squad

1219,kikogod,9/10 Top 3 Movie of the Year!,9,19 September 2021,"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie so memorable that a few days later I can't stop thinking about it and remembering cult scenes and shots! An absolute feast for the senses and the soul. With this film I experienced the whole range of emotions that one can experience - horror, shock, disgust, pleasure, laughter, sadness, etc... a complete program. Not to mention the great visual style of the film and the super good effects. It was just technically perfect.Yes, I can note small things, such as pacing problems, some unnecessary scenes, some moments when the drama didn't work very well for me (for example in the bus or the cringe scene at the end, where Idris' daughter says in a close-up, ""Thats my dad ""or something... sigh -_-). Surprisingly for Gunn, at least for me there were no particularly distinctive musical segments, such as the great ""You don't Own Me"" from the first film. But all this is dulled by the pure CINEMA pleasure I experienced from TSC. There are few people who can make such absurd creatures, characters and situations watchable. It's great fun to watch Gunn also sneak typical of old school splatter and body horror elements. You can hardly see such a movie anymore. I don't even know if Warner were on drugs when giving him the green light.Everyone played brutally well, but Idris Elba and Margot were my standouts. I like how Gunn succeeds, every time characters makes you sympathize with them, then immediately lands him a little bit in reality and reminds you that they're actually absolutely, tormented and messed up people, and it's better to you stay away from them. Dude managed with a few strokes to give emotionality even to Staro (or Zvezdyo in Bulgarian :D)!To build so well, such absurdly tragic images requires mastery. For example, the segment with the romance of Harley and the President - many people complained that it was forced and broke their pacing, but I consider it a great psychological portrait of a de facto crazy woman. It was interesting, funny, and it makes you think that no matter how much you sympathize with her, Harley is a mentally burdened person and you get sad that she may never be able to have a normal relationship and so on. And I think if it weren't for that scene to develop her image a little, maybe her role in the film wouldn't be so memorable.So overall, 9/10 from me, absolutelt brilliant and surprising movie on every level.",The Suicide Squad
1220,msebold55,I blame marijuana,1,6 August 2021,"Don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from but, in a nutshell, this was BY FAR the WORST superhero movie ever made. If ever a superhero movie deserved a Razzie it's this one. And it's almost entirely the writing and directing. The acting was okay, but the storyline and directing were just completely, utterly, and absolutely bizarre. All attempts at a plot, drama, humor (black or otherwise), or suspenseful action sequences just missed the mark by a country mile. I really suspect that the writers got together with the director and went on a huge six-week pot-induced bender when coming up with this. ""Hey man, this is gonna be real cool!""",The Suicide Squad

1225,joshey_kun19,Surprised that the first Suicide Squad is better,4,7 August 2021,"It's confusing on why this film is so highly regarded. Why so many are saying it's the best comic book movie. Critics would destroy this film in reviews if done by anyone else other than James Gunn I feel. There was a lot of destruction in the city, not much character development, plot was just okay, cgi was good only at times, violence was there to be edgy, and characters were just dumb and had very little development. The characters from the first film were reduced to garbage and there was wasted talent. I also felt as if the humor was just not that funny most of the time, and scenes dragged on which made moments that should be funny into cringe moments. Starro was probably the best thing in the film, and I laughed at one scene. There was one good fight scene as well, so it gets stars for that. But I don't think I'll be wanting to see this film again. I think I'd rather watch Studio Squad than this. It really is perplexing that this got such good reviews when it contained a lot of things I know other films by other directors would be harshly critiqued against by bloggers and critics.

And can I just say Harley Quin and Peacemaker absolutely nailed it in this.But while the R rating makes sense for a DEGREE of violence, I think Nudity, regular F-bombs and intense gore have no business in a comic book movie. It didn't need those extremes to convey the reality nor entertainment of villains teaming up, but so many filmmakers that get the R rating go way overboard just because they can.I'm a huge movie lover. There are so many movies that are better for being rated R. Because it's R to enhance the story. But I must admit I'm a fan of PG-13 blockbusters too. Going to a movie to have a good time.

When Marvel seems to be stuck in a creative drought, Gunn singlehandedly waters the similar drought Warner Bros seemed to be dealing with when Man of Steel and Batman failed to take off.James Gunn is such a skill- and soulful screenwriter it almost seems like he challenged his friends to come up with the most unlikely and downright ridiculous characters to show them he could incorporate them in a screenplay and still make them completely believable. A landshark anyone? Why not!James Gunn is an absolute master and totally unique in balancing his screenplay on the edge of satire, but still not tipping over the edge and delivering a believable superhero movie.

Which leads me into this one, at least in part one I got to the end of the film, this one I switched off on the hour mark when their still in the forest chatting to the butch chick from Predators.The beginning of the film which saw numerous crims get killed in the way of a distraction had its moments but seeing captain boomerang who was fun in the first one out the first nail in the coffin.I saw absolutely no chemistry between John cena and the black James Bond which should have been the glue the buddy feel I just couldn't see it.After an hour I was bored to the point I honestly felt life's to short to take a gamble on if the film would pick up and redeem
Itself,Speaking of redemption the only 2 things good I took away from this was after 3 films Margot Robbie can actually speak in a New York accent and rat catcher 2 was pretty funny I liked her,But all in all I was bored stupid I'm happy for you if you liked it just wasn't for me.",The Suicide Squad

Bringing the lesser known chracters in live action seemd like a brilliant idea to me ..but something went horribly wrong and that isn't beautiful. Firstly the chracters doesn't feel like supervillains, just some convicts who have been wronged by society and each of them has their sob story for which you don't feel nothing at all. Secondly Harley Quinn wasn't like herself, she was a bit crazy but that inner evil in her was missing from the start. She was just a sarcastic superhero with a broken heart out there going to save the world. Thirdly the underwhelming storyline. You will know what os going to happen if you aren't a major comic book reader too. Now coming to the main part it's felt like that I have been watching a marvel movie filled with dc chracters. That thin line of being dark what made DC DC is missing from the beginning. Adding some adult jokes and violent gory killing scenes into a childish script doesn't make movie darker. Good for only one time watch.",The Suicide Squad

I got sick of the constant tirade of super hero movies and gave up on them long ago. So I thought I'd take a chance with this hopeless piece of trash, I wish I'd known that from the start! At the end I thought ah it's just for kids, but... the amount of gore for a kids movie?? What were they thinking, who is this movie supposed to be aimed at? I'm no shrinking violet but I'd think twice about allowing a minor to witness such visceral 'entertainment'. I hate to moan about movies because they have their place, but does this movie have a place? So many cliches from other movies and the shark king looked like a carbon copy of Egil from Asgards Wrath! Plus don't get me started on the final 'boss', a pink and purple Starfish straight out of a Barbie cartoon! I'm all for humour and fun but the actors looked deadly serious when confronted by the Starfish equivalent of Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters 1, except that was funny.

In places outright annoying (including flashbacks that don't flash that far back) and disturbing (with a mother-love sight gag that sailed clean over my head not once but twice). But much effort goes into something that just makes me go ""Meh,"" and nearly real, real loud.So what rates this a ""6""? An undeniably fine cast, and when allowed, their acting. I would have liked to have seen and known more (but not by reading) about several characters, and as in precious few other movies I'd like to see more of their respective actors' work. I grant that ensemble acting is no simple or given thing, and here we need contend with a veritable General Meta-Assembly whose members compete for our attention no matter how familiar at least some may appear.I'll go on record as admitting I favor its nominal and reportedly studio-recut predecessor. (You know the one: Drop the article from its title.) Perhaps this sentiment is grounded in that movie's novelty and the distinct impression that all who participated in that full well knew this. That's not quite the case with this iteration, of which a spectacular example involves one Harley Quinn, which is a shame, for Margot Robbie can do anything she sets her sights on. In contrast Daniela Melchior's character sleepily steals every scene she is in.It's worth the view but feel entitled to set the bar higher.P. S.

It's definitely the best outing yet for the Suicide Squad, but it's not amazing.The characters are just as shallow as in the first movie. A 2 minute cutaway or backstory really isn't enough to develop the characters (thought they would've learned that lesson from the original).As the characters died off throughout the movie, it revealed probably the biggest issue overall - I didn't care who died. I was not attached to any of these characters, and it made it hard to care during some of the movie's serious moments.Bloodsport is just a Deadshot clone - including an incredibly similar backstory with the daughter and everything.Polka-Dot man jokes about hating his mom and seeing her everywhere; not once, not twice, not three times, not 4 times.. Seriously it wasn't funny enough to keep repeating the same joke.Peacekeeper is fun but had no backstory.Rick Flag was introduce in the first Suicide Squad movie and was very forgettable.And the list goes on like this... I don't need a full origin story for each character, but when they tried to add dramatic death scenes and tense close-call moments it didn't really fit.It was bizarre that we watched so many characters die for a joke, and then they had other characters in death-defying dramatic moments.It was a strange and entertaining dark comedy, but it is pretty forgettable.",The Suicide Squad

They are just plain boring and dull.The suicide squad has shown that a film so colourful and funny can be darker than all of them. James Gunn has made a masterful job. The suicide squad is fantastically directed, the shots are incredible, the colours are amazing. This film has all the elements, humour, emotion, action and gore. It's got pretty much all you could want in a film.I have seen this film 3 times now, there are very few minor errors but nothing that can take away from your experience at all.Apart from that this film is incredible and I will 100% buy it when it comes out! The characters are deeply lovable, I mean this film makes you care for a rat and a shark, let that sink in...Masterful work, far better than the last thing that had suicide squad in its name!

Taking this into account, and having seen the 2016 Ayer's version which left me disappointed, this movie did the exact right thing to revive some amount of hope for superhero movies in general.And in my eyes it all came down to warner throwing some money at James Gunn and letting him lose. You really feel that this movie crosses some lines you wouldnt expect such a ""big"" movie to cross. And this is good! This makes it such a ride. Its some fresh air, finally.Although I have to add that this movie isnt for everyone. This movie doesnt reinvent the wheel regarding superheroes. This movie is gory, has a stupid high death count and has some jokes in it some can laugh about and some cant.Also this movie isnt flawless either. Some script decisions are seen from a mile away and some characters are pretty bland and one-dimensional (John Cenas character for example). I probably wouldve enjoyed more exposition at the beginning and less of the action right at the start. Also, the emotional scene at the end with the rat-woman and her father doesnt really clicked with me right inbetween that funny and nasty gore.Its a movie where you kinda already know what you're getting beforehand.

It's rated R. There is no superhero action movie with this much comedy and blood. And James Gunn managed to blend the comedy and gruesomeness perfectly. He also divided the movie into chapters for people to easily understand. They didn't waste time on introducing new characters because they were going to get axed out. And add the background music, and turn this peculiarity into masterpiece. It's one of the best DC films after a long time. The CGI was decent, the hiliarosity was not forced at all and maintained the character connection throughout the whole movie.

1291,prabashsanka,Entertaining and violent,10,17 September 2021,Don't fall for hate reviews of toxic marvel fans. Seriously 1/10...? 10/10 for me because i love suicide squad but I would give this 8/10 even it wasn't suicide squad.,The Suicide Squad
1292,sakruauwu,Better then marvel,10,22 August 2021,"I never think to say this I love marvel. But this movie made me think marvel was a bit more. LIKE I love the gore and blood, they just let lose like I hated the 2016 one.The BIG BAD was a joke its so tone change and I love it we have more joke I get then a lot of things.",The Suicide Squad
1293,Mesina02,The Suicide Squad is awesome,8,9 August 2021,"This comes as no surprise that it is leagues ahead of its predecessor. This film works because it does not hold back on anything. It's a premise that is easy enough to understand and the concept's that are brought up are downright hilarious.It's creative in it's presentation and is completely aware of what it is. It delves deep into the wackiness of it's plot and it's characters as from the beginning action scene, you already have a clear understanding of how everything will be like.An aspect that I really liked in this film is the chemistry between the character's. The first Suicide Squad didn't do any of that so I was really glad they were able to at least give these character's some dynamics with one another. My favourite characters in the film were Bloodsport, Ratcatcher and surprisingly Polka-Dot Man but overall all the characters seemed quite enjoyable.The Suicide Squad exceeded my expectations with James Gunn turning this Action-Comedy hybrid into a thrilling joyride. Needless to say, The Suicide Squad is one of the best films of the year and maybe the best DCEU movie so far.",The Suicide Squad
1294,SimonEricAlexius,This was not good.,3,2 November 2021,"This movie was awful. Written by adults for adults with a mindset of a 7 year old. The character with most personality was the rat.And with all this top reviews I'm scared that this is the future for movies.There is no depth to this movie, no story. Just a way to get the characters from A to B with a few bad jokes and some action in between.I don't know, it gives me mixed opinions. I am interested in what happens next so I keep watching. My problem is mostly that I don't feel anything for the characters and what they are doing and why.Just numb mindless watching.It is better then the first move, but it doesn't make this one good.I believe I might be a bit harsh in my words to the point that I'm exaggerating. I think I wanted something more since the audience score was so good.",The Suicide Squad

1296,dbierm03,Overhyped GOG clone that doesn't quite pull it off,6,8 August 2021,Mixed feelings on this one. I really enjoyed the characters. James Gunn is certainly showing his style here and I don't care for it that much. The comedic one liner marvel stuff has just kinda worn itself out. If they could have mixed the style of the original with this I think I would have enjoyed it more.I'd like to see DC do its own thing and not go marvel rip off. The first Wonder Woman was the way to go.,The Suicide Squad

1298,andrewtmallory,Sure,4,7 August 2021,"This villain outing doesn't really say a whole lot. It definitely tries it's hardest to not be it's predecessor. It has a lot of genuine moments between characters as they explore their nature and true characters. As always, I enjoy Gunn's exploration of lesser used or known comic characters. For me it just felt a tad too long, frenzied and disjointed towards the end. There was some cringeworthy and just flat out odd moments. The use of sometimes laughable gore felt more like they just did it just to prove that they could. It feels like another slightly confused DC joint. Put up with the other DC Extended Universe offerings doesn't help me understand what the ""DCEU"" is trying to be. It does make me wonder what Ayer's untampered movie would have been like. Overall, it was alright and had some good cinematically pleasing moments.",The Suicide Squad
1299,thepalestfire,Gunn goes for it all!,3,6 August 2021,"After an opening joke stolen from Deadpool 2 falls flat on its face, director James Gunn throws every trick he has at the screen in hopes that something will stick. Unfortunately, it's a clinging feeling of utter indifference. For a director who gets off on being subversive, it's a shock at how predictable everything is with the only shocks coming from when a joke actually lands. Perhaps the most subversive thing about The Suicide Squad is when Gunn attempts to manipulate the audience into caring about any of these characters. It's almost as offensive as Taika Waititi's attempt at playing a Portuguese man.",The Suicide Squad

BVS! That's what happened here yet no ones saying that for this movie; hmm. The story was predictable but not what everyone's making it out to be like this absolutely great movie!

As far as superhero movies go this IS it.James Gunn was tossed aside by Disney and WB snatched him up in a blink. Geniuses and opportunistic and I applaud them for it. This is right up his alley. His style, the comic material are a match made in heaven.I laughed. I laughed. I actually wiped tears from my eyes. Then I laughed more. There isn't a minute... a single minute of this movie I was NOT ENTERTAINED. That's what a comic movie is supposed to be right? Suspend reality. Commit to nothing. Let your baser instincts roam free for a moment. In this, The Suicide Squad EXCELS.I love the soundtrack, the style, the colors, the one liners, the absurdity of this movie that knows its being beyond absurd. The short lifespan of 90% of all characters. It's perfect. This actually tops Deadpool 1/2 by a mile. It is also twenty leagues ahead of anything DC has done so far.",The Suicide Squad
1307,lordfanatic,Just don't understand why they did this?!,5,18 August 2021,"With first movie they had a good one.It was something newish, some other perspective.With this one they probably destroyed the franchise. It was waaaay more Deathpool than Sucide Squad. They didn't have twists, it was very predictable, with a lot of forced ""humor"". Some scenes were more like a parody than as reqular movie. You can mash and combine one with other movie gerne but you need to tread that road carefully and with taste. This wasn't that by a mile. This movie wasn't comedy, it was parody, it wasn't Sci-Fi it was forcibly unrealistic, it wasn't adventure it was badly forced action non-stop without any logic.It was badly produced, with bad finishing work.I could not swallow this s**t.5* only because of other bad bad movies I gave 4* and 3* and were much worse than this.Writters, producers and others should take a step back to the firts movie and try again because this was just bad.",The Suicide Squad

1312,jameszd44,Finally there is a good dc movie! Go watch it as soon as possible!,10,6 August 2021,"Warner's dc superhero movies are always not as good as Marvel's. I think it's because they want to rush too much. And they started to make Superman vs Batman movie without enough single hero movies before. It should be like a comic movie that has a few main characters first and then make the team movie.But this one is a very good commercial and entertainment film. Most people will love it even if they don't know anyone except the joker girl. This movie is much better than the first one and the Harley Quinn movie. I think it's also better than the Wonder Woman movie, the Wonder Woman movie looks more for the lower age audiences. After all, this is a R rated movie.The director of this movie is also the director of Guardians of the Galaxy. There are various people in this movie, but even if you don't recognize any of them, the movie is still pretty good. If you look at it this way, the movie shows the director's personal style in full.I don't know if the high-level Warner people intervene this movie or not.

Having said that,this is the perfect blend of Marvel's lighter faring comedy & feel-good moments, mixed with the darkness of the DC world! James Gunn brought the perfect approach to a DC film franchise by giving us some needed darkly & emotionally heavy moments, (but not so heavy that the film is hard to watch, or literally dark & hard to see, like Hack Snyder's films.) He also gets in the comedy & lighter feel-good moments that help to refresh your palette at just the right times throughout the movie, which keeps the film from getting too tedious & depressing (like Snyder's slog-fests were.) Love him or hate him, Gunn has definitely proven that he is the perfect director for these types of films!",The Suicide Squad

Hello even Peter Davidson in his four minutes of total screen time was more relatable than half of the suicide squad in the original movie. The cast was well assembled and each person was fantastic in their own individual personality. The story while some serious plot gaps and lapse of logic, their ball busting and gaffs made this enjoyable.John Cena has some serious acting chops and like Dave Bautista should be considered a serious actor.It's great to see how there's not a whole lot of plot armor and how every character you see on here is just as capable of dying in the movie. Which I appreciated.As someone who knows plans require days not minutes to execute flawlessly, the Suicide Squad executed their plan without any rehearsal which is the only think I rolled my eyes at.

***Long Review w/ one spoiler***
***TL:DR at end***The Suicide Squad (2021) has to be by far the best and creative DCEU movie thus far. Director & Writer James Gunn respected the source material all while implementing his ""wicked and colorful""visionary elements.From creative camera movements, to impactful dialogue and carefully constructed story arcs, James Gunn has redeemed what horrible mess the 2016 Suicide Squad came to be.In the first few minutes of the movie we are following Michael Rooker's Savant's POV at the utter chaos the Suicide squad endures.After his death we then follow Idris Elba's Bloodsport for majorly the rest of the movie.In between we receive some great background to unknown characters (to non-comic book readers) such as Bloodsport, Ratcatcher 2, Polka Dot Man & King Shark, this is done in a brief manner so that it would not interrupt the flow of the movie.Skipping Rick Flag & Harley Quinn already partially known back stories, their arcs in the movie plays a heavy role to the events that unfold.Overall, this movie's integrity of structure is UNBREAKABLE compared to 2016's version. What I mean is how nicely done the story is told with comprehensible transitions solely because of this structured point of view angle vs 2016's method, where as everyone took a piece of leading the movie and made it so that the audience wouldn't know who to root for because of the lack of story telling and character development. Granted, the theatrical release was not what we were supposed to receive originally this could be the main reason why the first movie was a flop.Looking at interviews with all actors who took part of The Suicide Squad and you can see nothing but passion being displayed over their work in this film.The first one was riddled so badly with drama on and off set that the overall morale between actors and actresses just wasn't what was best for the movie, added the terrible reviews and harsh criticism and no one who worked on Suicide Squad 2016 wanted to stand behind it.Look at Jared Leto's Joker for a good example, audiences HATED Leto for his horrible portrayal of the clown price of crime.Leto himself is a magnificent actor and was loved tremendously before having to pick up the mantle that Ledger had placed very high and not that very long ago before it was Leto's turn. The overall different approach to the Joker and his terribly written dialogue and costume design nearly killed Leto's career.Now let's look at John Cena's Peacemaker, what is easily Cena's most passionate role he's ever been given and in return his greatest role ever played.With James Gunn attached, Cena was on board from the start and given an incredible character with a complex ideology, memorable dialogue and character motivation you then get some heavily emotional scenes being played out. Won't go too in depth since I want to keep this review to a minimal as possible when discussing spoilers, but trust me Peacemaker is a complex villain who looks at the bigger picture and will do anything to achieve Peace even if he has to contradict what he stands for and wage war. (Doesn't that sound amazing??)
Quickly going over the dialogue in The Suicide Squad, I have to say it does not disappoint not even once!Especially with returning character Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis, is greatly redeemed from her portrayal to the first movie. She is to be taken more serious and is shown just how much of a villain she is compared to the prisoners she controls to abide by her rules. Of course, her mannerisms and cold stares grant her this refresh of a character but the dialogue she is given just truly serves the cold dish.Banter between the members of the squad is always fun and quirky, there is never a scene that's ruined because of the lack of meaning behind words said or even words said themselves.This along with a few team bonding scenes, better convinces not why you should care about the protagonists but why you should care about the protagonists's respected relationships established with one and another.Again, another element the first version fumbled embarrassingly. Like bonding and having an understanding what your fellow SS member is like and how they work is just nonexistent in 2016's SS.There is so much more positives I can say about this movie, as of writing this review I have streamed it 3 times and will probably preorder the dvd release when it's taken off HBO Max.I hope I convinced someone who was cautious of giving this movie a chance as I was one who was the same way until I heard nothing but greatness, and decided to give it a chance myself.Not every movie is perfect, this movie definitely has some flaws but if I'm being honest with you, it's not even worth mentioning when this movie already has so many positives going for itself.I encourage every one who's open-minded and loves creative, dark humorous, and original movies to stream The Suicide Squad now!If you're expecting a marvel movie because James Gunn's name is attached or if you're not a fan of dark humor and gore or you do not form attachments to fictional characters then I don't suggest this movie is for you.TL:DR:
* This version is better in every way from the first by improving character development, dialogue, creativity in certain scenes and camera angles and overall story and structure of story. Oddball characters are actually well fleshed out with incredible ideologies and back stories behind their personal motivations. Something the even more known characters lacked so much in 2016's version. Not flawless, but there's minimal flaws worth mentioning compared to the many positives. It's worth giving a shot at least, if you're an open-minded individual.",The Suicide Squad

1380,ameliagrennie,The film we deserved back in 2016.,9,31 July 2021,"As soon as the trailer dropped for suicide squad prior to its release in 2016, I remember being so excited for its release, practically counting down the days. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst films I ever have seen. This film on the other hand, is brilliant. Was everything and more i wanted from the original film. James Gunn is a godsend, I love guardians of the galaxy (both volumes) and he really came through with this film again, he really has proved his talent with large groups of characters. This film is rude, silly, utterly gorey and overall very funny and you find yourself getting rather attached to a lot of the characters. The action was very good, all of the jokes landed (except for one in my opinion) and the script was very well written. The plot was very clear throughout and stays this way throughout the whole film. It's incredibly action dominated which you would expect. However, every film has its faults. I didn't find Harley to have as much of her charm that she did in her previous 2 films even tho Margot did a great job with her character. Obviously the film is less centred on her and more on the group as a whole which is something I found to be good as your gripped to a large group of characters but her character was the only good thing I found about the original wish I wished seeped through to this film a little bit more. I don't think Margot did this film many favours either when she said that ""this is the best comic film of all time"" as I found myself constantly comparing it to other brilliant comic films throughout watching it. I can understand why it would be someone's FAVOURITE comic film but it is certainly not the best (the dark knight, endgame etc are up there for me in my opinion). However this wasn't the idea they were clearly going for in this film but I thought it would be useful to mention just incase there's someone who has their hopes up for a brilliant, 10/10, film. I also (no spoiler) found the villain to be a bit boring and found the final fight scene to be finished quite quickly and was probably my least favourite fight scene in the film, not a massive deal that affects the enjoyability of the film but every film has it's weakness. Overall, this is one of the best films DC has come out with in a long while which felt very refreshing and provided comedy that I haven't seen since Thor Ragnarok or deadpool 2. I would HIGHLY recommend you go see this film as i would say it will be one of the best films released this year. It's clearly a film that is supposed to be a bit of fun and when you embrace that, this film is very very good.",The Suicide Squad
1381,abloodynova,"Fun, Explosive, Gorey - Somewhat Shallow.",7,12 September 2021,"First off, I do feel like this movie is certainly a touch overrated, and in similar fashion to Snyder's Justice League, I feel it is primarily due to the simple fact that it's often compared to the previous theatrical iteration from not so long ago - yes, of course it's better in that regards. Being decapitated, I assume, would be better than Suicide Squad (2016). In some ways, it hits some of the same beats and still hit some of the same issues as the 2016 movie. For one, there were a ton of licensed music peppered throughout, although the selection were seemingly more fitting this time. There are a ton of jokes - some works, some don't really works, and others just ruins the pace. It is mostly petty sexual jokes, but eh- I've watched Revenge of The Fallen, I'm practically used to it.The premises are better. Not the best, but again, compared to the whackfest of the 2016 movie, it is more than acceptable. The ultimate villain is surprisingly better, too. Who would've known that a literal space starfish with a zombie army is an ultimately more engaging villain than an ancient demon of sort? Not me.The characters are actually much more interesting as a whole, which is what I think carried this movie beyond its somewhat mediocre core story. You can say goodbye to cringy pimp Joker; Harley is not as in focus anymore here, but thankfully, unlike the last movie, the supporting characters are actually characters instead of super-powered cardboard cutouts; Bloodsport is an interesting character and Idris Elba's performance is stellar, although he practically fills the role of Deadshot; Peacemaker and King Shark/Nanaue were amazing; Polkadot Man was great although severely lacking screen time; and Ratcatcher 2 and Rick Flag were the only pretty somewhat below average character for me - although, they didn't have a ton of screentime and they still have some moments.However, I personally, I think Gunn wanted to focus too much on gore and sending the ""message"" of them being a ""suicide squad"". Lots of characters died, and some are just a total waste of potential unless this is an isolated incident (which with Peacemaker series in the making, probably not), because I'm not even sure God knows the state of the DCEU right now. It's a pretty good movie, a really fun popcorn flick, but even though it does feel like Gunn's Guardians of The Galaxy at times (and it does work better than Whedon's MCU flavouring on Justice League), I feel like it's a bit lacking heart and character compared to, say Guardians 1 or even 2.",The Suicide Squad

1388,faulknerlaird,Even worse than it was,1,11 August 2021,"The deception starts right from the trailer and the title of the movie. ""Someone will die"" - the teaser hinted, maybe even everything. But... About everything in order.Let's start from the beginning. Introduction to the characters, introduction, history, no, forget it. Already in 2 minutes, the assembled party of those whom you do not know and have never heard of, except, perhaps, about Harley and Boomerang, is sent on a mission, the purpose of which is also unknown.There, almost everyone is quickly and cheerfully killed under a whole ocean of ketchup and dismemberment, and we are switched to the heroes of the film.Then the introduction, where in 3 minutes we are also shown the daughter...
a minute!But after all, in the original film there was not a Bloodshot, but a Deadshot!Screenwriter, fans, didn't you notice the difference?This is to the question of the elaboration of the Marvel world.By the way, which everyone puts as an example.In general, daughter, nothing new, but the dialogues are so weak and bad, so illogical and so incoherent that it seems that Mr. Tiny from the Simpsons worked on their creation.So, here they are, the heroes of the Galaxy and the saviors of our sinful philistine souls:
1. Bloodshot. Copy-paste of Deadshot, Elba-copy-paste of Smith, just aged. A weapons expert.2. John Cena. I do not know what his character's name was, they called him by name a little, I don't remember anymore, too... expert... on... weapons...
do you feel the effort?Originality?A variety of types and their abilities?No?And this is not there.3. Their supervisor. Sina's copy paste, just not so pumped up.4. The girl-summoner of rats.5. A downtrodden mother's son, so pathetic that he can shoot confetti and see only his mother everywhere.This character is so worthless that it's even disgusting.6. The shark.7. Harley Quinn (occasionally). Apparently, they took to exploit this image again, because, without it, the film would not have received more than 3.0, it is so weak and bad.One of the creators also worked on ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and his genius of creativity was so lacking here to create something new that he simply replaced Groot with a Shark, and the Rocket with a Weasel, which died first.The moment with the mistake was not bad, however, despite all the ""adulthood"", which is limited here to vulgar gestures and liters of strawberry juice with slices in the screens, the film reeks of Disney, as well as from Disney itself.Suddenly, Harley is dressed up as a princess and she sleeps with a ""dictator prince"", who is then killed for ""habits"", although it was never said that she decided to quit with psychos.Apart from the words and throwing guts, there is nothing mature in the film.There is no disclosure of serious topics, there are no mature ideas, for example, that it is society that gives birth to maniacs, who are then imprisoned, forcibly treated, or killed, no, there is only shock content and... nothing more.While the red paint is gushing, there is chatter, the essence of which is: the disclosure of the confettishness of a pathetic mother's son and the past of a rat-loving girl.The scenes with her father smelled so absurd from the excessive detail and maximum opacity of the events that it was even funny, it turned out so ridiculous.In the first bar, they meet the main villain, who looks just stupid with all these spark plugs stuck on his head, then they take him prisoner, and they themselves escape, deftly dealing with a soldier with stormtrooper syndrome.While Harley single-handedly destroyed the entire army of the country, which then shot crookedly, apparently because of the squint, according to which soldiers were recruited in this country for service, then forgot to shoot at all, then ran away, we see how useless all the others are against her background.In general, the film came out worse than even the first part, which was almost the same, only with a lot of charismatic actors, scenes and, in principle, typically Disney content.Here we have the same thing, only of the memorable actors and images, only Harley remains, who is essentially a minor character here, and that's all.Some of them reek of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but they are all unknown who, that's the reason for the failure of the picture.The plot is weak, the dialogues are poor, if you remove the gallons of blood, then this is a typical Disney, even with a prince and a princess.The characters do not shine with variety, what is happening is boring, and the action scenes are simply absurd.The film absolutely does not deserve a rating of 7.0 or higher, it is 5.0.The feeling is that everything was shot by Asaylum.What is his secret of success?In the audience.People began to grow up later, childhood stretches to about 30 years, when there is no taste, no requirements for logic, coherence and better content, when they can no longer be deceived by a stupid huge Shark and disgusting graphics in which juicy cruelty occurs.I hope that this is the last attempt to make money on this topic and people will do at least something new, and will not continue to reshoot what has already been filmed.Rating: 1/10.The film is not worth the money.It is better to go to the ""Magic of Moonlight"" again.",The Suicide Squad

But it didn't exceed expectations of being better than the first. I love all the characters in this. That was the best part for me! The shark was so cute but so savage.

The pluses, the acting and jokes were amazing. James Gunn really understands the atmosphere of movies. Minuses, I don't think I would say it but Harley Quinn was a but over the top and was more annoying than entertaining. In Birds of Prey and the original Suicide Squad, Harley Quinn was the most entertaining part of those films. Here, she seems she was a secondary thought.The first suicide squad was flawed by DC's doing too much and not develop the characters. In this one, similar problem. Now James Gunn addresses the problem with better dialogue and scenes seem to develop better but still flawed.",The Suicide Squad

A lot of the characters felt underdeveloped to the point where you don't care what happens to them (similar to the first attempt) and this goes double for the villains. The thinker could have been anyone, his character played no part in his role in the movie. Ultimately some clunky pacing and forced banter left a bit of a sour taste. Most people are bored of the marvel formula, so yes they finally got it right in a DC movie (even down to the pointless spin-off advertisement post-credit scene), but it's too late and just felt a little too formulaic. It's nice that they fixed mistakes of the past and finally made a film that tonally hits the mark on what they've been aiming at with the last few releases, but it all just felt kind of pointless and didn't really take the franchise anywhere new.

Suicide Squad (2016) could be wiped from existence and this movie need not even change anything. There is very little linkage to the first film apart from the title and 4 recurring characters. It pretty much starts anew, embarking on its own humor-infused adventure. Truely enjoyable, Gunn overhauled everything and made everything better. Idris Elba was surprisingly perfect for his role.

Idris Alba, this dude is just a star and is so good all throughout the movie; definitely a good idea making him the leader of the group. Margot Robbie will always be Harley Quinn from now on, and the performance she gives just further proves she's fit to play that character. The third act is so ridiculous that it made the movie so epic and the finale so satisfying for the characters.

1442,subhaanmalik-37282,A mediocre action film.,5,31 July 2021,"While James Gunn was excellent in directing Guardians 1 & 2, I feel he missed the mark with this one. It seems that this movie struggled with the genre it belonged to and the issues with David Ayer's version were actually exacerbated in this. I do think it was very well shot and it was creative, however, I think the writing was a let down. The humour did not work in this film, the jokes fell flat and they did not have the intended effect which is why it feels like a film struck between two genres. It would be best described as an action comedy, however, considering the comedic aspect of the film failed, what we were left with was a mediocre action film. What made Guardians successful was the ability to combine the humour and the action in an organic way but it seems that James Gunn failed in this movie to do that.The characters were written quite well and they were likeable which was one aspect that I enjoyed and they had their own identity which shined through. The characters were not forgettable like in 2016 and it did make the film bearable. The plot itself was quite generic and it felt that nothing was at stake. While this is perhaps the intent, it did not make the audience care much for what was going on.I do think the subplot of Luna was both bizzare and unnecessary. It added nothing of value, neither in the story nor character development. Perhaps it did add a bit for Harley but it felt very out of place.The background of a corrupt south American regime did seem too heavy and it felt like it was shoehorned in by the US government to reinforce how being against the US government is evil and those who oppose the US foreign policy are malicious people with ulterior motives.Once all these elements are combined, it really is quite an incoherent film. The humour and action do not fit together organically, the jokes fall flat, the idea of a corrupt regime did not fit well with the genre, it was like combining two different films, nothing felt at stake, and the way the villain was defeated felt childish and odd.It's mediocre in my opinion. Not a lot more than that.",The Suicide Squad

The film manages to mix action, jokes and occasional moments of warmth and emotion into a glorious romp.Okay, it is never going to feature in any person's top 5 films made but it sits high up in that list of films that you watch over and over again because they don't require a big emotional investment and they fit almost any mood (Bad Boys, The Mummy, Deadpool etc).James Gunn has produced a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours with a great cast, wonderfully over the top violence (so OTT that it's funny rather than gross) and a great visual style. The Lollipop Chainsaw inspired scene featuring Harley Quinn is one of the most wonderful scenes in many years.

1447,griffinzw,Really Solid! Not awful. Not brilliant. Super solid.,7,10 August 2021,"Seen a lot of people loving this, and a lot of people hating it. I'm in neither camp. Does this film reinvent superheroes? No. Is it an awesome DC movie? Yeah! The main issues are all with the plot, which feels very underwhelming. The killing of Flag felt like a mistake and the killing of Boomerang did too. Since it's a sequel, it would have been nice for Harley, Flag and Boomerang to have more time together as well as at least reference the events of the last film (as awful as they were). Peacemaker was brilliant, though twist feels a little forced. Bloodspot is the obvious star and Elba absolutely crushed it. Obviously Robbie as Harley is a huge win. Even Starro, was a fun choice that wasn't meant to be taken too seriously. The only character who was an absolute miss (in my opinion) is Amanda Waller who is just way too evil in this film. The stylization is a lot of fun and the VFX are really solid. Far better than Black Widow's. The comedy isn't as good as in Guardians of the Galaxy, but neither is the comedy in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Two so....All in all, definitely watch it. Gunn understands his characters really well, even if the plot doesn't always work. It's a lot like Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Two that way.",The Suicide Squad

1452,BlueBird84,A few plot/character stumbles keep this from being fantastic,7,1 September 2021,"The good: Tone flits perfectly between comedy and seriousness when appropriate, acting is all top notch, embraces the silliness and gratuity of its subject matter.The bad: Some very specific plot/character moments don't really make sense. Harley has thick plot armor when escaping her interrogation, easily handling dozens of large men; no explanation is given for the javelin appearing; I'm sick of Harley being this girl-boss feminist icon. Flag and Peacemaker's conflict over the incriminating flash drive was odd; imo their stances should have been reversed with Flag deciding to sell his soul as Waller's lapdog and Peacemaker giving his life in pursuit of justice/peace. This would also allow Flag to remain alive and in moral conflict for later sequels, where he could also develop his relationship with Harley further. It seemed like they were setting King Shark up to really redeem/prove himself and save the group but he never really does.Overall highly recommended if you like dark humor. This is the direction DC should keep going in with these villain-centric movies.",The Suicide Squad

You'll get lots of cash up front, maybe some points, and you'll be able to be paid to do comic conventions for the rest of you're life. The script? Don't worry. You'll have cool clothes, say a few lines, and then they'll CG you doing something amazing. It'll be like a Marvel film, but this is DC so it won't be as good. This movie is sort of like Monty Python. When I was young and it was the only show of it's kind it was really funny. Now that I'm old and there are many odd shows it's a little less funny.

The story line is paper thin and the less said about the huge star fish the better, that's all that lets this film down.The cast is perfectly cast, no actress could do Harley Quinn justice better than Margot Robbie, John Cena is awesome, Idris Elba.......well he's just Idris Elba but the best casting of all is Stallone as the voice of King Shark.......

Liked the characters a lot more than in the first iteration of the Squad, all of the main characters have a reason to be there. The human villains are bland, though. The actual boss enemy here reminded me of a Ghostbusters monster and even made me feel sympathetic towards it for a moment - just before it died a gruesome but necessary death. Most scenes were well choreographed, the action was well done (and a lot of gore, similar to The Boys on Amazon, if that's what you can tolerate). CGI was mostly good, the shark-god looked a little wacky at times, while that's exactly what made the Weazle character entertaining. Overall a decent time in the cinema if you're not heading there for a deep story and fleshed out characters but action, lot's of exploding bodies and one-liners ranging from cringeworthy to hilarious.",The Suicide Squad

The extended version of Ayer's Squad was much better than the theatrical and as many problems as it had, this one really built off the background of that one. Overall, the characters & actors were fresh & exciting. The storyline worked in the way that a team of bad guys go to clean up a mess that no one should know about. It didn't feel too large to where we questioned where the Justice League was. The mix of action, comedy, & drama worked quite well. The returning cast were great as they got to further dive into their characters. Viola & Margot were amazing of course however they felt more shallow in this one. Both would appear & disappear randomly and then have phenomenal scenes. Not that they were bad but they felt equally important & forgotten throughout the film. My only real ick was James Gunn shoehorn all his obnoxious buddies into this film. Albeit they were only present for a short time, they still were there enough. The scenes of action and chaos were quite gorgeous to look at. Not my favorite film, but definitely enjoyable & played great homage to DC!Pros:
Joel Kinnamin getting to properly shine as Rick!King Shark & SebastianHarley's action sequencesNewcomers spotlightsThe ToneThe rosterThe minor connections to the first filmCostumingThe heart of the filmCons:

Some of the Suicide squad were just pointless. Of those that make it to the end of the movie (or near the end) there's a Portuguese girl with a wand who can summon thousands of rats with a shiny staff and a nerdy guy with ""mother issues"" that had no relevance to the story who's only power was throwing explosive dots. Idris Elba did his usual thing of being all hard and from South London and making sure everyone knows he's the dog's cojones (ok I'm getting a bit tired of this, don't know how he ever pulled off playing Nelson Mandela). The only real saving grace was Margot Robbie's unhinged Harley Quin, again proving, unlike Idris, that she can pull off a wide range of roles.

So much better than 2016, and really most other movies these days. You gotta know what you're going to be watching going in though, as I think most--if not all--of the bad reviewers had no idea what Suicide Squad is supposed to be at all. Some seem to think this was supposed to be a drama, some thought it was supposed to be The Avengers lite, some thought it should've been a plodding, deep character study of write-off, z-grade villains from lost issues of forgotten DC books that no one cares about. One guy, I'm pretty sure, watched the 2016 movie and thought it was this one because he mentions long interludes of nothing. There's no way that guy watched the same movie I did, but could definitely be describing 2016's SS. These people then rate the movie based on what only they wish it was, even though their wish is theirs alone.

Unfortunately, this movie was mostly about John Cena (ho hum!) who is nothing on the same level as Will Smith. He's actually aggravating to watch at times! And Ms Robbie was more like a side note actor in the movie with small parts. For most of the movie I kept wondering where Harley Quinn was, and the script for her parts was extremely lacking in the humor we fell in love with in her 2016 movie which featured great dialog and a very funny Will Smith and Margot Robbie throughout the entire movie. I'm glad I didn't waste my hard earned money seeing this in a theater and watched it for free on HBO, otherwise I'd be wanting a refund of my money and my time wasted watching this movie. 4 stars for the movie for at least letting Ms Robbie be in the movie.",The Suicide Squad

A guy with polka dots, a lot of other ridiculous characters including the talentless and annoying Cena.(That's right the stupid shark has more acting abllity and personality than Cena). I get it that, work is work and during hard times actors take work where available but watching this movie I felt their talents wasted, and my brain cells dying! Story was all over the place, lots of needless gore to distract from the hideous acting, but not from everyone though.

1521,dylankoury,The Suicide Squad's Fatal Flaw,7,30 July 2021,"I honestly loved this movie until the credits rolled, but unfortunately the end credit scenes compound the single but dire issue this film has. Promotion for this film hyped up how no one was safe, and anyone could die, and for a movie called the Suicide Squad you'd think plot armor would be the one trope this film would have to forgo to live up to the name, and unfortunately that claim is disingenuous. Both end credit scenes show a character we believe to have died to truly be alive (and perhaps if that was the premise for one it would be forgivable) which honestly turned my satisfaction with the film into a sour taste. The movie turned into something disingenuous. Those end credit scenes served as a reminder that the stakes were never truly there (although Gunn does a good job at making you think they are). Ignoring the slaughter of ""team one"" which I don't think anyone truly thought any of them would make it past the first thirty minutes of the film, we are introduced to our main cast. Unfortunately only one of our ""team two"" doesn't make it off the island, the other death being that of Rick Flag. To wipe out Boomer and Flag felt like a purge of Ayers predecessor. Making the only truly genuine death in the film Polka Dot Man, and lets be real, with a name like Polka Dot Man you knew he was never making it out of this film. This movie is bright and intense, and pulls no punches unless you're a character we're supposed to care about.

Anyone who preferred Ayers version and rates this a 1 star I think you missed what makes this so special. This film has a lot of heart and at the center of it is our core cast of characters. They're all flawed and interesting in their own ways and I find that really special. They aren't perfect do-gooders but they are heroes. And they can feel pain. My biggest issue was King Shark seemed to be invincible.If you preferred the last film, sure everyone has their personal taste but don't be mad that people are enjoying this film more.

Also the dialogues are 18± but the villian or the enemy is 3±. You will laugh at what is going on once you see the starfish as a villian opposite to the suicide squad... Silly, silly, silly..... To sum up, the movie goes like this. You will see two scenes of vulger 18± dialogues then two scenes of 3+ kids scenes and the scenes go like this till the end.....",The Suicide Squad
1528,johnnyrcook,A poor man's Guardians of the Galaxy,6,6 August 2021,"It appears James Gunn knows only one style, cheesy space movies. This movie seems to copy GOTG. Silly monologue. Silly jokes. This combined with eliminating members of the original Suicide Squad from the comics with unknown unlikeable DC characters makes this movie forgettable. Moreover, the enemies in this flick are outright silly for the genre. The enemies are something out of a B rated space movie. It appears every reviewer must be below the age of 30 because any adult viewer would just shake their head at this movie and say, another silly money grabbing gore fest with crappy dialogue combined with crappy characters.",The Suicide Squad
1529,matt-27634,Better than the first,7,14 August 2021,"Neither a reboot, or a sequel, The Suicide Squad is great, whatever it wants to be.From the opening scene, filled with lots of gore and a surprising twist, to the end, complete with post credit scene, it's action packed and well worth the watch.Really exciting casting, even those who were only on screen for a few minutes. I will say it was nice to have Harley Quinn not dominate the entire movie this time, and some new characters be given bigger storylines than her.This film is more successful in getting the 'Deadpool' style humor they originally wanted in the first film and there were lots of laugh out loud moments.After watching this, I'm hoping DC will continue this momentum now.",The Suicide Squad

When SQ 2016 didn't go well, they just brought in James Gunn...hoping to make a movie like GOTG. Nice try, but it didn't work much.To a super hero movie junkie, it may be entertaining but it's just a stupid movie with no logic even for a superhero movie. WTF was that scene with Harley Quinn beating all those military guys. Even Batman couldn't pull that off without sneaking or using gadgets.Only thing it is different from other superhero movies is that, it has high profanity, violence and not everyone survives (hence the title, Suicide Squad) which were apt with the story.

The plot wasn't anything special but that was expected and it wasn't anything to ruin the movie. The characters for the most part were decent and everyone gave an adequate performance for the most part. The movie didn't take itself too seriously and was actually pretty funny, which is refreshing in a superhero movie that isn't grounded in reality. Another thing is that it definitely was not afraid to show gore with some really gruesome scenes which made for some pretty awesome death scenes.

The movie incorporated everything from action, suspense, drama, and more charter development.They touched enough on back stories you could create a connection without prior knowledge of them wile not becoming lost in them. The action sequences were shot beautifully and the way they flowed through was incredible. They managed to maintain the comic feel and hints of unrealistic being brought to life.

(+) King Shark(-) u dont really get an emtional connection to most of them, because you already know what happens to many of those guys(-) a lot of people will hate me for this...but I think Harley Quinn is not necessary for this movie, I love Margot Robbie. But even after the first film I didnt really understand the whole hype. I would rather had more screentime for polka-dot-man and ratcatcher. DC just completely sucks the juice out of Margot Robbies way of Harley Quinn...they shouldnt!DC is so much more than that. And I think with this movie they came a lot closer to the MCU.

The movie didn't try to make serious like the first one, and even when it was serious it was political lite, and of course make it ""R"" was genius.In general, DCEU now in the right track by making movies non related to each other with trying many stuff, but the big question is how DCEU will do their own cinematic universe (or multiverse) if they fired many of the old cast like Ben Affleck and Henry Cavil ?

So i ask, just who was this movie meant for???After watching this, the first suicide squad movie looks like a masterpiece. It at least had character development and by the end you could actually care about a few of them. It also had a more coherent, mature and entertaining story. This movie didn't have any of that.

I loved the new additions with John Cena and Idris Elba and with the return of Margot Robbie. I loved the action sequences, the many kills, and the heart. With Polka Dot Man dying tho, that hit me personally. With many deaths including Blackguard, Captain Boomerang, and Javelin in the first 10 minutes, the movie keeps those ideas throughout.

He was just on the movie for the trailer and within the first 9 minutes he died idiotically. THAT'S NOT ACTING.VFX were really poor for a movie that is for 2021. Other Studio had the similar VFX before 2014. For a superhero action movie much higher quality content was expected.The story was significantly good compared to the first movies so thumps up to the writer.The flashbacks are unnecessary and makes you lose the punch line.Sound tracks was AWFUL, considering that WB movies are usually having an outstanding sound tracks.Overall the movie is not engaging at all, The story is good and well put together but ...",The Suicide Squad

Bad Points: the use of look backs...8 minutes before, 3 days before, etc., the new characters, some with no explained background of what they do, and the bath bomb Starfish as the target of the Squad.

The special effects are impeccable, the villains' costumes are great and the scenes are identical the same way. My grade is 10/10. I LOVE THE POLKA DOT MAN #LOVE.",The Suicide Squad
1595,arrowappledesign,Sucker Punch -The Sequel,3,6 September 2021,"Everyone saying the first half is better than the second half is completely right. I ended up falling asleep during the camp invasion, and I remember being excited to return to this movie. It is at that point the movie becomes bizarre and there is no plot after the camp invasion twist. The main antagonist is not introduced until halfway in, And the control room has a very strange sense of non-consequential actions. There's a scene where the students rebel from the master and there is absolutely no consequence from that major plot device. The story just forgets it even introduced itself and rewrites its own identity. It would be like talking to someone who uses a new name with each person they meet thinking they are clever when in reality we just don't know what's going on.Each backstory from the characters is spun at random moments. The rat girls backstory begins right in between the action sequences at the climatic point 3/4th of the movie in when the starfish kaiju is about to win.There are moments that if there was a plot or purpose would've been excellent. For instance, bloodsport falling through the tower floor by floor to meet peacemaker would've been epic if it made any sense. Because that one scene was surrounded by such over the top nonsense wire jumping, that scene had no impact whatsoever. I really loved Harleys javelin jump to save herself from the tower falling in this same scene. Conversely, I hated the same jump being used to pierce the kaiju as a plot device.All the characters were unrelatable, when given their obvious weaknesses, should have been even more than their famously heroic DC characters like Batman and Superman. The dot man's Pathetic demeanor was underutilized. Harley Quinn's insanity was utilized. But the problem with Harley was that we didn't know what her weaknesses were or what her limits were. No matter how dire the situation, Harley could get out of it by herself so what was the point in having the squad at all? The same thing could be said for each character. At moments their power was so strong I don't see the point in needing anyone else.",The Suicide Squad

TSS was definitely the coolest movie for Harley Quinn, who finally got to show off her most bad ass and psychopathic sides to their fullest ability. Ratcatcher2 and Peacemaker were fantastic, instantly likeable characters who were instant favorites of mine, and I had no prior experience with these characters.

I put this in the same category as The Dark Knight and Wonder Woman.Many DC movies of late try to copy the magic of Marvel movies, but the comedy and style misses the mark. Thanks to James Gunn for making a DC movie that incorporates the same ingredients of a fun Marvel film without coming across as a subpar replica.(One of my few disappointments is that a couple of the characters aren't in the movie as long as I wished they were, but hey, their demises were unexpected.)",The Suicide Squad

What does it do? Maybe his personality was left in the first movie, I didnt catch that one. Fast forward to the 'starfishy' ending, it was very hard to stay awake.

If one looks under the hood and thinks about the characters, the plot or the story for 2 seconds then one realises that it's pretty bland and without consequences really. None and I repeat none of the characters had a complete arc; only suggestions of a journey in the past which some carried baggage from. It suffers from what I call cinema episodia introduced by the MCU where none of the films complete the story within the duration of a feature film often leaving the audience with cliffhangers or implications of a possible future where the real conclusion will take place.

1616,mrsham7,"""So this is the famous Suicide Squad.""",10,7 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is a 2021 action comedy written and directed by James Gunn.Not only did Gunn add a ""The"" to the semi-sequel/reboot/stand alone outing, but he also added everything that now makes this unmissable entertainment (having been given carte blanche by Warner Bros). It's fun, features a killer cast, a killer soundtrack, and a script that kills (literally) being both hilarious and gruesome.Similar to the emotional feel of Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad creates a lovable band of a-holes that Gunn gleefully plays with your expectations, and revels in the anarchic narrative he has created.All the cast are great fun to watch on screen with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn getting the big stand out action sequence. The less you know going in the better (be mindful of the tagline ""Don't get too attached""). David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man and Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, are exceptional, not only bringing pathos to the proceedings, but also being the instigators of some outlandish surreal moments.The best of the DC films, this demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible and rewards audiences with unhinged carnage, big laughs and real emotional depth. An indie cult classic masquerading as a summer blockbuster, which features the best cinematic shark since ""Bruce"".The best fun you'll have in your local cinema emporium this year.

I felt like without the gore and the swearing, this could would be very appealing for children, in fact that was really all that stopped this from being a kids movie.Props for the gore though, probably the only thing I laughed at. Another positive would be it's well made.I guess I was expecting more from this as a huge fan of Guadians of the Galaxy, and this being directed by James Gunn, I was expecting it to be an improvement on the first film but it really wasn't.

Few thing doesn't match the universe we saw so far like bloodsport who apparently send Superman in hospital with a kryptonite bullet, when did that happen?Lots of cliffhanger which are for most pretty good and some choking as hell. You will see by yourself.Most action happen in daylight while it was during the night in the first movie which was for me more interesting and realistic in term if send a team for a coup d'état in bright day, come on!Hopefully WB will is this movie to keep things going even I don't have hope in that, we all saw how they handle things during the past few years.PS: loos like we have a director's cut right away which probably never happen before for a dc movie!",The Suicide Squad

We can appreciate its pain and that it was surviving happily before humans came along and changed its life. At the same time when we're introduced to the character one of the first things said is, 'starfish can mean butthole, is that what it means?'The merger of idiotic humour and deeper understanding toward existence and happiness didn't work for this film. I would be interested to see the David Ayer cut, I imagine that it's much better than this film and follows the pain and trauma from the characters more closely. I guess when they edited it they wanted to make it fun, exciting, and draw crowds in but they took away a lot of the heart of the movie.Save your money. This one can be missed.",The Suicide Squad

.""Relive the Superhero Experience with James Gunn""
.When James Gunn brought Guardians Of The Galaxy in 2014 he brought about a revolution in Superhero Movie experience. It was an antithesis to traditional emotional Straight-Faced action based superhero movie. After 7 years, I should say, James Gunn brought out our ""SUPERHERO MOVIE PRO MAX""
.GOTG was a movie of Misfits. And which group is the Legendary icon of Misfits? Yes, the one and only DC supervillains The Suicide Squad. So when a proven director is given the task to bring out a fitting flick with this misfits, he didn't miss..
Suicide Squad is a cliched film. This is A Film of mostly Cliches. But sometimes that's what we need. But everyone do their cliches perfectly. There is a Groot in King Shark who wants to ""Nom Nom"". The Harley Quinn is 10 times better than Star-Lord. And there is some original characters to sympathise for, like Colonel Rick Flag, and even ""The Starfish""..
Apart from the MVP Margot Robbie, James Gunn pretty much changes the Squad ensemble, and boy, How fine they were!.
This movie doesn't takes it seriously for a split second. But still it will reach your heart with the one-liners. And regarding technical things, what a superb production design! Discovered some great songs through the film..

This helps a lot with the jokes that are here, as they are given time to breathe and dont feel forced, and a lot of the time are absolutely hilarious because of the longer time spent on them, and in between them.The movie has weight, and the characters have real chemistry. The times when it gets serious and emotional hit a lot, whether its a simple line (such as the villains final line), or a tragic backstory; it all feels really well done, and.. well.. real.The action pulls no punches (no seriously holy crap this movie is violent) and looks and feels incredible. This is afforded to the R-Rating, but surprisingly) James Gunn utilizes the rating in less of a Deadpool way, and more of a Logan way, making the world a lot less innocent and a lot more grim, something that is just pretty impossible without this rating, (see Xaviers ailment in Logan for example and in this film, Ratcatcher 2's backstory) and the movie is all the better for it.All in all, it was a fantastic surprise, a ridiculously good ""sequel"" (if it even is that or a reboot), and just a great time that im so glad coincided with cinemas opening back up in my country.Bravo DC, youre finally getting your act together.",The Suicide Squad

1646,jcblur,"MUCH Better than the Original Squad, but Still Not Great",5,7 August 2021,"I'll get to the point for anyone that is on the fence with checking this version out or not. Firstly, don't believe the hype from the ""this is the greatest comic book movie ever"" fanboys and girls, although it is pretty good. Secondly, I absolutely loved Gunn's ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" I've watched it at least 10-15 times since it came out. Thirdly, although I was looking forward to the first ""Suicide Squad,"" due to the general premise, star power (Will and Margot,) the cool trailers, and of course Jared's Joker, I was greatly disappointed. It was a massive, heartbreaking train-wreck.And lastly, this was good, but not great. I liked it, and will probably watch it again sooner or later, because I love these types of movies, but probably not more than once or twice.

This movie is creative, funny, emotional and visually stunning. The opening sequence alone is perfect and makes clear immediately that none of the crap that was Suicide Squad 2016 will be happening here.But also without comparing it to the first movie, it convinces the audience with its fantastic music choices combined with creative shots, violence paired with funny lines, and believable characters.

However, I take a movie for what it shows me.The first one wasn't good, but it was many times better than this one.There are 2 reasons I ranked it as high as I did: The twist at the beginning (beach scene). That was good. I enjoyed that, but it went down hill at warp speed after that. 2) Harley Quinn; although she popped in and out of character was decent. Other than that, it was terrible and that's actually a compliment. 2.5) Sylvester did a pretty good job with what he was given, but everyone assumed his character would be much move violent. So they failed to deliver on that one.As with all poor writers, they use the F-bomb when they can't think of anything creative to say and this film is no different.The forced ""jokes"" were so childish & lame, even a junior high boy wouldn't laugh at them.John Cena's character was so lame and stupid, it was unbelievable. He was a joke. He took a neck shot & bleed out (before the star fish came out and leveled the building he was in) and yet he survived (ending credits). LAME X 100000!Starro (really creative name there. Again with how bad the writing was) look cartoonish. Like something straight outta Scooby Doo. It was ridiculous & laughable.

1681,d_fernandez,"Hard to see, hard to explain...",4,7 August 2021,"It's strange to start a review having so much and at the same time so little to say.First I have to say that I can't find any answer on why so much people love it. It seems that somehow you love it or you hate it like it happened in other, not so far in time, hero movies from DC.The story goes forward and backwards several times, a move that not much people like, it seems that the director choose that roadmap in order to try to give continuous thrilling and action, and that don't work for me in that angle.Margot Robbie's acting is awesome, Idris Elba kicks the same ball, John Cena goes a step down together with Joel kinnaman (a character more guided like altered carbon would have been outstanding), and the rest... Oh boy the rest could be almost completely erased and then the story would be almost the same. Viola Davis is indisputable, she has the talent and has showed it thousand times but here, nothing even near an acceptable figure.The story has some huge and heavy problems, not only of continuity (see ticking lights of police prison transport when crashes and half a minute later for an example) but also on what is trying to go. I can't stop thinking that here the producers had the same problem that fast 9 had: a numerous sequence of action tied by nonsense and boring nothingness that has nothing to do with the line of the movie. Starts bad like a class b movie, at 5 minutes it goes down and after 15 minutes it looks even worse.The enemies: when fighting against normal soldiers, the soldier's IQ is near 0, they can't see any far that a meter of where they are, even in straight line! Not forgetting than their aim is somewhere between inconceivable and hilarious. The latins show less ambition, emotion and violence than any 5 year old child. And the main enemy, looks like he was cut out from Looney tunes.The thing is simple: If you like the first 15 minutes of movie then you'll like the rest of it, if you think that it's like a waste of time then don't expect better for the rest.",The Suicide Squad

1696,uwasattheclub,Making comic book films fun again,7,31 July 2021,"Going into this, I was cautiously optimistic. Regardless of David Ayer's original intentions, the 2016 Suicide Squad was unfortunately an absolute mess of a film. It was overly dark-looking, characters were flat and had little to no banter or dynamics between them aside from the occasional forced one-liner. And oh boy, I don't think I need to mention what an embarrassment that take on the Joker was. From hearing that James Gunn was behind the camera and seeing the trailer and promotional material, it seemed that although DC were going in the right direction, it could very easily go wrong. Initially I had my concerns that they were relying solely on James Gunn and the strength of his previous efforts to do a redo and fix their mistakes. However I am glad to say that that was indeed the right decision, because damn was this a blast.Ever since the Dark Knight trilogy, it feels like DC have kept trying to recapture that dark, serious tone without really knowing how to pull it off without Nolan (while also tampering with every other director's vision who tries to attempt it). It's apparent before the opening titles that this is not the case at all with this film, as it seems James Gunn was really given free reign to make it as stylised, bloody and whacky as possible. First off, the cinematography is colourful, vibrant and some of the best I've seen in a modern DC or Marvel movie. The characters are fun and distinct from each other, and play off each other really well throughout. I was pleasantly surprised to see Harley Quinn not being half as annoying as she previously was while still getting plenty of time to shine (including an insane action scene!) The action choreography is bloody and pretty brutal at times, but always has an element of slapstick and is very fun to watch. Speaking of which, the comedy is actually pretty well done and lands most of the time. Sure there's the occasional joke that doesn't work or a silly one-liner but it's much more forgiveable considering the light-hearted and zany tone of the film.Overall, this was basically just a complete blast to watch from start to finish. Doesn't overstay its welcome or try to force you to care about its plot through exposition or shove some message down your throat. The main goal of this film is to ENTERTAIN you, and it does so far better than 85% of comic book movies coming out today. With this, Aquaman and Shazam it really feels like DC is prioritising entertainment in their films again, regardless of how silly or crazy it is. Honestly, continuing a run like this, they could easily overthrow Marvel as the top dog superhero studio that everyone wants to see and talk about (especially seeing Marvel really running low on good ideas after Endgame). If you want to just watch a campy, over-the-top DC movie with an emphasis on 'fun' for 2 hours, this is the movie for you.",The Suicide Squad

It's not about heroic deeds, a grand establishment story or the first story of a great trilogy. It's a comic book movie that goes out of it's way to make sure you understand just how ridiculous everything in it is. And that's how it should be, who is supposed to take a character called polka dot man seriously? And yet it does make you take them seriously, giving the team a sense of real camaraderie and genuine moments in between everything. The plot does get a little slow in between and all the jokes don't make you laugh, but it's a wild, exhilarating ride that knows exactly what it is. I want more comic book movies that know what they're doing instead of edgy CGI fight scene filled movies.

I give them props for trying to get away from being so serious all the time but they went way to hard trying to make it funny. It was borderline parody kind of humor and it got to the point where I almost forgot that they tried to make a serious movie. They dressed John Cena up as Mermaid Man, missed 10 opportunities for epic fight scenes and dont even get me started on the big bad looking like Patrick.

1709,Als_Reviews,"Fun and funny, not without its flaws",7,6 August 2021,"The Good:
Solid performances across the board, the material was definitely elevated by that. Idris Elba's performance was the one that stood out for me.Very fun and enjoyable for the most part with good action with a humorous flavor that carried the rather weak script.Gets the most of its R rating unlike other DC movies, this one was very bloody with some rated R humor. I enjoyed both.Visually, the film looks great, I think Gunn did a good job directing it but....The Bad:
It was a case of style over substance here, I found the whole script and premise of the movie to be empty. And the action and humor does its best to cover that in the first two acts, and it does that perfectly, but when things get too ridiculous for my liking in the third, that was when I was patiently waiting for it to be over.I admired the creative risks taken, but I didn't agree with them, namely the decisions to kill a character as cold as it did just when the audience was connecting with it. And retracting what was easily the most surprising moment, it was going to be an 8 until the post credit scene, make sure you stay for that.The Rating:
The Suicide Squad was a fun and funny movie with the flaws you'd expect from a dumb fun movie. I had a good time watching for the most part. I give it a 7/10.",The Suicide Squad

The characters Harley Quinn , BloodSport were very likable...
Even John Cena fit in well along with polka Dot and RatCatcher 2... Although i thought i would find Cena as Peacemaker really annoying:P
I found King Shark to be the most funny and he was good....
The film also surprises us in the beginning and makes us feel that those important characters should have been there....
I liked the amount of bloodshed that was there but by no means this is the best Superhero movie made by DCEU as many fans are claiming...
The film lacks background at certain moments like why Cena opposes the task force X etc and is unevenly paced throughout....
The Sex scenes of Harley Quinn also looked very forced... Wasn't necessary...

But letting Gunn have freedom was like letting a toddler have sharpies on a new painted wall.I would have marked this lower, but there were some redeemable parts. Harley Quinn was good, the intro was good. It was funny to see bloody body's ripped apart or shot to start with, but after two hours of the same thing it gets tiresome.I won't spoil the plot, but it becomes like a lovechild of the expendables and Doctor who. Which is fine, if it wasn't the suicide squad. It lacked darkness and spite, instead was trying to hard to be funny whilst blowing people's limbs apart.I came out of the cinema not really knowing what Gunn was trying to do.Plenty of people have enjoyed it, and that shows the film was aimed for mass appeal which maybe is what the studio wanted. But for me, I will never watch another one of this new Disney wannabe DC drivel.Many will disagree, but I am now going to watch the Ayer version and appreciate what we had before Gunn got hold of it.

The second act drags horribly and could have been edited down. The third act is about as generic as you'll find among comic book/heavy sci-fi action movies. But I guess it's about the execution, which was pretty solid.The ""Squad"" ends up being a pared-down version of the 2016 original, so there are fewer characters to keep track of, but even with that, only a couple get anything to really do or build on. Basically, if you're coming for an innovative plot or character development, this isn't your movie. Just have some laughs and maybe make yourself a snack about an hour in.There was also a political element to the ending, which ended up being some clumsy critique of US neocolonialism (I think?).

There are few things that I particularly didn't like or cared about. Especially Harley Quinn's portrayal. This is my least favorite for sure. Missed the SS HQ vibes. So many boring scenes here and there. HQ romantic scenes were unnecessary and stupid. If Zack directed that sequence, there would have been a huge backlash from critics and DC gatekeepers.

1765,abdelrahmanashraf41,They really are dying to save the world,9,7 August 2021,"Let's start by saying that The Suicide Squad has a little bit of everything. It has Humor, Action, Gore, Drama and you can feel that though-out the movie. This is easily James Gunn's best movie to date, he was given complete freedom to do what he wants with this huge ensemble of characters, and boy, he didn't disappoint. The movie is starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport and John Cena as Peacemaker. With the Films' R-Rating, It has the ability to go as far as it can get with it's characters that at any moment any character can die in a blink of an eye, and it's not always pretty when that happens. The movie really does utilize the R-Rating pretty well. In my opinion, this is the best Margot Robbie has ever been playing Harley Quinn, She has mastered the role having played it in David Ayer's Suicide Squad and Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey and this gave her the ability to really embrace the character's psyche. She really is the perfect casting as Harley Quinn and I really hope to get to see her play the character for many years to come. Idris Elba's character has a lot of similarities with Will Smith's Deadshot from the 2016 movie at first, but as the movie progresses, they start to feel like two different characters and Idris Elba did a great job playing the role. Peacemaker being played by John Cena combines both the humor and Viciousness of the character as he would do anything to achieve peace even by ""Killing Women and Children"". The story of the movie itself is about gathering a group of misfits and useless villains to create The Task Force X led by Amanda Waller to go on suicide missions to achieve her own goal even if that means sacrificing all of the squad. Viola Davis is brilliant as Amanda Waller, having played the role before in David Ayer's Suicide Squad. But this time she gets the chance to dive deeper into the character's motivations and that she would do almost anything to get what she wants and that made her team question her actions through the course of the movie. The Plot is quite generic, but that's the point. I wasn't going in expecting a complicated plot and twists and turns, there are twists and turns, don't get me wrong but what I'm trying to say is that you should go see the movie with the mindset of seeing all these characters come together on a suicide mission to try to save the world from a huge starfish trying to take over the planet. You go in with the mindset of enjoying the movie with all the action and humor in it because it is a lot of fun. The movie also has a lot of heartwarming moments in the backstories of some of the characters, and Ratcatcher 2 gets most of those moments being played by Daniela Melchior, She really did a good job as for me, she can really be the heart of the movie. King Shark being played by Sylvester Stallone is really a fun interpretation of the character as King Shark is always known to be this Human-eating monster with no emotions, But in this movie he is really well written and gets some of those heartwarming moment too. The visual effects are super well done in this movie as I really didn't notice anything that can ruin the experience at all. All of the visuals are of high quality as it was done by studios like Weta Studios as They previously worked on movies like Zack Snyder's Justice League and Avengers: Endgame and much more. The only thing that I would take away from the movie is that I wished they have used Peter Capaldi's The Thinker more. In my opinion, He is very under used in this movie and I hoped that we could experience some of his abilities. Overall this movie is a Joyride, It's a lot of fun to watch and I'm excited to see what more can James Gunn bring to the table in the future especially since The Peacemaker mini series is coming out soon on HBO Max.",The Suicide Squad

1769,pln_pierre,"You have to know how to say it, you have to know how to recognize it.",7,29 July 2021,"Warner continues to drain the surplus from its blockbuster catalog, and the latest screenings are neither the most reassuring nor the most memorable. The same goes for the competition, who wanted to project themselves with a pale and deeply trivialized ""Black Widow"". Yet in the midst of this intercosmic mush is James Gunn, who is reborn and whose style eventually flourishes in the Hollywood limelight. Recovered by the neighbor, then rehired by Mickey's house, the filmmaker bounces on so many occasions that clear him of ambiguity. And it is on the same ground that stumbled David Ayer, that he is building a zone of solace, combed with blood and entrails under the sunlight of the tropics.Flames ? We'll assume so, because in general terms, the father of ""Horribilis"", ""Super"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" had fun doing what was once forbidden to him by his studio. And overall, we find all his filmography there, with a good touch of dark humor and a zeal to iconize his characters, whether they are ephemeral or not in the story. It is then good to remember that the villains that we follow have different degrees of humanity and it works from the first minutes, which undoubtedly ruin the development of some, but who keep the promise of not awakening the heroic instinct that we have. Will have exhausted, even ejected from the universe. But water has passed under the bridges and this remake takes the form of an informal sequel, which is not fun to reprimand the version of 2016. On the contrary, it captures with delicacy, its routine and its scenario taking on a post-it. The characters that we keep in mind will have evolved or else chance will have helped Gunn, like the agent of perfect chaos in the mess he announces.So it's all about casting, and that's why this factor achieves a diversity that would make any previous heroic reunion at DC pale with envy. Unheard of on the big screen, the summer period inherits a bunch of suicidal broken arms. However, it remains in a harmonious bubble, where the mirror of the United States is shattered and the marginalized, or even the invisible ones in society, reveal their grotesque nature. This does not spoil the narration, which appreciates each character and which transports them in a choir of the most gory, recreational and enjoyable. Idris Elba embodies a somewhat smooth Bloodsport, but responds to Will Smith's Deadshot, whose solo score illustrates the team's failure. Here, it is not necessarily around a handful of mercenaries that we gather, those that we will meet forever untouchable, of course not. Margot Robbie once again extends this dark Harley Queen madness, which flees only in loneliness and in the glitter it creates for itself, as if to free itself from the yoke of a push, poisonous and immoral.Peacemaker is therefore introduced with the firm intention of articulating his vision for peace, but often confronts his makeshift partners against his share of quips, which always hits the nail on the head. John Cena camps him with an address, which perhaps destines him to find a way out in this kind of role, cynical and ruthless. Too bad for the fairer sex, it is a little more delicate, because we do not dig enough Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to understand her limits, if she has any. Likewise, Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) is undoubtedly too readable and predictable, like a climax that stretches, but whose disconnection will end the whole thing in style, until it takes full view. The graphics of the shots are fundamentally neat and sequenced in a necessary time frame, because everything is a question of timing. The broken tones and the variety of kills bear witness to this.Villains, movies, blood and emotion are things that Warner's previous promise failed to get us to digest. ""The Suicide Squad"", although it forces a little too often into overexplicative ellipses, is a magnificent transgressive, visually poignant work and an adaptive gem paying homage to comic books and its finest boards. Without revolutionizing the genre, what James Gunn manages to convey will no doubt find the echo sought by producers, whose overexploitation of decorum deconstructs his myths more than he constructs them. The irony is that the filmmaker does not follow a guidebook by following the wick. He prefers detonation at close range, in the heart of the action, in the heart of good emotions.",The Suicide Squad

Without spoilers and with rather a direct cut to the chase I must say - James Gunn delivered, along with the humorous, yet dedicated cast and crew.With an R rating, viewers can expect action sequences with unfiltered gore - more like flaunted, actually. Don't bother keeping track of the f-bombs either. For a movie with this type of source material and potential, the execution and balance of explicit material was executed nearly to perfection; Although, in my humble opinion, some liberties were taken to an extreme in a few instances at least. Nonetheless, The Suicide Squad is definitely a must-watch for DC fans and superhero fans in general that are of the appropriate age and mindset.",The Suicide Squad

It was fun, hilarious, crazy, wacky, unapologetically violent, unapologetically raunchy, and surprisingly heartwarming.Despite the director's questionable views on certain things, he did an amazing job. Just like with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2"", he managed to make unknown and seemingly silly looking characters have more depth. He has this incredible ability to make silly and quirky-concept type characters and anthropomorphic characters genuine when it comes to humor and heart.Everyone in the cast did an excellent job. The direction was great. The storyline was solid. The action was unapologetically wild, gruesome, and badass. The visual effects was amazing.However, I did have a few issues with some parts of the story and the characters. I wish that they would've gone more in depth with some of the characters and have a few more moments to breathe a bit.Still, I like that this film embraces the absurdity and insanity of the situation while still having moments of characters reflecting on whether what they're doing is right.I may be rushing a bit but I hope that they make a sequel to this film.

I mean, are the DC fans so dumb to accept this movie as a masterpiece?The first movie had more substance than this. It had some character building, some chemistry between cast and some purpose.This one has nothing. Just 2 hours of somehow funny dialogue, colours, colours, and again colours, some starfish with a big, huge, eye that pops up mini versions of itself and some guys with different agendas.Even Amanda Wheeler looked like a bad joke of her previous version. If someone new to the DC universe was asking why is called Suicide than he had his answer in the first 15 minutes of the movie. So many characters brought to this movie for what?

1797,jsidedfilms,The Antidote to Superhero Fatigue,9,22 August 2021,"Everything that makes The Suicide Squad so great starts with the creative freedom James Gunn was given for this film. The MCU has always been infamously known for playing it safe with their successful movie-making formula. And it's worked. The majority of their films are entertaining but we now live in a world where superhero movies are the kingpin of Hollywood which results in new releases feeling stale and recycled.With movies like these, studio interference, which is behind-the-scenes, is ironically very public. Or, at least, very noticeable in the final product. Justice League's theatrical cut was notoriously known for being way different from the directors original vision (ie. Snyder Cut). Hell, take some time to look into the original Suicide Squad and how Warner Bros gave David Ayer, the director, the same low-blow they gave Snyder.Now here lies James Gunn's The Suicide Squad.This sequel is simply a colorful bloodbath of a film that feels like something Quentin Tarantino would've directed if someone had locked him in a comic book store for a couple weeks.The concept of pulling D-List comic book characters and forming a connection with them and the audience in just 2 hours is something that should be praised just on its own. This isn't Gunn's first rodeo (ie. Guardians of the Galaxy) and he only improves on it in The Suicide Squad.And Gunn takes advantage of using lesser-known characters and makes them dispensable which keeps viewers attentive and on the edge of their seat throughout.Take any frame of this movie and slap it in a comic book and it'll blend right in. One of favorite parts of this movie were the integrated chapter headings inside the film which is just another tipping of the hat to comic book enthusiasts.Gunn has no shame with the brutality that bleeds throughout this film which I can see scaring some audience members away. And that's a reoccurring theme throughout this film:This film doesn't hesitate to make a name for itself. It's bloody, comedic, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Which is important in an era where superhero films are oversaturated. As said before, cookie-cutter doesn't cut it anymore and Gunn fully understands this.In a nutshell, The Suicide Squad is simply a director having full creative freedom and making the most fun out of his 300-million dollar budget. And this time around: it worked. If you're looking for a sequel that complements the first installments tone, you're going to be severely disappointed.Continuity should be able to take a dip for the sake of keeping things fresh every once and awhile, and that was a big controversy with this movie for some. This didn't bother me for one second, because in the end, we all just want to be entertained.I can totally see The Suicide Squad being the pioneer for the next generation of superhero films. James Gunn and Warner Brothers have found the antidote to the superhero fatigue.It's artistic freedom.",The Suicide Squad

1808,amccandlesandcameras,Well we were laughing but not at the intentional jokes,3,15 August 2021,"I may be in the minority here but I liked the first Suicide Squad but this one fell short.The first chunk of the movie was literally killing off a bunch of random characters just for the fun of it. They didn't impact the story line in any meaningful way. It was just a complete waste of time.I guess if you just want to watch a bunch of people die in brutal ways with no care of there being a point then you would probably like the first 10-15 minutes of it but I like quality storytelling rather than quantity gore.The characters were barely even skin deep. They were there purely to kill things and provide punchlines that fell flat.Also, If there ever were some secret government operative team using violent criminals for important missions they would certainly not be as dumb as that crew. I'm no genius but I would know to check and see who can swim before sending them in the water.I'm sure I could go on and on about the many aspects that made this movie a laughable attempt but I'll end it with this.The creature looked like bad 90s Claymation creature with a goofy eyeball. It was beyond ridiculous looking and it's little mind control babies were even more ridiculous. Then it shoots it's little mind control out of labium in it's arm pits and they somehow know how to fly, not like a bird or a bug or any way that makes logical sense but by this bizarre bouncing action that defies all laws of the universe and just looks hysterically wrong.I went with a friend and even though we both agreed this movie was HORRIBLE we also agreed that it has a cult appeal for it's ridiculousness and we laughed through most of it. Just to be clear though, we were laughing AT it, not with it. There were maybe a few intentional funny lines but mostly it was laughing at how awkward it all was.",The Suicide Squad

The first one tried to be serious when the premise was absurd and cliche. Recognizing that and having fun with it is was made the second one better. We've all seen King Kong and Godzilla destroy everything. Why not a giant one-eyed Starfish then? Having the first - more ridiculous -squad be introduced first was great and original. Not sure what the point of Michael Rooker was though.The second is to look at it on its own. Suffers a bit here. As some have said here, the banter was a bit forced as they tried to get the GOTG vibe that Gunn was previously successful at. Not so much here.

But the witty humor the actors in the MCU play out so well, seems Gunn didn't achieve or wasn't even trying for in Squad. I'm not saying I was looking for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in Suicide Squad Take 2, I just thought I'd laugh more is what I'm saying. Which leads me to the R rating, I'm no prude, (and as I stated before, Guardians PG-13, both much funnier), but given the excess freedoms allowed in an R rated film, Gunn kinda went all-out on the gross-out and sacrificed the humor. The story itself, again, it wasn't genius nor was it horrendous. It needed some tweaking & fine tuning and the climax tip-toed (I'd even say crossed) the ""this is borderline stupidity, I mean c'mon"" line. I guess I'd say just don't think about it to much, but you shouldn't have to, even with a film like Suicide Squad. But I will say for a 2 hr 12 min runtime, it def holds your attention, and the few jaw-drop worthy scenes, make the watch worthwhile. In improvement over its predecessor, as a whole you ask?, sure, I'll go along with that.",The Suicide Squad

I thought the villain would be silly in live action but it was made amazing, every character had great development and made me care about them and action in second half of film is non-stop which I absolutely enjoyed in a theatre.

1827,kallludde,James Gunn has done it again,9,12 August 2021,"I'm more of a marvel guy, but since this movie is made by Gunn I knew I had to go see it. I was not dissapointed.First off, this movie is hilarious. I'm not the kind of guy to laugh watching a movie, the most a film gets out of me is usually a chuckle. This movie made me laugh several times. The scene where all the characters met on the plane was great, the banter in this movie is fantastic.This movie also had very high stakes. The only character I felt t had plot-armor was Harley Quinn, the others I had no idea about. This movie also has some really great emotional moments, and of course the scenes where the characters sit down and bond are fantastic. The characters (except Harley) all were great. The biggest surprise for me was Ratcatcher 2. She was kind of the emotional core of the movie. She is the nicest of the characters, and she bringed the team together.As I said in the beginning of the review, I'm more of a Marvel guy. The only DCEU movies I've seen are Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. I did not see the first it one, nor did I see Birds of Prey. This may have made me enjoy the movie more, perhaps less. This leads on to my next point. I didn't find Harley all that interesting or funny. This is the first time I've seen this character, and I do not see why everybody likes her so much. Margot Robbie does a great job, but that accent is really annoying in my opinion, it gets old really fast. Her subplot was really boring and it drags down the movie.TLDR: This movie is awesome, Harley is not. 9/10.",The Suicide Squad
1828,musicalmarvell,Rats Are The REAL Superheroes,8,6 August 2021,"I just finished watching this marvel of a film. The first thing that I can immediately point out is that it's obviously nothing like the regular, PG-13 films marketed towards kids and people attracted to Henry Cavill.""The Suicide Squad"" is reliant on an excessive amount of blood and guts, which is not for those who are squeamish. But, if you're able to get through the nasty stuff, the story that unfolds over an acceptable 2-hour runtime is worth the watch.James Gunn's direction and screenplay are undeniably the best to exist in the DC Cinematic Universe to date. His lively, creative vision for the film is exciting to see, and it's exactly what this franchise needed. The problem with the original ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Justice League"" films is that they felt so underwhelmingly arid. The superstars were shiny but the final result was as dull as Jared Leto's Joker. Gunn takes every aspect to the next level in this film; from the comedy to the characters, as well as the overall ambience. He establishes a solid connection between us and the ensemble cast, ensuring that we understand their stories or at least have an idea of who they are and who they will be.John Cena's performance as Peacemaker surprised me greatly; I've never seen him portray such a captivating role! Every minute that he's on screen, he manages to be outstanding alongside a star-studded cast. Whether it's in a humorous bit or a serious scene, Cena validates his role as one of the best he's ever done. Sylvester Stallone's Nanaue (a.k.a. King Shark) is also a colossal highlight, with his hilarious moments making you wish that YOU were his friend. Ultimately, the main set of actors, including Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, Viola Davis, David Dastmalchian & Daniela Melchior, are truly fantastic moreover. The strength that this cast encompasses is dangerously flawless, and you cannot deny it one bit.And one more thing-- the cinematography. Ooh, and the score! Henry Braham captures each scene thrillingly, giving us some of the most beautiful shots in the DCEU. And John Murphy's score elevates the action scenes perfectly, providing the best amount of suspense and surprise. The soundtrack for the film is very fitting too, featuring classic songs in certain scenes that take the mood beyond our eyes and into our ears.It was surely expected that the main-man James Gunn would do an excellent job with this movie, considering his work in the MCU with the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" trilogy. Though, one thing that was unexpected that we should've seen coming... was the true saviors of the story: the rats. We can always rely on super soldiers and trained assassins, but in reality, rats are the REAL superheroes.",The Suicide Squad
1829,kadenkirtland,Lived Up To It's Name,9,8 August 2021,This is the definitive Suicide Squad movie. The first ten minutes immediately live up to the premise with the irreverent humor of the comics.

Harley is quite cool in here. Peacemaker is OMG act right there. Simple, cute and ruthless of King Shark is great.

Most of the characters are quite well written (although they are all well played by their respective actors and actresses).My favorite character is Ratcatcher2, she is very cute and I empathized with her a lot. I also still love Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She is very charismatic and funny.The Character that I liked the least was Peacemaker, it was necessary to explain why he is so extremely nationalistic. I understand that they want to leave the origin for the series, but they could have shown a little in this movie. But I loved John Cena's performance.But anyway, I am very happy that we have this movie and that they have given all the creative freedom to James Gunn.

1839,connorbaileyactor,Possibly the worst film I've ever seen,1,15 August 2021,"As it says in the title, this was possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I think I've seen a worse film, but I can't remember when. First was the lack of story line, it felt like they were grasping at something, but there was nothing there. Second the mass use of really poorly constructed characters, most of which used for cheap laughs. Third the monster they were fighting was terrible, and not really much of a story behind it. Plus they defeated it rather easily in the end. Lastly I think they need to give up, the last two movies with Harley Quinn in have been awful the character has been ruined, this is also the case for some of the other DC characters.This was the first time we had been to the cinema since lockdown and it was a massive disappointment, my girlfriend turned to me 45 mins in asking if we could leave, it was that bad.

1843,ncotorcea,Best DCEU movie yet,9,6 August 2021,"While ZSJL was so loved by DC fans I still stand for my title.The Suicide Squad is exactly what I thought it would be and more. It's a movie done with pleasure in a world where money is the main reason a film is made. This is not a cinematographic masterpiece or the best superhero movie ever made and it's not even trying to be. While the visuals are great, CGI is made properly and I loved every costume in the movie especially Bloodsport's, the plot is simple and it's really trying to focus on it's characters instead of the story. James Gunn's biggest achievement in the Suicide Squad I think it's giving every single character a bit of personality so that when you see someone on the screen you kind of expect a certain way for them to behave. You actually see Harley being a crazy human being, an aspect that I feel all the other movies she appeard in neglected transforming her in a children-loving woman in an universe where she killed Robin who was in fact a kid.I loved every action scene, (and the movie is full of it) especially the one in the middle of the movie. Gunn impliments humor during them in a way so they become even more fun and in theme with the film instead of distracting and taking you out of the it. Also the editing is WAY above the 2016 Suicide Squad.Now I have some problems with the movie and I must Say that most of them are just personal and many other s won't sense them as me.First, I feel like with so many villain characters Rick Flag was left outside and is super underutilised, him not even feeling as the leader anymore and just some side-character.Second, this movie has no real villain. The movie focuses so much on the team that forgets about the threat and when it appears it's so thin and absurd that for me it become a joke. A GIANT STAR and zombies.Verdict: The Suicide Squad lives to the hype and it is just what it promised. The movie is not for kids or sensitive people but for comic and DC fans8.7/10.",The Suicide Squad

There's little to no character development or backstory and not much plot setup, so you're not attached to any of the characters and you're not invested in the mission they're going on. Scenes jump around too much and felt scatterbrained at times. The jokes consistently missed for me. The sound track didn't work for me either. The gore and the foul language were excessive and felt more forced than elements to complement the story. It's like a Guardians of the Galaxy meets The Boys, so you have this movie being some weird kind of hybrid of the two, with aliens and bright colors, trying to tell jokes while still looking all dark and grungy, swearing and blowing people's heads off.

And gore was somewhat ok, a little over the place, but not as overused as the humour.Other than that, actions were solid and the pacing and treatment of characters, was really great. All the characters signed.Some unpredictable deaths doesn't deliver the sense of ""wow f**ck, that was unpredictable, cool!"", But felt like that was wierd, unnecessary and not so cool at all.For me, Starro and Thinker was wasted. And Harley felt kinda undermined, even after getting her a solo little kidnap-adventure. Except Harley, every other squad member shined for me. Oh, and I didn't like what happened with Waller at the end.Visually it was great.

1853,danreetam,The best DC Movie ever.,10,6 August 2021,"Gruesome, Irreverent and witty throughout, The Suicide Squad is a non-stop joyride from start to finish. It was unpredictable and certainly delivered on the endeavour to raise the stakes of the genre, shamelessly killing off a plethora of characters in true James Gunn fashion. The film expertly switches between various tones to create a truly cohesive and full story, juggling heartfelt character moments and thrilling action, graphic violence and intelligent humour with ease and tact, overall producing a special experience for DC fans old and new and truly setting itself apart from the vast roster of copy and paste superhero movies. The cast of the film is vast in number with every member as talented and enjoyable to watch as the last. Notable standouts for me were Peter Capaldi as the joyously evil mastermind, ""The Thinker"" and of course, Sylvester Stallone as the voice of the simple, lovable, yet feral beast, ""King Shark."" As well as this, the returning cast from the 2016 Suicide Squad felt new and invigorated with Gunn's writing style, yet still retained some connective tissue to past films. This allowed the film to build upon pre-existing lore, enriching the wider DCEU as a whole, whilst simultaneously providing a purely unique and self contained story for the audience to become completely immersed in, without worry of how things tie into other projects. One final thing i feel i must comment on is the design of the film. From each character's attire seemingly ripped directly from the pages of DC comics, to the unapologetically colourful and outlandish ""Starro the Conqueror,"" The Suicide Squad felt like a love letter to DC nerds everywhere, willing to engulf its main cast in the wacky regalia of their comic counterparts, where many other films of the genre would typically shy away in favour of tactical jumpsuits and modernised armour. As a big DC fan myself, i found a lot to enjoy in this film and hope to see more comic adapted properties daring to be as bold as this one.

What a shame!Almost every one loves to see Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn but I'm sure most of us pissed off her over-usage in DC movies. Harley Quinn isn't a big villain in DC universe, never was. Also she's not a hero nor a noteworthy anti-hero, never was. But yes, she's a woman and as everyone knows, Hollywood prefers to show us powerful woman characters recently. Unfortunately, an overpowered and invincible Harley Quinn just doesn't fit the nature of DC comics.The Suicide Squad is just another terrible DC movie which you wish you didn't watched.

The second act however was weak.Although the second act was weak, let's talk about the great stuff first. First of all, it's funny interesting, the colours look beautiful, gorgeous cinematography with great shots. The acting is excellent, like everybody is great in this movie. There are a bunch of unexpected scenes and moments. The action looks epic. The spectacle is epic. The first and third act is the best. The songs though are fun but sometimes underused. Still, great soundtrack. James Gunn is excellent in crafting a heartfelt delightful violent story. There are moments that have a ton of heart. And some very interesting time transitions instead of lazy texts on the screen.Well, there are a few negatives here. Such as the thinker, which is a underdeveloped character.

1883,bbass-70234,Definitely better than the first,7,8 August 2021,"I think this movie has the best representation of HQ of the 3. The writers seemed to understand her character enough to give her the right amount of quippy dialogue, and the R rating let a lot of the actors and editors have fun. It looked like a blast to shoot.John Cena had a surprising amount of depth in this movie. Well casted and well done in my opinion.The mascots slowed down the film for me with the dumb humor; since it was rated R, those scenes felt like moments for my kid brother to enjoy.I had no idea where or when the characters where throughout the whole film though. The title cards were a nice stray from a normal lower third, but sometimes I still just couldn't even tell where we were.The end of the film was weird. I had no emotional attachment to the last scenes, I felt more during HQ's monologue before her (second) capture. Viola Davis knocked it out of the park again, but I just couldn't tell why in the ever loving fudk she would tell a squad with supernatural abilities not to kill a kaiju ravaging the city. Was that not the premise of the first movie? Would them saving the world release the contents of the SOLIDEST state drive to the world? It was on the news anyway before they showed up lol I'm still like what was the point.Anyway, somehow this edged out over its prequel and B. O. P. In terms of excitement and fun, but I think it's because the genre has finally matched the rating. DCU needs to stay in the R category like this to remain competitive.",The Suicide Squad

with out standing performances from some big names, channeling their given character's egos and expressing their characters in top form.With over the top action and plenty of gore and destruction, the film never fails to entertain, sometimes falling short on its jokes, humor is still in high regards and will keep you from leaving you're seat, along with its edge of the seat suprises.Though the story is yet simple, there's plenty of heart in it, with back stories and shockers to really grip you.Again James Gunn provides us another hit movie and yes with an amazing sound track !!DONT MISS IT !!",The Suicide Squad

However after watching this,I believe that this movie has more heart than any dc movie released in the past 10 years. The character development is fantastic. Gunn has given every major character a lot of emotional depth and has redeemed characters like Rick Flag who i didn't care for in the 1st movie. This movie made me feel sad for minor dc characters I never knew about.

Full of special effects with no human drama, the exposition is bad, every 5 minutes change the emotion of movie without any bound within before seen. Movie clueless, just gore and watch me shooting and blood everywhere.

1923,mythbuff,Suicide Squad a bit too suicidal,7,7 August 2021,"Let me start by saying this movie is exactly as off-the-rails crazy as it should be. It is absolutely ridiculous in every single aspect, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The villain is a gigantic mind-controlling starfish for crying out loud. You can't go into this expecting a serious movie.My only real issue with the movie? They killed off way too many characters.Jai Courtney, Pete Davidson, Michael Rooker, and most of all Nathan Fillion were all advertised in every trailer and on every poster for the movie. And they all brutally die within 10 minutes for no reason other than shock value and dark humor. Boomerang was one of the few good parts of the original movie (along with Harley and Deadshot) and I was excited to see more of him. And then he gets chopped up by a helicopter. Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors. His powers in this movie were completely ridiculous, but it would've been cool to see him use them for longer than 10 slapstick seconds before he's killed. I don't even know what Pete Davidson's character could DO because they killed him as soon as the action started.(But of course the weasel survived)The biggest disappointing death was Polka-Dot Man. They took a schizophrenic character with one of the dumbest powers you can think of, gave him a very cool backstory, and actually made him good. He was funny and he was useful. As soon as Starro came out I was like ""Well, Polka-Man's stuff should cut right through that right? Inter-dimensional energy and all that?"" And it did. Once. Then, as soon as he was happy for obviously the first time in his life, they killed him for shock value and dark humor. Completely unnecessary.So many characters could have and should have been expanded upon. And if the goal wasn't to expand upon them, they should have been excluded or just not advertised as much as they were. Shock value is only valuable if you're given time to get attached to the character. Not if it's a big name actor you were excited to see who just dies for the lawlz.If you watch this movie, go into it with low expectations and you will not be disappointed. Not because it's a bad movie, but because it's so balls-to-the-wall wild that you just cannot take it seriously.",The Suicide Squad

Clearly and upgrade from the first flick. Movie has really great production quality. Cinematography has a distinct style especially. Only negative is that pace is slow in middle section because of plot and character development. But it pays.This movie doesn't care about offending woke cultists yet it is not political at all. It refreshingly does not care about politics.I god pleased with this despite walking in with high expectations. Hollywood is full of woke lame movies today.

Once that's done we're thrown back right into the action only to be slowed down again. It's almost like you're about reach 'climax' and you stop to explain how you got there, which really put me off the movie especially right at the end with bloodshot's character (those super knees though) who we see land in front of cena after seeing all the fight with flag and about to shoot ratcatcher 2.The jokes don't land most of the time. Dick jokes are all over the movie. Unnecessary sex scene inserted. Gory for the sake of making it gory.I felt the movie didn't have the heart, It was a Popcorn movie except you have to see the blood popping out of everywhere. They tried to make it heartfelt by putting a back story but I couldn't get myself to sympathise with any character. Idris's character was good but felt like a payday. Not much going on there. Cena done a very nice job but needs refinement in the comedy. King shark had decent scenes and the gory scenes with him were justified. Polka-dot was amazing to watch but not enough of him in there.All in all. I wouldn't say it's the best comic book movie of all time.

The mise on scene is playful and creative without ever distracting from the narrative. The main villain is ridiculous, yet totally worthy of a comic book. The characters all have moments which feel like they were yanked from the pages and respectfully inserted into the movie.And if you're invested, the poignant moments land in an authentic way.If you're attached to grim, world-shattering epic DC movies, this might not be your cup of tea.It's a great popcorn flick with a touch of pathos tucked in.",The Suicide Squad

This is a brash, loud and extremely colorful movie - however, leave your brain at the door as there are no existential crisis here.If you after an entertaining couple of hours (in the company of some of the funniest and diverse supervillians), go see this movie!",The Suicide Squad

I mean i had no expectations cuz the SSQ (2016) was an abomination and the marketing for this movie was terrible (I didn't even know when it comes out), so i just went in with a clear mind. I think the problem is the basic plot and the predictable pacing. At the end of the day, you are not going to remember the movie the next day (perhaps one or two scenes) and if it wasn't a DC film, it would have a 6.5 or less rating. Definitely better than the first one, like that's a given, but nothing interesting really happens so ..
Ps. I've read reviews that say this is the best DC film after Nolan's trilogy, but the truth is this the best DC film after WW1984 (which I didn't really enjoyed). Shazam was way better than this tbh.",The Suicide Squad

After watching that movie it's hard to not just conclude the writers are incompetent, but they're bad people to boot. The Suicide Squad 2021 however is very competently put together, amusing and enjoyable. It at once subverts expectations while remaining clever, believable and enjoyable. Instead of feeling like you're being asked to barrack for a bunch of bad people, as with the first one, characters have development and redemption arcs.

1954,southernpride51089,Had alot of potential.....They made some dumb choices.,2,1 September 2021,"So when they were teasing the cast I said heck ya this could be good and funny because they had some actual funny cast members like pete davidson, nathon fillon, the guy from guardians of the galaxy, and weasel and polka dot man. So I was pumped when I started the movie. 15minutes goes by and Weasel drowns and you think hes going to be saved by white hair dude maybe one of those scenes where someone has to give a foul mouthed creature mouth to mouth at the same time getting blasted with nasty rodent breath or something. And no he just dies? The 1 min after pete davidson's character is a wimpy traitor and his face gets shredded, then next to go is detachable armed nathon fillion with no real dialog given to him and a pansy death. You would think they would use detachable arms throught out the move for comedy purposes but they don't use them at all. Last but not least guardians of the galaxy actor Xanadu gets the worst roll after helping to make james guns reputation these days his character was unspeakably stupid. At the beginning you were led to believe that he is a crazy kick a** machine and instead hes the biggest wimp and gets his head blown to bits. So at about the 30 minute mark literally every ounce of comedy that could've been pumped into the movie was dead I did not understand this choice at all it makes no sense to me.

I don't know, something's missing, hmm.A good story maybe, yeah that could be it, i mean come on, tropic island state lead by dictatorship, experimenting with superweapons?Didn't we have all that in hundreds of other movies before?Even the best director can't make a good movie from such a flat story, so considering his previous milestones like Guardians of the Galaxy i will give James Gunn the credits he deserves. But that still doesn't make this movie better.I didn't really buy the characters, all too flat, at some few points there were small tries to give them a little more depth by telling their personal stories, but it all looks too ""constructed"".When you take the main hero's character more or less one to one from the first movie, giving him a different look, different weapons, but an almost similiar father-daughter-story as a background, than it really brings your lack of ideas directly into the bright light of day.What can an actor do with a character as described above, well, they tried their best, but John Cena is just John Cena, Idris Elba is good and Margot is always gorgeous, but none of them is an an actor-genius like Robert Downey Jr.Says it all.To me it was like one of the old Schwerzenegger movies like Commando, at the end a fire and forget film.",The Suicide Squad

I did expect it to be on the level of the first Suicide Squad or even better! But my expectations were not meant to be...The movie starts with an utmost and unnecessary massacre of quite a lot of well-known characters (such as Captain Boomerang, who was one of my favorite. Blasted after just one throw of his boomerang), and quite in a ""brutal"" way. It looked like DC tried to fish people into cinemas with these well-known names and then just blow them up while saying ""hey, you're watching it already, so no matter""...And then starts a stupid adventure of the dumbest team ever on a mission ""nobody knows what or why"" while blasting everyone around like it's just another day. It looks cheap and childish, but with an RThe dumb plot that Flag just suddenly decides to betray his government and his country, even though he has been working for the Suicide Squad Project, is just too damn stupid. Especially with how Peacemaker suddenly goes to stop him... Come on, creating a conflict out of nowhere is....disappointing...Harley kills out a whole military outpost (that was guarding her) like it's nothing. And I mean it! She didn't get a scratch. But killed almost 30 people in there... DC, Harley is cool yeah...but she is NOT A SUPAnd finally, the overall protagonist - the ALLMIGHTY SPACE PATRICK THE STARFISH!OH. COME. ON
Like, the whole crew didn't have a better idea about the final danger/boss?? A giant space starfish, who wants to destroy the whole city? I mean, really...?? How old are your designers/scriptwriters? 10, 12 years old?An utter disappointment...

1972,eincrespo,Silly escapism. Great fun.,9,9 August 2021,"Much better than the first movie. Plot, truthfully rather thin and generic, may be silly fantasy but then again most comic books are. The Suicide Squad is an example. James Gunn goes wild with the violence and profanity but doesn't forget that anti superheroes could be vulnerable and you end up empathizing with them. The Don't Get Attached warning from Gunn holds true as members of the Squad gets picked off in gory fashion. It is a bloodbath. Top rated performances from Daniela Melchoir, David Dastmalchian. Margot Robbie is at her prime as Harley Quinn and she's a riot! Idris Elba holds his own as Bloodsport. His character and John Cena's Peacemaker's banter may seem jock-like but it works. Viola Davis smashes it as the ruthless Amanda Waller. The only niggle is Peter Capaldi's The Thinker was underused. All in all The Suicide Squad is a fun popcorn flick that doesn't really take itself too seriously so don't take the film seriously. Just enjoy the ride.",The Suicide Squad

1983,tenniashiu-08547,..Confirmed that it's Kevin Feige who is the genius,1,13 August 2021,"I wasn't expecting much with this next Suicide Squad, but was hoping it could at least improve upon the last one. But whilst the first GOTG was really awesome and was pretty genius in almost all aspects. This movie has proved to me that it's really Kevin Feige who is the real genius. That he is the one that has elevated ordinary directors to another level providing the needed restraint to prevent a crappy over-indulgent mess of movie like the one we have now.I've rated this 1 star to help dilute the 9-10 ratings and I rarely make reviews but thought this was needed. The only positive point was Harley Quinn escaping herself from being tied up which showed how she used her wits and craziness to get herself of situations. However, it all goes downhill from there.. her whole being courted by her captor and even bedding him was so cringe worthy and over the top. I get that she is crazy and falls for people she shouldn't, but seriously, like this? How cool is it to like fall for someone, bed him and shoot him? How is it showing us craziness that makes you think she is a cool character or sympathetic? It just is pathetic sidestep to satisfy a male centric wet dream.. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Then the whole father daughter connection with blood sport and ratcatcher 2 was so rushed and forced just in space of 5mins, feels almost borderline creepy. The pacing was so off and slow with so many scenes feeling forced or tacked on cos it was just because it was James Gunn's idea of fun and to show us gore and for the R rating. No thrill or tension at all. I saw Forever Purge right after and felt it was a much better movie.. But the real cherry to top it off was the huge Spongebob starfish monster.. so ridiculous and so childish..... it's not scary, it's not interesting, it's not making any sense.. ratcatcher and her father scenes and the message of the rats is good.. but not done well and felt like part of another movie.. lucky I didn't to sit in cinema for this movie ..

The beginning as so many cliched ideas and 'improv' banter that we almost gave up entirely. And again, how many dumb-guy characters do you need? And does every movie need a bug-eyed, mute animal to attract an audience? It's a good movie if you're under 16 yrs old, maybe. I will give it credit for partially redeeming itself after the 1/3rd mark by actually have a plot and interesting enemy boss, but this is really more of the same... formulaic and for the (extra) dumb masses.",The Suicide Squad

The start is at a breakneck pace, that when eventually slow down for some character development it feels like we are already hours into this film.It would have been better as a 6 part tv series, with the amount that happens, each scene could be developed rather than feeling rushed and empty.Worst part is each actor turned in some solid performances, the script and directing let them down.",The Suicide Squad

1996,realmoviescout,Who was your favourite character?,9,13 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad (2021): NO SPOILERS.DC Comics drop their 10th film in the DCEU (extended universe) this weekend. Out in theatres and streaming on HBO Max. It's the standalone sequel to the 2016 Suicide Squad film, which was rated PG (huge mistake) and pretty average.Written & directed by James Gunn, The Suicide Squad is rated R and so bad ass. A huge upgrade from the first. It's relentlessly violent, not quite hilarious but at times very funny and even a little emotional. I didn't see that last one coming.An amazing cast. Is there a better actor than Idris Elba, who is Bloodsport. Margot Robbie, once again as Harley Quinn and my god was she viciously beautiful. Simply deadly. The biggest surprise was John Cena, who is Peacemaker. Now mind you I just watched Fast 9 yesterday and I didn't like him at all in that (all due respect of course). Here, Cena steals the show. He was full of good jokes and so likeable. Hats off my friend. You killed it!Daniela Melchior is sleepy Ratcatcher 2, probably my favourite character who is surely taking a nap as I write this. Although other characters lacked development, which reduces my score a little, we get quite a bit of backstory on her & her friend who is always by her side, Sebastian the rat. I don't know who I love more, Sebastian or Splinter from Ninja Turtles.Although I did find that every character got plenty of screen time, Joel Kinnaman as Colonel Rick Flag probably had the least, leaving him feeling dull and boring. Sylvester Stallone is King Shark whom I loved, David Dastmalchian is Polka-Dot Man who is creepy yet a friend you can trust and Viola Davis is Amanda Waller, director of the Task Force X program.I really enjoyed most of what this film offered us. The cast, the music, the action, heck, even ""Project Starfish"" was pretty cool. The visual effects/CGI were amazing, especially considering how much of it was used. There's a lot of destruction here.They're labelled as super-villains but you'll be calling them superheroes in no time. 2 extra scenes.

I'm 100% done with her as Harley Quinn, she's a gorgeous woman but the character is unbelievably annoying. Also I'd imagine Quentin Tarantino would be absolutely fuming at the fact that Margot Robbie's feet play such a pivotal role in one scene and he missed out on them toes in his last film.Terrible dialogue, I'm talking daytime soap opera level.I watched this for free online and I'm glad I didn't pay for this.

Every minute of this movie - worth watching and hearing!How. Does. Gunn. Manage. To make. Every. Character. Likable. How? I mean, we all know that he is a god of team-up movies, even though he didnt do many! And that was the reason i went for DC movie, and i usually dont, because the way DC movies were held before - was way too serious. I knew this wasn't going to be the case. But it doesnt mean you wont feel for the characters. Don't get too attached! Although, trust me, you will!Those, who rank it from 6 to 4 are probably people who are tired of genre or superheroes. And those, who rank it below 4 - i am pretty sure they ranked this movie in their heads before even seeing it.I mean, come on, what did you expect?Less gore? Less moral-less humor? Deep ideas?

With each one having a backstory or an arc, that made me feel for themKing Shark and Peacemaker were really funnyRatcatcher 2 was my favorite characterGood actions scenes and cinemetographyThe score was really good.What i disliked:Killing Polka-dot Man in that way was anticlimatic and a little bit forced.And a few jokes didn't land.Overall: It's really good, but don't watch it expecting the new Dark Knight or something that takes itself seriously.",The Suicide Squad
2009,arkhamj,"Warner Bros., KEEP LETTING THE WRITERS WRITE!",8,7 August 2021,"One of if not THE best DC film to date. A completely fun, R-rated, stupid, psychotic heist film. Not one character was unlikeable or useless in the film. Great casting and acting from everyone. Yes, that includes John Cena, who is as confoundingly charismatic as ever. Don't care what anyone says. And what an absurd scenario, putting all these obscure and occasionally laughable villains against such a galactic powerhouse of a villain. Just ridiculous, and amazing.James Gunn excels at writing flawed yet lovable/admirable characters. Guardians of the Galaxy, Super, and now this. This man can WRITE! This movie definitely shows the potential that DC's future holds. Keep em coming. Suicide Squad 2021 and the Snyder Cut both exemplify that the corporate bigwigs need to stay out of the writing room, and let superhero fans write movies for superhero fans.

2014,jeansanchez-80827,BEST DCEU FILM AND ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE,8,2 August 2021,"James Gunn has done it again, he has delivered not only the funniest DCEU film but the best one as well. This is 100% a James Gunn film no doubt about it, and we won't have to worry about hearing anything about the film being taken away from him. This has his signature all over it from the humor, look and violence. I've never been afraid to admit that I'm a fan of the first film but this is better in every single way. I loved the mission/military film vibe of the film. The team lives up to their name this time around as many characters die and in gruesome ways. That was an issue I had with the first film, that despite the title I don't feel many died. Gunn being a better writer than David Ayer also helped with character development, as he actually made me care for majority of the cast, I felt a connection to also all. This is definitely a reboot, as besides Rick and Harley knowing each other, there's not much mention of the first. The soundtrack was fantastic and rivals the music in the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy""..
.Many people were skeptical to the R rating, and let me just say it's warranted. The freedom Gunn got with dialogue and the dialogue and rating was fantastic. Seeing King Shark rip people to shreds just makes me wish we would get a Rated R ""Venom"" film. Margot once again delivers as Harley, and I feel this her best performance in the character. She gets some great highlight moments. Idris Elba has finally gotten a comic book character that is worthy of his talents. He was fantastic as Bloodsport, and better than Will Smith, so I'm glad he replaced him. He has a great competitive rivalry with John Cena's Peacemaker than provided the film with some of its funniest scenes. Speaking about Cena, I love him in these type of roles. He is perfect in them as he has great comedic timing and plays a dick really well. I'm really excited for his HBO MAX series. I'm surprised by how fleshed out and how much I loved David Dastmalchian's Polka Dot Man and Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2. I didn't expect much from them and thought they would be corny but they ended up being my two favorite characters..
.Starro lives up to the hype. Coming from his Troma background, James Gunn was the perfect Director to bring him to the big screen. I'm also amazed at how great he looked, as the CGI on the character was flawless. The one issue I had with the film is that the secondary military villain, who was almost essentially the main villain for the first two acts sucked. He was a generic mission/war film villain. Overall, one of the best films of the year, don't see it on HBO Max, try seeing it in Dolby or IMAX as it deserves the big screen treatment.",The Suicide Squad

2018,stanley_dickerson-72737,"Great director, bad execution",1,7 August 2021,"I honestly don't believe James Gunn thinks this his best work, or even his good work. What I did like was the realism of the gore, that was a nice change of pace for the DCEU, what I didn't like was the rest of the movie.When comparing Marvel and DC, Kevin Feige to Zach Snyder, Marvel is winning this race IMO. It just seems since Chris Nolan left DC there has only been flop after flop, with a few noteable exceptions: WW, Aquaman and Zach Snyder's Justice league. I'm a DC fan, more so than a Marvel fan, but this mediocre movie trend has got to stop.I really hope that the Dark Knight trilogy wasn't the high light of the DCEU. I mean, James Gunn is amazing, but come on, I don't believe anyone really would say this movie has rewatch ability.In closing, hero's are only as good as their villains, and DC had an opportunity to really make a great movie, but instead made another green lantern-esque flop. The ratings will drop in a week or so, people are just so beat down from COVID, that the first morsel of escape we collapsed on, like a dry sponge to water.

2023,thelethys,"So, so",7,12 August 2021,"Some of the jokes weren't funny. At all.Action is on top, but at the same time, the very course of the plot sometimes sags. Because of this, it seems that the film runs not for 2 hours, but longer. That's just discouraging.All characters are dragged into action, and some scenes are reminding us, that we are watching the movie not about good boys and girls, but criminals. Yet, some still manage to see that what they are doing - wrong. The last words of starfish are heartbreaking.Overall, funny (but sometimes the ""jokes"" were straight up awful, honestly), seems a little bit longer, than 2 hours, but crazy action scequences compensate that. Bloodsport and Peacemaker showing off scene is funny and brutal at the same time, so is the movie in general.In conclusion:
Entertaining and boring at the same time. Funny and unfunny. Emotions change, like when you riding a roller coaster. The movie deserves 5/10, in my opinion, but one more star for showing off scene. Can't help it. R rating justified fully.",The Suicide Squad
2024,jkevinparker,This is how a Rated R DC Comics film is supposed to be!,10,7 August 2021,"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad is SO much better than the first Suicide Squad. It is not a reboot of the previous film-it is a very loose continuation within the same DCEU continuity, meaning you can watch The Suicide Squad (2021) without seeing Suicide Squad (2016) first (or at all).TSS is absurd in all the right ways. It's incredibly funny with tons of amazing action and a story that actually works. No sky beams or dancing enchantresses. Just a bunch of RIDICULOUS comic book characters that were all perfect for this movie. TSS had no business being all this AND having such incredible emotional depth for this genre of film, but it does and it all works!!!For DC fans: This is NOT a Marvel knock-off. It is very much a DC Comics movie with its own style.Maturity: This film is Rated R for lots of gore and foul language, plus 2 very brief shots of nudity (not involved any ""the act"").",The Suicide Squad

2027,vilhenafurlan,Almost perfect!,9,9 August 2021,"That is to say, the direction of the James Gunn is awesome! Making the acting and the photography perfect. Like the scene that all the fight happens inside the helmet of Peacemaker. This scene is great because it's not only visually awesome, it's makes sense on the narrative, such as the character who's fighting is the character who uses the helmet and this probably inside the mind of him. And when the Bloodsport command the group to attack the starro, making a travelling with the characters in an over the shoulder of the Bloodsport, such as he is the leader of the squad, commanding the squad.Not just the direction, but the acting is really great too! I believed in every character, not even imagined who was the actor that role-played a specific scene or whatever, just immersive characters! And the actors didn't make the characters flat, they were very emotional, it was made with heart! Talking about characters... They were deep, even a little, but every character was deep in this film. Cause every character had a past, other side... Making their human, relatable, understandable. For example: Ratcatcher 2 when she talks about her dad. And that scene that show her past inside the window, interacting with the place where she is, just perfect!I laughed a lot with this movie, it has a great timing! Almost every time when the King Shark I laugh, he's a very stupid fella, makes a lot of idiot things, but not every second. When the Amanda Waller explains the mission, and he questions it, he just said ""hand"" LOL.And almost perfect, just that I wish this film could be a little faster... I mean, they explained a lot sometimes. Such as the ""8 minute earlier"" when they were at the tower, I think it wasn't completely necessary, because I would understand this scene without this ""8 minute earlier"". But it should not affect the movie in general, it's just a little thing what does not interfere in the whole movie.So... If you watched the movie, watch again! Or even if you don't, watch!

John Cena's Peacemaker should have more development it kept you just waiting for that little bit more (maybe cause of the TV series coming out) and never actually got quite there. I felt that for all the characters in general. Ratcatcher 2 back story felt abit not needed really, Polka dot man could have stole the film if the character was better developed. Elba's Bloodsport like all the characters could and should have gone to the next level, but was just missing that spark. The 2 hours and odd minutes was alittle long for me, it felt could have been wrapped up 20 minutes earlier.

This is a typical James Gunn movie- no matter WHAT people are posting. If you like GOTG and you don't like this then I'm wondering why.Also, you know what are probably the worse comic book movies? Green Lantern or the most recent reboot of Fantastic 4. Not this movie.The action on this movie starts pretty much immediately and it's pretty gory, but it's funny. There's a lot of death in it, but that's kind of the point of The Suicide Squad.

It follows a team of messed up and violent people who become a family and learn to be heroes. Every character, like the movie, is extremely cartoonish, dark and serious, and full of heart.This movie sheds a light on US imperialism and corruption and champions those that are forgotten by society. It skips forward and backward in time, but it remains a brilliant and simple plot structure. The movie's tone is jarring, but on purpose, and in the best way possible. The style of James Gunn is very strong, but it's a style I can get behind.I enjoyed every moment of this movie. That's the key. It's fun. It hits you hard in multiple different ways.

2064,mechstorm-99713,DC embraces it's wacky side,8,30 July 2021,"In contrast to most of Snyder's offerings and even the previous Suicide Squad movie, this movie is actually quite fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously and knows exactly what it is: a silly, stupid comic book movie, which isn't a bad thing by any means. James Gunn's visual flair brings the extremely memorable cast into their own, a personal highlight being the Harley Quinn escape scene, which highlights what the movie does best: gratuitous violence and amazing spectacle, driven by great leads. The main characters don't feel like cardboard cutouts here, and while their development is not that deep, it's still leaps and bounds ahead of the last movie. The music lines up with both the previous film and Gunn's previous work on Guardians, where licensed music is put to use in memorable scenes.My only gripe was that the movie didn't lean as far into the ""anyone can die at any time"" aspect as I would have liked, with most of the cast being whittled down early on. But other than that, if you enjoy fun action movies then you really cannot go wrong with THE Suicide Squad.",The Suicide Squad

This is not an average Marvel Superhero Movie where the hole tension is absolute garbage because you know the hero won't die. The Suicide Squad is the perfect example of how superhero movies could be if you just throw away the Marvel formula. DC does it better again. Again with an FSK 16. What a surprise. In my opinion superhero's became way to childish. Look at Batman. He is one of the hero's that's not childish and in my opinion he's the best. He's dark, he does have some really big issues with his family etc. And he has the best villains. James Gunn had every liberties and now this comic book masterpiece became reality. I love it. King Shark is again a very good example on how James Gunn can create loveable characters and fan favourites without them talking really much. The Aquarium Scene with King Shark was perfect. A really emotional moment in a film like this. Perfect. For the first time I saw Harley Quinn. Not like in Suicide Squad or Birds of Prey. Please don't see this Film with marvel eyes. It's not a Marvel like superhero movie. It's much more. Thank you.",The Suicide Squad

Lifting the restraints from his previous MCU films, The Suicide Squad allows Gunn to kill any character he wants, which gives the film a real feeling a danger that constantly keeps on the edge of your seat. Featuring excellent performances from Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Viola Davis, Daniela Melchior... well pretty much everyone, gonzo action, a smartly written script and above all an undeniable sense of fun, The Suicide Squad is not only DC's 2nd best film after The Dark Knight but also rises to become one of the greatest comic-book movies of all time.",The Suicide Squad

Simply because it was sooooo overhyped.But just cuz it was overhyped, doesnt mean that it was a bad movie. Gunn did it again, this time for DC, helping the Universe to get on a new, better path for the next movies.To put it as it is: It is an entertaining movie, very original with crazy characters and a load of fun, goofy action.Dont expect it to be more than that, cuz it is not some groundbreaking new experience of a lifetime or anything.

As I said in the title, the movie was full of life and colour. You can just pause the movie at any time, take a screenshot and it could be a great wallpaper for your PC. I was just looking at the screen and just thinking how the hell did James made this movie, maybe with magic...
I didn't get bored for one second. The movie just attaches you with it. But, don't get so attached, 'cause you'll fall in love with the characters and you'll have to see them suffering.Before 30,35 minutes from the ending you could think that, okay, it was a great experience, but now maybe it needs to be end. But just wait a few more minutes, you'll just shock and then you'll never want it to be end. You'll say I want more. The actions were so unique and dramatic. I loved the chemistry between the characters especially Bloodsport and his daughter( and it was far better than deadshot & his daughter's story from the first movie). And King Shark, oh my goodness, he was just great, he was just bringing life to the movie with his every appearances. You can just see that the actors worked so hard for their rolls.It wasn't like a DC movie or any kinda movie attached to a superhero universe. It can stand by it's own. It was a totally different experience, a much much better experience than other DC movies. I hope it joins the Billion dollars club 'cause it's worth it. I am sure you'll never get bored by this movie doesn't matter how many times you watch it.At last, l can say to james gunn that he just changed DC by this movie. Thank you very much.",The Suicide Squad

I was not disappointed.This movie felt like a deranged comic book on film. The cinematography was great and there wasn't a moment I wasn't entertained. The action scenes were reminiscent of the Kingsman movies, perfectly gory and light-hearted to keep you from feeling sick.I also liked the way Gunn interpreted the comic like fonts into the movie. Just another little thing that made the movie much easier to follow and enjoy.Overall, this movie reminds me of a more gory and down-to-earth (literally) Guardians of the Galaxy and is a perfect reminder that DC can make movies just as good as Marvel with the right cast and director. 9/10.",The Suicide Squad

Too many jokes were either generic and predictable, some even being telegraphed 10 minutes in advance. Others were cringy adult humor jokes for the sake of cringy adult humor. Amanda Waller's character was utterly ruined for cheap jokes, actually making the original suicide squad film the better of the 2 by a small margin. Still waiting on thr Ayer cut for a proper comparison.Watch this film if you want to turn your brain off for 2 hours and want a Guardians of the Galaxy meets Deadpool movie wearing the DC label.

I didn't think the story line was that great and the new squad was the dumbest squad they could come up with. And also some of the dialogue was awful.

2100,Fictons,Great improvement,7,4 August 2021,"DCs track record on films is like watching a twitter argument, it can sometimes be entertaining and mildly charming but overall it's messy and full of holes left to be desired. Take 2016s suicide squad for example a convoluted mess that got torn adpart by clueless studio executives and with a potent combination of botched edits.The trailer left a lot to be desired, it stuck me by how little impression the suicide squad made on me, so I was pretty skeptical going into the movie, and after watching it today for the most part I had a good time with it, for the most part.The suicide squad is a vast improvement over it's predecessor although that isn't that much of a hugh bench mark. It gives it's characters much needed levity this time around and allows them to kickass again. The suicide squad isn't without it's problems and I can tell you there's a lot of problems with this movie. First off the majority of the jokes do not land in the slightest, and that's a problem because it makes up most of the movie. The gags are cheap and obvious that drag on way too long, and it's quite excruciating to watch.You are bombarded by so much ridiculous nonsense it's hard to follow, and that is the same for the pacing of the suicide squad, it juggles a lot of ideas and it definitely drops the ball at times. Like for example there's a non exact plot about Leo capaldi character that was the key to pretty much everything and suddenly he's there with the squad with a very bleak reason to the convenience of the plot, it just felt cheap.The best thing about this movie was the characters and the twist in the final act, to a final act that is far from perfect. It really caught me off guard and it's the single reason why I rank this movie so high. It's ballsy and this is risks marvel doesn't take and it's the single reason why I think DC has immense potential. The characters are well constructed and James Gunn is a seasoned professional at this and can take any character and make them like able, it's what he did with guardians of the galaxy and it's no exception here.If I was to describe this movie is that it's potential, potential DC can finally get their act together and finally get back on its feet, because this movie is a great leap forward for the DCEU as a whole and excited to see what the future holds for film in dc.",The Suicide Squad
2101,loganwhitfield-93953,Best in a while,9,6 August 2021,Thoroughly enjoyed this film. To it's credit It doesn't take itself seriously for the most part. It's incredibly fun to watch and could be the more adult oriented superhero flick you've been longing for.,The Suicide Squad
2102,Dolting,Easily in the top 3 of superhero films,9,6 August 2021,"Idris Elba is one of the finest actors of our generation; every scene he touches turns to gold. His hero's journey in this film was one worth taking. While he's a standout, the entire cast is fantastic-including John Cena. As a fan of John Cena, I've been very critical of his previous works; but, this was his foot in the door to big Hollywood roles. He did well.The humor was excellent, for the most part. As expected, you're going to hear a few forced jokes, but the corny Marvel level of humor is successfully avoided. Some scenes absolutely had me in stitches without a word being spoken-and that's rare..I'm going to watch this film twice in the same day. I don't recall the last time I did that. It must have been a Christopher Nolan film, and those are meant for re-watching.

2104,migueljonatha,Jonathan RM.,1,30 October 2021,"With all due respect to the people who worked on this movie, but it is one of the biggest disappointments of 2021, starting with the bad publicity that said: ""The Suicide Squad is a masterpiece"", when the result shown in theaters is a generic movie. But, it sins with the cliches of the previous one (not to say that it is the same plot base), there is no interest in telling a story, because it only strives to show its attractiveness, violence and jokes (not bad, but it is too exploited nowadays), you are not interested in the characters because there is no exploration of them, the R classification, it is vulgarly executed, there is no maturity or density in the plot so that the (R) classification is fair, but it is the same exploitation of the R rating, as an adaptation to the comic because it is far away, as a general film because it is a common and current, Gunn knows how to make interesting characters (like Super 2010), but this is an abysmal setback, it is on the same level as the movie to Birds Of Prey, they both waste an interesting cast and characters, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the experience (just the popcorn), but no wonder it had lower support, much lower support, this is a lot of noise and little nuts.",The Suicide Squad

Initial DCEU movies had far better action sequences.Characters are not used correctly and you will see the repetitive content almost every 10 mins. This movie's overall story is very less as compared to the last one.Some jokes are fine but still, I have not paid to watch some jokes and 40 mins of content to a movie.People liking Bloodsport is fine but to be honest, we don't get options to like any more characters. But I can tell you that he is no match for the Deadshot.The overall movie feels predictive and lacks the vision. 80% of the characters are not used in the correct way.It's a disappointment.",The Suicide Squad

Maybe a chuckle here or there. Also, the ""heart"" of the movie was so forced. Characters just randomly start talking about their backstory. I probably won't be rewatching.",The Suicide Squad
2125,regim-42088,Sucked,1,11 August 2021,"This movie was JUST. SO. BAD. I can't even believe there are people who like it. The jokes had to have been written by a 6th grade boy. I kept thinking of that scene in Idiocracy where Dax Shepard's character is watching the show ""Ow my balls"". I mean, I guess if you think using the word butthole is hilarious, this might be the movie for you.TSS tried to be so much; funny like Deadpool, quirky like Scott Pilgrim, and dramatic like...idk. It just failed on every account.",The Suicide Squad

2129,bryanhandley,One of the best DC live action films so far,10,6 August 2021,"1st I will say I didn't hate the 1st Suicide Squad movie. It was just ok though and would probably rate around a 5/10. The sequel was everything the 1st one should have been.James Gunn was the perfect person to get to make a good Suicide Squad movie. Also loved seeing and hearing Task Force X. From the start it got you laughing which I expected with Gunn behind it. Loved the GOTG movies so I had high hopes for this movie and it didn't disappoint. Even the lesser known characters like Ratcatcher where perfectly done. This was the best Harley Quinn we have seen on screen. King Shark was a lot of fun and also perfectly done. Bloodsport was excellent but I'm a fan of Idris Elba and on and on.The action was good and the movie didn't take much time getting into it at all. Storywise it's what you should expect with your typical comicbook type movie. Making it rated R was also necessary and glad they didn't cave. Something like Suicide Squad needs to be rated R as there will be blood and gore.I really want a sequel and hope they can get James Gunn back to do one. Will be watching it again this weekend. Overall watching this movie just expect good laughs, lots of action and a cast that really gels together making the movie that much better. Its a true popcorn flick and shouldn't be missed.",The Suicide Squad
2130,williamgibson-60943,Great fun!,8,2 August 2021,"If you are a fan of modern day R rated superhero films then this is the film for you. It has over the top cartoonish gore, fun humour and lots of exciting action sequences which all together make this a great superhero film.This film is so close to having its finger tips on a 9 or a 10 but just falls at the finish line. The only issues I have with this film is some characters which die very quick and the flashbacks (which is understandable to happen when you let James Gun off his leash). Some of the hero's who are axed quick are played by some great names and given the opportunity would add to this already exceptional film. So it is a shame we dont get to see them explored and maybe what they could of offered. With the flashbacks it just seems odd and kills the pace of the film at times, and makes you think if this film was in order it would make no difference.However those two points are small in the grand scheme of things should not take away from the entertaining film; and by god is it an improvement over the first by a mile! I would happily recommend this film to any of my friends, and everyone I went with came out of this spectacle with similar feelings.P. S King Shark is amazing.",The Suicide Squad

King shark and Polka Dot man are spectacular, totally steal the show.Well worth the view.",The Suicide Squad
2135,darence-08391,James Gunn has made superhero a genre of his own,8,10 August 2021,"""The Suicide Squad"" is hands down one of my favourite superhero movies of all time now. If you like ""Guardians"" you'll love this movie, except for me I think this movie is better in many aspects.Firstly this movie feels more grounded and relatable. This movie definitely has less green screens and CGI. Most of the scenes in this movie were shot in actual real locations and all the scenes in the movie look gorgeous! Despite all the violent and bloody action sequences, this movie actually has more emotion than you'd expect. James Gunn has the ability to turn bizarre comical characters that we've never even heard of into some real-life people that we all can relate to and therefore it makes this whole movie more realistic, grounded and emotional. You really feel for the characters in this movie although they are all villains and the chemistry between all these characters is the best part of the film. You'd feel like everyone in the squad serves a purpose, they are not just being thrown in there to make up numbers. I loved every character in the movie.The story, acting, cinematography etc are on point in this movie. I guess the only thing some people probably would feel uncomfortable about is the intense graphic content. Some people might feel a little offended by certain R-rated scenes in the movie. This movie really doesn't hold back. There's violence, nudity, dark humor, literally every R-rated thing you could think of is in this movie. You might find that a little uncomfortable but I absolutely loved it. It makes this movie so hilarious. I laughed a lot in this movie, so absolutely no problem with that.This movie is definitely worth watching on the biggest and the best movie system you could get. I'll can't wait to watch it on Blu-ray again! Support this movie :)",The Suicide Squad
2136,jhavsteenfranklin,It's not worth it unless your easily humoured and don't mind sloppy story telling,5,14 August 2021,"Pfff. I took my mother to go see this hoping it was up to par with the other marvel films in the franchise. I didn't recognize any of the characters I've come to love from the other films.

2139,majrs,Is incredible,9,8 August 2021,"I loved the movie a lot, the humor, the action scenes, I really don't know if to call it the best superhero movie but, heck, it's much, much better than the original suicide squad, it's not perfect, but it's quite enjoyable and entertaining.",The Suicide Squad

2141,hyderalw,This movie should be renamed to Suicide,2,8 August 2021,"Most successfull movies out there have a very basic story line but the supporting elements and here and there surprises plus jokes make it work; The Suicide Squad had no memorable jokes, The Shark guy was like a bad version of the hulk....just pointless and pushed on, The weasel was actually a much much better character; Harley Quinn is impossible to judge is she an antagonist or a anti hero will never know as She supports her homicidal boy friend joker but She could not stand the fact when one of the villain expressed He is going to kill people with the star fish project which makes Harley kill him; She is a big question mark but with hypocritical symptoms.The characters actually need to be good to make a movie like this work but the only one that actually knew who he is and doesn't have a identity crisis is Dead shot.Sadly the jokes were forced, The story line was mediocre, The villains were beyond boring and the sound tracks don't sync with the scenes at most times which again is not appealing at all.....if anybody wants to enjoy suicide squad please just watch the cartoon movie.",The Suicide Squad

2143,dimeset,This was a blast,9,9 August 2021,"This was probably the film that I enjoyed the most this year. It's a superhero movie that knows what it is and it's audience.It focuses on its cast of characters, their motivations and the absurdity of the DC universe and embraces it without wasting energy on identity politics or messaging.Perfect movie to unplug your brain and enjoy, some moments were hilarious and I genuinely cared about the characters by the end of the movie (which I didn't expect)",The Suicide Squad

2149,thomaswilliams-79836,Ignorant of almost 10 years of groundwork...,4,6 August 2021,"WB is interested in snagging up marvel fans. That was clear when they hired Joss(avengers) to ruin justice league and its clear now with James(guardians of the Galaxy). As a stand alone film, I would say 3-3.5 stars. It gets docked because, while I understand the need to revitalize the DCEU, they could've done it without a slap in the face to the almost 10 years tenured fans of MoS, BvS(ultimate edition) and ZSJL. This did not feel like it fit in he almost 10 year old DCEU, and in fact does very little to acknowledge it. I understand that this movie should be held in it's own light and not critiqued with the past movies in mind, but you'll have to forgive me, I've spent a very long time being dedicated to a studio that keeps ignoring the expectations they set. I simply can't watch a DCEU film without expecting to see some positive acknowledgement of the foundation they've already laid... On it's own, it's wild, adventurous and pretty fun. But it's not on its own. It's a part of something much bigger and doesn't care.",The Suicide Squad
2150,niwaeka-13031,A fun movie with friends,6,1 September 2021,"This movie will very likely give you an enjoyable enough experience especially with friends. Some characters feel very nuanced and really had interesting themes whilst others absolutely did not. The acting was good in some parts bad in others. As fun as the movie can be, there are also very long periods where not a lot is happening and it's really hard to pay attention. The narrative made sense, cinematography wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either and the characters could be annoying at times were much less annoying than the trailer might have made it seem. I feel there's always a huge rift when the movie switches from not taking itself too seriously and then a few moments later to be completely immersed in the story and cheering the characters on and that overall lessened my enjoyment of the movie.

2156,jessjess-82430,Honestly the first one was way better...,1,6 August 2021,"This film was honestly really boring for me. I didn't expect much so I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised but I was not.The characters are just rubbish and they're shoved together like some ugly decoupage expected to make a wort of art. There's scenes where there is just talking but not actually much happening and then suddenly the characters talk about their family and they're all bonded and cry over each other.The first suicide squad character arcs were much more believeable.The Enchantress wasn't the best villain but compared to the giant starfish (that was clearly just chosen because it was weird) she was amazing. There were some fight scenes but they were pretty basic and not really what I expect from ""super"" villains who get locked up in bell reeve.Harley as a character was okay...she wasn't really allowed to be her full crazy self until she got kidnapped, other than that she could have just been any old character. She's supposed to be insane but she was very tame in this film.Honestly all the other characters were pretty basic and I've seen reviews that say it shows depth to characters that aren't usually focused on but apart from a quick 2 second tale about their sad past...nothing really happens with them.My other half nearly fell asleep and I bit my nails for something to do. We honestly nearly left half way through but we had paid to see it so we stayed.Not sure how they messed this uup so badly with the cast and director. Guardians of the Galaxy was amazing and the characters in that came together nicely but in this it just feels forced and somehow boring.There seem to be some weirdly high reviews of this film but I'm honestly unsure why. Some of them seem to be copied and pasted and people are raving about James Gunn rather than the film itself. He may be a good director but as with all the DC films apart from Wonder Woman, there's just something missing.",The Suicide Squad
2157,coquifantasma,Absolutely horrible,1,6 August 2021,"The worst DC movie yet. Unnecessary things in it, no storyline. WB needs to just reboot the whole DC movies without Snyder. Gunn should be ashamed of this terrible made movie. Does not deserve even one star.",The Suicide Squad

This film does not disappoint. A must-see: I lost track of how many times we all laughed out loud.TL;DR: The funniest and most entertaining movie I've seen this year. Kudos, DCEU.",The Suicide Squad

2160,palm_first,This time James Guns has knocked it out,9,7 August 2021,"It succeed my expectation. James Guns absolutely kills it. It's a bloody, chaotic ride from the start. The story in this feels a lot more like the suicide squad, lot of casualties, death body counts and some brutal violence action scene. Now yes this is James Guns movie so the tone will be Guardians of The Galaxy style. The tone looks beautiful, full of great visuals and it feels fresh for an adult.Now there is 11 members in the squad James Guns knows how to balanced each character to take in the action. There is also some great character arc moments that are unforgettable. Speaking of it, let's don't forget Margot Robbie spotlight as Harley Quinn. She a lot funnier, unpredictable and takes the action very wellNow there is some weak point in this which is the villain. Now I didn't find it to be interesting but the more I watched it I did find it to be more interesting. For me I liked Amanda Waller as the villain a lot. She controls Task-Force X to do what she says now that looks evil. Ok there's not much to complain about this film.It's a win for James Guns. A chaotic hell of a ride, with some bloody violence action scene. There's no doubt at all this is one of the best DC extended universe film.Verdict: 9.2/10.",The Suicide Squad

He's been anti American for a while. And why they chose to bring back viola davis, I have no idea. She was terrible in the first one, and she was terrible in this one. Which on that same note, the only two black women with screen time, they chose to make loud and obnoxious. Really?. Obviously it was great visually. And the only notable actor was idris Elba. I thought he did a fantastic job. I wish marvel (or any other big name) would have picked him up so he could have been in a memorable movie. I literally just finished it and I've already forgotten what it was about. I thought it would be hard to be as bad as the first suicide squad. I was wrong.

While it's not worse than ww84, it certainly tried to be. An utterly ridiculous story, my nine year old is more imaginative, coupled with characters who couldn't be less interesting, resulted in a disjointed and absolutely senseless story. DCs thinks that just blowing things up and dismemberment will help keep your attention and hope you forget that there should be an honest attempt at theatrics or character development. This movie has plenty of action and NOTHING else. Even if I were 13 years old I would have seen through the movies obvious flaws, I nearly turned it off several times while watching it!

Really fresh and entertaining with great and weird characters, great performances, great comedy, and really good action set pieces. James Gunn is completely unhinged, and you can definietely see that here. He takes this bonkers plot and characters and uses it as an advantage for his impeccable sense of humor, but he also uses it for some genuinely heartfelt moments. The actors have really great chemistry with one another. The banter between Bloodsport and Peacemaker on who is cooler was really hilarious. The film is very self aware, it doesn't take its plot seriously, but what it does take seriously, are its characters. You care about this team, you want them to accomplish this mission, and that is very important. This is my kind of superhero film. My only issue is that some of the jokes don't land, but that's kind of it, only one minor flaw that didn't take away any enjoyment I was having while watching the film. This is an extremely entertaining film that has explosive violent action, well written characters and heartfelt moments. And no, I'm not gonna compare it to the first one, unless and until they release the Ayer Cut.I still think Guardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 1) is a bit better.Oh, and also, Sylvester Stallone is fricking awesome as King Shark.",The Suicide Squad

How is that even possible do you think before you talk at best this mediocre OK movie is not even top 50 of ALL TIME and that is just me being generous, on its own it's a solid movie according to today's standards and today's standards is pretty low, but it's still OK it reminds most people of the 80s generic action movies, no depth just explosions and superb CG.Now when you start comparing it to other movies, superhero movies precisely it might even fall short of the 100th bracket, it wanted to be a spiritual successor, reboot/remake/rebrand/reimagining, but I don't think it delivered,if it wanted to be a sequel then why kill important, vital characters like Rick Flag & Captain Boomerang the fans actually cared for those characters and wanted to see more, who the f- wants to see the peacemaker? No-one(a handful of questionable people) that's who,if it said it wanted to be a reboot/remake, any of the ""re's"" then the reboot did not reboot s!!! It's still the same, only the name change to include ""the"" and that's pretty much it, then if it was a rebounding then you succeeded by make a doctor dumb, she's freaking Harley freaking Quinn not an OP Mary sue(I actually wanted to see Rick Flag's plan, but if it took the whole team to execute that plan and only Harley was able to achieve it, and her was the one to take down Starro even Justice League could not take him down so easily(didn't they fire bullets at Starro's eyes, and it did not but when she did it with a javelin it worked, wow)), any who HQ was a Psychiatrist.What messed me up was the execution of the characters dying, it was just MK level gore, and the deaths was just played for laughs, example the freedom fighters' death, and they just laughed it off like nothing happened, no morality.P.s. Amanda Waller is not forgiving, she was better portrayed in her coldheartedness in the previous movie.In the end it was a fun movie, one of the few movies in which I finished my snacks before the movie ended, so I guess not groundbreaking in any way just like the rest of the last 25 movie so yeah.",The Suicide Squad

However I was blown away by its unique style and creative humour.I should have known that it would be amazing since it was coming from James Gunn. The idea of making a cast only for them to all be brutality murdered in the first ten minutes was shocking and hilarious.The main cast is a bunch of very different actors that you would never put together and you would never think it would ( kind of like the characters huh) but Gunn managed to pull it off.It was not cinematic gold but all together it was a funny movie with a plot that is easy to follow.,The Suicide Squad

You can subscribe for free hereGuardians of the Galaxy's James Gunn, who has written and directed The Suicide Squad, has injected the film with his particular brand of zip and energy. The DC Extended Universe's tenth film is violent and funny in equal measure. After superhero films became these brobdingnagian money spinners that everyone worshipped, the time was ripe to take them down a couple of pegs. There have been films and shows with an irreverent take on the meta-humans who walk among us. Gunn riffs off that sentiment with The Suicide Squad, which he has rightly described as ""its own thing"".A coup in the small South American island nation of Corto Maltese results in Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) sending two Task Force X teams (that is Suicide Squad's proper name). Team A led by Rick Flag, (Joel Kinnaman) is betrayed and all members except for Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) are killed in a variety of gory, grotesque ways. Flag is captured by rebel soldiers. While all manner of mayhem is happening to Team A, Team B led by Bloodsport (Idris Elba), is able to sneak into the island.",The Suicide Squad

Every character gets enough development so we can relate in a sense with them, but also moves constantly forward in the main storyline so it doesn't stop just to explain something, like when we hear the story of ratcatcher, they are in the bus, what else would they do but talk?, the story continues to move forward while developing every character.",The Suicide Squad

It was dare I say, as perfect as it could have been made given the choices they made.I could have done with perhaps another villain, I hated the Enchantress from the previous film. I like a more grounded suicide squad story to be told and for the villain to be more grounded like The Joker or Death-stroke or even Lex Luther. Nevertheless that's my only grip with the movie.

2218,th_snc,A serious downgrade for all the characters and in comparison to the previous movie.,4,22 September 2021,"I'm not a fan of Gunn, but I was excited about this movie, considering the trailers.I guess the best thing I can say about this movie is that it lives up to its name. But is it ""a movie that saved DC""? No f-ing way. Quite the opposite.The movie barely made me laugh (but maybe its just not in my taste) because its jokes are mostly juvenile and predictable.I can handle gore, I'm ok with violence, but this? These elements were used here merely for the sadistic satisfaction of the director.I get that, in a suicide squad, characters are supposed to die, but so many talents were wasted here. Some even within the first 10 minutes of movie. Fan favorites were killed for no reason whatsoever, felt really disrespectful both to the actors and characters.Yet, its curious that others were truly protected by ""plot armor"".Quite often - specially in the first half of the movie - it felt like a B movie (you know, like on a budget). The cinematography, framing, etc often felt cheap.For a guy that gets praised over his use/choice of soundtrack for his movies, Gunn really made a subpar OST for this one.The CGI was quite subpar - often felt like a mash up between live action and pixar stuff - never really feeling like they belonged in the same world - which didnt make those moments feel REAL at all.Amanda Waller was probably the biggest downgrade of them all. Being overpowered by a random girl while also giving the spotlight to a bunch of randos to dictate the control over the squad? LOL PLEASE. Surprised Viola Davis agreed to return to this piece of shit of a take on the character.Bad use of an iconic DC Villain (not a threat at all, for a character that has overpowered the justice league in several occasions)Still, the plot is fine, at best. The writing is poor.. I'm far from a prude person, but I really felt annoyed by the constant obsession with awkward dialogues about genitals...... and kids (but being a James Gunn movie, that's to be expected - if you know what I mean)Other than that, if you are not convinced of the problems with this movie and it's take to show that this isnt a movie to save DC, here are a few final elements:
Bloodsport was clearly a badly rewritten replacement for Will Smith's Deadshot. Even reused the same narrative trope for his character.good guys get screwed, some bad guys get a pass for all the atrocities they pulled off. Way to set an example, huh?stereotypical depict of latinos and indiscriminated killing of the sameanimal cruelty (unnecessary, just for the sake of it)If you thoroughly enjoyed this movie, you probably got some issues.",The Suicide Squad

Wtf was that part with Harley and the President? It was a giant waste of time. Honestly the plot didn't matter, because the few good things of the movie were bigger points like bloodsport having some good left in him. But for the plot to not matter there needs to be more from the characters but most were killed before we could actually learn enough about them. The handful of jokes that landed were very funny.

No script, mostly mediocre acting, the jokes were not funny at all and the whole gory part was over used unnecessarily.I didn't think that I'd say this, but even the butchered by WB, 2016 SS is way better than this mess of a movie.

Margot Robbie doesn't get to play the Harley Quinn she is very able to play (as she has shown quite fine in the other movies, e.g. Birds of Prey). The black humor and the deep moments from the first Suicide Squad movie are missing. And of top of everything, it's really bloody.Ha, of course it is - the title might give a hint as of that. But all the close shots of innards and ripped-apart bodies and smashed what-nots - it kinda took the fun out of the movie for me. I'm not particular squeamish and I like Vikings as well as GoT.

And just cause he does one right thing, we are supposed to believe his daughter seems to have forgiven him for everything and is now proud of him. Characters are villains who do somethings right and continue to do somethings bad. Blood and gore excessively for no reason. Male frontal and female nudity for no reason. Jokes not funny to me personally. Even though some jokes in Deadpool made me laugh. Every character is a little crazy and off. Not for kids it has many adult topics in it. Surprised some people brought kids to theater to watch. Needless and pointless deaths for no reason, is frustrating to me.

But the timing and delivery was way off, the plot felt rushed and poorly thought out, and why does James Gunn hate birds so much? Arbitrary violence and gore looked childish, like a teenager's first time using special effects. I mean, a huge starfish thing? Really?? Viola Davis' character makes me sad... She's a FABULOUS actress, but in both the first SS and this one she just comes off as bored.

2282,George_Hassard,James Gunn's Prized Possession,8,6 August 2021,"This movie is a lot to process.An extremely fun time. I interpreted it as a Love Letter for DC Comic Book fans, This movie is nothing like any other Superhero film. It felt like a 2-hour long comic book made into live-action.The movie was surprisingly not as comedic as expected. But when it does try to be funny. It does it well.James Gunn did something that I have never seen a filmmaker be able to achieve, his ability to transition from emotions so quickly. You go from Feeling Disgusted, Then Laughing, Then Heartbroken, Then Happy all within 5 minutes, and it completely works. I have to admit, There was a scene that made me tear up towards the end and not because it was sad, It just hit a lot of strings and I think it will for a lot of people.I have to give credit to Warner Bros. They have the best CGI and Special Effects in the Industry. There were shots with King Shark that I could look at and actually think They could be real.There was not a single actor in this movie I thought didn't put on an Amazing performance,The actress for Rat Catcher 2: Daniela Melchior, Was easily my favorite character and Actress in the film, This was her first big role in a movie and I Guarantee her phone will be ringing from a lot of Studios after her amazing performance in this,The huge set pieces that they created for this movie astonished me. This movie has a lot of love and soul put into it.Also, John Murphy's Score was Incredible.However, I do have a few complaints,
Stop using Harley Quinn for Sex Appeal! There was a scene in this movie. That I could not stop thinking to myself. This completely Contradicted Everything Birds Of Prey set up! It was painful to watch and not in a good way. It was very poor taste.I have no issue with violence and gore in movies. But This was Ridiculous. Every character's death has to have been The most Violent and painful to watch death you have ever seen. It just was plain annoying. I have to say, This was the Most Violent Movie I have ever seen and it gets to a point where it just got unwatchable.Altogether this would be a very fun movie to see with a group of friends.

Dragging out every scene like it's a GCSE art project isn't entertaining. Filling your cliches with cliches is something people on day 1 of film writing school do. Putting as many characters as you can into every scene so everyone gets completely lost and you don't care about anyone or what's happening is exactly what was wrong with all the Transformers movies.James Gunn, the writer and director, needs to grow up. He's meant to be an adult man. Why would an adult man think anyone is entertained by gratuitous blood, violence, gore and completely unecessary nudity? Tropic Thunder parodied this kind of movie (using Jack Black as the actor who only stars in movies filled with fart jokes). People who loved this film would also have loved the first Deadpool movie for all the same reasons.Wonder Woman 1984 was terrible. Batman Vs Superman was terrible. Justice League (whichever version) was terrible. This was actually worse.As for the scene where the shark thing stomps around in an aquarium (Which for some reason is inside an alien research lab) and makes friends with some fish - my IQ actually fell out of my head.It's put me off going to the cinema ever again.

The characters in the film are so goddamn Great. My favourites being King Shark - a man eating beast who was such an adorable character.Peacemaker - I love John Cena
Ratcatcher 2 - I was pleasantly surprised by her character
Polka Dot Man - IMO the best character of the film.The Gore in the film is amazingly horrifying, thank god James Gunn made it a priority for the film to be a 15/R because the film was bloody, gruesome and just fun. The shot of King Shark ripping a poor soul into half looked absolutely phenomenal. There were some other scenes which also looked great but were horrifying to look at like some of the people who had been experimented on at Jotunheim.The humour was a mix bag for me as it really was a case of it being a hit or miss. The hit being the banter between the team was great mainly because they had good chemistry with each other. Though some of the jokes were quite awkward and some really took away from a scenes poignancy - can't add much to that without getting majorly spoilery so I'll leave it there.It wouldn't be a James Gunn film without a banging soundtrack - Johnny cash is 🔥.I can't wait for the Peacemaker series because the film left me wanting to see how they go from here.8/10.",The Suicide Squad

Yes, MoS, BvS and SS included (Josstice League is not). I can truly say there has yet to be an experience quite like this in the DC universe.A movie that is so bombastically violent and brutal, yet hilarious and demented in all the right ways, complete with moments of heart and even in-group betrayal, and yes, THIS IS HOW SUICIDE SQUAD SHOULD LOOK AND FEELYes I say this having enjoyed the 2016 SS, yes I say this wanting to see the Ayer cut. But facts are facts, we have two live-action SS movies at our disposal at this moment, and this is authentic SSThat isn't to say I had my faults with the flick. I hate how they made King Shark a cute idiot for instance.

The story arc & character depth is just impressive!,9,16 August 2021,"First off the amount of story, character depth when you have so many characters is nearly impossible to do in a SINGLE movie yet it does. While for many, including myself there's alot of very small details that are easily missed due to all the great cinematography. So to really understand how amazing it is you may have to watch it multiple times in order to appreciate just how great this movie is. Well I'm not a person who likes metaphors in movies this has a very straightforward concept of setting the tone early on that everyone is expendable which is why they are called The suicide Squad to begin with.If after watching the opening scene you immediately assume after that nearly everyone is most likely going to die by the credits that is the way it was intended.

2321,nocranetech,Not so good...,4,9 August 2021,So I'm glad it was free to watch on HBO Max...I would have been disappointed if I spent extra money to see this at the theater.It was ok as far as action and so so for the acting.The story line was trash.The Giant monster was something off of SpongeBob Square Pants...It was really begging to be a good (at best) movie but this is my opinion of a b rate movie.Sharknado was a better production.Harlequin was great as usual though.Just my point of view...,The Suicide Squad

The humor was not executed well, the action was good, the main villain was cartoonish and the plot was unbelievably dumb. It seems like the script was written by a fifth grader who is the class clown of the school. Just bad! Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, and Daniela Melchior were the only good actors in the movie and it was only so much they can do with this ""cringe worthy"" script. The bond between Idris Elba's Bloodsport and Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 was the best part of the movie, and Margot Robbie was the only person that was funny. John Cena was just bad, he is a really poor actor, I'm not sure why he is getting so many roles, he should just stick to wrestling. Viola Davis who is usually a great actress was too over the top in this movie. I can see the effort made to make this movie fun, colorful, and outrageous, but it fails miserably. It appears a lot of people like this though, as for me, flush this one down the toilet, because it stinks.",The Suicide Squad

If you want to enjoy this movie you have to have a sense of humor and you can't take it so seriously. The fight scenes were so good and the Peacemaker/Bloodsport duo was very fun to watch. Starro could've been so much cooler, the ending sucked and they killed a few people I wish they wouldn't have which is why its not a 10 in my eyes. When they killed next to all of Team 1 in the first 10 minutes that was stupid tbh. A few of my favorite parts of the movie were when the squad killed all of those guys that ended up being on their side and Peacemaker/Bloodshot were making a competition out of it and when Rick Flag got killed and they showed his heart getting punctured on the inside that was awesome. DC is moving in the right direction the past couple years excluding Birds of Prey which was god awful. I'd rate this an 8.5/9 but I'm rating it at a 10 because of the marvel fanboys who didn't even watch it and rated it a 1.",The Suicide Squad

BUT this movie was AMAZING, I especially enjoyed the James Gunn's direction and I would go as far as say this is his best work. Also I was amazed by Idris Elba's acting and of course Margot Robbie was once more phenomenal. Lastly, the CGI were very good quality, the characters well developed and well played and the costumes were much better than the previous movie. Overall it's a great adventure / action/ super hero movie and you will certainly enjoy it provided violent and splatter scenes are your cup of tea.",The Suicide Squad
2335,reece-94761,The right way forward,10,1 August 2021,Wow I went cinema on the 30th with my partner and mother and friends.The movie was insanely crazy and amazing with a high budget amazing plots and especially the characters delivering characters that stood out beside Harley and king shark was Peacemaker was surprisingly one of my favourites and Ratcatcher.This is definitely one of the best Dc movies in recent years and should definitely be the way forward.The only negative I would give was that a part of the characters which was shown amazing just wasn't given enough time to shine as much as we would have enjoyed.Go and watch this movie you won't be disappointed.,The Suicide Squad
2336,fitzgeraldryan-70413,AN UNEXPECTED TWIST ON THE SUPERHERO GENRE,9,6 August 2021,"This film will be seen as a pivotal turn in the superhero genre for years to come. After nearly 3 hours of digesting I am still processing just how chaotic this film was. It's not perfect, I'll say that. A perfect comic book film is hard to achieve. A perfect film of any genre is nearly impossible to achieve, which is why we only get one once every decade that becomes a house hold name, but that doesn't mean I don't think this film has the potential to become one.From the jump James Gunn waits no time getting into the thick of it. The opening introduction and beach shoot out are like the first drop of a roller coaster, start off big to get the riders heart racing and grab their full attention for the ride ahead. The rest of the story is non linear, which I love, so building up a pivotal ending to a scene only to then jump back in time and include outside stories that brought the characters to this disastrous fight scene or possible final moments, when done right, is brilliant. Very few people can do this correctly, Quentin Tarantino being one of if not the best at it. Not only was the way James Gunn leaves you at the edge of your seat for 5-15ish minutes, only to scale the full weight of what's about to happen, well done, but it hasn't really been seen in super hero films as much as it is here. Non linear story telling is very much lost in this genre, for the right reasons, but in comic books it's done very so often. The film is also, if you haven't read already, pretty graphic for a comic book film, not Deadpool graphic, like Amazon Primes 'The Boys' graphic, but with a better budget for more realistic blood and gore. It also shows the egotistical dim witted side of super heroes/villains that you don't really see in these films. Some of these characters have pretty deep storylines that although aren't finished are shown very gracefully and only a few times seemed a bit eccentric, one character in particular, but that never took me out of the film. Like I said this film isn't perfect, but the things James Gunn was attempting to do differently here he knocked out of the park. These characters were brilliantly played and told, but don't get too attached to them.",The Suicide Squad

It's too bad if you don't like jokes in the movie, nothing can help. However, with the latter, extreme violence in this movie effectively built up the images and mood of its theme - villains with low moral standard. This was not supposed to be a PG-13 superhero film. Violence did add unpleasant feelings, which made movie more complexed. Despite quite long running time, Gunn successfully made his B-film ideas into ""enjoyable Hollywood action movie with quailities"" as he'd done with his previous marvel series, while delivering vivid and dynamic sceneries.

Although, if James Gunn can find a goofy team of space protectors comprised of a talking raccoon, a tree, a female jolly green giant, gray hulk, and a man still living in the 80s-yet somehow make it one of the best and most enjoyable superhero movie franchises to date-there's no surprise that he made this group of outcasts into DC's best work since Joker.

I've watched this masterpiece from James Gunn 3 times in cinema's now and I'm planning on going again soon!The way the characters interact with one another is priceless with the stand out being Ratcatcher 2. From being a basically unknown character in the DC universe James Gunn has made you care as much about her as the returning cast. She provides a great comedic relief and feels like the glue that hold the main squad together.The plot is great and the pacing of the movie is amazingly quick, keeping you engaged and entertained throughout the movie with the new twists, turns and phenomenal action sequences!A notable scene is the extraction of Rick Flag. The competition between Bloodsport and Peacemaker is hilarious plus the many jokes such as ""I don't like to kill people but if I pretend they're my mum it's easy"" from Polka-Dot Man.

The pure unadulterated action spectacle of it all was something to behold, peering into the eye of a madman. Literally the eye in one case (you know the scene if you've seen the film!). How James Gunn can take the aggressive and the grotesque and turn it into something beautiful is nothing short of genius. Not only that, but in the world's greatest mulligan this Suicide Squad takes all the things that worked about the first film and runs with them while fixing all the mistakes. Amanda Waller is still here, and she kicks things off with no BS telling us this is Task Force X, this is the mission, and here we go. Within minutes we're on our way and into the film and into the action. And what action it is! Absurd action too, Polka dots slicing people to bits and a King Shark chomping a guy down in just a few bites? Excellent. That's not to say the film doesn't have a heart though, it does when it needs to. Bloodsport has a surprisingly genuine relationship with his daughter. It's not a happy relationship, but it's real, and it's the relationship this character would have. Similarly, Ratcatcher is a highly sympathetic character with a tragic origin and probably the most likable of the squad. All this combined makes The Suicide Squad one of the best films of the year, and one of the most purely enjoyable superhero films I've seen in a very long time.",The Suicide Squad

2369,writetoxanderl,uhhhhhhhh...........,5,6 August 2021,"I don't even know what to say, definitely one of james gunns worse movies yet it really feels like he's sold out with this one with constant forced comedy that usually falls flat, king sharks even being in this movie was a giant mistake and feels like groot from gunns other movie guardians of the galaxy or like patrick in spongebob, by huge surprise john cena was one of the better actors in this movie but him turning against the group feels forced and odd from the character they were making peacemaker, idris alba had a mediocre performance with good cgi being what his character relies on constantly bloodshot has the same storyline as will smiths deadshot in the previous suicide squad film and makes this new one feel more like a remake then it's own movie
margot robbie as always playing harley quinn amazingly felt like james funn didn't know how to write her and he just gave her only jokes as her whole role, except for her action scene which was amazing other then the cgi to dumb down his r rating, rat catcher two was a ok character filled with all the drama this movie has as in she's the only one who knows feeling at all while all the rest of the cast are stupid comedy 90 % of the movie,
while watching this movie i don't think i can say i've seen a more predictable awful opening that not one person didn't see coming but it felt like the scene in deadpool 2 when they kill x force or like the hunt, but it's also a scene put in so gunn could make a movie where nobody dies till the last 20 minutes and still say they killed a bunch of people, it wasn't a heart felt scene because they're characters we've never met before except one and they're deaths are forced in and all feel like a waste of time a lot like the rest of this movie
i don't think i could say with a straight face this movie was any better then ok while it feels like a little kid movie that kids can't watch i feel like every joke is something i'd watch on teen titans go or uncle grandpa
starro ""the conqueror"" looks spectacular and is amazing on paper but when you turn his story into cheetahs story from ww84 and pull the not actually evil villain card it feels so generic and i would've given gunn that maybe if they had him kill more then 2 people the entire movie or was in more then 4 scenes but it's not
polka dot man was performed great had a weird story completely different from the comics and his mom was funny but weird felt unneeded but had some really funny scenes, if something is missing from this review you expected to see either it wasn't in the movie or was barely in the movie.",The Suicide Squad

Not really a huge fan of Gunn to start as I always felt the first Gaurdians is his only decent movie. I won't go into too much detail for spoilers. But generally, the flaws were definitely in the directing and writing. Some really talented actors were wasted here by Gunn's overall bad cinematography and lackluster writing. Most of the jokes fell flat and some were just plain creepy s.i.c (Harley Quinn)... The villain(s), plot, and subplot were all incredibly boring and forgettable. About the only good thing in the film is the chemistry between some of the actors.(notably Idris Elba and John Cena). I had quite a few laughs but on the whole it wasn't enough to justify this an enjoyable experience. If this movie is better than Suicide Squad, it's only just so.

2385,tomaspsalves,Best DC movie since the Nolan trilogy.,8,7 August 2021,"Let's all adress the elephant in the room. The first Suicide Squad was absolute garbage.James Gunn took the worst DC movie and transformed it into arguably one of the best.The characters are all memorable and funny, they all have excelent chemistry. The acting is pretty good and the writing is actually impressive. Even the throwaway characters were funny.Ratcatcher was a pivotal part of the plot and I personally enjoyed her very much, due to the fact that I live in Portugal, in the same city where she came from. It's nice to see my ""small"" country in Hollywood. Speaking of that, Daniela Melchior steals every scene she's in, whether it's with Idris Elba or John Cena. Way to go girl! Hope she makes it big on the other side of the Atlantic.This is a brutal but great movie, with thrilling action sequences and a straight forward plot that doesn't put you to sleep. I enjoyed this movie very much, more than I expected really, so I give it a 8 out of 10.",The Suicide Squad
2386,noahj-39969,Awesome thrill ride of action and emotion,9,8 August 2021,This film is amazing the best DC film besides the Snyder Cut James Gunn really went all out and it paid off.In the first 30 minutes the tone is set as there are some comedy aspects that really work but then takes a dark turn of brutal kills unlike any other superhero film. Literally all of the characters in the first team die except Harley and Flag which really establishes that no one is safe. This is heat shown by Boomerang's death as he was one of the main characters in the last film and he's on screen for around 10 minutes before dying brutally. But after the scene where Bloodsport and Peacemaker destroy the soldiers and the resistance base the pacing of the movie falls off and gets really slow compared to the previous scenes. But this is made up for by funny moments from the entire cast. Every shines in this movie and even the throw away characters get at least one good moment. The final battle is truly the best part of the film with intense action and high stakes that villain Starro creates. They takeover of the city showed how powerful Starro is and the solution on how to kill it really is satisfying. Using the rats really paid of the characters arc and was a good ending to the film.The post credits scenes were one of the best parts of the film. The comedic one being the reveal of weasel surviving and not actually drowning was really good and harmless as it didn't really change anything. But after all the credits it was revealed that Peacmaker survived his wound which really made me happy as he was one of my favorite characters and now I absolutely can't wait for his show coming in Janut.,The Suicide Squad

A fairly simple and straightforward story, easy to enjoy and have fun watching, with some nice twists along the way, however much of the plot was facilitated by, what it felt to me, by several unnatural decisions/actions from the characters, for the sake to have the plot move along or to offer some explanation. The way Amanda Waller was portrayed felt insulting to the character.",The Suicide Squad

The cast of characters (especially Margot Robbie and John Cena) fits perfectly with the attitude of the movie. The fact that the movie took obscure characters and made them loveable human beings truly shows the genius of the writers and directors. This is exactly what a Suicide Squad movie should be, a hilarious R-rated movie with characters never seen before on screen. I 100% believe it's the best ""DCEU"" movie made to date, even though I'm not a fan of the DCEU. I could not stop laughing while watching this, and the gore included really added to the quality of the film. Definitely recommend, but not for the feint of heart.",The Suicide Squad

2400,BigBlueBackpack,"Big, Dumb Fun and a Step Forward for the DC Universe",8,19 October 2021,"Beginning with 2013's Man of Steel, DC comics has rushed to desperately cobble together a cinematic universe to compete with Marvel's, resulting in a string of mediocre to terrible releases. The worst of those was easily 2016's Suicide Squad, a movie that seemed to do nothing right.But more recently, DC has begun to figure out how to click with audiences with modest hits like Shazam and Aquaman. And it looks like 2021's The Suicide Squad (despite its status as a sequel, its confusing title, and its release of HBO Max) followed in their footsteps. The result is easily the best DC Universe movie so far.Director James Gunn gets a ton of credit for picking through everything that didn't work about the previous Suicide Squad movie, while pulling what does work from comics and animated Suicide Squad movies (Assault on Arkham and Hell To Pay). This movie is less of a gritty, angsty thriller, instead leaning hard into offbeat humor and cartoonish, gratuitous violence. It's a decision that pays huge dividends; I never thought I'd laugh so hard, so many times, at gruesome dismemberment.The movie has the same premise as the previous film: a group of captured supervillains undertake a super-secret mission for the government in exchange for time off their sentences. It's a setup that's rife with opportunity for clashes between big personalities, a promise that the movie delivers on in spades.Gunn sheds almost the entire cast of the first film to create an entirely new team of supervillains forced to do the government's dirty work. The only returning faces are Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, the breakout character of this universe, as well as Rick Flagg and Amanda Waller, who serve as the straight men to the wacky ensemble.In the lead role, Idris Elba's Bloodsport replaces Will Smith's Deadshot, and the movie is infinitely better for it. The linchpin of the movie is exploring how, even as a contract killer, Bloodsport is still capable of empathy. Elba perfectly rides the line between scumbag and nice guy. Through his foil, John Cena's Peacemaker, we see a nearly identical character (""He does everything I do!"") but without a conscience to guide him.Alongside them, the movie digs deep for the most obscure, most ridiculous DC characters possible. Rounding out the roster is Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher II, and King Shark (the bipedal talking shark voiced by Sylvester Stallone). There's even a nod to Arm-Fall-Off Boy, easily the silliest comic character ever made. Dropping these characters into an R-rated live-action setting heightens the absurdity and humor even further. But in addition to that, every single notable character has a fully fleshed out personality and character arc (well, except King Shark). Against all odds, the script makes you care about these C-list characters, more than I ever cared about Batman in the newest Justice League.Gone are the muted colors and nighttime scenes of Zack Snyder's DC. This is one of the most colorful and vibrant blockbusters in recent memory. Here, superpowered people gore soldiers on sunny beaches with confetti and polka dots. It's a refreshing change of pace, and I wish more movies would try it.It's easy to criticize this movie as dumb, gratuitous, and/or pure spectacle. Those criticisms wouldn't be unfounded - this won't be winning Best Picture at the Oscars anytime soon. But I would never accuse James Gunn and the other who made this movie of being careless or unthoughtful. They picked out what was good and what wasn't out of previous DC movies with surgical precision. And with that, Gunn injected the script with his trademark goofy tone that feels right at home alongside his other films like Guardians of the Galaxy. This might be a movie that features multiple gunshots to the groin, but every choice it makes is intentional, helping to steer the DCEU in a bold new direction.",The Suicide Squad

Action scenes and pacing are great. Gore is top notch. Oh my God the gore. It is fricking amazing. Finally not a pg-13 movie. Cinematography is great. Everything in this movie is awesome. Viola Davis is once again amazing as Amanda Waller, even better in this one than in previous one. Margot Robbie is once again brilliant as Harley Quinn. I would like to also give props to Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher. She is amazing. She felt like a huge huge kind soul of the movie. Idris Elba as Bloodsport as well. This movie works far better than the last. You root for them. You constantly feeling range of emotions through this movie where the last one fail to do so.This is what you get when you hire right director and writers for the job.Alongside with the Zack Snyder's Justice League it is one of the BEST DC movies so far.Now i only hope that in the future we get more of movies like this.",The Suicide Squad

He was having much freedom in this one as it's rated R unlike Marvel's guardians of the galaxy and I would say he could have done much better.....Climax was also too weak for me......

It had much broader appeal than this installment.I'd say, if you think it might be something you'd enjoy or you gave any hesitation, check it out on HBO. Laying out $25 to see this in a theater is likely not going to turn out well for someone just checking it out because they like Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, etc.If you are a fan of the comic, odds are you'll absolutely love it.

2438,abrinab-62207,"Gruesome, Irreverent and witty throughout",9,7 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad is a non-stop joyride from start to finish. It was unpredictable and certainly delivered on the endeavour to raise the stakes of the genre, shamelessly killing off a plethora of characters in true James Gunn fashion. The film expertly switches between various tones to create a truly cohesive and full story, juggling heartfelt character moments and thrilling action, graphic violence and intelligent humour with ease and tact, overall producing a special experience for DC fans old and new and truly setting itself apart from the vast roster of copy and paste superhero movies. The cast of the film is vast in number with every member as talented and enjoyable to watch as the last. Notable standouts for me were Peter Capaldi as the joyously evil mastermind, ""The Thinker"" and of course, Sylvester Stallone as the voice of the simple, lovable, yet feral beast, ""King Shark."" As well as this, the returning cast from the 2016 Suicide Squad felt new and invigorated with Gunn's writing style, yet still retained some connective tissue to past films. This allowed the film to build upon pre-existing lore, enriching the wider DCEU as a whole, whilst simultaneously providing a purely unique and self contained story for the audience to become completely immersed in, without worry of how things tie into other projects. One final thing i feel i must comment on is the design of the film. From each character's attire seemingly ripped directly from the pages of DC comics, to the unapologetically colourful and outlandish ""Starro the Conqueror,"" The Suicide Squad felt like a love letter to DC nerds everywhere, willing to engulf its main cast in the wacky regalia of their comic counterparts, where many other films of the genre would typically shy away in favour of tactical jumpsuits and modernised armour. As a big DC fan myself, i found a lot to enjoy in this film and hope to see more comic adapted properties daring to be as bold as this one. In simpler terms, I loved every second of The Suicide Squad and can't wait to see it again.",The Suicide Squad

Rat-catcher 2, King Shark and Bloodsport and Peacemaker's rivalry were the highlights of the film alongside Margot's phenomenal role as Harley as usual. Lack of studio interference and Gunn's personal taste can be seen and finally appreciated all over the film, its over the place comedy, sincerity to the source material and bolder changes help you get a good few laughs.The Bad: The plot isn't as strong as its cast or the acting of the superb selection of characters in the movie and in many ways the movie is similar to its predecessor. It is not the best movie present in the DCEU but it is definitely a great film.",The Suicide Squad

Here's my critique of (spoiler free) Suicide Squad by JamesGunnWhile I was rooting for it to be good, it was overall lackluster. Disappointed in a lot of the directions taken and the try hard hard comdey. The second half saved it from being a complete bomb. The story was terribly incoherent. I had a hard time connecting with the characters. The characters I did connect with were from the previous film. The foundation David Ayer laid in ""his"" rendition saved the second act of this film because of the characters. I hope this isnt a sign of the future from WB for what's to come for the DC live action ""multiverse."" There were a few things I did really enioy, specifically a certain Harley solo fight, but not enough to give it a thumbs up. This film was JUST OK.

But as a stand-alone movie for the average viewer, it is very hard to sit through. Early jokes are ok and you quickly dismiss them, then the whole thing carries on in the same manner. Eventually it becomes a tedious exercise in dumbing yourself down. I wish more reviews were honest in this way. Just review it as it is without adding hype. Anyways, skip it.",The Suicide Squad
2484,mpetronace,"Definitely better than the first, but still kind of formulaic",8,5 August 2021,"First of all, this movie is a wild ride. The action is great, absurd, gory in all the right ways. You really feel like you are in this world of súper-heroes (with all its advanced technology, science, alien characteristics) The humour is mostly great the actors give compelling perfomances. The visuals are nothing short of amazing
However, I was quite disappointed with how the plot turned out. It felt kind of like seeing Guardians of the Galaxy again (as in group of outcasts join forces to ""save the world"") instead of an actual group of criminals like the Suicide Squad truly is. There should not be camaderie or let's refer to it as ""inherent goodness"" in them. They should be people who only want to reduce their sentences and are willing to doubleback their teammates (NOT their friends)
Plus, for a movie with the tagline ""Don't get too attached"", all the characters I got somewhat attached to lived. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the movie?Anyway, it sure is better than the first one and, with an unique style, I thing it will be fondly remembered.",The Suicide Squad

King shark was built up as a cross between the hulk and Drax but dropped very short of being funny. Harley Quinn felt misused and treated as a side show, a great actress and character but jumped from javelin to Rick flag to one of the big bads. She fell back into the old ""lady needs a man "" trope which was extremely disappointing after her stand out performance in the first film and the character building in birds of prey. She could have been missing from the film completely and no one would have noticed. On that topic, random busty secretary character was an odd addition to the film. Idris Elba is a great replacement for Will Smith as the criminal team leader and the peacemaker suprised as a good character with the most humorous lines and scenes. Suprised by some deaths of main characters and Rick Flag very poorly used and sidelined. More suitable storyline than the first, but not a major improvement as promised.",The Suicide Squad

The musical score is a perfect fit, as expected from Gunn with his track record with Guardians of the Galaxy.As the title states, the R rating isn't just for show. There's gore, and lots of it, though not always for the sake of it - it's woven into dark comedic action-packed scenes where your mouth will alternate between ""haha"" and ""ohhh (painful)"". Definitely worth watching with no kids about.The non-perfect score, from me at least, is because you do kind of need to watch the other DC movies with Harley Quinn (eg Birds of Prey) to get the most of her character. Her antics and almost overshadow the other members of the team which is already made up of strong characters in their own right.",The Suicide Squad

The closest ive ever come to laugh at this movie was a slight gust of air through my nose that made little to no sound at all.. the acting for me was cringey at some point especially towards the end. The jokes was meh... The most annoying thing was trying to make that shark guy as drax in GOTG. For me this is the biggest reason this movie doesnt click for my taste.. i thought i liked the drax character style in any other movie.. not this one tho.. drax was stupid i get it. But that shark guy.. was expressionless. When drax does it, it is charming, then this guy doing it just seems like the director just need some sort of cheap cute(not cute tho) looking thingy who tries to be funny with a personality of drax made is china.",The Suicide Squad

2501,zgrtnqwxk,How is this worse than Studio Squad (2016)?!,6,6 August 2021,This movie isn't funny enough to be an absurd comedy and isn't hard hitting enough to comment on the American government or penal system. There are good moments in this movie like the competition between Idris Elba's Bloodsport and John Cena's Peacemaker but any humor or heart is short lived in this tonal tornado.So many DC characters die in this movie for no reason eliminating their potential to be in future DC films. A lot of the humor feels forced and cringey and Margot Robbie's NY/Gotham accent is hit or miss. There's a lot of Boston in her accent this time around.If you like over the top gore and enjoyed GoTG you'll probably like this movie. I think Gunn will do well with the Peacemaker series but this film was just too many weird ideas tossed into a blender and thrown into audiences faces. With one core character and more focus I think Gunn & Cena will fair much better than this movie did.,The Suicide Squad

It was way better in pretty much every aspect than the first suicide squad. The directing was amazing too. John Cena turning out to be a bad guy was quite a twist. I also never knew how great of an actor Idris Elba was. I very much look forward to a sequel to this movie. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes movies such as deadpool and kick-ass, and doesn't mind some gore and crazy concepts. The humor was on point too, most every joke was delivered very well. Thanks to James Gunn and everyone else involved for giving us this masterpiece.",The Suicide Squad

2510,tomas-75743,Another anti-superhero comedy.,8,14 August 2021,"For the record, I did not watch the original Suicide Squad. And I am not a fan of superhero movies. Last one I watched was Deadpool 2. I did not find that movie very engaging because of the overflowing meta-humour, matter of preference.The strength of this movie is in its balance of visual comedy and action. Which was also prevalent in the director's previous movies. Such as guardians of the galaxy vol 2.Pros:Throughout the film I had plenty of laughs and there were an abundance of funny scenes. More than your typical superhero movie.The action scenes were very engaging and eye-popping.The characters in the suicide squad were extremely unusual but it magically works to its benefit. The actors who were playing them were excellent. My actor MVP in this movie is Idris Elba.Cons:Some comedic scenes tend to be quite bizarre and may not work for all the viewers.As in any other superhero movie, there is plenty of action and an ensemble of ""unique"" characters. However, I fear that this movie is yet another one in the long list of superhero movies that is going to be forgotten.

This movie only ramps up with time and it's absolutely awesome the way James Gunn has paced this film is masterful and the fight choreography was top notch.

Movies should always contain some sense of controversy regardless but back to this movie. I love the fact that it's rated R I also love the fact that every single person in this movie nailed their roles. Even John Cena awesome performance on his part & of course the rest of the cast.

They tried hard to make characters likeable and relatable but ultimately there's a mismatch in emotion, tone , direction , and pacing. It doesn't know what it is.

No villain in any of the movies can survive before the credits role. Unless of course your name is...Ocean Master.This movie is okay, but it would be even better if it were PG-13. Not all Rated R movies mean it's better quality.The only thing appealing about DC nowadays is the animated series from the 90's and the Justice League cartoon. Those are gold mines. Witha few good movies here and there.",The Suicide Squad

Overall this movie is great in every way, it has humour, character arc, good plot, and all the other stuff that makes it a good movie. However the movie got a little slow sometimes. Spoilers, I really liked a group if villains ti to defeat another cillian who was not really bad but wronged for a long time. It was really sad when starro said ""I was happy floating in with stars"". Loved this movie, it s fun and something entirely different from regular comic book movies just like other DC movies this is a masterpiece. You should watch it for King Shark.",The Suicide Squad

Sure, the movie has a lot of funny moments and blood etc but that doesnt make it a masterpiece or a really good movie. Now to the movie. The most dumb thing about the movie was Harley Quinn. Why make her so dumb and all? Why? I hated it and it was awkward to watch. Then we have rick flag and peacemaker. Those were actually good and i liked them besides the fact that i didnt care for the movie anymore. The relationship between bloodsport and ratcatcher was nice to see. But in the end when i started watch the movie i was like okee this can be a very good movie but halfway i was bored and was glad the movie was over. Overall this movie is better then Suicide Squad.",The Suicide Squad
2547,euandavidkerr,Utterly delightful,10,30 July 2021,"To all those who are sceptical about this movie don't be as it is everything you hoped for.From the opening of the movie to the end you are utterly gripped as the movie makes 2 hours and 12 minutes feel like an hour.Their was way more gore than I thought and I absolutely loved it and the humour is definitely on point.Although the movie still manages to keep its Heart and for a blood soaked gore and adolescent humour it has a lot of heart.Every single character is absolutely loveable and ratcatcher 2 is essentially the heart of the squad and the movie.Every character is so unique and loveable all with their own story's and traits with standouts being ratcatcher 2, king shark and bloodsport also Rick flag is a much better character here.The colour and joy this movie brings to the eyes is amazing with the CGI being some of the best and the soundtrack wow the soundtrack just amplifies the whole movie.This is by far one of the best comic book movies I have ever watched and it makes 2016 suicide squad look like a joke.Blood soaked, humourous and an absolute treat for the eyes and comic book fans.A must watch.",The Suicide Squad

But what you'll get will be a Gaint improvement from the 2016 version. This Movie is incredibly well Edited. It's Light hearted,very colourful. There's no unnecessary dark tone in this movie. The dialogues are massively inspired from Tarantino's writing. It'll always keep you hooked. The Performances are quite good. John cena was a huge surprise. I didn't liked him in F9 but here he works really well. Whatever,Idris elba as 'deadshot' was underwhelming. He lacks the natural flair for comedy needed in this Movie. He's more suitable for serious Roles. In short,It's a good fun to watch movie just Don't expect something extraordinary.",The Suicide Squad
2550,deansmyth-25065,Best DCEU movie in my opinion,10,15 August 2021,I really love how they embrace the wacky style from the comics. Nowadays studios are always trying to make comic book movies more grounded and realistic but this movie pretty much tells you that this is the furthest thing from being realistic. Great movie and I loved what James Gunn did with The Suicide Squad and I hope the DCEU continues in this direction for their future films.,The Suicide Squad
2551,Humantarget80,A Summer Movie You'll Sink Right Into,8,31 July 2021,"I caught an early screening of The Suicide Squad and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. The trailers didn't have me particularly excited but I went in with an open mind and James Gunn knocked it out of the park. Every character gets their time to shine in this crazy war film. While all of the jokes don't land, the ones that did were hilarious and surprising. The gore was sometimes over the top but in a way that was just fun. Definitely recommend. It did have one sequence involving Harley when the plot started that had me baffled but other than that it was a wild ride.",The Suicide Squad
2552,HarleyGrin,Great First Movie Back In Theaters,10,31 July 2021,"This movie was such a spectacle! I got to watch it a week early at an advanced screening, and I honestly didn't think I was going to like it as much as I ended up! It's gory, funny, suspenseful, and full of heart. As much of the FX as possible were done practically and it really shows! The movie is GORGEOUS! You don't get distracted by cruddy CGI. Not even when the talking shark is there! (He'll be one of your favorites!) I went for Harley, but by the end of it I loved every single key player in the movie. The cast is phenomenal and their chemistry is magic. It's everything I love about comic book movies minus everything I'm starting to grow tired of about them. Truly kinda felt like watching an large scale ensemble CBM for the first time again. It will bring the kid out of you, I hope if you see it that you enjoy it as much as I did!Oh! And don't take small children. Seriously.",The Suicide Squad
2553,shaimaobeyeh,The first movie was better,4,11 August 2021,I did enjoy this movie but it wasn't as entertaining as the first one. I've watched the first one more then once but this one I won't watch it again. There was a lot of violence n blood n people get ripped apart n heads being cut off so I don't recommend it for people who don't enjoy or fear watching these kind of scene.,The Suicide Squad

2556,sebastianpankalla,best DC movie since 2008,8,14 August 2021,"The biggest surprise was how much I liked Elba, Cena and Ratcatcher II. I went in because of my love for the 80s John Ostrander Suicide Squad comics, Gail Simone's Secret Six and the Kot Suicide Squad run. Those 3 actors really were incredible charming in their roles. If we get a sequel I wish to see more Waller, espionage and politics, though. Ostrander's run felt like Bourne Identity at times. King Shark is superior to Groot, Rocket and Drax IMHO. Sly did a great job with a character who is not as ridiculous as he should be. Maybe its about Gunn's writing... all the characters felt like they were more interesting than you'd expect and had satisfying arcs. The best DC movie since 2008's Dark Knight. Toning down the violence might be an idea... really surprising with how much they got away with.",The Suicide Squad

Every single character had some sort of Arc, the chemistry between them all is amusing, the casting is perfect!

2560,matthewsking,Villains that fight a starfish.. not the DC I've come to love,1,1 August 2021,"True to comics or not as someone who loved seeing the masterpiece that was joker and who moderately appreciated what they tried to create with the first suicide squad this film felt like a slapstick Laurel & hardy act straight from the Marvel Universe which makes complete sense as it was directed by James Gunn.DC for me is a dark universe where villains act.. like criminals. I have no problem with the setup of Suicide Squad itself being controlled by the government to rid the world of evil on impossible missions BUT when did these villains stop having criminal instincts.. why are the double crosses sooo OBVIOUS.James Gunn should stick to marvel where this kind of comedic value belongs.A joke here or there is fine but every other line was a bad pun and the only thing that made it close to being DC was the amazing fight scenes and gore. Plus points for this mr . Gunn.Can we touch on how the 2016 version was slated for its terrible portrayal of The Empress ? Sorry, did I just watch a Star Fish turn out to be the big bad boss that we are all waiting for. It seemed more like something from Doctor Who. Again, regardless of whether it was true to comics.. we are used to seeing James Gunn films directed to bosses like Thanos.When exactly does Suicide Squad or The Suicide Squad catch a break and get a director who fleshes out a set of Super-Villains properly? Take it slow, build the right back story for a cast that are going to remain in tow for more than one film.Shall we get the writers of Gotham in now ? At least they know how to make a villain who has charisma.Also Margot Robbie smashed her role as Harley Quinn once again. Albeit, since Birds of Prey she has seemingly become a little more disjointed and more tamed down as time moves on Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey and then The Suicide Squad .. I want to see crazy Harley from the joker experiments back.In a lot of ways I actually preferred Suicide Squad (2016) to this reboot/remake/sequel or whatever it is.Are we ever going to actually get to see Jared Letos joker running around with Harley Quinn? Let's be honest Joker (film) is a master piece but Harley doesn't fit in with that joker.. she is far more acclimatised to the 2016 Suicide Squad (Leto).Let's get the footage of Leto back out of the archives that wasn't used in the original Suicide Squad and give us a proper joker / Quinn film.Then if Suicide Squad or The Suicide Squad does get a sequel let's put the best characters from both into one film called The Ultimate Suicide Squad and be done with this.It's time for some proper DC story telling with proper story arcs instead of one off master pieces followed by stand alone comedies.P. S, it got a one star because I had to write a review, it was entertaining but I'd still rewatch 2016 again and again over this.",The Suicide Squad

2569,connorjim,A surprisingly heartfelt take on the suicide squad,9,3 August 2021,"After seeing the suicide squad I can confidently say that this is my favourite DCEU film to date. I can not truly say it is the BEST DCEU film because it is so different from many other comic book movies and consequently it is difficult to compare against the varying visual, tonal and thematically different movies in the DCEU at present but nonetheless it is my personal favourite. James Gunn was not exaggerating when he said WB gave him license to do whatever he wanted. As a comic book fan Gunn's reverence for the medium as well his ability to present these wacky characters in a believable and grounded way had me giddy with excitement.Visually the film is STUNNING, please go see this on the biggest screen available, knowing that whenever possible Gunn shot this film practically really added to the experience and compared to many current day comic book movies (I love Marvel as much as the next person) the authenticity is felt in every frame. The Panama location is a gorgeous and unique setting that provides a beautiful backdrop to many of the action set pieces and the choice to anchor the film in the tone of a gritty 1970s war movie is an inspired one, the tropical jungle location really reminded me of saving private Ryan. Again i can't overstate how good this film looks, the colour grading is as good as 2019's The Joker which alleviates the flat washed out aesthetic of other DCEU films and sets it apart from Marvel's visually identifiable style. This is without a doubt James Gunns vision for The Suicide Squad and I for one couldn't be happier with how it turned out.Is this James Gunn's best movie ? In my opinion no, but it is his best movie since guardians of the galaxy. That film felt like lightning in a bottle and it's not that the suicide squad falls flat, on the contrary, it's simply that a near perfect film like the first guardians is very rare but The Suicide Squad, amongst other Comic Book fare of recent years, offers a unique experience. That's what this film felt like, an EXPERIENCE, not in the sense that it is monumentally life changing but in the sense that this film is clearly meant to be watched on the big screen and it is clearly in every way a James Gunn film. I mentioned authenticity before but it is absolutely true in the case of this film. It doesn't feel manufactured to meet the needs of WB execs like the 2016 suicide squad and as a result Gunn is able to communicate to the audience a consistent, bold and confident vision that certainly took me on an emotional journey I wasn't expecting. There is a tenderness to the movie and many of its characters which surprised me and elevated the film immensely.Is the film violent? You bet it is ! But the violence isn't overly gratuitous and is very much congruent with the tone of the film, it is called the suicide squad after all. YES the movie's tagline is absolutely true, DONT GET TOO ATTACHED, which when bearing in mind really ups the stakes in this film and heightens the tension, something sorely missing from films like Black Widow. As such the movie keeps you on your feet with shocking moments and creative risks that don't feel cheap and are certainly earned.Lastly I'm going to talk about pace. The film to me felt very fast paced. While there is certainly a lot of action there are really only 3 large action set pieces in the film, one of which is absolutely brilliant involving Harley. As such I felt the action was used sparingly and there wasn't an over reliance on it, instead the frenetically clever editing, snappy dialogue and compelling characters keep the pace moving at a consistently entertaining rate, I was not bored once. Again, the editing and the way the film is cut together is very cool and visually engaging, similar to aspects of Birds of Prey, only done better here. I mentioned compelling characters and this was something I was worried about going in. With a huge roster of suicide squad members I assumed only a few would get developed and much like the maligned 2016 suicide squad the film would suffer for it. Needless to say my concerns were alleviated pretty quickly (I can't really elaborate on this point without spoiling things, James Gunn you madman !) but you definitely know who you are supposed to care about and who should be treated as expendable canon fodder, only it's sad because those same canon fodder are portrayed by such excellent acting talent ! Harley is the best we have ever seen her and Margot Robbie as always does an incredible job, John Cena's chemistry with Idris Elba really worked for me, Idris himself had a few really good emotional scenes with Viola Davis who was mesmerising in this role IMO, and his daughter but otherwise was just a serviceable lead, Polka Dot Man was endearing and will not doubt be a fan favourite and King Shark is the DC's answer to Groot, every time he's on screen you are guaranteed to at least crack a grin.But if you had told me my favourite character in The Suicide Squad would be Ratchatcher 2 I would have laughed at you. I should have reserved judgement because her character is great and without any spoilers some of hers scenes are very emotional. In fact her character epitomises the theme of this movie which I'll let you figure out on your own when you watch the film, it truly made me tear up just a little.Side Note the third act is absolutely brilliant. That is all.",The Suicide Squad
2570,rebeccadonaldson-54374,So satire it will leave a bad taste in your mouth,1,3 August 2021,"I can't believe how utterly horrifying this movie is. Not the gore, the see through plot and personality-less characters. Even Margot Robbie couldn't save this. I am in a state of shock at the good reviews on this movie. Perhaps we are not talking about the same movie. It's the wish version of marvel on crack. Colourful, childish scenes do not fit in a DC world. There is no real plot, it loses all meaning half way through. I seriously hope this movie is discredited, I can't take it as part of the DC universe. To put it into perspective, I am a marvel fan, and a James Gunn fan, but there is no room for this in a DC universe. It does not work!",The Suicide Squad

2573,eafunicorn,Great film - needs an 18 rating in the UK,8,4 August 2021,"James Gunn really nailed it with this one. It's a real standout in the DC cinematic universe, it's completely unique to the point I actually forgot it's a DC film. It's such an original masterpiece, with great humour, heart, action, storyline and characters. I love how Gunn made all the characters stand out in their own way. I'm not even gonna compare it to the first Suicide Squad- this is completely it's own thing and it's really good.I was very surprised to find it had a 15 rating over here in the UK. I know it's an R-rating in America and elsewhere, which would be equivalent to an 18 here, which it really needs. The violence is very, very graphic. Great for shock value, I was very lightheaded by the end of the film, but I totally wasn't expecting it. Ultra violence is an understatement, this film is filled with gore and blood. There is also a brief moment with a nude male which caught me off guard, and a nude female too later on in the film. I think this should have been enough to give it that top 18 rating - I did have to give proof I was over 18 before seeing it in the cinemas anyway, which was a giveaway that it was gonna be pretty intense. This isn't me complaining about the graphic-ness of the film, it does suit the film and gives it that real edge that separates it from the rest of the superhero genre.I totally recommend this film! It's so unique and really was an experience from start to finish.",The Suicide Squad

2577,chici-42253,terribly!!!!!!!!!,1,5 August 2021,"I have no idea how this film got such high ratings at all(this was just the reason for watching it). A film for a separate group of people: if you are interested in a meat grinder, bloody murders.... strange costumes..., Margot Robbie))), then the film is suitable for you... I do not advise the rest. Probably the worst movie I've seen, the plot is zero, there is no fantasy at all, the final villain is a walking star in general, what??!, the costumes of some heroes are generally nonsense, one blood and murder, I don't know how you can watch it at all..... the film is clearly not for the smartest.... the first part is much better, but also far from a masterpiece the only thing that corrects the opinion about the film is its ending, it is even less, the idea that the rats save the city brings some surprise, and the rest is horror.... probably designed for very stupid people... jokes for people with erotomania
The only thing that can be said in defense of the film is well shot, very high quality, a lot of special effects, a lot of details are drawn, there is nothing to complain about, but the question arises whether it was worth how much money you need to spend to draw blood at every murder, etc....... I think not!",The Suicide Squad

I enjoyed the movie but towards the end when they were fighting the star fish thing (didn't really have a name) they killed it with rats. Like really rats??? Come on that big huge thing that they were hyping up and they killed it in less than a minute with rats that's why I'm giving it a low rating. I felt it wasn't really that funny to me. I was surprised I thought I would enjoy it more but I found myself being bored and going on my phone during the movie which I never do. I found the way that they killed the thing stupid and dumb. The acting was amazing thought that's something that I appreciate. The little things were great but somethings were not. For me I didn't like it. I found myself pointing out all the flaws and I never do that. The cgi was moderate some parts looked good others not so much. Tho the shark was my favorite character.

2594,ariel_vardy,Was this a really deep satire or did I way over think it? Enjoyed the conversation...,9,6 August 2021,"I have never been moved enough to write a review before.I also try to stay away from superhero movies and saw this on a complete random whim of wanting to spend time with someone. So we went to the movies, and this was the first movie playing so we went for it.I really don't like watching violence and for the first half, was really annoyed that we had chosen the most shallow and violent movie option available. That being said, it is very stylish, and colorful. I found a lot of the jokes kinda stupid, but then again I couldn't help laugh as well, so guess it was funny.And then I started to realized how steeped this movie is in social commentary and I started to appreciate the conversation this movie was trying to start. After the movie I searched online to see what other people thought: what was the symbolism of the birds? Why a star fish? Etc... and I am really struggling to find ANYONE discussing the underlying symbolism, AM I MAKING IT ALL UP???Here is my take on the movie below, honestly, I found so much symbolism I can only ramble about a few major pieces before I feel like I'm typing/rambling too much and no one will want to read all of it.First of all, maybe its silly, but there are two random reasons I started looking deeper into the movie.1. the movie writes messages on the cinematography. Roots or clouds might spell a word out. What is the intention of that? I decided (maybe foolishly) that it meant 'the movie has messages, you just need to read them'2. There was some overt satire when the characters mindlessly killed the people in the jungle, just to find out they were actually the 'good guys'. This section was shot like a platformer video game. There is some later overt satire when you come to realize the plot matches us history, of us putting someone in power for their own gain, having things go bad, and then needing to cover it up just to make it even worse. Meanwhile this new power brainwashes everyone into following their ways.Then I saw social commentary other places: suicide squad are inmates that can go on suicide missions and most likely die to lessen their prison sentence. This seems to say something (to me) about America's prison complex, getting cheap labor from inmates with no profit to them. These people are literally thrown away without care (many scenes show how little thought the staff had in trying to keep everyone alive, even after the main person explicitly says this is a #1 priority).And I think the theme of 'good vs bad' // 'freedom vs following orders/set paths' was a main part of the commentary. The inmates (some of who were explicitly murderers) are chosen to be the 'heroes' for a mission for us to save the world (so they can one day be free), only to find out the us created the mess in the first place. All the freedom fighters were complaining about the violence of the others, and then they too were violent. Symbolically, the bird was senselessly killed in the open scene, and an identical bird senselessly ate the brains of that character later on when he was killed. There is some sort of message here about being the victim when its convenient, and is emotionless and merciless when they need to be.The characters often each tell their own social commentary. The most obvious being 'peacemaker' who is super violent, and polka dot whose dots are literally flamboyant (I think it is mentioned at some point that he is gay?). Somehow he is in jail and has a power dampener on even though he explicitly does not like to kill/hurt anyone.And one last idea, maybe the most far fetch. People are trying to figure out if this is a sequel, a reboot or what. It takes the same name and (some of the) same characters from the previous film, but makes no mention of it, and does not advertise as either sequel nor reboot. I can hardly imagine this being on purpose, but it feels like there is commentary on colonialism here. The director literally takes a complete movie idea, calls it his, rebrands it, and runs with it without connecting it to the previous one at all. I am not offended or mad at him, but it just feels relevant to the movies themes and I find that fascinating.Not sure if I thought too hard about this movie. Its bizarre that I have SO MANY things to saw about the film, and I can't find anyone else analyzing it in this way AT ALL (tried imdb, googled 'suicide squad 2021 satire' 'suicide squad 2021 analysis"" and also tried youtube). Whether or not I am crazy, I see it as a great conversation piece, and others who are more into mindless violent (CGI) films said they liked it to, so I guess it makes everyone happy!",The Suicide Squad

It's really a shame that there were some fantastic actors in this movie and yet it still fell flat.The advertisements for this movie were right though. There definitely was a style to this movie, it just wasn't one that was enjoyable to look at. I've enjoyed some of Gunn's others work so I don't really know what went wrong here.I'm left here after finishing The Suicide Squad (2021) for the first time and my only thoughts are on another Harley Quinn movie. Probably because out of the large cast of characters Harley is the most well written and acted. That's not meant to be a jab at the other actors but be a pointed look at the writers. It was like they took pointers from the first Suicide Squad before writing the miniscule backgrounds for other characters.

They should've hired Tim Gunn to direct because apparently James couldn't even MAKE IT WORK.The most complex characters are one-dimensional or don't have enough screen time to make an impact. And when Pete Davidson and a rat are the two redeeming qualities, you need to rethink how your using your time.If you're going to watch this movie, not waste your money in the theatre - watch it at movie, grab a drink, and take a sip every time there's a reference to something Marvel relate.

The detachable pieces of suit morphing into guns and other weapons with infinite ammunition is imaginative but depressingly beyond ridiculous.Peacemaker is pretty much unbearable, as is Polka-Dot Man, both feel like half-assed attempts at creating a character. Ratcatcher 2 isn't much better a character, but at least she was fleshed out with some background.

2632,yihongjin-85807,"Why rates, papa?",9,7 August 2021,"Rats are the lowliest and most despised of all creatures, my love.If they have purpose, so do we all.When I saw this proletarian manifesto popping out in 3D on the screen of a bourgeois country, I felt confused.A large-scale commercial pop culture film promoted by big capital will always fit or represent a part of the spirit of the times. When an audience purely for the pleasure of watching commercial films, see that ""Suicide Squad 2"" uses a lot of symbols and metaphors to insinuate and satirize the hegemonism of the United States, and call on the proletariat to unite and fight for freedom to overthrow hegemonism. At this time, you should be clearly aware that the world is undergoing drastic changes unconsciously.The structure of ""Suicide Squad 2"" is highly neat, and the two battles before and after entering the main story are highly echoed.In the previous battle, the suicide squad, under the absolute control of Waller, a senior official representing the US government, for the purpose of self-protection, in the name of justice, infiltrated the base of the small country resistance army, and made the combat power far lower than their resistance army members. The slaughter was exhausted, and finally he was shocked to engage in the black humor of Oolong.The latter battle was a suicide squad that got rid of Waller's control. For the purpose of protection, at the expense of sacrifice, confronted the starfish monster with a fighting force a hundred times its own. It faced group extinction several times, and finally reversed with the help of absolute external forces. Heroic epic.The echoing of these two battles aims to convey some core spirits:1. The individual's free will must be higher than the collective will, otherwise it will easily become a tool of evil;2. The human spirit lies in knowing self-sacrifice, and life can only survive with another life as its value;3. The strength of individuals is small, but as long as they are united, the combined efforts of small individuals can also bring down cruel giants.These core spirits are not the noble ideas of those who have never seen them before, but they are just clichés, even with a little bit of dogmatism.But when this American superhero movie portrays the US government itself as the absolute villain in the movie, and uses a lot of symbols and metaphors worthy of fun and scrutiny, so that clichés and dogmatism are no longer purely superficial.This bottle of old wine will naturally begin to exude an intoxicating fragrance.The image of the villain, the U. S. government, is split into three parts in the film:The first part is Waller, a senior official and leader of the Suicide Squad, representing American politicians. She was insensitive and did not regard the prisoners' lives as their lives. In order to ensure the success of the mission, she sacrificed a team of prisoners in cold blood and let them act as bait for the real team. What's interesting is that as a black Waller, almost all of the subordinates in the office are white, and the victim chosen by her is Bloodsport, who is a black. She even chose a white executioner Peacemaker because of fear of B rebellion. , As an internal response.The second part is the Peacemaker, who wears the national flag directly on his body. He is a peaceful executioner who actually kills women and children without blinking his eyes. He represents the US military. He has always claimed that he is defending freedom, but he dismissed the freedom and even the deprivation of life of those who became the victims of the experiment, and he only wanted to defend his own interests. In order to better shape Peacemaker, in the first battle mentioned above, a bridge was deliberately added in the film--Peacemaker and Bloodsport kill people with dazzling skills for vindictiveness.P and B are not pure homicide experts, they even tend to kill for pleasure. This is undoubtedly an allusion to the various evil deeds committed by the US military in torturing prisoners and robbing civilians in the Middle East.The third part is the starfish monster. That's right. For fear that the audience would not be able to see it, the film simply made the starfish monster draped in an American flag, striped of red and blue colors, and matched with a five-pointed star. It is a mutated star and stripes. The starfish monster represents the conspiracy theory of the US government. In the real world, it is Iraq's ""deadly weapon"", China's ""virus"", and anything that is detrimental to the US government, organizations, or individuals.These three parts form a ring. Although it is still a bit flat, it is relatively complete and smooth to shape one, tearing away the imagination and beautification of the contemporary American image. This is in line with the perception of the vast majority of people (especially leftist Americans) except the US government.Correspondingly, decency is divided into three parts in the film:The first part is Colonel Flag (this name is really...you can't live if you look at it). He represents the conscience. Strictly speaking, it should be the conscience of white people-that is, the so-called universal value of the United States. Because of this, when Peacemaker stabbed Flag with a piece of floor tile, the film had to spend a lot of time to make a close-up of the heart stabbed.The white conscience tried to uphold justice, but was killed by the American government, which claimed to be just.Peacemaker, what a joke.Flag took this sarcasm as the rest of his life, and it was really loud.The second part is Controlling Mouse Girl. Her composition is particularly complicated-ethnic minorities, immigrants, women, teenagers, orphans, prisoners who have been maliciously aggravated, but also particularly simple-vulnerable people. Control Mouse Girl is a collection of tags for disadvantaged people, which is a comprehensive symbol. She is the representative of the proletariat, so she has the ability to call the proletariat-it is a call, not a control, which is very important. In order to distinguish them, the film shows the friendship between Control Mouse Girl and Mouse at all costs. They are good comrades who report to the group to keep warm. What's more terrible is that the posture when the rat girl called for the rat is clearly restoring the Statue of Liberty (by the way, the Statue of Liberty is a gift from France to the United States, and it is indeed not an American product).At this point, the existence of the mouse sister is to express something, so there is no need to say anything.The third part is Bloodsport. This is the real and only complex role in the film, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a microcosm of contemporary American social problems.He is a black single father. People who know a little bit about American culture are naturally familiar with this identity tag. For those who don't know, I can't explain it clearly to you in a few words.He is a military veteran, now a prisoner. What we are talking about here are the old problems of the U. S. military veterans;He was abused by his father when he was a child (think about his father if his mother was alive; if his mother died young, this is a black single father) and was trained as a killing machine. What I'm talking about here is children's rights and terrorism;Most importantly, he hates and fears mice.The film explains why Bloodsport hates mice because of being abused by his father when he was a child. But because the mouse was given the identity of the proletariat in the film, we can't just use the explanation in the film to understand Bloodsport's hatred of mice.In fact, Bloodsport's aversion to mice is likely to be an allusion to the aversion of the native class by those from the bottom.This is not only a phenomenon that appears in American society, it is a worldwide phenomenon, and a human phenomenon.People born at the bottom, let alone getting rich, just get a little better, and can't wait to get rid of the relationship with the bottom. Are there few princes? As we all know, the best way to separate from a class is to promote hatred of that class.Sebastian the mouse has been showing goodwill and goodwill to Bloodsport, but he has never concealed his disdain and disgust, even when the rats finally united to charge the starfish monster, Bloodsport also because the rats stepped on him. Trembling with disgust and fear. Until the mouse knocked down the starfish monster and saved his life, he reluctantly stretched out his hand and touched Sebastian.In the film, from beginning to end, Bloodsport is a part of decency, not a part of justice. He did something, but he still failed to get out of his own narrowness. Based on this, Bloodsport did not follow Flag's last wish to hand over the hard drive to the media, but instead used it as a suicide squad's life-saving talisman. His actions even aroused the contempt of Harry Bain...It can be said that the end of the hard drive battle is the climax of the film.The White Conscience Flag spared his life and robbed it, and passed it to the disadvantaged group of control mouse girl; mouse control girl gritted her teeth and risked her life to send the hard drive away; in the end, the hard drive fell into the narrow hands of Bloodsport.Justice came to an abrupt end, and self-interest quietly raised its head.""Suicide Squad 2"" is cheerful on the surface, with dense cold humor and black humor, so that everyone can watch it with popcorn. But it is by no means easy, nor is it complete. Under the jacket of the popcorn movie of this commercial film, there is a little seriousness and profoundness hidden, which will make everyone who lifts this jacket feel terrified.When an audience purely for the pleasure of watching commercial films begins to express the core of commercial films, feeling a little uncomfortable and extremely scared, you should clearly realize what is happening.",The Suicide Squad

2637,inversioneslanderos,The cold hard truth.,1,7 August 2021,James Gunn got paid for a worthless piece of a movie.

2641,moviereviewsimdb,worst move I have ever seen,1,7 August 2021,"I spent over an hour trying to think of a worse movie that I have seen and could not come up with one. That's shocking.This movie seems targeted towards young thoughtless minds. The jokes are low quality junior high (12-15 year olds) humor. At times you are sitting through a scene that can last a minute or even seven or eight minutes only for it to end on a joke that doesn't pay off. It's sacrificing story, character development, and entertainment for a build up to a ""joke"" that's not even funny. It leaves you confused and feeling like your time is being disrespected. The humor (or attempt at humor I should say) and gore definitely shows Gunn has not grown up from the tweets that landed him in hot water a few years ago. He's still exactly who he was then. Only now more celebrated for some reason. I'm also confused on how the first SS movie was criticized for killing off characters rather abruptly after introducing them but is praised for doing so in this movie. The movie relies so heavily on the R rating for ""shock"" value (including male nudity) that it wears itself out. It can only be shocking once or twice. After that is just becomes boring. It's just endless gory death after gory death. Whenever I see movies or franchises go this direction it tells me they are out of ideas and cannot make a smart thoughtful movie. It becomes dumbing everything that to try to appeal to the mindless that think a collection of vulgar jokes and violent deaths make a good edgy movie. I did find some decent acting from Melchior (Ratcatcher 2) and Dastmalchian (Polka-Dot Man) but just not enough to keep your interest. Elba does a good job and makes me want to see him in a real comedic role. Cena isn't funny and comes off as a robot (that might be the intent.) Robbie's Quinn is just as good as ever but gets lost in the movie.I know I must not be the target audience for this movie but if you're putting out a comic book movie in 2021 you're casting a giant net for an audience. DC might be giving up on trying to make their DC universe and going all in on vulgar jokes and gore. If this is the direction then they can forget merchandising or being anything other than a niche market at the box office.On a final note. This is my first review. This movie was so bad and disappointing that it made me want to sign up just to leave it a bad review. WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen.",The Suicide Squad

As well as that, its nice to see a cast of characters that would likely never see the light of day in any other DC movie, Polka Dot man being a prime example. The casting itself was also really well done with Daniela Melchior being the standout to me.Overall I loved this movie, it was such a breath of fresh air in, at times, today's over saturated superhero movie genre and I would highly recommend that people go see this film in cinemas for a truly unforgettable experience.",The Suicide Squad

2658,rafikhitti,When there's more creative freedom there's outstanding results,8,10 August 2021,"Directors who have creative freedom make magic, and maybe create the #1 DCEU FilmJames Gunn's The Suicide Squad is a feast of outstanding performances, action sequences and a soul that has been ignored for a long time to the comic book film genre.The screenplay is basic, but masterfully made and executed, and that's the magic of the storyline.The only flaw of it is that in the second act it gets stagnant but it rises up to the third act so powerful and strongly as Starro the conqueror.The Performances are exquisit.Margot Robbie has proven one more time that she was born to play Harley Quinn and that she is the action star of our generation.Idris Elba is so strong and powerful but also charming, and a very good actor to play the role of the leader in this exotic yet outstanding team.Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2 is so charming, lovely and powerful for this film, and she has a clear future on the film industry
David Dastmalchian is so funny and has such a level of charisma that makes you always feel sad for him
Viola Davis is so strong and imposing, and she makes you and gives you chills
John Cena is insanely funny and most important, imposing.The soundtrack sometimes is overused, because sometimes a song comes immediately after the last one.The polithical message it has is so strong, with the squad being basically pigs for slaughter for the government to fight and help the undercover of different war crimes.The action sequences are outstanding, with very well choreographed and viable, yet crude and savage.Conclusion
The Suicide Squad is a very original well done comic book film with outstanding performances, thrilling and strong action sequences, falls a little bit but rises strongly and most important with bold and strong choices by it's filmmaker and his outstanding visions.An action packed yet deep and strong feast and a relief of the COMIC BOOK MOVIE formula.",The Suicide Squad

2671,goduofthenorth,"Fun wacky ideas, poor pacing and execution",4,9 August 2021,"The reviews seem to either love or hate this film. If the bar is Guardians, yeah, this doesn't come close. That being said, if you're not big into DCEU, this won't change your mind, but it's easy enough to watch on its own, and the wacky ideas kinda make up for it. Although, as I will explain later, this is unfortunately not a reboot of the 2016 film.I give this movie an amount of credit because it feels like it could've been good. There are gags and visuals that are inventive, at times I was entertained. Harley Quinn was pretty good, I liked Idris Elba and the rest of the squad was never overwhelmingly annoying. James Gunn's attempt to go outside the box wasn't the problem here. The problem is that the pacing and the clumsy dialogue undercut everything good going on. Whenever there was a good joke, it never had any room to breathe before 10 more ok ones fired off. Sometimes character development happens in one scene when it feels like it should really be more fleshed out, and that's definately a side effect of how many characters they tried to jam into this film. Then in other parts, it grinds to a hault and drags on something that should take 5 seconds, often some experimental shot or something that might be interesting if they didn't take so long. Like, whoever editted this movie just made baffeling decisions on where to focus, and it's not clear how much of that was James Gunn. That doesn't mean the script is perfect, or that James Gunn didn't fall asleep at the wheel, but I think a stronger editor could've brought this film to a 6 or 7 out of 10.Of course, another issue that effects the plot development is that this film isn't actually a reboot. Clearly, Warner Brothers wanted people to think it was a reboot that just shared a few returning cast members, because they called this film, ""The Suicide Squad,"" with no subtitle, and I don't think anyone would've given this a chance had James Gunn's name hadn't been attatched. The last film called Suicide Squad was a critical bomb, Birds of Prey didn't do much better. It's clear that this movie is trying to take things in a significantly different direction. The problem is that they also didn't want to do another Harley Quinn origin story, but they still wanted Harley Quinn because she was the only good thing the other movies had going, so I guess they figured if they just changed most of the characters, re-explained the head bomb thing, and didn't put a number in the title, they could have their cake and eat it too. As I said, you don't need to watch the other movies to understand this one, but it does end up feeling somewhat like a sequel, which definately doesn't help.There's a lot wrong with this film, but I think if it were restructured it could be good. It's got some entertaining things going on, it was worth a watch, but the execution was poor and they should be able to do better.",The Suicide Squad

2678,danishzwordan,What was that?,1,9 August 2021,"I am highly disappointed in this movie. Everyone rating this as the best DCEU movie or one of the best, should really reconsider because this might be contending for the worst one yet. And as bold as this might be but I think the first movie was much better than this one.Let's start with the pros. It has incredible camera work and color palette which has that indie look to it that I love. Scenes look gorgeous and well-lit (Harley escape scene) although the final battle looked a little bit overexposed but that's a nitpick. The creative transitions looked super cool and it fits the 'comic-book' feel. The CGI is marvelous. Truly one of the best. Every shot with CGI was well-lit according to the environment. Not one scene was I taken out of due to CGI which is rare nowadays. The OST is okay but I was expecting better music considering it's Gunn's thing.Let's move on to the cons because there are way too many.First, I was highly expecting top notch character chemistry, storytelling and plot considering it's a movie about a group of villains working under a more evil person. But no, there was almost no character chemistry or anything. I just didn't care for the characters. For example, the scene where they tried to create a father-daughter bond between Ratcatcher 2 and Bloodsport was so forced and poorly executed, it made me cringe. They tried to make the characters bond over a drink and even that didn't work. How could you screw that up? None of the characters are taken seriously so why should we? At least the first Suicide Squad tried to clash each character with each other to create a sense of chemistry. Hell, Boomerang had more character in the first movie then any of the characters in this one.Speaking of characters, the character assassination done in this movie is unforgivable. First of all, the fact that they killed Boomer raised my expectations for the movie even more considering they killed one of my fav SS characters. Amanda Waller in this movie was done so dirty. It's not even the same character. Same for Rick Flag. It was an insult to Ayer's vision.Another thing was the forced childish toilet humor. Oh god, the humor. This movie is R-rated which means it serves adults, yet the humor only captivates 5 year olds. Who is this movie for? Hell. Even Teen Titans GO had more well suited and better written humor than this. If you like the Deadpool's humor BUT add 10 notches to that and have that stretched through the entire movie, then you'll probably like this movie.The plot was incoherent and messy. Although they had one objective, the plot felt directionless. It was a waste of time and I would not recommend it. It was basically a very expensive, millions of dollar episode of Legends of Tomorrow.Edit: changed the rating.",The Suicide Squad

2681,Punyrred,So bad I can't believe the high average score,2,9 August 2021,"The movie is definitely so much worse than the first part.So many things are just lacking background, characters are lacking motivation behind their actions, the boss is grotesque and inexplicable.

Nothing they say or do matters or makes us care.Peacemaker's actions are inexplicable, there is no hint of why he's doing what he's doing.The jokes are so flat and forced, it's straight embarrassing.

No motivations explained, no explanations of what drives the characters and the scene where Amanda gives her look from her office - is that supposed to have some meaning??Oh my god, I can't even imagine why someone would write such a trash of a plot.

2682,heavymetaldaze,How do you mess something up this badly?,4,9 August 2021,"So i didnt even know this was out yet, but the first suicide squad was somewhat enjoyable, so figured i'd give this a go when i saw it was out in the headlines. Saw the cast, thought ""man this could be awesome!"" 5 minutes into the film, everyone with potential was dead.. i didnt even want to keep watching after the opening scene. But it does the rewind b.s. And i thought ""ok, even though the entire movie is already ruined, maybe we get to see those characters on screen for a while before that happens.."" nope.. its just ""here's like 2 dozen characters for 5 minutes... and then a boring movie about 4 or 5 of them..."" Martin was the best character in the movie. There was sooooo much potential, and they took it, and flushed it. Almost zero character development.. and what little their was, was corny, cliche, and shallow.The harley quinn cartoon series runs circles around this movie..The ONLY reason its not 1 star, is i will give credit to the visuals. They are pretty neat. Except.. like everything else with potential in this movie, the cool stuff shows up for a minute or two, serves no purpose, and is never seen again.Also i guess i'm a sucker for movies that make you not like how it ends for the characters you like/are interested in.. but this brought that to extremes.On that note.. i dont even see how there could be another suicide squad after this.. the entire squad is dead.. except of course harley..DC's little golden girl.Honestly if they kept pete davidson's character around (black guard? I dunno), kept boomerang man, and made king shark like he is on the quinn show, they could have added a lot to the dynamic of the group you get stuck with..And the weasel is just dumb.. ""here's a comic relief character! And he lasted 3 seconds..""Why? Just why?There were some boobies.. so i guess that's something..? I dunno..This film just leaves you wondering what the hell you just watched, and who thought it was a good idea..I guess the ""edgy"" 16-21 crowd might see something in it.. but honestly hope they are better than that.Wait let me pull the rewind... can we talk about all the damn ""a few moments earlier"" segways? Gaaaaaarbage. Dont ever do that again..Also the ""scene name"" cut scenes... lame..Oh and ""hey meet the main bad guy..."" ::a few moments later..:: ""ha! Just kidding he's dead with 5minutes of screen time... next!.. oh yeah you're not going to get any character development out of the next one either...""Just ugh....And why was their a giant fish tank at the top of the tower with cute little jelly squids from hell? Speaking of which.. coulda been a chance for some shark development time.. or at least a silly montage if him doing something, but nope. Just cut to something else..I could go on forever, there is something wrong with literally every part of this movie.. i think the only scene that landed was when they took out the camp. That was it.I gotta stop.. i'd say dont watch, but you wont believe its thats bad, and even if you do, you'll still watch it to see the train wreck.. so just be prepared to hate it.

2687,mflanders-11666,The Suicide Squad is its Surface Level.,5,9 August 2021,"The Suicide Squad (2021) is definetly not Suicide Squad (2016). But let it be known that just because you're not absolute waste of time does not mean that you're immediately good. Suicide Squad (2021) is considerably more confident in its tone, execution, and writing. For that alone, the movie is deeply enjoyable and easier to watch than its predecessor. Though confidence does not null the flaws persisting within the antihero movie.It's been stated that we the viewer shouldn't mistake Suicide Squad (2021) for an R rated Guardians of the Galaxy. Despite Suicide Squad (2021) boasting the same pitfalls of Guardians of the Galaxy. The presence of James Gunn for the movie's writing is an obvious double edged sword. Specifically the use of humor. Like Guardians of the Galaxy, Suicide Squad (2021) has amazing character interaction based humor; when it's appropiate. The movie is chalk full of funny dialogue, which makes it all the more awkward when anything not immediately funny and serious is discussed. Giving the appearance of an awkward obligatory wedge of sad backstory and it feeling very out of place in a sea of laughter. Which explains the instant whiplash following a more heavy discussion/scene. This particular gripe is not an attack on the movie's identity or to suggest that the movie is tone confused. Instead it points to the problem with pacing within the movie and many other James Gunn works. In making a movie casual both in tone and dialogue a lot of in universe DC statements fail to have weight in addition to the characters themselves. A casual cadence and tone for movies like Guardians of the Galaxy makes sense, as the characters are laid back heroes who aren't really renowned but function as family. The members of the Suicide Squad aren't immediate family though and are in fact renowned.Suicide Squad (2021) is two hours and thirteen minutes of villains doing a bureaucrats and governments dirty work but flipping the script for good at the end. And that's it. Now it can be argued that Suicide Squad (2021) is a rowdy found family trope wrapped in antihero adventure. I know what anybody siding with the latter statement intends but I just can't agree.Before anybody clamors up and says that it's pretentious to expect Suicide Squad (2021) to mean or say something don't forget the following. A morally grey group of villains were tasked with doing a bureaucrats' dirty work in a Latin American nation. Now this is where it can be argued that the mission was more of a backdrop than anything, that found family was the focal point of the movie. The movie shoots itself and that argument in the foot. As we the audience are supposed to be taken back along with the idealistic Colonel Flag at America's involvement in an insidious alien weapon on latin american soil. The key word is supposed to be. Outside of the nation's freedom fighters convenient and occasional presence we the audience never delve deeper into the supposed pathos of Colonel Flag. As he shows little concern for the fact that his rescue team just killed a great deal of innocent freedom fighters in the movie. Nor does Colonel Flags question his team's presence at all for being in latin america or think further when tasked as a lackey for a cutthroat politician who believes the ends justify the means. Just that the ending is treated as a twist by all parties within and directing the movie, which feels redundant more than anything. Which brings us back to the hollow feel of the movie more than tone confusion. How Suicide Squad (2021) doesn't really have a focal theme, nothing to point out or say in general.For a movie that we're to believe exists because of its characters and their interactions with one another, its hard to believe that when watching Suicide Squad (2021). While endearing and humorful in parts, the interactions and relationships in the movie don't feel grown organically over time. In most movies there is a slow to care main character, you'd think it was Bloodsport this time around. The speed that Bloodsport goes on to trust a band of strangers organized by a woman that just threatened to murder his daughter is awkward at best and half baked at worst. The humor and contest had by Bloodsport between himself and Peacemaker for a mission feels sudden for a character we're told is the goal and serious orientated of the group. Also characters such as Colonel Flag should be more aware of the man who put Superman in the ICU, and if so should be slow to trust him. Even if Colonel Flag and Bloodsport knew each other once, the movie feels lazy in brushing over the fact the two characters are diametrically opposed in life pursuits. The farthest the movie's writers thought interaction wise is how difficult it would be for them as a job to not have characters get along instantly.The movie also failed in doing its homework beyond surface level and it was obvious James Gunn wasn't caring for staying true to character portrayal. Harley Quinn is an amazing and nuanced character but this movie was either intimidated or lazy in approaching this, dumbing her character down to sporadic jester who thinks with her lady parts and sensibilities. Believing in girl power by granting her badass privilege but no depth. Her cunning and intellect left out for the more entrancing ditz. A great deal of characters are simmered down for Suicide Squad (2021), Colonel Flags, Amanda Waller, Bloodsport, and King Shark. All these characters offer up interesting and depthful ideas and concepts. But James Gunn was obviously intimidated at the prospect of more serious concepts immediately outside of casual gore and death.A misc collection of concerns with the movie. There was little consideration for the potential misogynoir in the movie's aftermath, as Amanda Waller is the only dark skinned black woman who is the main antagonist in most of the movie. With no discussion or backstory for her to explain herself. Harley is written in nearly all comics to be repulsed by skeevy men or men with an inkling of Joker's tendency- this was forgotten for plot. Amanda Waller is more thorough and is an equal to Batman in cunning and planning, why would she place Boomerang and Harley on team A; they're Suicide Squad veterans. Just a lot of sloppy plot happenings.Overall, if you want to watch a pretty movie not immediately like Suicide Squad (2016) The Suicide Squad (2021) is the way to go. Otherwise, look somewhere else I guess.",The Suicide Squad
2688,simonsavine,Gunn has saved the unsavable,9,30 August 2021,"This movie absolutely blew me away and was a massive up from the previous one. The vibrant colors, the phenomenal acting (I was especially surprised with Cena's acting as his previous roles were mediocre at best), the simplistic but exciting plot, the way Gunn blew new life into Flag and Waller and don't even get me started on Nanue, who knew Stallone could play such an adorable character?

Actually, the entire sequence with the starfish plastered to the crowd of people's faces reminded me of the DNAliens story arc of Ben 10 Alien Force season 1 (which i liked and was really well done.) The comedy in this film was more slapstick than actually comedic and witty. I like some slapstick but you have to have substance behind it to make it work.

After GOTG 1 & 2, i have faith in James Gunn, i believe that he will make another film that is great as his previous work and it did not disappoint me.The action and the characters are really great especially Polka Dot-Man. James Gunn able to make this character that has the most useless power I've ever seen into a great character (I wish he had more action in this film). The jokes in this film kinda feel forced to me but i still enjoyed the film for what it is.If you have any doubt to watch this film, don't be.

But I kept coming back for more with this movie with it's gore, humor, fantastic music choice, and characters. Trust me if you wanted to see more action and limbs being removed in the DCEU you will not be disappointed with this movie. You want a good laugh? This movie makes the humor feel natural between each of the characters and for me it definitely doesn't seem forced, I've laughed at the same jokes every time I've watched this movie.2016 Suicide Squad was a chopped up mess and this time around in 2021 this movie redeemed that. The pacing, transitions, and character development feel right on the bullseye.This is what DCEU, especially suicide squad should be. James Gunn did a fantastic job with the direction of the movie. It takes turns that you might not expect and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's going to happen next. Are you gonna laugh, cry, gasp, gag, who knows?I really loved this movie and will more than likely watch it a lot more throughout this year waiting for the next movies and tv shows yet to be released.

2712,avery_kats,Like if Guardians of The Galaxy was just violence for 2 hours,1,11 August 2021,"Admittedly, I'm not such a big superhero fan anymore. I was once really into Marvel and some DC stuff like Batman, and I know DC is much darker (and more violent) then Marvel. But good god! This film was just awful.I watched it with my younger sister and grandma to kill some time in the afternoon. I'm 16 and a lover of dark history and true crime so I don't mind death, destruction and things like that. The 14A rating somewhat assured me I'd be fine.Well, spoiler alert. In the first 2 minutes a bird is killed (I cannot handle animal violence lol). In the first 20 minutes, the characters we were just introduced to drown, have their heads blown in, get shot up brutally, and literally explode. I was looking away for most of these scene in hopes I could actually sleep again. The ""humour"" of the people discussing the squad's mission in the brief room or whatever was completely lost on me. Maybe I have too much humanity but I saw nothing funny about people (even made up ones) struggling through their last breath or screaming out of fear before being completely obliterated. I think I cried after that scene- not because of the beauty of it but because it was so grotesquely gory I couldn't hold myself back.Then we are introduced to our real heroes. A black man is a bad father. A black woman is tough, without humanity and stuck up. A burly white dude is dumb. There's a sassy, sleepy millennial and a depressed guy who hates his mom. Not to mention the shark thing, which is like Groot but with more language. These characters are less characters and more caricatures of stereotypes but whatever. That's not the movie's fault I guess.They drop in, take a rest and are told to kill anyone they meet. They then proceed to murder a whole camp of Democrats in a way that I guess one might find amusing (if that one is Richard Ramirez). More gory, gross violence I was not watching for the most part. A lady with the general from the murdered squad is the only survivor, and she doesn't even flinch as she sees her whole camp slaughtered. A black, burned up body is floating in the water. I think movie directors forget they're supposed to be portraying somewhat real people and that a person cannot just see things like that without being disturbed. I was brought out of the moment here.Then comes the dreaded middle- I find this to be the most boring in superhero movies. Subplots drag on. Sometimes a comic-style label pops up to explain what's happening. The music was odd for the movie. There's a lot more mindless violence and jokes that were completely lost on me. I don't think I laughed once. I can't really remember what was happening during this time but they saved Harley Quinn (she saved herself, I guess a commentary on men being savours to women- big whoop) and captured the weird looking guy. He then leads them to infiltrate the mad scientist lab.I hated the last part. It stressed me out more than anything but it was less gross then the rest of the movie so I guess it was tolerable. The weird guy has a starfish and is experimenting on innocent people and children. The biggest plot twist is that the US was funding the experiment. Again, big whoop because anyone who knows anything about history knows that's more accurate then any sort of fiction. A battle ensues for the card containing this information and ranger Rick or whatever his name was is murdered by John Cena. Then John Cena is murdered by Idris Alba. Before that happens the only joke I can remember occurs.Guy who was driving the bus: is shot multiple times and dies
Poka dot guy: oh Milton is dead
Everyone: who's Milton?Poka dot: you guys don't remember Milton?!?Again lost on me thanks to the senseless violence. The building falls and the starfish is released. I can't stress enough that this is an idiotic idea of a adult movie monster. You could have chosen anything more threatening then a starfish- a squid has the same properties and is at least kind of scary. Nothing is scary about a starfish except the fact that it kills a person (in the movie lol) and uses their body as a host. This immediately reminded me of Alien: Covenant where I also hated this trope because of the grotesque violence.Anyways the starfish escapes and the mean black lady orders them not to go save the city. They do anyways. She gets knocked out before she can blow them up (thank god because that would have made me leave). Long story short rat girl saves the day. Now it's time for the character development. Only few characters survive so the directors could have focused on their arcs to create a satisfying ending. This was not the case.Idris Alba character- his daughter doesn't hate him anymore
Rat girl- remembers her own father who taught her to use rats.Shark guy- still wants to eat people, except now it's the mounds of dead bodies littering the streets.Needless to say, awful, awful, awful. Just so gross and so needless. At least in Guardians of The Galaxy, there was good music and the characters developed. This is like Guardian of the Galaxy written by a 12 year old who's watched Adam Sandler and R rated movies all his life. You will gain nothing from watching this movie except two hours. I don't want to offend anyone but if you actually enjoyed this garbage you should take a course in respecting others or something. I don't know what normal person can sit through hours of violence like that and come out the same.If this is the standards movies are being held to now, good luck to us all. Mindless violence and gore, cheap jokes, stereotypical characters and tropes and 0 thought or passion put in at all. I wish the directors well but I seriously hope this isn't where society is going. This movie is a dumpster filled with rotten fish on fire and stuffed into an atomic bomb. Smells bad and extremely detrimental to human development.

But so many things were stupid, a waste of time, and just borning. The character Bloodshot was good, but he was jsut a chepa recreation of Deadshot from the first movie. Even Harleys character was not up to scratch, she wasn't as devilish as her character truely is. Why put the characters that could have added something, Pete Davidson's character and Weasel, only in the first 5 minutes and then nothing.The introduction was terrible. There was just monolouge, and the audience gets no real sense of the characters before the movie is in full swing. They talk about their background later in the movie, but it feels foced and shallow. The introducitons in the first movie, and the whole start, was much better than this one.'Projust Starfish' was potentially the worst designed and written foe ever. The whole design was childish and boring. They could have done something far more intersting than this.Overall, terrible. Could have maybe been done well if they actually interesting characters had been allowed to shine.

The script and direction of the movie is childish, immature, vapid, and completely lacking any intellect. For the most part the characters are dull, boring, and simply meatheads. Many of the scenes are predictable. The music doesn't make sense for the scenes they are in and are completely out of place. A couple funny lines do exist, but those are few and far between. Mostly the dialogue and banter is witless and humorless. I've liked DC movies as much as Marvel movies, so I don't write this to simply bash on a DC movie. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Let's stop with the Suicide Squad movies and never have James Gunn direct another DC movie. Zach Snyder's Justice League had great character development, a real story, and set up the DC universe for many potential sequels. It would be good to have a sequel for Justice league where they take on DarkSeid.

This movie was hilarious throughout the entire thing, it did not lose its comedic touch as the story got more focused on. The action scenes (and there were a sh- ton) were totally dope. The actors all completely dominated their roles and had a great script. Directing was on point. The R rating holds true to its rating and does not let you down.

Looks like a child drew it and wrote the script. Are you telling me in 2021 this is creative?! It's worst than a movie from the 2000s.Why did they do a 180 on the first film? I tought this will be the best movie 2021 and it's just heart breaking to see what they have done. Crushed dreams, lost time and just disappointing 😞.No, don't understand this high score and how so many people think this is a masterpiece!I'm sorry for the actors and everyone who did work hard to make this film but it's truly the second worst film I saw in my life.PLEASE DO A SUICIDE SQUAD 3 THAT WILL HONOR THE FIRST FILM AND FORGET THIS ONE EVER EXISTED.

2738,jessemaddy,To the point. Watch it.,10,14 August 2021,"It gets a 10 because of the dumb review bombs. Gunn makes it his own right off the bat, separating his movie from the previous suicide squad by introducing new characters, fast deaths, and fun chaos all within the first 20 minutes. Main characters get established later in time, some new, some old. The previous members are separated and used well during their screen time. New members get enough back story and are fleshed out well enough for you to care about. It's R rated fun and brings heart into the story when appropriate. Plus there's no real connection to the poorly established DCEU so you can go in not caring. It's a solid 8 and I hope it's the highest viewed DC movie and breaks HBO max so Warner can stop releasing garbage and embarrassing great source material/characters that are literally handed to them. 🤙",The Suicide Squad

All the actors seem horribly miscast (except Robbie). The action sequences are unoriginal. None of the jokes work. I could care less about any of the characters, or if they live or die. There is no on screen chemistry among any of the cast. The ""bad guy"" is a giant CGI starfish which reminds me of the StayPuff marshmallow man from Ghostbusters and the savior is an emo girl waving a wand that summons rats. The soundtrack was awful. How do you mess up a soundtrack? Pick 8 hits from the seventies and go. There is a ton of gratuitous violence, if that's all you're looking for in a movie, but little else. I have never written a movie review, much less a bad one, ever. I always try to find something good in every movie I see, but this was garbage. Of ALL the DC/Marvel movies this one is the worst.

Other than that, it was absolutely phenomenal, the acting was great, especially for John Cena who isn't traditionally an actor. All the character's actions and motivations are clear and i like how Waller gets some comeuppance. I like most of the Harley Quinn scenes in this more than in the original Suicide Squad, which was somehow rushed and slow at the same time. I like how fresh Peacemaker is, as a hero who will do whatever it takes to make peace unquestionably. I noticed how this movie is a little divisive, but i emplore y'all to take it less seriously, this isn't Shawshank, but i think its a fun movie to watch and is pretty satirical (ex. Reoccurring javelin, reoccurring bird with Savant) it may be a little coincidental at times, but it's usually acknowledged in an entertaining way (ex.

2760,allen-42945,A reflection of our cultural and social dereliction.,1,18 August 2021,"I don't understand in what bottom-up world paying for a ticket to watch this movie can be considered worthwhile. I find it disturbing that so many talented people wasted hundreds of hours of their precious and finite time producing this rubbish.I would pay 10x the amount I paid for my ticket to know what thoughts ran through their heads when they watched the premiere. You know what...forget it. I am pretty sure they just patted each other in the back. If Hollywood had one ounce of self-awareness, everyone in the production of such petty crap would vow to ""never again"" put something as awful as this out. But it won't happen. Worse movies will be made.I don't know if this movie was created to cater to the demands of an increasingly dumb audience, fully committed to embracing only the most base forms of entertainment; or because Hollywood genuinely ran out of ideas, and they stopped trying; or it's part of something more sinister, a reflection of our cultural and social dereliction.Whatever the underlying mechanisms that allow such a movie to be reproduced on thousands of screens worldwide and get away with it (with bags of money) needs to be stopped. The very least that unsatisfied spectators can do is voice their contempt.Death as pornography (even a kindergartener stomping on ants for fun has more awe for their life than this movie), the gore, the dick jokes, the pathetic emotional interludes, the sheer stupidity of it all.And the ""heroes""? The men and women (and shark!) America summoned to eliminate a hostile foreign dictatorship. What are we supposed to...are we supposed to root for them?Maybe I am missing the point. But even anti-heroes have certain humanity, a ""soul"", a redeemable aspect that makes you forget for a second that they are the bad guys. The heroes of this movie are automatons. Who jump into every scene without any fear, compassion, nor any sense of humanity.The only redeemable thing about this movie is that it ends.And the worst is, as of August 2021, this movie has a respectable rating of 7.5 on IMDB, standing toe to toe with such classics as Eastern Promises (2007). A score it doesn't even remotely deserve.If something as trivial as a movie rating is so carefully manipulated what to think then, of more critical affairs?",The Suicide Squad

Cant forget polka dot man, who was also a surprisingly delightful part of the film as well. If you enjoy campy gore + a splash of heroism I recommend you at least try the movie. DCEU hasn't gotten a lot of recognition as of late, but this movie deserves to shine.

You don't even need to see the 2016 Suicide Squad to understand this one. This is less of a sequel and more of a do-over for me, and is what The Suicide Squad should be. This movie 100% EARNS its hard R rating. But if you're not a fan of dark comedy or gory movies, this is NOT the movie for you.It's full of twists and constantly surprised me. I never knew which characters were going to live or die.The movie is bloody and comical, and does a great job of taking all sorts of movie genres, like comedy, dark comedy, and action, and blending it all together successfully. All the jokes hit well for me, and all the characters are likeable and detailed. The movie shines a light on some villains I'm guessing would never get to see the light of day in normal DC movies. The movie gets me to care about every character. It's also well shot, well edited, and the acting is on point.Personally, I loved the positive light it shines on rats. As someone who owned 2 pet rats, the movie really tells how rats are not as awful as most people think.However, I think the pacing is a bit weird, with all the jumping back and forth on the timeline, and I feel like it constantly speeds up and slows down. The bad guys (not including Starro) seem a bit cliché.But all in all, the movie is comical and action filled, and doesn't take itself seriously, which is what makes it so fun. The movie is best when not taken seriously, and excels at being what a adapted comic book movie should be. I 100% recommend this movie.",The Suicide Squad

The plot line is disgustingly shallow and it's generous to even call it a plot 'line'. It's real more of a ball of screwed up, cut off, messy plot strings knotted together.None of the character are likeable, aside from Ratcatcher and Bloodsport. Most of the famous faces we were lured in with were simple 1-2min cameos. Harley Quinn was more or less just borrowed to draw in views, and did literally nothing AT ALL to contribute to the plot. Literally NOTHING. If you took her out, it would be the exact same spare a few cheap Harley Quinn themed fight scenes with more plot irrelevant minor antagonists.And the main villain?

It was worth getting a HBO Max subscription just to watch this movie. More movies like this and DC could easily beat Marvel.Perfect casting choices, especially Harley Quinn. No overly evil or malicious characters, every character is relatable and human. They all have a reason for why they are there and what they are doing.Little to no exposition, character building occurs naturally as the story progresses.The graphics and visual effects rival those of Avengers Infinity War and Endgame.Comedy is on point and very natural. Almost 0 cringe. James Gunn kept it real throughout the movie.Story itself is very believable. Pacing is also on point with a nice mix of action and non action scenes as well as transitions between them. Almost no filler scenes or fluff that makes you want to skip.Overall it truly deserves the 10 stars. In my opinion this was even better than Guardians of the Galaxy (both movies).",The Suicide Squad

In superhero films based on comic books, we like to see more development of characters, twists and most importantly the storyline. Gunn's vision about the movie is just mind blowing there are few scenes to prove this(like 8 mins earlier, harley escapes the palace, rain scene etc.) . In this film there is always a comic book vibe that paces the film. In this 2hr 12 min movie we see development of characters like Bloodsport,King Shark,Polka dot man and there was always a reference given in the movie that how things are going (no comparison but in Endgame we see Hulk with no character development and just a line about how the transformation of him to professor Hulk took place , boring scenes in the time travel part, weak storyline and you can't say that the movie is excellent for just 3-4 scenes it should be overall a good movie) The characters of THE SUICIDE SQUAD were interesting like Peacemaker,King Shark, Polka Dot Man, Bloodsport, Harley Quinn, Colonel Flag which kept us engaged throughout the film. The film is full of blood, violence ,language and awesome music. So overall an excellent comic book movie which is meant to be experienced in cinema.",The Suicide Squad

2814,ninaschaft,They should pay the people who watched this garbage for wasting their time!,1,11 September 2021,"I honestly don't do reviews, because I always see the good parts of a movie. I also don't have high expectations on movies (f. E.: I even kinda like the first movie even though it had its' issues). But this stupid movie made me wanna leave the theatre. Here is why:1. Harley Quinn
As a huge Harley Quinn Fan - especially when played from Margot Robbie - I was sure to at least like her parts in the movie. She was actually the reason I watched it. That was before I knew they turned a wolf into a Chihuahua. You could not see her craziness at all - maybe a little bit when she was kidnapped, but not even that was much. I think Margot Robbie wasn't even allowed to be that crazy cause she would've stolen the show of all the other characters, which brings me to2. The rest of the squad
After the first movie I often read critics about the fact that you didn't learn a lot about the characters history. Well apparently this time they decided to skip this part in total. I don't know what that was, I couldn't bound to any of them, I didn't feel for any of them, except of shark maybe with his food addiction. Rick Flag was also tamed to a puppy.3. Starfish
Do I really have to say something to this garbage?! So much worse than the first movie with Enchantress. She wasn't even that bad comparing to a giant starfish thats creating zombies.4. Super villains?!Last point: They really managed to make super villains to super heroes. Why? That's basically the opposite of what they are. We don't go into the cinema to watch another super hero doing super hero stuff, we want to see villains doing crazy stuff. The fight scenes were basic and you couldn't see anything special about the squad. They were all exchangeable.I am really disappointed. Don't waste your money.",The Suicide Squad

This film is shockingly bad! In fact no, it's not shocking, it's totally expected. It's bad in that way that only DC movies seem to be able to achieve.Seemingly, the main brief of this and all other DC films I've ever seen, seems to be to make a film which is nothing like a Marvel film. And, they've achieved it again with this movie. You see, Marvel films are often good, coherent, entertaining fun, but this movie is none of the above. Nothing about the plot and/or characters makes you care about a single thing that happens in the film. Completely unnecessary ott gore, the only purpose of which seems to be to make sure that you know you're watching DC, not Marvel. Stupid cinematography and production, with silly gimmicky effects, the sort which would appeal to a child, (possibly the reason why the under 18s have rated this film so highly) like that scene where those colourful flowers/butterflies or whatever are coming out of Harley Quinn when she's shooting/killing people.This is not a very good film.

I love it! 10/10.",The Suicide Squad
2831,jeremyjonsson,Another 50/50 'superhero' flick,5,17 October 2021,"This movie has me feeling extremely torn between the two extremes that permeates the movie.On one hand, you have honestly good writing, well timed comedic bits, good action sequences, and other just really well crafted bits, which I will mention a bit later in this review.On the other hand however, you have more of the same problems that a lot of these types of movies have, both from DC and Marvel alike; Incredibly poorly timed and ill-fitted humor, absolutely nonsensical and illogical decisions made by protagonist and antagonist alike, and some really lack-luster action sequences as well.Most of the problems of the movie, however, comes from the absolutely atrocious character of Harley Quinn. I don't know why she's in the movie, whether it's to do with some contract with WB, or they really thought that she could add anything to the movie itself. Now, mind you, I don't think the actor is bad, but the character herself is one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of seeing on the big screen.Early on the movie, Harley is separated from the main group of protagonists and is taken hostage. From there on, we follow a quirky, yet grounded enough group of people (+1) facing the challenges of completing the suicide mission they are given. Along the way, we find out more about the characters and their backstories, and I'll give it to the movie, they are pretty likeable. There's some action, some drama, some comedy, all in a mostly well-blended mix (though IMO, the comedy bits are a bit too much and too frequent, I feel it really clashes and takes away from the gritty and dark themes explored in the movie). But just when the ball really gets rolling, we cut away to the aforementioned Harley. Who, after being captured, is dolled-up, adorned with beautiful clothes and pampered like royalty, has the time of her life, before being captured again and 'tortured' (aka lightly tickled with an electric rod) waltzes through dozens of armed and armored guards, murdering each with a smile on her lips and singing some random song.To summarize;The movie has some very good things going for it, exploring some serious and sensitive topics in a rough, but well-put way, with some good action, dialouge, and VFX to boot. But it's hindered by over-the-top, poorly timed comedy, some completely illogical things the characters do, and the addition of the mary-sue of the century, Harley Quinn, who adds precisely nothing to the movie itself.",The Suicide Squad

DC needs to do right by the fans for once and give Zack Snyder back control of the universe.Overall an utter mess and painful watch from start to finish. For the second most expensive R rated movie ever you'd expect more than what we got, a giant starfish villain...WB your fans deserve so much better.This is hands down the WORST DC movie...ever.

2839,SoDuits,An honest review by an MCU fanboy,8,10 August 2021,"To start off: I enjoyed this movie. Enormously. Was it violent? Yes. Did it use humour to lighten the mood? Yes. Does it show John Cena in tighty whities? YES. Was any of it out of place? Definitely not. We're talking about comic book antagonists who are forced to partake in life threatening missions to shave years off their sentences and who are completely expendable. Will they have the same moral issues as Tony Stark or Peter Parker? Heck no! Not sure what some people expected, but clearly they were waiting to see some WGA award nominated masterpiece and Michael Rooker in a white wig delivering an Oscar worthy performance.This is buttered popcorn certified entertainment for adults. It's a 100x better than its predecessor. It's built up as well as it could be with a cast of dozens. And it delivers on its promise: a superpowered version of a 70's war movie. James Gunn went all out on this one and made it as absurd as could be, but somehow managed to give the movie heart and enough character background to actually care for these people. Not gonna spoil any of it, but if you're into dark humour, R-rated violence, walking sharks with a dad bod, rats and comic books: go see this. You're welcome.",The Suicide Squad

(Watching on HBO Max.)Nope, it's pretty much what I expected. The fact that it got some positive hype made it sting a bit more when they tricked me into watching another Suicide Squad movie.I feel like DC has had so many misses, that if a film doesn't come off as ""bad"" people act like it's award winning.Suicide Squad is a middle of the road action film, that runs LONG, has tons of pacing issues and lots of cringey, juvenile humor that falls flat most of the time.

James Gunn does some amazing work here, same as with Guardians.The whole roster was really well cast, Margot Robbie nails the character of Harley and she steals pretty much every scene she's in. IMO her portrayal is so much better in this than birds of prey, but BOP was another film I couldn't finish. The movie has a lot of hilarious moments too but also some gruesome disturbing scenes but it's to be expected in an R rated super hero movie. Highly recommend this though.

Margot Robbie's performance (the highlight of the previous incarnation of the suicide squad) was lackluster, but still fairly entertaining.Pacing is a bit scattered.I'm ambivalent toward the excessive gore (a la ""The Boys"" or ""Watchmen""), it was funny at moments but felt like filler most of the time. It was so campy and over the top, that it felt like it wasn't supposed to do anything other than make you say gross and/or laugh.Style wise the best part of the flick was Polka Dot Man, without those splashes of color it would have barely clocked in a step above the typical, bleak DC movie color wheel.Overall glad I saw it for free on HBO.

The movie puts up every sterotype on its characters, abuses on gore, and follows a completely expected storyline. I can't believe many reviews I read saying this is the best superhero movie. How can this be compared to GotG, to the Dark Knight (in fact, the trilogy), Marvel's Infinity War saga (in fact, the entire 15 movies storyline), or the Snyder cut of Justice League?

What I do mind is every single character having to throw the f bomb around every other word.The story line was all over the place. It was so bizarre. I was so disappointed with this movie. We were so excited to watch it. While my husband and older son thought it was fine (they mostly loved all the ridiculous amount of violence). They agree it was just okay.Originally I was very upset that Will Smith didn't reprise his role. After seeing this movie, I am so glad he didn't. I would have been disappointed in him had he been in this. While I usually love Idris Elba, I hated his character. He was definitely no Will Smith. He too had a daughter, but he hated her. They tried to make you think she was proud of him, but it felt forced. She hated her dad more than he hated her. I understand these are bad guys, but there was no real redeeming quality in him.

2894,tristandochterman,James Gunn>this film,6,6 August 2021,"James Gunn's directing takes the front seat here. Yet as critics have stated before, this movie feels less like a movie and more like a directorial reel to boast about (IE: look how epic I can make this set piece! Look how cool the characters are! Look at this decapitated head, look at that shark with legs and arms eating people! Ohhh-ahhh). That's the problem with this film: it's all eye candy with little to no substance/character development. NOW, I understand it's a comic book story (for kids...?) but Gunn wanted something much deeper than that alone- eluding to very serious social and political issues that felt forced and awkward juxtaposed in a very silly and slapstick world. I will say however that the movie is extremely confident with every choice it makes, no matter how ridiculous (I'm looking at you, giant Patrick Star). It's better than the first by a mile but when the bar was set so low is that really an accomplishment? I wouldn't say it's great or even good, just mindless entertainment like the millions of other dc/marvel machines already out there.

Especially, the ones that found the humor not only passable but actually enjoyable. I think the movie lacks any kind of subtlety, it basically treats the audience as idiots. There is no need to constantly have characters point out what is happening or what they are feeling. There is a scene where Harley Quinn says she is sad and lonely, then a song plays that basically has those two words as the chorus. There were many attempts at giving out positive messages (like not harming children, not condoning dictatorship, no gender roles, etc.) but they are ruined in my opinion by the constant violence and attempt to make it all pass as satirical. I think this movie is DC's failed attempt to make a Deadpool franchise. But what Deadpool lacks in subtlety it makes up for by not taking itself seriously (its not fighting for any messages and actually makes fun of itself through meta jokes). This movie has a giant monster starfish fight off a group of people wearing onesies (and an anthropomorphic shark) and wants us to take it seriously? Of course not! There is unrequired nudity, swearing, drug abuse and all kinds of violence. So if you are gonna have an R rated movie DC, why not make it actually funny? Why so serious?",The Suicide Squad

Some gore and explosions here and there. Then put a charismatic protagonist to the mix (elba), as well as a wrestler, a character that can only speak a few words and some attractive females and toss some elements from the DC Extended Universe into the mix. Does this sound familiar to you?Well and then, there you go.Don't get me wrong.The movie itself is entertaining but there is nothing outstanding about it and it feels too close to Gunn's Guardians series although Suicide Squad is set in a completely different universe and franchise.Just turn off your brain and try to enjoy the 2h ride...",The Suicide Squad

2929,TheFitzyd2,Putting the Suicide in Squad,9,1 August 2021,"James Gunn is back behind the camera for the first time since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. (2017) and boy does his skill of visual story telling come into play for some exciting action sequences that leave fans wanting more from task force X.Compared to Suicide squad (2015), Gunn's film seems a lot sharper and well thought out, and you can tell this is the film makers vision. The first 10 minutes is an all out blood bath, with new and old characters meeting their fate in a gory fashion, which I felt was a bit gratuitous at times, but you quickly adjust to the bold and violent tone of the film.Like in the 2015 film, Margot Robbie shines as Harley Quinn, further cementing that she is the perfect actress to portray the character, and hopefully she will continue to do so in future projects. Both Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman return and both give excellent performances- Davis' Waller seems to take a bit of a back seat in this film, but she still shines in the scenes she's in. New characters Bloodsport and Peacemaker, played by Idris Elba and John Cena respectively, have great chemistry on screen, and are welcomed additions to the squad. I was surprised with the performance of Cena, he started very cringey, but by the end of the film he turned out to be a menacing antagonist.Portuguese actress Daniela Melchior deserves a lot of praise as she feels like the heart of the film. Although Ratcatcher 2 was an unknown character to many, she gives a brilliant performance and carries a lot of emotional beats throughout the film.The film felt very well paced, blending fun and creative action sequences with a plot that pays homage to old war films like the dirty dozen. The film however is not perfect. I personally felt that the Harley romance with the president felt very forced and seemed to be used as a way to capture Harley; however I won't complain too much as Harley's escape was one of the standout set pieces of the film. Those not accustomed to Gunn's style of humour may not enjoy all the jokes, some definitely landed better than others but overall I'd say the humour was well placed.The Suicide Squad was a brilliant film and DC's best release over the last few years. The film wasn't afraid to live up to the title of the suicide squad, and we finally got to see what happens when Waller blows those bombs at the base of the skull. I hope the writer/director collaborates with Warner bros again.9/10.",The Suicide Squad

It acted to perfection and the dynamic relationships within the team make you care for the characters deeply. Each has their role and each plays it flawlessly. At no point is there a lull in the pace of the film. There is no ""boring build-up"" to a climax because the entire movie is entertaining. I was so engrossed in the characters and their sub-plots that I had almost forgotten about the main villain in the movie half-way through.

2940,suzmac10,"Relentless violence, heavy, a slog",1,16 September 2021,"There's a scene In Pulp Fiction where John Travolta and Samuel Jackson argue in the front seat until they hit a bump and Travolta's gun goes off. It's funny because he didn't intend to blow the young guy's head off in the back seat. Viewers see the full frame by frame of the guy's head bursting open and his brains on the back windshield. It's both a horror and played for laughs. Suicide Squad (2021) is a lot like watching this Pulp Fiction scene played over and over.For me, the movie was heavy, a slog. No interesting set-ups or dialogue. Is part of the fun that they weren't really trying? For villains, a cigar smoking Cuban? A killer starfish? And I got no chuckles out of the shark suit. High point (I thought) was Idris Elba and his daughter screaming at each other in the opening scenes, after that it got less interesting. Viola Davis' natural hair was a nice touch. She had gravitas. The female character fighting her way out of torture, not needing a recue wasn't so funny. I found no sense of fun in the relentless violence. As criticism of America, that we are overfed, clueless brutes tainted by corruption it makes a certain kind of sense. It could be that I'm too sensitive for blood sport.

The story is odd at best and convoluted at worst. The tone is all over the place, and the movie is dotted with wtf moments. Like when Harley Quinn jumps 10ft in the air onto a rooftop. It's not important, it shouldn't be a big deal, but it leaves you saying ""wtf was that?"" and pulls you right out of the scene.

There is absolutely no emotional connection to any of the characters. It has some creative exposition here and there to give some backstory, but it's disjointed and detached, and never goes anywhere. Gunn employs creative title cards, but they make no sense visually. There are attempts to show simultaneous events in subsequent sequences, but there's never any ""I wonder how we'll end up where we left off"" moment.The movie is wickedly violent, and there's lots of expectation subversion, but ultimately none of it means anything or has any effect on the story that follows.

I will stay quiet about the director & producer of the movie, how can you release such a horrendous thing? Even George Clooney as Batman was better.Had to leave the cinema early, because I felt like i was being degraded to a 5 year old's intellect if I continued to watch any of it.I'm surprised my girlfriend hasn't left me yet for dragging her to this awful piece of basura.With a $185 million budget, I can only say, what an utter waste of money.

2972,kimjsheil,James Gunn Saves A Cinematic Universe...Again,9,15 August 2021,"I know I'm in the minority when I say this but 2012's The Avengers was one of the worst superhero films I'd ever seen. No plot, out of place, poorly timed humour, zero character development and a third act that was one trailer shot after another. I truely believed that after that film it was all downhill for the MCU from there, and it seemed as though I was right thanks to the forgettable and underwhelming Ironman 3 and Thor 2.Then along came Guardians of the Galaxy. James Gunn gave us the perfect blend of superhero action and well-timed comedy, and, for me, it saved the MCU. I was now invested in the franchise and excited for future films again. Not even the abysmal Age of Ultron could kill my enthusiasm for the MCU. Gunn saved the MCU, and he did it by using characters that barely anyone outside of comic book fandom had even heard of. I mean, he made us care deeply for a raccoon and a tree.The DCEU never really had the same success with audience as the MCU, and it wasn't until Wonder Woman that a film in the series actually had overwhelming positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. But WB had really dropped the ball with the DCEU. Wonder Woman, Shazam and the Snyder Cut were the only films of the series that were great, everything else being underwhelming. WB didn't seem to understand how to make a cinematic universe to rival Marvel/Disney's. From hiring abusive hack directors to take over and ruin projects with bad writing, poorly-times humour and creepy boob gags that made the made the female lead uncomfortable to insisting on keeping certain cast members in roles that they aren't suited for despite a petition with over a million signatures to have them removed, the future of the DCEU seemed bleak.Then along comes James Gunn and another film universe is saved!Like Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad is the perfect blend of superhero action and humour, and again he has achieved this by using mostly unknown characters.This Suicide Squad team is amazing. Our main protagonist, Bloodsport, is an engaging character who is blackmailed into going on this mission to prevent his estranged daughter from winding up in the most dangerous prison in country. He is joined by the uber-patriot, Peacekeeper, who instantly becomes a fierce rival, the adorable but deadly King Shark, and the highly underestimated members, Polkadot Man and Ratcatcher 2, along the way being joined by Rick Flag and Harley Quinn.Although characters like Captain Boomerang, Savant and TDK get less screen time then they deserve, the main cast are brilliant and they have so much chemistry together. Idris Elba and John Cena work so well off of each other, Margot Robbie yet again nails it as Harley Quinn, Peter Capaldi does a fantastic job as a villain with Thinker, Viola Davis delivers an even better performance as Amanda Waller than last time, King Shark gives us both some of the best kills, funniest lines and the most wholesome moments, but David Dastmalchian and Daniela Melchior steal the show as Polkadot Man and Ratcatcher 2. The Suicide Squad gives these extremely minor comic book characters tragic backstories and well written character arcs, as well as cool abilities that wind up being extremely helpful for the mission.James Gunn has proven yet again that he is the perfect person to make comic book movies. He knows exactly what he is doing. Furthermore, he was given so much creative freedom on this project and it shows. There are so many highly stylistic moment through the film that I absolutely loved. Even better was the soundtrack. You can always count on Gunn to have the best music in his films. On top of that, much like what he did with a raccoon and tree, Gunn made us root for a rat and a shark-man.This is definitely one of the best movies of the year. Yeah, it probably won't get an Oscar nomination but it was so much fun, over-the-top, gory, violent and yet gave us some truely touching moments, especially the flashbacks between Ratcatcher 2 and her father, and King Shark playing with some ""new friends"" in an aquarium.Thank you, Mr Gunn, for making me invested again in not one by two cinematic universes. Perhaps Gunn should have a shot in making an entry for WB/Legendary's Monsterverse. In fact, if Universal wants to try their luck with their Dark Universe again, Gunn could give us a fun and gory monster flick.",The Suicide Squad

Yes, but little more",6,9 August 2021,"It's no debate James Gunn wins the title of best SS movie (so far) but I'd hardly consider this film ""one of the best comic book/superhero movies"" as some of the others here have claimed. Ignore anything you see that mentions this movie and academy awards in the same sentence. Let's start with the pros.Positives:The R rating was a great call and allows for most of the films better moments, the graphic violence and language just allows for a much more authentic action movie and fortunately I think this movie will contribute to studios being more comfortable with giving mainstream comic book movies that hard R they really should have.Weasel. He was an easy top 3 character and he has 4 mins screen time (maybe)Fans of earlier James Gunn will notice some parallels in The Suicide Squad to his Slither (2006), and this did feel like Jame's movie which is nice to see WB learned their lesson it would seem. (Just give us the Ayer version already look how it worked with Syndercut)Cons:Comedy was a generous 50/50. Some genuine laugh out loud moments but repetitive and childish more often than not. (That Norman Bates line was golden though)Bloodsport was a recycled Deadshot. At least try and make him original? A no nonsense, insanely accurate military man with some estranged daughter issues that lead him into joining the squad (sigh) I'll say Idris's performance topped Will Smith's but Will was the highlight of Ayer's SS it should be said.Amanda Waller wasn't written well and I question her role going forward in the DCEU honestly.King Shark was a dud character. Giggled a couple times but his presence felt silly.Harley Quinn was the only standout as being being significantly more enjoyable in Ayer's Suicide Squad, I can't look at her anymore without thinking of WB's agenda and how she's used as a marketing tool. She's way too OP for the limitations of her character.Won't be catching it again soon but it's not 'bad' by any means, just be weary of the 8-10 reviews or you may feel disappointed as I was. Will give it a rewatch and see how things change over time but for now I'd rank it slightly below Deadpool? Cheers if you read this far!",The Suicide Squad

Though all characters were good, but the characters other than Harley which I really liked most were King Shark and Peacemaker, felt the commitment of Peacemaker, the way he killed Flag with a sorrow heart, I did find this Cena best performance, he really played that role good, and loved the King Shark innocense throughout the movie, loved the scene where King shark felt sad and in tears when his new fish friends betrayed and attacked him, he was in loneliness throughout the movie but later find his true friends*What I didn't like*Somehow I didn't like its climax a much, way of starro death, could have been better, the way movie killed so many characters in its starting, I felt it was too early to kill characters without showing their full capabilities, although it was to show that any character can be killed, but should have been given atleast Boomerang a perfect death.",The Suicide Squad

As I've been experiencing bunch of underwhelming and disposable superhero movies lately this almost like sparked my brain little bit. (Maybe I will enjoy a DECENT superhero movie again!?)And it was enjoyable. Characters had depth and they did meaningful actions which were not braindead. Simply I cared about what decisions the characters made and I was carried away how some of the jokes were actually funny. The chemistry between the squad felt also believeable and world building made sense lots of times. But then the plot let me baffled quite often and the ridiculuos plotarmor with the characters felt really forced (like it seems to be with many titles nowadays) to create these ""cool"" scenes. A scene should make sense more than look cool. I did not mind the limited nature of the worldbuilding --- not having dc superheroes there made actually little bit sense when you take into consideration the black ops feel of the mission.

Let's see how much gore and how many f-bombs we can throw in for shock value. Awful plot, bad acting, (even though I still like Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn), and bad CG. This was so much worse than the first Suicide Squad featuring Will Smith. I gave that movie 6/10 stars. I still don't know if this was a reboot, a prequel, or a sequel (probably a reboot). Just don't waste your time on it. Glad I have someone's HBO Max subscription so I did not have to pay for this garbage.Why does this have a 7.4 rating as of 8/27/2021?!?",The Suicide Squad

But it turned out to be the best superhero movie/comic book adaptation I've seen lately.A breath of fresh air after years of bland producer movies directed by an A. I.

You could tell who was going to die just by the lack of coverage of certain characters before the film even came out. Lots of flat jokes. Stand outs were Ratcatcher , King Shark and John Cena was damn funny. Movie would have been much better and tighter without the inclusion of Harley Quinn, her Character served no purpose, her scenes were just repeats from the other movies she was unfunny and she was overpowered. People seem to not realise thae the character does not have super powers, never did, but she is included just to sell more Harley Quinn products to her fan base. Character deaths where you are supposed to feel something are unmoving, I just didn't care. Gunn didn't improve on the first SS movie he just added a dull, unfunny companion with lots of gore and cursing.",The Suicide Squad

The characters are by-and-large very likeable and the whole thing just about manages to hold their collective motivations, and the breakneck turns of plot, together.The set pieces are completely insane- brilliantly realised by a constant barrage of eye-popping special effects. The soundtrack stands in perfect parallel to the pictures- huge pop needle drops, cult folk rock, eery space-like lullabies and Spanish guitar ballads that are dripping with cool and charm. Somehow James Gunn has woven all of the multi-coloured elements of this movie together and the result is like a silken rainbow tapestry of Nyan cat, which you just can't take your eyes off.Don't expect too much from this movie, but too much is exactly what you'll get.",The Suicide Squad

It has 1 million plotholes, characters are forgettable, villian is a joke. It does not and will not fit in the current DCEU. Its just a forgettable attempt of a movie made by a way too overrated James Gunn. They advertise his work like he is some kind of misunderstood genious, but in reality people just like it because the first one was also utter garbage, however this is garbage made by someone who was in the cahoots with Marvel, and yes , evryone must adore everything Marvel.

I'd actually say that with better villains and motives, and fewer stupid CGI gimmicks and hideous mutilation, it would have been a pretty good movie.

No. It was difficult to get through the first 20 minutes, as everything was messy. Since the very first moments, we already had to say goodbye to some main characters. This was something new, and I don't know if I like this or not. You are tensed whenever a fight scene starts, as you don't know who will die next. But, it's something new, so let's give it a chance. However, there were minor moments that I noticed, some jokes that seemed too dull for me, but that's me and my taste.All in all nothing bad about the film, nothing superb either. The first suicide squad was also not bad for me. If you ask me which one is good, I'd say both feel on the same level for me. It really depends on what you prefer. More blood? More killing? Then this one is definitely for you. If you want something less bloody and more chill with good soundtracks, the first one is better.BUT!

So it's going to be that kind of movie"". His death within the first several minutes, however, brought slight hope back to my expectations. Unfortunately, this was quickly diminished as poor dialogue and humor was well and alive; the main culprit being John Cena. I am hoping that this script will make 13 year old boys chuckle, after all, laughter is such a wonderful thing. I just did not get to experience it this time around. But I digress.A challenge I faced while viewing this film was the overall plot. If you would have told me this movie was 4 hours long, I would have certainly believed you. Twice did my father and I glance at one another as we began to rise in unison from the sofa, only to find that the movie was in fact not over. If such a thing as purgatory does exist, I would imagine this movie series to be an excellent candidate to play on repeat for all eternity. With that said, remember to 'love thy neighbor'. I know I certainly will. But I digress once more.As for the character development and their interactions with one another, I was again mostly let down. I looked to my father a few times to share maybe some insight on what we were seeing, only to find that it was me who was only seeing, as he was unconscious for a good deal of the movie. I will say, however, that it is always nice to see a transition from the ex con who was once a danger to society, finally turn into the hero that was always within.

Mark Cena's is a caricature of American Imperialism, but instead of being a good caricature, like those in Team America, it falls flat and comes off as preachy writing.I swear every plot twist came from one of the producer's thirteen-year-old sons saying, ""It would be really cool if..."".It's Saw meets Archer, but far dumber.

I enjoyed the first avengers and thought some bits of guardians of the galaxy were okay (think was more because i enjoyed the song featured). But i wouldn't give neither of those films above a six. The only super hero movies I would say I'm a fan of is the dark night trilogy.But this film is amazing in my opinion. I have never watched the first one and was almost dragged to the cinema to watch it. I am so happy i didn't bail. Within the first 10 minutes i was gripped.This movie was funny (not like mcu humour, actually funny), stylistic action scenes (similar to kill bill quality), moments of upset and heartwarming moments. I assumed John Cena would be terrible but he actually played the role of peacemaker very well.I would recommend this film to anyone. I think it is probably the most fun i have had watching a film in the cinema.",The Suicide Squad

3070,connorraithby,JAMES GUNN AT HIS BEST!!!,9,31 July 2021,"When i first heard abut this movie, and heard character names such as, ""Polka Dot Man"" and ""TDK"" i thought that this would be a flop. Knowing how Warner Bros have interfered with previous directors visions and story telling, to try and copy marvel, i had serious doubts about this film. The trailers did interest me, hence why i wanted to book tickets to see it. Well...this film does not disappoint.I enjoyed this film from beginning to end. A fantastic mixture of both. Humour, Violence and Emotion. James Gunn has written a heartfelt and epic story, including some of the weirdest and most peculiar characters from the DC Comics. Each one has their own story arc, their best moments, and are just damn right awesome! Again, Jame Gunn uses such a wide range of music choice to suit each scene, each one working perfectly. The cinematography is most of the scenes were visually stunning to watch on the big screen, and the costume designs were fantastic! Astounding visual and practical effects used throughout the film made you feel part of the story.In conclusion, James Gunn has managed to use the most bland and uninteresting comic characters, and create a masterpiece. A film that lives up to its R rating and hype. Would highly recommend seeing this.",The Suicide Squad

3073,befuzin,"Inoffensive, bland and forgettable.",5,8 August 2021,"The man behind the Farscape remakes brings us the movie meant to salvage the name ""Suicide Squad"" after its previous traumatic showing. What we get is Suicide Squad the musical that bores us with predictability, MTV action and the complete and utter pointlessness of hiring quality actors like Idris Elba, Peter Capaldi etc. When the director has no intent of utilizing their abilities.The story is not worth mentioning since it's only function is to serve as a backdrop for the directors ""creativity"" (aka Joss Whedon level comedy and assaults on the senses through ""action"").That said, the movie is competently made from a technical standpoint and delivers a few chuckles here and there. Although those chuckles might be difficult to pick up on among all the cringe.In conclusion I give the movie a score of 4/10, but the sheer audacity of bringing back cinemas queen of stupidity: Amanda Waller, forces me to give the movie another point for a total of 5/10 - another forgettable comic book movie.",The Suicide Squad

This one made me so attached to all this team of anti-heros. And in the end, despite some of these characters seeming ridiculous with their very unique skills, they all actually meant something, symbolized our imperfections as human beings. I loved the moral of this movie too: rats are small and hated by most people but can change the world/ smaller can win... it was actually a clever movie full of metaphors!Haley symbolizes the princess who doesn't need saving and I just loved how she is the strongest character of all despite her personality traits seeming too ""naive and innocent"".Except for the cleverness of the characters, I really laughed at loud throughout the movie and was amazed by some of the images: the cartoonesque/disney-like scene with Haley made me scream with pleasure. I also loved when they tried to film in the reflexion of water or a helmet. You could see intentional effort in the filming and the montage. This made the movie never dull and full of colors.Finally, the music choice is once again so good that I had to add it to my playlist and made me want to jump in the scene to dance with the characters and fight in a choreography.So, you understood. I really don't understand the comments who thought this movie ridiculous and dumb. I would watch a dozen times still notice new things that make this movie awesome.Vive les rats!

3077,johncarlin-08347,Not great,4,16 August 2021,"I am very selective of which comic book movies I watch as the vast majority of them have the exact same storyline yet with a different superhero wedged in.The last comic movie I watched was Joker - which was a breathe of fresh air. Brilliant.I decided to give this a go due to James Gunn and the great reviews. I expected something fresh like when Guardians Vol 1 first landed, but boy was it disappointing. The first 20 minutes were funny and there were enough plot turns to keep things interesting... but then its just slowed right down, plodding along for the next hour or so. The flair with which the movie started pretty much disappeared and any other stylistic elements become repetitive and overused. AND YET AGAIN theres a final 30 minute sequence of SMASH, BANG, WALLOP that just follows the well worn-out formula of every other movie. For the amount of money and talent used to produce these movies you would hope someone could come up with something slightly more original. It astounds me to see huge box office takings and top reviews movies like these generate. It just means they'll fire another formulaic replica at us again soon. Sigh.",The Suicide Squad
3078,Niclas95,A masterclass in making an outrageous movie that still delivers heart and character,8,16 August 2021,"I would say NO SPOILERS but there might be light spoilers if you are a bit sensitive to that.General thoughts -What an amazing way to showcase the talents of James Gunn. The Suicide Squad (2021) seems to be the perfect outlet for James Gunn to spread his wings and create a universe that respects what came before yet strays so far away from its predecessor, Suicide Squad (2016). This movie succeeds in almost every aspect it sets out to accomplish and it manages to course correct the trainwreck that was Suicide Squad (2016) by keeping what worked (Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller) and bringing in a whole new set of weird and creative characters. On paper this movie should not work with characters like Nanaue/King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), Polka-Dot Man (Da-vid Dastmalchian) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) just to name a few, but James Gunn has once again done what he did with Guardians of the Galaxy and taken these incredibly weird, some of them non-human and generally unknown characters and given them heart, humanity and a very clear character arc, which to me is the very biggest strength of the movie. It should also be mentioned that this might be one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I have seen in the cinema, period.Plot -Without getting into spoilers, I can say that I found the plot almost irrelevant to the enjoyment of the movie, as it just serves as a tool to showcase this amazing ensemble cast and their characters individual story arcs, which I will get into below. If I had to give some criticism to the movie it would probably be the simplicity of the plot and the way that the Harley Quinn story felt very separate to the rest of the film. But then again it can be argued that even though the events in the film takes place over short period and the story doesn't seem to go anywhere before the last 20-30 minutes, there is creative use of flashbacks and most importantly the screen time is used to showcase this group of complex characters coming together and evolving with each individual getting their own time in the spotlight. I also have to comment on the villain story where we were given 2 sets of villains one of them took up most of the movie on the villain side and I found their story a bit too ""one note"" and their motivation seemed to be the classic ""world domination"" that we have seen a thousand times before. I did however like the way their story concluded as I found it refreshing. Without getting into spoiler territory I can say that the second villain was way more fleshed out and had a very satisfying story arc.Characters -It seems as though James Gunn wanted to challenge himself in taking one overly ""comic-book"" character after the next with the intention of giving them a carefully thought-out background and setting them in a situation where they would have to face their demons and grow. I can literally highlight every single character from this movie and talk in depth about how impressed I was with the way they were brought to life. But if I had to highlight a few that impressed me the most, it would definitely be characters like Ratcatcher 2, whom I even forgot was in the movie, as she actually functioned as the heart of the movie and was the central character in almost every major story moment or scene. The way James Gunn gave her a heartfelt and truly inspiring backstory to the way she ends up in the movie is truly amazing. There are also characters like King Shark whom I thought would only be there to serve as a deliverer of punchlines and r-rated action scenes and yet they managed to make him one of the movies most endearing characters and it makes you feel sorry for this mass-murdering human-like shark creature...amazing. But then again in 2014 James Gunn made me cry (spoilers for Guardians of the Galaxy) over the sacrifice of a humanoid tree, so it shouldn't surprise me.Conclusion -I don't think I would change a single frame of this movie and it definitely finds itself on my top 10 favorite comic book movies ever. I'm going to give it an 8,5/10. If only the secondary villains were more fleshed out, it would probably have been higher and Harley Quinn's story arc did sometimes feel like a totally different movie, though one that admittedly entertained me. I am truly excited to see the next James Gunn project with Guardians of the Galaxy: Holiday Special and 3. I also hope to see more R-rated stuff from him in the future.",The Suicide Squad
3079,lgajordyn,Second half gets better,6,9 August 2021,"I admit I almost turned this off after 30 minutes. I didn't like Weasel and a lot of the comedic elements fell flat on its face. I kept wondering, why did they remake this? At least the 2016 movie had a solid storyline. I hated Jared Leto's Joker but Harley Quinn shined in her role. This seemed more jumbled and over the top violent and just about everyone died in the first wave on the beach. After the second soldiers went in, I started liking the characters. Ratcatcher 2, King Shark and Bloodsport were awesome! I loved the interplay between them and even Polka Dot Man had his moments.

James Gunn is written all over each scene throughout the film as he engages you with non stop violence and gore. Not to mention the heart felt scenes, Gunn is able to rip your heart out and crush it as he attaches you so well to the characters he's developed. I was on my edge of my seat the entire time as shivers ran down my spine viewing the gut wrenching horror of these deaths. I didn't know who would die next. BloodSport, Harley, Pokadot man and Ratcatcher II are absolute standouts in the film as they have such emotional and gravitational quirks. Each are different in their own stylistic ways. I was pleasantly surprised with John Cenas peace Maker. He is genuinely an underrated actor and I found he shines well in this film. As one of the most in your face films I've ever seen, this is possibly in my top five favourite films of all time. Even the soundtrack is impeccable, I can't wait to see it again.

3089,monkishelf,Gave It a '10' to Spite Fans of the Original,10,18 August 2021,"So yeah, title say's it all. I gave this movie a 10/10, not because it deserves a solid 10, but because of all the airhead reviews giving this a 1/10 and exclaiming that the original movie was superior.What I think it deserves? A solid 7.5. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this film. The plot was decent and the characters worked fairly synergistically with each other. I enjoyed the competitive dynamic between Edris and Cena. They really carried the film during the middle and end. Harley's character was charming as ever, but I felt it was all a little forced and out of character during the whole -intimate- scene.The climax from the assault on Jotunheim to the very end was easily the best and most memorable part of the production. Every character really shone through at this moment, especially Milton. Loved that guy.Honestly though, it wasn't a bad film and if you're interested in DC comics - I think it deserves your attention. That being said, if you're not interested in DC comics (or if you are and happen to be a crybaby starfish) recognize that this is a movie about murderous rampaging villains, that are given a second chance at life by doing what they do best: murderous rampage.

And I went into it, expecting it to be a good movie.Sure, maybe WB screwed the pooch on that one, and the director really did have a cohesive vision with the original... but that's not what I watched. What I watched was an unapologetically awful turd of a film. Nothing about it felt like I was watching a movie about comic book villains.. characters that go toe-to-toe with some of the DC worlds strongest heroes. Honestly, there was more militant rambo combat action in the original than there was anything to do with the actual villains and their abilities... and the pacing.. god the pacing and editing was soo bad. Scenes jump from one pivotal moment to the next with NO buildup or understanding of how you got there.If you know literally anything about cinematography, writing and film then you understand how much of a shit show the original Suicide Squad was

3090,ThePeacefulCucumber,"A Good Movie, Overrated, and with Essential Directing Flaws",6,8 August 2021,"I went into the theaters not expecting much, with how the last suicide squad movie turned out, but to my surprise I enjoyed the movie very much. The movie is funny and the action is fun. However I think that the movie lacked some essential parts of good directing.There were almost no backstories, there was only a couple of lines depicting the backstories for the Peacemaker (John Cena), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and the Polka Dot man (David Dastmalchian).The only character that gets an actual backstory that we, the audience, can feel and experience through flashbacks, is Ratcatcher (Daniela Melchior). But even then the backstory is very thin and shallow and is directed in such a way that we would have no emotional connection to her. Also, it was very short, even if it was the emotional connection kind of directing, we wouldn't have time to connect with her. In Kill Bill: Vol. 1, for about 10 whole minutes, we gain knowledge and the background of O Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), and she is the villain in that movie, so I think it is more than appropriate to make a backstory about one of the main protagonists more captivating and important.In the scene in which Javelin (Flula Borg) is dying and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) was sat over his body, again, I felt no emotional connection to either Harley Quinn nor Javelin. It is very clear to me that the scene was meant to be half comedic and it was not supposed to be the kind of scene to make us cry or even feel bad for either of the characters, but just because it was not, does not mean it should not be. I would argue that this scene needs to be sad and emotional. Yes, at the moment of the scene we have no connection to the characters, so James Gunn could have extended the beginning so that we wouldTowards the end of the movie, when Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), is about to kill the suicide squad because they were doing the right thing and trying to save Corto-Maltesein lives, some random woman hits her on the head from behind and knocks her unconscious. Personally, I have a problem with that. We don't know who she is nor why she is doing what she is doing.A suggestion; all throughout the movie we see about
15 flashbacks of five minute each where we see the backstory of that woman, of how when she was a child, her parents died because of a coverup made by the US government, and she vowed to raise through the ranks to do better and save people. We would see the flashbacks in the movie and it would make no sense why they are there, because the woman has nothing to do with the other part of the plot, up until a flashback that we see that it is today, the day of the knockout, and how she got there and then we see her knockout Amanda Waller. Then it would be so much more meaningful than just a random person knocking Amanda Waller out.",The Suicide Squad

The back and forth in the storyline was unnecessary, and they killed people off for the sake of killing them off! At least in the first Suicide Squad El Diablo sacrificed himself- way more meaningful death. After they killed practically EVERYONE in the first 10 mins for no reason other than shock value, the only other death that meant something was Flagg's!
