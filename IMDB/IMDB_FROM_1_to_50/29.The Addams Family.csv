0,MartinHafer,NOT to be confused with the television Addams Family.,6,26 October 2020,"There really is not definitive ""Addams Family"" when it comes to films and TV. This is because the Charles Addams cartoons on which they have been based really were not originally intended to be anything other than single panel comics. They were not fleshed out stories about the family...that began with 1964's ""The Addams Family"" television show. But this film version really is its own creation...not cute or nice like the television show at all. In this case, the family is actually homicidal...as they are its sequel. Because of this, I strongly recommend you don't let younger kids watch it...it's NOT kid-friendly...at least not for younger ones. And, if you do let them watch, please watch it with them, as the films never were intended for young kids and they are NOT cute and cuddly like the original TV incarnation. No, they are edgier and more dangerous in the movies. Well made but also not exactly comedies in the traditional sense.",The Addams Family
1,TheLittleSongbird,Great fun from the Addams Family!,9,26 March 2009,"Well, I finally managed to write a review on this, and I have to say, I like this a lot. I do think Values is marginally better, but both are solid entertainment, two good examples of films, driven by character not plot(though there was a very good one in both films). Like Values, the rating is too low, why? My only criticism, is that I don't like the rap song over the end credits at all. Apart from that, it had spirited direction, great incidental music, great performances, and a gem of a black humour filled script.The plot is simple but grabs the attention of adults, as young children might not understand it. The script is witty, dark and very funny, something that Reunion forgot to add to the proceedings. Barry Sonnenfield directs with spirit and enthusiasm, but it's the performances that I was most impressed with.Raul Julia and Angelica Huston were perfect as Gomez and Morticia, and I was sure that Tim Curry and Daryl Hannah would have been, had they a half-decent script and director to work with.(alas!) Christopher Lloyd was great fun as Fester, but the performance of Christina Ricci steals the film. Everyone else deserves a mention.In conclusion, a well-done and inventive film, with a 9/10 from me!

2,Leofwine_draca,"Brash, noisy nonsense",4,1 September 2015,"I remember watching THE ADDAMS FAMILY as a kid and not being overly impressed with it even then: I preferred the more subtle ghoulish humour of the original '60s TV series. Watching the film again as an adult, I can see that time has not been kind to this outing, with the endless dated early '90s effects work and quickly tiring madcap pace.It's as if the writers have taken the family members from the original show and plonked them into the middle of a quick-fire comedy. Everything is noisy, brash and over-the-top, and the likes of Raul Julia are frankly quite embarrassing with their endless scenery chewing which grates on the viewer before long. Only Christopher Lloyd and Christina Ricci prove a real fit for their parts, and funnily enough they get all the best gags and one-liners.Although the overly complicated script has to take its share of responsibility, I think Barry Sonnenfeld's tiresome direction is to blame; remember that this guy is the king of FX-heavy comedies (he later made MEN IN BLACK). Had things been dialled down and delivered in a more mannered and focused way I probably would have enjoyed this a great deal more.",The Addams Family
3,SnoopyStyle,Great macabre family,7,13 October 2013,"The Addams are an unique wealthy macabre family. Their corrupted lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) owns money to a loan shark. Together they plot to inject a fake Uncle Fester Addams (Christopher Lloyd) into the family so he could search for the family treasure of gold Doubloons.Barry Sonnenfeld has created a well made Gothic Addams world. The family is played by Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, and Christina Ricci as young Wednesday Addams. This is mostly amusing especially what Wednesday keep doing to Pugsley. All the performers are wonderful. They have all the fun creating these amazing characters. The whole setup is incredibly inventive. The story itself is a bit of a grind. It would be better for the Family to clash more with the 'normal' suburban life. The regular jobs are funny. The kids should wreck havoc on regular school. That's the better sweet spot.",The Addams Family
4,Horst_In_Translation,Too much over the top eventually,4,7 November 2016,"""The Addams Family"" is an American 95-minute movie from 1991, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. The director is Barry Sonnenfeld and the characters are based on the work of Charles Addams. This movie was nominated for an Oscar in the costume category where it lost to Bugsy and Anjelica Huston was nominated for a Golden Globe that she lost to Bette Midler. So you already hear that Oscar winner Huston is in here, but there are more known names such as Christopher Lloyd (BttF), the late Raul Julia or the very young Christina Ricci, which means the cast is pretty exquisite. But no matter how colorfully they play their roles, this film is eventually just all about styles, costumes and sets as well as makeup really. It's about a family of undead and we see them during their everyday life as well as during their not so everyday life. There are many references to torture and murder in here, but it is all pretty funny and light. This film is a comedy fantasy movie and there is no intention from anybody to make this look like a horror film despite the protagonists.In my opinion, this was not really a good watch. Maybe it was okay by the standards back then, but I must say by today's standards the film has not aged well at all. This refers to the story mostly that I just did not find interesting or entertaining at all. It all felt very gimmicky and just one scene follows the next in which the filmmakers tried to entertain the audience in a slightly shocking fashion, but there is no coherent plot in this movie despite the filmmakers trying pretty hard sometimes to achieve such. They weren't successful. Here and there, there was a somewhat memorable line (quote) or scene, but it was just not enough, neither in terms of quality, not in terms of quantity. Addams died a couple years before this film came out, but I somehow don't feel he really would have appreciated the outcome here. It is fairly underwhelming in my opinion. It is not a complete failure by any means, but looking at how popular and known the film's title still is today and how the characters are somewhat known too (especially Ricci's and Huston's), I was very unimpressed. The comedy also becomes repetitive fairly quickly. Thumbs down from me and I do not recommend the watch.",The Addams Family
5,mark.waltz,"Creepy characters you can't help but love in spite of their ""dark"" side.",7,19 May 2015,"Certainly there are going to be those who take this comic variation on ""Tales From the Darkside"" as something that was influenced by the devil with its irreverent take on family structure and focus on characters who obviously seem to take great pleasure in following some seemingly morbid characteristics. Yes, they are indeed absolutely ookie, with gorgeous mom Morticia (that's Anjelica Huston, not Cher...), extremely sexy dad Gomez (a very dreamy Raul Julia), the witch-like Grandma (Judith Malina), portly Pugsly (Jimmy Workman) and the very dour Wednesday (a delightful Christina Ricci) not the Brady Bunch, not the Cunninghams, not the Cleavers, and very far even from the Munsters. Gomez has been mourning the disappearance of his brother Fester (which means ""to rot"") for years, and every year like clockwork on the anniversary of his disappearance, they do a séance to try and find out where he is. Thanks to some con-artist clients of the family attorney (Dan Heydara), ""Fester"" does show up during the séance, actually the son of a hard-hearted con-artist (a very funny Elizabeth Wilson). She pretends to be his psychiatrist, having ""discovered"" him in the midst of the Bermuda triangle. Cynical Wednesday is suspicious, and this eventually leads to the Addams being removed from their own home so ""Fester"" and mommie dearest can find out where the family fortune is being hidden.Lavishly filmed with fun special effects and gorgeously morbid art direction, the film version of the famous comic strip and 1960's T.V. series is perfectly cast. It seems that nobody could replaced Carolyn Jones as the luscious Morticia, but Ms. Huston does a phenomenal job and is obviously having a ton of fun, especially after being haggard as an evil witch just a few years earlier. Raul Julia is not as tongue-in-cheek as John Astin was, but his Gomez is certainly unforgettable with an undeniable sex appeal. Anjelica and Raul have amazing chemistry, making it clear that this morbidly old married couple are very much in love. Those who saw Raul in the original Broadway cast of ""Nine"" will agree that after playing that role, nobody else could have done this role justice.Some people are going to confuse Dana Ivey, the talented stage actress who plays Heydara's neglected wife Margaret Alford, with the legendary Maggie Smith as they do have similar facial features. Lots of old friends truly thought Ivey's character in ""The Color Purple"" was Maggie Smith until I pointed out her name in the credits. What happens to her character here is truly bizarre, but in a magnificently funny way. Carel Struycken is an amusing Lurch, but unfortunately never gets to say Ted Cassidy's famous line, ""You Rang?"", only being silent with the exception of a few grunts when things don't seem right to him. Take the satanic references with a grain of salt or you might find yourself as crazy and ookie as the bizarre characters (both dead and alive) here. The film also features a magnificent party sequence which utilizes a classic movie tradition of switching from two characters dancing alone to the switch to the party in full swing. When Julia and Lloyd break into ""The Mamushka"", the film becomes absolutely delightful. There's really nothing offensive in the things the Addams family does. It's just all silly fun, and if you watch it with that in mind, you won't need to ""cleanse"" yourself afterwords with a hot shower.",The Addams Family
6,kosmasp,One of many,8,28 October 2021,"The Addams Family - depending on when you have grown up, there might be another version of this that you are more familiar than this. Most recent ones have been animated and a new one is in the pipeline as they say, with Rob Zombie at the helm (and of course his wife, which has become grounds for many jokes/memes recently) - and that new one may be the reason this is quite popular right now. Or the fact it is availabel to watch for free on a streaming service.All that aside, what a wonderful cast put together. And what fine effects for the 90s for sure. And that theme music ... might bring some memories back. Even if not, it is so catchy you'll be on it before you know it. Some horror elements and even some sexual themes may be a bit too much for some kids, but I don't think they'll catch on to most of the underlying things (meant for adults watching anyway).Funny throughout with certain morbid tendencies, this can be a lot of fun, visually speaking and in terms of acting.",The Addams Family
7,gavin6942,This Is How It Should Be Done,7,25 October 2009,"The Addams Family has had a death... Fester Addams. But lo and behold, their lawyer knows a man who resembles Fester and if he passes the impostor off, could gain access to the family vault, full of treasures untold. But can the fake Fester survive the family's maniacal games? I don't have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams Family. So, I can't make an educated comparison. However, this film excels in every way: macabre, humorous and just plain eccentrically absurd. The casting is also amazing... Raul Julia in the performance of his career, and Christopher Lloyd in a very offebeat role even for him.This was a breakout performance for Christina Ricci (playing Wednesday Addams). Sure, it possibly typecast her into weird roles (""Casper"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Pumpkin"") but this is, beyond a doubt, where she fits. She can do drama (""Monster"", ""Black Snake Moan"") but will always be America's goth girl.This film's dark humor is family appropriate -- cartoon violence, no nudity and marginal language. They simply do not make films like this anymore. Full credit must be given to the writer and director for bringing this family to life in a way that just cannot be repeated. Well, aside from the sequel.",The Addams Family
8,lee_eisenberg,They're funny and they're zany...,10,16 September 2005,"So here it is: a feature look into the lives of the ghoulish family that bears the name of their creator. In this case, Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) are raising their family, when long lost Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) rejoins the family. But there may be other people who want the Addams' house.Most people don't seem to realize that ""The Addams Family"" actually had some social commentary: everyone outside the Addams house considers them weird because they live differently, but they're actually a very loving family. As it was, ""The Addams Family"" was always better than ""The Munsters"" (cleverer and not as silly). But anyway, this is the feature, and it's one of the few TV-to-movie adaptations that got it right.",The Addams Family
9,jboothmillard,The Addams Family,8,24 March 2005,"Based on the popular TV series (which there were a few of) and New Yorker cartoons - from the characters created by Charles Addams - comes this live action feature film about the kooky, spooky, eccentric and darkly comical humorous family, from director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black). Basically The Addams Family are the strange scary movie stereotypes filled clan, with wife/mother Morticia (Anjelica Huston), husband/father Gomez (Raul Julia), the witch-like Granny (Judith Malina), Frankenstein's monster like butler Lurch (Carel Struycken), and the kids, Wednesday (young Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman). Notice anyone missing, yes, Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) disappeared 25 years ago after a fight with brother Gomez, and Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) wants to try and get the Addams' fortune, by using her ""son"" Gordon (Lloyd again), who has a striking resemblance to Fester, to con his way into the family, and find the fortune. As time goes by though, Gordon slowly finds himself settling very nicely as if he really was Fester, oh, and by the end, you realise it is really him, Craven found him with amnesia. Also starring Dan Hedaya as Tully Alford, Dana Ivey as Margaret Alford and Paul Benedict as Judge Womack. The dark comedy is wonderfully strange, the performances from Julia, Huston and Lloyd are marvellous, young Ricci also shines with her moments as the daughter, just a very good dark comedy film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist and Best Production Design. Very good!",The Addams Family
10,ccthemovieman-1,'Fun' Is The Best Adjective,8,18 November 2006,"Generally, speaking this a pretty ""fun movie"" for most people, kids and adults. I think ""fun"" is the adjective most people would use in describing this film.As one who remembered the television series, I thought I would check this out, too. Angelica Huston certainly didn't match Carolyn Jones' beauty but she, along with Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and Christinia Ricci all were entertaining to watch.There certainly were no end to the colorful imagines, unique scenes and dialog, special-effects and - for those with a surround system, good sound. It all made for an entertaining and fast-moving film.I didn't find a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but it did bring a lot of smiles to my face. A lot of this is dark humor, so it helps to appreciate that type of comedy.",The Addams Family
11,Tweekums,Dark and fun,8,7 December 2010,"I've not seen the television version of The Addams Family so I can't say how this film compares; I can say it was a lot of fun though. As the film starts Gomez Addams is still lamenting the loss of his older brother Fester twenty-five years ago. He is soon visited by a lawyer who is hoping the get his hands on the Addams' family fortune so he can pay off his debts; his initial scheme fails but when he meets the son of the woman he owes money to he seems a striking resemblance to Fester. Soon the look-alike is trying to get into the family and most of them believe he is indeed the long lost Fester; young Wednesday is more suspicious though. As he stays with them trying to find a way into the vault he finds himself growing to like them and Wednesday starts to trust him too.This film is a lot of fun, Raul Julia and Angelica Huston were great as Gomez and his wife Morticia and Christopher Lloyd was a lot of fun as Fester; however young Christina Ricci managed to steal every scene she was in; playing Wednesday Addams she managed to only smile once and when she did it was a very creepy smile, it is just a shame she didn't have a larger role. While this is suitable for most ages some scenes may be a bit scary for younger viewers; one scene where Wednesday and her brother perform at school might be a little to gory for some as gallons of obviously fake blood are sprayed about!",The Addams Family
12,BA_Harrison,"Two, ten, eleven. Eyes, fingers, toes!",7,4 November 2021,"Gordon Craven (Christopher Lloyd), a dead ringer for The Addams' long lost Uncle Fester, poses as the missing relative in order to get his hands on the freaky family's fortune, hidden in the bowels of their spooky mansion.I find the humour in Barry Sonnenfeld's big screen debut for The Addams Family more amusing than side-splitting, but I can't fault the casting, the lively, spot-on performances ensuring that a good time is had throughout: in particular, Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams are inspired choices. Another aspect of the film that makes it more success than failure is the production design, from the wonderful interiors of the Addams' mansion, to the amazing costumes, to the top-notch special effects. Throw in a suitably ooky score by Marc Shaiman and what you have is an entertaining 99 minutes of morbid fun for all the family.The ghoulish gags come thick and fast, there's a fun musical number (the Mamushka!), Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday add some grand guignol to their school play, Elizabeth Wilson (as Gordon's loanshark mother Abigail) does a great comedic German accent, and Thing gets a job with FedEx!6.5/10 for the film, plus a bonus point for being the inspiration for one of the best pinball machines of the '90s (second only to The Twilight Zone). So that's 7.5/10, rounded down to 7 for that awful Addam's rap by M. C. Hammer (such an early '90s thing).",The Addams Family
13,moonspinner55,"Handsome Goth production, often meager returns...",5,30 March 2008,"From the Charles Addams comic-strip about ghoulish yet fun-loving family, here taking in a long lost relative who is in reality a gold-digging impostor. Well-cast and acted, smartly paced and designed comedy is an improvement on the material over the popular television series of the mid-1960s. Still, this screenplay is full of repetitive jokes and groaners; the picture looks better than it plays, with an incredible art direction, costumes and make-up. One is likely to watch and enjoy it, yet wishing it were funnier, crazier. The gags don't spin off into orbit, and eventually the whole thing evaporates from memory. Followed by a sequel, ""Addams Family Values"", in 1993. ** from ****",The Addams Family
14,Coventry,Black > blacker > blackest > THE ADDAMS FAMILY!,9,28 April 2004,"Being a kid from the 80's, this film was my very first acquaintance with the legendary ""The Addams Family"", and only watched the mid-60s TV-series (starring John Astin as the original Gomez Addams) much later. I am a big fan of the concept of sarcastic black comedy; however, and therefore I was very much looking forward to Sonnenfeld's film. The daily rituals of this family are just great! Mom and dad and their macabre passion for each other, siblings constantly thinking up games to murder each other, and a bodiless hand racing around the massive Gothic mansion! It's all very sinisterly and depressingly portrayed, but the humor is hilarious and ultra-effective. Admittedly, the whole concept exclusively revolves around one gag, namely a sort of behavioral inversion, but it works every single time! The characters remain serious no matter what crazed madness they proclaim, and even the driest forms of vulgarity are considered to be the most normal things in the world. The scenery and locations are simply brilliant, and all the supportive characters that walk through the screen (Cousin It, Dr. Pider-Schloss, a Siamese twin, ...) carry a special place in my heart. Uncle Fester Addams, Gomez' long lost brother, returns to the family, but he's brainwashed into an imposter by greedy lawyers in order to steal the Addams' family fortune. My best advice is to repeatedly watch ""The Addams Family"" and its sequel, because the number of gags, hidden references, and little trivia details there are to discover is endless. This is simply one of the funniest comedies I ever saw, although not for everyone's taste. Barry Sonnenfeld's direction is occasionally very uneven, but it was only his first major assignment after primarily working as a cameraman. Still, you can't help thinking how even more awesome this film must have been if Tim Burton (the producers' preferred choice) would have helmed it.I simply can't go without mentioning the cast! I hope they paid good money to whoever was in charge of casting. Every character in the family is just delightfully chosen and you are guaranteed to forevermore associate them with the roles they played here. Anjelica Huston as the gorgeous witch, Raul Julia (who was sadly never able to enjoy the success of the films for a long time) as the poetic madman, Christopher Lloyd as the white-faced and shiny bald-headed Fester, Carl Struyken as the towering Lurch, etc! Special mention to Christina Ricci, who truly bewitched me. She's the same age as me, and when I first saw this film at the theater, I fell head over heels in love with her! It's amazing how she depicts Wednesday Addams! She doesn't move a muscle when she speaks, and her appearance is charismatic and spooky at the same time! 'The Addams Family' is highly recommended entertainment and easily one of those few comedies you'll never grow tired off. The entire cast and crew returned for an equally enjoyable sequel in 1993.",The Addams Family
15,poolandrews,"""I'm your Mother, you only owe me your entire existence on this planet."" Pretty good fun.",6,13 September 2005,"The Addams Family has the Addams family debt laden almost bankrupt lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) & his wife Margaret (Dana Ivey) being invited to an annual séance held by the Addams family to remember Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) Brother, Fester who mysteriously disappeared 25 years ago. Back at his office Alford is threatened by loan shark Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) & her brute of a son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd) who want their money. Alford says he has no money but knows where there is a vault full of treasure & that her son Gordon looks exactly like Fester who disappeared 25 years ago & that with his help they can rob the Addams family of all their money. Later that night at the séance Gomez his wife Morticia (Anjelica Huston), Grandma (Judith Malina) & the two children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are all astounded & delighted when Fester suddenly & rather unexpectedly turns up having supposedly been trapped in the Bermuda Triangle... Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld I thought The Addams Family was a fine film that provides solid entertainment but at the same time is maybe a little simplistic & not quite funny enough. The Addams Family first appeared as a series of cartoons by Charles Addams in 1935, then the character's were given their own TV series The Addams Family (1964 - 1966) which ran for 64 episodes, then Hanna-Barbera turned the concept into a short-lived cartoon series that ran for 16 episodes in 1973 & there was one spin-off TV special called Halloween with the Addams Family (1977) with most of the original cast which then brings us to this big budget film version. The script by Caroline Thompson & Larry Wilson with Paul Rudnick doing the rewrites moves along at a nice pace & isn't demanding, it has the sort of macabre black humour you would expect & is good fun. I have to admit that I personally didn't really laugh at any point, I certainly smiled & found it amusing but there weren't any big laugh-out-loud moments for me & anyone who doesn't guess the 'surprise' ending within the first ten minutes is either dead or just plain stupid. All the Addams Family character's are there including Lurch (Carel Struycken) the ridiculously tall butler & Thing the dismembered hand. The cast help the film enormously, Julia as Gomez is perfect as is Huston as Morticia while a young Christinia Ricci is very effective as Wednesday. With a supposed budget of $38,000,000 back in '91 The Addams Family is technically a very good looking & polished film with the Addamses' Gothic mansion standing out & almost being a character in it's own right. The special effects vary as one would expect from a film from '91, the special effects on Thing are surprisingly good while the wind & electricity effects at the end are awful by todays standards. The recognisable Addams Family theme tune is only used during the opening credits. Director Sonnenfeld keeps things moving with plenty of visual gags & slapstick comedy, although I felt the sequence where Wednesday cuts Pugsley's arm off in a school play & in return he slits her throat with fountains of spurting blood spraying from the wounds was somewhat disturbing & felt out of place as in the context of the film I think they did it for 'real'. I liked it, I'm not sure I would want to watch it again anytime soon. Definitetly worth a watch especially as you can probably find it cheap these days or catch it on TV for free, like I did in fact!",The Addams Family
16,writers_reign,Black Magic,8,7 August 2014,"Comedy rarely comes blacker than this nor as magical. We open with a great sight gag which is lifted directly from one of Addams' New Yorker cartoons. As carollers sing their hearts out at the front door of the celebrated Addams house we slowly pan up to the roof where, en masse, the family tilt a large cauldron of boiling oil toward the carollers. We cut away before the oil actually leaves the cauldron because the story is not about this, it merely serves to establish the kind of family we're dealing with and, in the case of Addams veterans/devotees, to provide a bonus via animating one of the classic cartoons. There's a plot of sorts but it's not allowed to get in the way of the blend of sight gags and one liners that are deftly placed and explode like cherry bombs throughout the running time. The acting is uniformly good to excellent and it will, I am sure, sustain a second viewing.",The Addams Family
17,Calicodreamin,Cara Mia!,8,2 August 2020,"Huston and Julia steal the show as morticia and Gomez! They are the definition of chemistry. The acting is good, the storyline well developed, and the costuming and cinematography beautifully dark. A classic.",The Addams Family
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Inferior to its sequel, but great entertainment nonetheless",7,16 July 2004,"I haven't seen the original Addams Family series, I've only seen the three movies and the cartoon series, and I have to say that this is far better than the cartoon series. Every single character is perfectly casted in this film; Raul Julia does a great Gomez, Anjelica Huston is perfect as the dangerously slim, french-loving Morticia, Christoper Lloyd is flawless a Fester, Christina Ricci does a chillingly good Wednesday, which is quite impressive at that age(she was 10 or 11 when they made this), and Jimmy Workman is also great as Pugsley. Carel Struycken and Christopher Hart also do good jobs, portraying Lurch and Thing respectively, but since one of them is a giant who never speaks, and the other is a disembodied hand, I wouldn't really classify it as acting, though they're great at what they do. The script and plot seems a little awkward and reeks of lack of good ideas. It seems like they couldn't figure out how to introduce the characters, without the age-old plot of having a new character be introduced to something that is completely different to him and the audience, while it seems perfectly normal to the characters that it's trying to introduce. It just seems tired and borderline cliché-like. I would have preferred to, at the very least, see some completely new character show up and be introduced, both to us and to the Addams family, rather than having someone who appears to be Fester show up with amnesia. Apart from that, the film is great. The plot does seem a bit tiresome, but it never really gets dull; I guess this film is actually more eventful than the next in the series, but I'll have to compare after I see it again. It has a good pace throughout, and continues to entertain through most of the film, with good gags and jokes for every single scene. The acting was, like I mentioned earlier, pretty much flawless, at least by all of the leads and the most important supporting characters. Every single member of the Addams family was just about perfect. The one complaint is Huston as Morticia, who, as my fiancée pointed out, hasn't got the walk down. Actually, that's kind of the problem... she does walk. She should kind of float, with the tight dress. The characters are well-written and sufficiently bizarre and grotesque, as is the great black humor. The make-up has some flaws... Julia and Lloyd aren't quite pale enough, though last-mentioned goes back and forth some(personally, I attribute that to the character... you'll understand once you've seen the entire film), and Anjelica... well, with the white face, the blue eyeshadow and the bright red lipstick, she looks like a clown or a mime. You kept wondering when she was going to make a balloon animal... or at least, my fiancée did. And on thinking back, I have to agree with her. Still, the whole film is a worthy watch for any fan of any of the actors and probably of the Addams family as well. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors(as all of them give some of their best performances) and fans of black comedy. 7/10",The Addams Family
19,view_and_review,Pleasant Unpleasantness,7,11 October 2019,"The Addam's Family T.V. show was a bit before my time but that's not to say I couldn't enjoy this movie. I had a cursory idea who the Addam's Family was back in '91 when this movie was released, although I was more familiar with the Munsters (I saw more of those reruns).The Addam's Family are a gothic somewhat paranormal family that revel in all things morbid. Death, dismemberment, and destruction bring them joy. They're attracted to anything hinting towards gross, ghastly, and gory--unclean, uncouth, and unpleasant. Their family is strange, slightly monsterish and a delight to watch.I think they brought it to the screen very well with splendid performances from Raul Julia as Gomez, Anjelica Huston as Morticia, and the young Christina Ricci as Wednesday. The movie wasn't Earth shattering, but it did move the needle.",The Addams Family

Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston look the parts of Gomez and Morticia, the head couple with Pugsley and Wednesday as their two demented children who have the disturbing past time of finding methods of execution. Christopher Lloyd plays Uncle Fester who went missing twenty-five years ago. He turns up with a couple of the most forgettable villains the screenwriter can conjure up. Elizabeth Wilson poises as a psychiatrist claiming that Fester was lost in the Bermuda Triangle and lost his memory. He is told that he is Gordon who she brought him in. Lloyd as Fester is sent to possess the Addams fortune but predictable elements occurs such as his growing close to the family. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who presents the film's look and the special effects and art direction hold appeal with a black and white mostly presentation. While the Addams cast play their roles with appeal but the villains played by Wilson and Dan Hedaya have less personality than the severed life hand, Thing. This is not a great film but for those who loved the TV show, they will enjoy the recreation and bizarre nature of this odd family. Score: 7 ½ / 10",The Addams Family

The fake uncle adapts very well to the family, but can the doctor carry out her evil plans and take over the Addams Family's fortune......It's a remake of a TV show, and just like most TV to movie adaptations, it's just a series of clumsy sketches weakly held together by a flimsy plot.Luckily then, the cast put their all into it, and make somewhat more watchable than it should be.Sonnenfeld has made a sumptuous looking film, and one thinks he must have been watching Batman and Beetlejuice on loop whilst making this, because it's very Burtonesque, which isn't a bad thing.But it's one of those movies that you will forget about no sooner than when you switch it off.Fun, but very hollow.Like a cheap Easter egg.",The Addams Family
22,Aaron1375,"Somewhat funny, but nothing to special.",6,8 December 2009,"This film adaptation of the Addam's Family has its moments and is watchable, but there are just certain things about it that do not work that cause it to be a sort of all right comedy rather than a really good one. Part of the problem is the casting, but then the casting is good as well. Raul Julie is perfectly cast as Gomez and is a very bright spot in this film. A shame Addam's Family Values was not his last movie instead of the horrid Street Fighter movie. Christopher Lloyd plays Fester, and while he is not my first choice the man can play any role from Fester, to Judge Doom, and even a Klingon. Anjelica Houston on the other hand had the look of Morticia, but her voice was at times barely audible. I did not care for grandma either as that person would thankfully be played by Karol Cane in the sequel and she did a much better job even though that role was largely ignored in both films. The story here is rather different, as we have a person trying to pass off this dude whose mother is like some loan shark or something as the long lost Uncle Fester. So we have a guy trying to make heads or tails of the strange family while trying to get the family fortune. There are some funny scenes and long dead sections to the movie as well. The kids Wednesday and Pugsley provide the biggest laugh for me though during there school play. All in all it was not a bad film, just needed a bit of work. I actually feel the sequel is a more complete film than this one, but not by much.",The Addams Family
23,Mr-Fusion,Morbidly entertaining,8,18 May 2016,"I was a kid when ""The Addams Family"" came out, and my parents had to educate me on the background of the original show. But the movie stands on its own terms completely apart from the series. I love this movie based simply on its macabre sense of humor and across-the-board perfect cast; Christopher Lloyd's physical comedy, the unbelievable chemistry between Raúl Juliá and Anjelica Huston, and Christina Ricci's just adorable.But there's an undeniable charm here, some twisted wholesomeness to this family. Gomez is moneyed but devoid of avarice, Wednesday delights in trying to kill her brother (of which Morticia consistently approves) and their favorite game to play on Halloween is wake the dead (bring your own shovel). These people are all sorts of darkly likable and the movie has its fair share of solid laughs to say the least.8/10",The Addams Family
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,"An amusing film from the popular TV series ""The Addams Family""",8,28 November 2003,"""The Adams Family"" is a very funny film that is very under rated. With a great all star cast you get just what you expect, a great comedy. The TV show was already funny enough, and then the movie came and I was on the floor laughing. It's fun to see a happy dysfunctional family. No, I'm not talking about ""The Osbornes"". All the characters are great and you really get into it. If you can tell me that you honestly did not get one laugh from this film, there is something very wrong with you. Because it is a very funny film. I would recommend this to anyone.

25,OllieSuave-007,Creepy and kooky.,8,10 April 2014,"If you like the classic TV show, you're going to enjoy this movie adaptation of the Addams Family, featuring Gomez, Morticia, Uncle Fester, Granny, Wednesday, Pugsley, Lurch and Cousin Itt. It has the same craziness and kookiness as the TV show, but with more serious and darker tones - in this movie, Uncle Fester has been missing for 25 years, leading to an evil doctor to introduce a fake Fester to the family in an attempt to get their money.The make-up was superb in bringing the Addams Family to life and the house was dark, eerie and mysterious, a perfect Halloween-like setting.

26,sddavis63,I Found It A Bit Of A Drag,3,6 May 2010,"I suppose you have to have been a fan of the 60's TV series to really ""get"" this - and I confess that I never was a fan of that series - even as a kid (I was always more of a ""Munsters"" kid personally.) I'll readily concede that the general consensus of fans of the series seems to be that this was a pretty good resurrection of the series (which makes it better than a lot of the movies based on the 60's series) and I also agree (from the little I've seen of the series) that the various characters in the movie all seemed to be consistent with their precursors, and that all the cast seemed to do a pretty good job with them. But - again - I guess you really have to have been an ""Addams Family"" fan to appreciate this, because, quite frankly, I found the movie something of a drag.The story revolves around the return of the long lost Uncle Fester to the Addams family bosom, and an attempt by the family's lawyer to swindle Gomez out of the family fortune. But is it really Fester? And will the plot succeed? It's all tongue in cheek, of course, and there's the usual wordplay going on in this type of movie (such as when Gomez tells Thing to ""lend a hand."") Fans of the series obviously enjoy this. Those who weren't fans probably won't get much out of it. I definitely didn't.",The Addams Family
27,thesar-2,Family Time is King,9,9 February 2013,"Well now. 900 reviews down and I thought it would be special to go back to the beginning.Picture it: Phoenix. 1991. I saw the movie version of The Addams Family with the intent of reviewing it for The Demon Dispatch, my High School newspaper and it would become not only my very first review I ever wrote, but my first realm into being published.I still have a copy of that review, so I will include to the bottom of this recap (on my website only.) But, until I finish writing this ""new"" take on a movie I just recently watched for the first time in at least 15 years, I won't revisit that so that this will be pure.Pure. That is a great word. The movie's now over 21 years old and damn, it's held up and still ""pure"" today.The movie follows a wacky family and bases itself more on the comic than the TV series of the 1960s, though, it really resembles that sitcom. I even grew up on the show – reruns, damnit, I am not a child of the 1960s, for pete's sake – and I still loved this reincarnation of the strange house and family.Now, the conflict of the story – person pretending to be someone that's long-lost and he may actually be that person – isn't really new, even in 1991, but the events, the comedy, the dialogue, the sets and graphics and above all, the acting make up for the lack of originality tenfold. I could list every single actor in here, from the great performance of Anjelica Huston and awesome Raul Julia and the excellent Christina Ricci to the newcomer and impressive Jimmy Workman and never end this review on how everyone played their part to the tee and excelled in making their characters truly alive.To this day, again, more than two decades following release, I find myself marveling in this movie, laughing and appreciating all the efforts made to make this an instant classic (back then and today.)",The Addams Family
28,ElMaruecan82,"Sonnenfeld understood the Addams, not the Audience ...",7,26 December 2013,"At the end of the film, in Halloween, when the Addams go excitedly to the cemetery to play ""Wake the Dead"", the newcomer in the family Margaret (Dana Ivey) innocently asks the Granny (Judith Malina) : ""I've never played that, how does it go?"" to which the old coot retorts with a demonic smile ""Did you bring the shovel?"".This brief exchange will help me to illustrate the two problems of ""The Addams Family"". First of all, the movie needed more bits of dark and hilarious dialogs like that one, not only it is hilarious but it subtly sets the eternal gap between the off-the-wall Addams Family and the common people, no matter how eager they are to discover their 'traditions'. That moment echoes another scene where Wednesday (Cristina Ricci) asked a Scout girl if the biscuits were made of real children: that kind of humor was severely lacking in ""The Addams Family"" and the more I think about it, the more I realize it was the only one the film could provide besides the obligatory children-oriented slapstick.The second problem is that they still felt the need to ruin to that ""shovel"" quote by actually showing them 'waking up the dead' and that kind of on-the-nose humor is a blatant example of the way they ruined the very effect the film could have as a comedy. I really didn't need to see what the game consisted on, I needed to laugh and the ""did you bring the shovel"" was enough a punch-line. So why did they had to show everyone having fun in the cemetery since it is the audience that is supposed to have fun? Barry Sonnenfeld's adaptation of the iconic cartoon made me realize one thing: he certainly understood the Addams Family and whatever they 'stood for(', but he did not understand the audience.But let's give Sonnenfeld the credit he deserves, his film is marvelously looking, it carries that scary Gothic look where I suspect many trainees made their bones before working later on the Harry Potter' franchise. The photography, the costume design and naturally, the casting contribute to set the basis of a great cartoon adaptation. Raul Julia makes a perfectly suave and seductive Gomez Adams, and Anjelica Huston has never been so frighteningly sensual, and more than that, both had that unique chemistry going, if I ever think of a dad and mom who love each other to death, well, I guess Gomez and Morticia come to my mind first.Cristina Ricci is more than convincing as Wednesday, whose main occupation consists on tormenting her cooperative brother Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) with many instruments, from a knife to an electric chair. And when she passes by Morticia, carrying a big knife for her brother, Morticia takes it from her, to give her a larger one, how motherly of her! The moment is funny but not as the biscuits and shovel quotes, for the simple reason that they occur within the family, it is supposed to be normal, and as soon as we get used the family's weirdness, we stop looking at their eccentricity with surprised eyes. There has to be an outsider.The outsider issue could have served the plot, either someone normal goes to the Addams Family, or the Addams Family goes to the normal world. The first idea is abandoned when the intruder is a man who bears a striking resemblance with lost uncle Fester (remarkably played by Christopher Lloyd) and is used by his tyrannical mother (Elizabeth Wilson) as a decoy in order to throw the family away with the help of a corrupted lawyer (Dan Hedaya). The first acts celebrates the reunion between Fester and his brother but it is victim of the same problem, it spends so much time in that inner circle we stop looking at it as weird.The consequence is that the moments supposed to provide the biggest laughs don't work well, nothing comes much from the Addams party except for Cousin It's scene-stealing appearance and a fantastic 'Mamuchka' knife-dance. What lacks again is the presence of a straight person to convey the reaction of the normal word, it works for all comedies, the effectiveness of gags relies on their impact on a character who'd hate what happens to him. When Wednesday tortures her brother, it's not funny anymore because he enjoys it, how about she plays hide-and-seek with a 'normal' boy and we'll see what the outcome will be.""The Addams Family"" isn't totally unfunny, the film makes you smile and is visually entertaining but there were so much room for great laughs, it's a pity the film didn't exploit these eccentricities. The third act where the family 'discovered' the real world could have originated so many great gags, starting with good old Thing working in Fedex express. That's the stuff we expect, not a long and continuous exposition leading to a superficial conflict, the only 'conflict' possible is between the 'Addams' and normality, as during a funny school play sequence with an unexpected outburst of blood splattering the audience.The film should have been like its last five minutes, from the way they get rid of the two villains by pushing them in a coffin, ""are they dead?"" asks Pugsley ""does it matter?"" replies Wednesday. There is also good old Lurch (Carel Struycken) welcoming kids playing 'tricks or treats' with a tender smile, their reaction, no matter how predictable is, would make anyone laugh. And again, have you noticed, it featured 'normal' people. As I said, either the normal world comes to Addams, or they come to it, the first comes too rarely, the second too late.The film is still a good Family comedy with cute one-liners, but it really could've been a laugh-riot. And they still had to ruin the ending by preventing us from the famous Addams score at the end, what were they thinking with that dreadfully-90's Addams groove thing?!",The Addams Family
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Delightfully devilish.,7,29 October 2018,"There are some strange contrivances and contradictions within the plot, especially considering its forced and all too convenient final few moments (mostly concerning the true identity of a key character), but the majority of the piece is a frightfully fun, delightfully devilish time that's quirky in the best possible way. 'The Addams Family (1991)' does strangely seem to condone the dangerous behaviour of its protagonists, especially the small macabre siblings who take teasing to a whole other level, which is nearly always amusing, yet portrayed in an oddly consequence-free way that makes it feel quite challenging - at least, for its supposed target audience. Still, though it creaks in places and is certainly a bit hokey in others, this is an enjoyable - if predictable - feature that's built on suitably ostentatious, highly entertaining performances and a wryly knowing screenplay. 7/10",The Addams Family

I thought this movie would ruin the TV series, but it did not thankfully.The movie is about when Uncle Fester returns to the family after 25 years.

33,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,3 October 2012,"The Addams FamilyThe paradox of being in a family is that you can give other family members advice, but since you're family they won't listen to it.That happens to be the case in this comedy about an estranged uncle's homecoming.Decades after his brother Fester (Christopher Lloyd) departed over a disagreement, Gomez (Raúl Juliá) is overjoyed to have his brother back in his, his wife Morticia's (Anjelica Huston) and their children's, Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday's (Christina Ricci), lives.While a dead ringer of the long-lost brother-in-law, Fester is in fact part of a plan orchestrated by the Addams' lawyer (Dan Hedaya) to fleece the well-heeled weirdos of their riches.Based on the television series inspired by the comic strip, The Addams Family is aptly adapted in terms of kooky characters, ooky milieu and spooky humour.However, living with any uncle means having your address on the National Sex Offender Registry.

34,Bored_Dragon,Disappointment,6,17 June 2018,"Since I was a child I followed the adventures of The Addams Family with great fondness whenever they show up on television. Later, when I got hold of the internet, several times I've looked at all 64 episodes of the original series. I can not say I'm a huge fan, but I really love The Addams Family and for me this movie is a disappointment. The Addams Family have always been original, in their weird way, and this film is not. The plot does not bring anything new. Color movie can not even come close to the atmosphere of the black and white series, and the hour and a half was not enough for me to overcome the original actors and get used to the new cast. Raul Julia is, I have to admit, the perfect Gomez who does not fall behind John Astin. Christina Ricci and Jimmy Workman are quite ok as Wednesday and Pugsley, but the rest of the team I didn't accept well. Carolyn Jones from the original series was beautiful, elegant and irresistibly morbid Morticia. She was everything that Anjelica Huston is not. (Yes, you did not misunderstand me, Anjelica is ugly and antipathic and unsuitable for Morticia.) Christopher Lloyd is decent Fester, but he's not even close to Jackie Coogan, and the new Lurch is completely missed. New actor is not even a shadow of genius Ted Cassidy and Lurch's character is totally neglected in this film. And finally, The Addams Family is family-friendly horror comedy, and this film is just family-friendly, and not a bit spooky or funny. I can not say it's bad, but it was pretty boring for me. It may be good for you if you have not watched the series, but after a series this is totally lame.6/10",The Addams Family
35,ironhorse_iv,I'm dead serious. This movie was not quite worth dancing the Mamushka for.,6,21 December 2020,"Oh snap! You're probably asking yourself why. Well, it's because the film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld doesn't really hold that much value to me. The 1993 sequel told the same gold-digging plot of a woman trying to manipulate Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) a lot better. While also giving more screen time to the other family members; especially the star making performance from Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams who was given some of the best snarking deadpan morbid jokes from the series. I love her smarts jabs toward consumerism, the media, the mistreatment of Native Americans and others from the sequel. It sucks that Wednesday in the original isn't as clever as she later becomes. After all her running away to the graveyard rather than fighting back or telling her parents about the villains seem out of character. There were other ways the filmmakers could had used to get the Addams Family out of the house. Still, she far more interesting than the forgettable Pugsy character played by Jimmy Workman that always seem underwritten. As for Angelica Huston as Morticia & Raul Julia as Gomez Addams. They indeed capture the creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky, they're all together ooky, the Addams Family vibe. Often with discomfort toward their eyes due to the heavy makeup. They really went all for their craft. Yet once again the sequel captured their character's love affair so much better with scenes like the tango dance. Although seeing the Mamushka sequence in this film was pretty awesome even if the stunt performers are pretty obvious seen throwing the knives around. I just didn't like how the filmmakers made Fester the straight man for most of the movie. It goes against everything that we know of the character from the comic strip by cartoonist Charles Addams and the 1960s tv show of the same title. It's hurt the overall macabre comedic approach of what made Fester popular in the first place. After all we barely go to see the strange ability that the character has on generating electricity. Another thing that I hate about the Gordon subplot is how it was resolved. The whole out of nowhere Amnesia excuse was really forced during the last few minutes of the movie. Regardless of that, Lloyd was alright as Fester. Yet I felt that the actor was much better used in the sequel. He really did capture the character's mannerisms well there. Still, I'm glad that he channeled his own voice for Fester rather than copying the annoying pitch from the 1960s television show. As for actress Elizabeth Wilson. She was wonderful as Gordon's ever so controlling mother Abigail Craven. The way she speaks reminds me of a mixer of all the actresses that voice Mrs. Bates from the 1960s horror film 'Psycho'. It's wicked wonderful. Actor Dan Hedaya was also fine as Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford but I kinda mistook him for Darrin McGavin. I also dig the cameos of Sally Jesse Raphel as herself and Mercedes McNab as some random Girl Scout who later become a bigger role in the sequel as Amanda Buckman. Their interaction with the Addams Family was really funny. As of humor. The second movie mostly works for that. Don't get me wrong there were some jokes from that film that fell flat for me like the off-putting murder attempts of a young infant. While similar dark humor is hilarious here in the original like Wednesday trying to fry her brother in an electric chair. Humor is subjective, but if I had to count how many people laugh at the sequel Thanksgiving play over the first flick bloody school show. It's leans more to the latter. Regardless this movie has more fantastic scenery sets, make up and some wonderful special effects. Most of the scenes involving Thing Addams still somewhat works. Magician and puppeteer Christopher Hart really do a good performance in the hand motion and gestures. A good example of that him trying to tell Gomez that Morticia is in danger. Yet there was a lot of visuals that might not be suitable for children even with the PG-13 warning. It really depends on the parents. As for the music. The theme song is ever so catchy. As for 'The Addams Grove' rap from McHammer, that never did make me want to jam. Overall: While this comedy is still watchable. It's probably better to let this movie rest in peace. Check out the sequel instead. Now that's a film that worth haunting.",The Addams Family

38,sol-,Family Plot,7,14 February 2017,"Based on the popular 1960s TV show, this energetic comedy focuses on an affluent family with a taste for the ghoulish and their lawyer who attempts to pass off an acquaintance as a long-lost relative of the kooky clan. The film has a lot of positive aspects, but best of all is Barry Sonnenfeld in the director's chair. Having entered the film scene as a cinematographer for the Coens, Sonnenfeld always ensures that the film is visually alive, from shots that run across the floor to shots that travel with golf balls through the air. The set design is magnificent too with the theme park style slide into the vault standing out in particular. If one thing disappoints though, it is the relatively little time dedicated to the Addams children, especially Christina Ricci's perfect deadpan line delivery. Some moments also drag on too long, most notably a dance sequence (though it was apparently edited down as it is). The vast majority of the film is very good news though, and surprisingly thoughtful too. While the goofiness gets a bit in the way, the film offers some heartfelt messages in terms of the importance of family as the Addams clan are loyal and loving for all their morbidity - not to mention far less prissy than others. Then there is Christopher Lloyd as the man posing as the long-lost relative whose sense of personal identity is shattered as he falls in love with the notion of being the very character that he is pretending to be since it is so much fun. Indeed, say what you want about the Addamses, they certainly get up to much fun just by not adhering to social norms.",The Addams Family

By its nature, I believe it is not suitable for children, but young people over 12 years old will perfectly adhere to the film. The script is good and gives the Addams all the space to show everything they are and delight us with their unusual and Gothic style.The film is loaded with well-known actors and they all did a good job thanks to Barry Sonnenfeld's excellent direction. Raul Julia and Angelica Huston shone in the role of Gomez and Morticia, and Christopher Lloyd proved to be great in the role of the hysterical and strange Fester Addams. Dan Hedaya was a pleasant presence and knew how to make a good villain, and it was nice to see Carol Kane.

This wonderful attempt takes us out of the venue of camp and into that of startlingly clever wit. Excellent job, Sonnenfeld!Raul Julia is the personification Gomez Addams. I'm writing this after his death, and unfortunately, for me, there will never BE another Gomez Addams. Julia contributed a lust for life, a dark and twisted animalistic (and, indeed, cultured Barbaristic) sexuality, and the Gothic overtones attempted in the comic strip, but which were miserably overlooked in the awful campy TV series. He was brilliant as Gomez, and in my opinion, when he died, so did the franchise. (Though Jimmy Smits would make a passable Gomez, now that he's older and more mature.)Also, Anjelica Huston is the perfect Morticia. Actually, this whole cast is about the most perfectly chosen cast for any movie franchise I've ever seen. Christina Ricci perfectly personifies Wednesday Addams, Christopher Lloyd is the absolute epitome of Fester, Jimmy Workman was the perfect shadow of Pugsley, and so on.The direction was dark and Gothic, just as it should be. The sets and designs were breathtakingly stark, wonderfully Gothic, and beautifully designed. The wardrobe of each character was lovingly created with a great care devoted to each piece, and the story was beautifully written; crafted with a real pride in the work.The end result is far greater than the sum of its wonderful parts.This movie is sheer perfection. There is not a moment of wasted film, not one performance which was out of step, not one scene which should have been deleted.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Addams Family

49,kevin_robbins,The storyline for this was perfect for a movie and a great way to introduce the characters.,10,31 July 2021,"Addams Family (1991) is currently available on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows the Addams Family when Uncle Fester has been missing for 25 years. He suddenly appears on their doorstep with a strange doctor who convinces them he had memory failure but is their Uncle Fester; however, behind the scenes this Uncle Fester could be an imposter looking to steal the Addams Family fortune. Is it the real Uncle Fester or a robber? This movie is directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black) and stars Raul Julia (Street Fighter), Angelica Huston (The Witches), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), Christina Ricci (Black Snake Moan) and Paul Benedict (The Jefferson's). The storyline for this was perfect for a movie and a great way to introduce the characters. The casting was magnificent. There wasn't a single character not perfectly selected. The backdrop, settings, props and cinematography to display this universe was excellent, so was the script. The dialogue, chemistry and interactions between characters was fantastic. I absolutely loved the situations the characters were put in and the chemistry between Julia and Huston was so fun. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would score it a 9.5/10.",The Addams Family

No one even looked at the corpse.,7,7 April 2021,"Uncle Fester appears to have come home after a long period of absence, but is he an imposter?This is a pretty good comedy with great performances, a decent amount of jokes and some memorable scenes.The plot is for me the weakest aspect of the movie, but it gets us from start to finish and importantly allows for the characters and their actors to shine as much as possible.I enjoy the visuals which are very atmospheric, entertaining and technically well done. The cinematography and editing is excellent with lots of great shot compositions and lively camera movement. One of my favourite moments is the dance between Gomez and Morticia in the dark empty ballroom that superbly transitions mid dip to the actual ball in full swing.The production design is perfect for the tone of the film with wonderful set design in the Addams house, along with great costumes and props.It is the acting that gives it the extra quality, with Raúl Juliá on fantastic form as Gomez and Angelica Huston perfect as Morticia.

51,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Superior film adaptation of a classic TV show with excellent performances,9,24 November 2005,"THE ADDAMS FAMILY, in my opinion, is a superior film adaptation of a classic TV show with excellent performances. Also, even though everyone gave a superior performance, I liked Wednesday's (Christina Ricci) the best. If you ask me, Gomez (Raul Julia) and Morticia (Anjelica Huston) were absolutely kooky parents. I thought that the Girl Scout (Mercedes McNab) was an absolute b****. In conclusion, I highly recommend this superior film adaptation of a classic TV show with excellent performances to any fan who hasn't seen it.

52,davispittman,Void of substance,3,6 February 2016,"The Addams Family (1991) has a well put together stylish look to it, but the script, the dialogue, and the storyline are all void of any substance whatsoever. The cast does a pretty good job and look their roles, but the script they were given to work with just doesn't measure up. Their really isn't much of a storyline, so it might be hard for some to really care that much about this TV show adaptation. The costume design was pretty well put together, and the affection and chemistry between Gomez and Morticia worked well. That was one thing I did enjoy, the on screen chemistry between all the characters really meshed well. But like I said, the plot is just boring and bland and the film gets to where it is hard to pay attention to what's going on because the plot is just so lacking. So overall, a 3/10 for The Addams Family, I will say though that the sequel is much better!",The Addams Family

Casting is clever, and cast members are fun to watch, especially Christopher Lloyd as 'Uncle Fester'. Also starred Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, Elizabeth Wilson, Christina Ricci, Dan Hedeya and Dana Ivey.Unfortunately it is only the eye-catching make-up, special effects (look out for 'Thing') and sets, along with a little good humour, that keeps one interested in the misadventures of ""The Addams Family"".

With the exception of MIB and the Addam's family movies, these movies have proven to be the exception of his career. Raul Julia was excellent in his most endearing role, perfect in his role as Gomez along with Angelica Huston, who was perfect as Moticia. While I liked the original series, these two were better than the original Gomez and Morticia from the television series. Along with the likes of Christopher Lloyd and Christina Ricci, this was one of those rare films based on an old TV show that actually shined. Well put together and deliciously fast paced, this is one of those odd films that keep me smiling every time I see it.",The Addams Family
55,aidanratesmovies,Mamushka!,9,18 October 2021,"An incredibly charming and campy delight, The Addams Family (1991) is a bonafide classic of its time and still manages to hold up great today- even in the wake of so many remakes and reboots. I have been a huge fan of this film since I was little, and especially the films sequel Addams Family Values which at one point I watched 3 times in one week. It's a very rare occasion when a films sequel surpasses the first in terms of quality, but the first Addams family film to the screen will always hold a fond place in my heart due to its wonderful cast, style and charm. Its main flaws lie in its formulaic writing at times, but thankfully despite its somewhat cheap gimmick it presents us, it truly makes the most of it. Raul Julia is absolutely perfect as Gomez Addams, by far the best portrayal to date. Anjelica Huston also shines as Morticia Addams as well as iconic actor Christopher Lloyd as Fester. The set design is incredibly in depth and its tone is excellent and beyond fitting. The film has so many quotable lines, and so many hilarious and absurd moments, it's hard not to watch the film in its entirety with a smile on your face. Given that it is the 90's- there is some super dated special effects towards the end, but nothing that truly takes away from the film and the spell it seems to cast on its audience. In the end, The Addams Family isn't as great as Addams Family Values but it's a perfectly fun adaptation and one that manages to be rewatchable again and again.My Rating: 9.2/10.",The Addams Family
56,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Introduction Horror Film,7,11 October 2021,"This film is one that I saw regularly growing up. This is another that always seemed to be on television and it was an easy watch. I'd pop in wherever it was and just finish it out normally. I've seen this now a couple times with a more critical eye. The synopsis is con artists plan to fleece an eccentric family using an accomplice who claims to be their long-lost uncle.Most everybody knows who the Addams family is. They are definitely a different type of family. They are a 'horror movie' group that is made up of the mother Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and her husband Gomez (Raul Julia). Their children are Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman). These two are weird as they are constantly playing games to kill each other. Morticia's mother is Granny (Judith Malina). The butler is Lurch (Carel Struycken). They also have a hand that is cut off from a body that moves around on and has its own mind that they call Thing (Christopher Hart).The film begins with an accountant who does shady business comes to visit. His name is Tully Alfrod (Dan Hedaya). He comes by to get the monthly expenses for the Addams family and wants to introduce some new business to Gomez. He's actually trying to swindle some money from him to pay off his debts. His wife also comes with him, Margaret (Dana Ivey). She wants to see if Morticia will donate anything to a charity auction. Margaret has more success than Tully as Gomez isn't looking to talk about new business until next quarter.When Tully returns to his office with a briefcase full of gold, he is met by a loan shark team that is made up of mother and son duo. She is Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) and Gordon (Christopher Lloyd). They are there to collect since Tully hasn't paid them back yet. Gordon lifts up Tully and spins him around by his neck. While he is being held there, he realizes that Gordon looks like Uncle Fester, just with curly hair. His briefcase opens up and everyone sees the gold. Tully comes up with a plan to get more and it needs Gordon.The Addams family is doing their annual séance, trying to get in touch with Uncle Fester. Granny leads it with the help of Morticia and Wednesday. Granny claims to feel Fester being close and tells him to knock. There is then knocking at the door. She tells him to do it again and there is more knocking. Thing books for the door and opens it to find Gordon standing there, posing as Fester. Gomez is elated that his brother is back. Abigail is there with them as a doctor, to explain what happened and why Fester doesn't remember.There is some apprehension since Fester doesn't remember things that Gomez feels he couldn't forget. Wednesday also has her issues. Abigail comes up with a reasonable explanation. As time goes on, Gordon fit in more and more. This upsets his mother as she wants him to keep his eyes on the prize. Gordon will need to decide to help out his gaslighting mother or assimilate into the Addams family completely.That is where I'll leave my recap and where I want to start would be that this is a fun movie. This is actually a good gateway horror movie in my opinion. Some might not consider it horror, but I do. We have this odd family that embodies a lot of darker aspects. There are also some monsters and what not included as well. Just thought I should get that out of the way first.Where I want to go next is the satirical nature of this. The Addams family is weird as I said, but they're the perfect family. They aren't pretending to be anything that they aren't. Morticia and Gomez are in complete love with each other. There are no concerns as he doesn't have eyes for anyone else. Despite being rivals with his Fester, he again loves him completely and wants him back. Wednesday and Pugsley try to kill each other, but that is a game. The real monsters here are Tully and Abigail, which is interesting as they're more 'normal'.Since this movie is more of a family drama/comedy, I'll go next to the acting as that is what carries this. Huston and Julia are great. Any time I think of Morticia or Gomez, they are who I picture. The same can be said for Ricci and Workman along with Lloyd as Fester. I like that he's given a second role in the form of Gordon. Hedaya and Wilson are good as the villains here. They fit that perfectly. Aside from that, I think that Malina, Struycken, Ivey and the rest of the cast round this movie out for what is needed.Then the last things to go into would be the cinematography, effects and the soundtrack. For the former, I think this movie is shot well. We get some interesting angles when focusing on Thing. The house itself has a lot of character and I love the 'old dark house' motif that we get there. We don't get a lot in the way of effects, but what we do look good. There is some early CGI here that works. Aside from that, the rest are solid enough. The soundtrack is interesting. We have the iconic The Addams Family theme, but it also appears they got MC Hammer. It doesn't fully fit, but doesn't ruin it either.So then in conclusion here, this movie is a classic family horror film. It is fun and just enjoyable. The acting is what makes this work as they all bring their characters to life. The story is interesting enough and holds my attention. The cinematography and the effects fit for what they needed. The soundtrack might not fully work, but it also doesn't ruin the movie. For me, I'd say this is an above average movie in the scheme, but the entertainment factor is there.",The Addams Family
57,TheOneThatYouWanted,This is the reason why the second film didn't do as well,7,9 February 2017,"So yeah. I just finished watching this after watching Family Values, the sequel to this film. I watched the films out of order because I thought the sequel would be the weaker film out of the two. I was slightly wrong. The problem with this film is all the goofy magic books and stupid stuff like that. Plus they don't give the Addams a chance to interact with the outside world which is a huge mistake given how well it works when they finally do have the Addams muck around outside of their watering hole in the last twenty minutes of the film. Overall, the film isn't horrible but lacking in a lot of places. Like I stated in my review for the sequel, the director corrected these mistakes and sort of did an unofficial soft reboot but by that time the general public didn't bite because of this film. Both films are good but could have been soooo much better.",The Addams Family
58,invisibleunicornninja,I dunno,5,14 May 2018,"This movie is weird and dumb. Its somewhat entertaining, though there's nothing particularly special. All the acting is pretty flat and awkward. There's nothing here that would lead me to recommending it, watching it again, or even thinking about it. Its just forgettable.",The Addams Family
59,nycritic,Gothic Kookiness,8,30 January 2006,"Charles Addams' dark characters get the film treatment in Barry Sonnenfeld's THE ADDAMS FAMILY, which is something of a cross between the actual New Yorker comics and the 1960s television show. Not trying to lean too far to either, the movie stays at a safe plane, even incorporating a vague plot involving two grifters, Gordon and Abigail Craven, posing as Uncle Fester and a renowned psychiatrist (Christopher Lloyd and Elizabeth Wilson) who are in cahoots to rob the Addams of their fortune and house. The problem arises when Craven seems to go against his take-the-money-and-run attitude and when the Addams themselves appear to enjoy every minute that they're being taken advantage of. It suits the dark humor well, because since the Addams live in an alternative universe of their own creation in which dark is light, repugnant is beautiful, pain equals pleasure, death is life, and chaos equals order, it leaves the door open for many of their Gothic eccentricities to pull the rug over Lloyd and Wilson over and over again. It's clever, although its only problem is the ""needing to introduce the characters we all know"" setup which like in all movies based on comics or television shows, looks obvious.But despite this, everyone is uniformly excellent. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston lend their looks to embody their cartoon counterparts and are the romantics at the heart of this decidedly perverse story. Christopher Lloyd is also great in his representation of Uncle Fester. But hands down: the one who walks away with the entire movie is Christina Ricci who plays Wednesday as if she were living the role day by day. There's a sadistic gleam in her eyes and her voice that not many child actors have and I think that any other actor of the time that this film was made would have been unable to fit into this difficult part. Other than that, the tone of the movie is perfect: as dark as it wants to be, but never letting its Gothic setting drown it in an inescapable mire. On the contrary, we're constantly aware that this is a typical American family who lives upside down and who are happy in being so even when we gawk and cringe at their oddities.",The Addams Family
60,Sandcooler,Doesn't quite grasp the right tone,5,21 February 2012,"I get that making a two-hour episode of a great but still somewhat flawed 60s sitcom doesn't exactly fill a lot of seats, but this movie adaptation seems to go too far the other way. Even though it's clear from the start that you aren't supposed to take it seriously, it doesn't really play out like a comedy either. It looks more like a Gothic Tim Burton movie, which makes sense because he was in talks to direct the thing. Of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of (faux-)Burton magic in a movie, but it all seems pretty different from the original TV show. There's humour as well of course, but it's all pretty repetitive and mediocre. There one saving grace to the movie though: the actors, who really do a splendid job of reviving all these characters. Obviously you can't do much wrong if you get Christopher Lloyd, but still, great casting job. They all give it their own little twist, without being unrecognizable. Overall though I was pretty disappointed with the movie, doesn't hold up to the series for me.",The Addams Family
61,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,The perfect cast stuck with hit-and-miss material in this jet black comedy,8,22 February 2014,"Dressed to the nines, in almost deco 1930s clothing, Raul Julia clearly relishes his role as wealthy, model train-wrecking Gomez Addams. Loving father, devoted and passionate husband, madly in love with his erotic, sensual wife, Morticia, played by Anjelica Huston, the most romantic and sensual Morticia Addams possible. There was unbelievable chemistry between these two.Christina Ricci *is* Wednesday Addams- her face pale, blank, and emotionless, as she so cheerfully tries to switch on the electric chair Pugsley is sitting in, or dump a cauldron of boiling oil on unsuspecting door knockers, in a well done reference to Charles Addams' original comic strip.Carel Struyken is another wonderfully, comically, creepy, seven-foot-tall Lurch, quite possibly the most loyal and dedicated butler on Earth.Christopher Lloyd is also a wonderfully nutty Uncle Fester (or is he an impostor?) But the material is sometimes forced: in the original television series, the Addams' just did whatever normal (to them) macabre things they felt like, but here, the screenwriters seemed to go out of their way, on occasion, to make the family seem macabre and outlandish. The cast of the original television series were all very good, but this cast is even better, brilliant, and that alone makes this film worthwhile, allowing me to overlook some occasional lulls in the screenplay.",The Addams Family
62,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Addams Family""- An amusing and stylish 90's revamp of the classic comedy franchise!",8,27 October 2017,"For some reason, the 90's and early 2000's were a bit of a heyday when it came to contemporary adaptations of kitschy old TV-shows and stories. Everything from ""The Flintstones"" to ""Charlie's Angels""... from ""The Brady Bunch"" to ""Dudley Do-Right""... they all got remade, rebooted and re-imagined for then-modern audiences. But strangely, almost all of them were redone in typically either a self-satirical or self-deprecating way. Almost like the filmmakers were ashamed of the properties they were meant to be paying tribute to. But one particular film among them stands out for doing quite the opposite. For creating a respectful, honorable and faithful adaptation that kept changes to a necessary minimum while simply delivering a bigger and wilder version of what came before.And oddly enough... that film was ""The Addams Family"", directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and released in 1991. Loosely inspired by the original comics of creator Charles Addams, while taking many cues and nods from the beloved 1960's sitcom, Sonnenfeld crafted a delicious and delightful comedic throwback that's filled to burst with classic Addams humor... with dark visual references, creepy double-entendres and plenty of cynical gallows humor gags. All the while, treating audiences to top-notch visuals and fantastic comedic turns from an all-star cast. ""The Addams Family"" might not be a perfect film... but it's darned entertaining and is a great riff on a classic piece of source material.The very creepy and kooky Addams Family is getting along fine, though Gomez Addams (the late and great Raul Julia) still laments the disappearance of his brother Fester 25 years earlier. But things take an interesting turn when the Addams' lawyer Tully (Dan Hedaya) ends up in too deep with devious loan shark Abigail (Elizabeth Wilson)... Out of time, Tully hatches a plan to pay off his debt- To disguise Abigail's oafish son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd) as the long-lost Fester, of whom he is the spitting image, so that he can infiltrate the Addams clan and discover their secret vault, which holds an immense treasure. Gordon is welcomed ""back"" into the clan under the pretense of suffering amnesia. Though the more time he spends with the devilish family, the more he grows attached to them, and the more he doubts he'll be able to go through with the plan...The peculiar thing about both this film and it's immediate follow-up ""Addams Family Values"" is that in many ways, they come across more as a series of clever but only tenuously connected vignettes than as singular, cohesive narratives... and yet, they both function quite well. The story lines are kept almost as an after-thought and only serve the basis of building and contriving funny situations to find our heroes in. And I think it actually works better this way given the nature of the material. The humor of the Addams Family was almost always about contrast and subversion of modern American ideals. And structuring the film in such a way to base much of the humor on almost random interactions with standard members of middle-class culture was a good way to go. It keeps the pacing light and refreshing, and only bogs itself down with the intricacies of plot and character development when needed.Visually, the film is a delightfully Gothic masterwork of manic energy thanks to Sonnenfeld's breezy and slick cinematography and use of movement and flow. It's got an energy to it that's all its own, and feels unique and even special in a weird way. This is complimented by the remarkable and even awe-inspiring set and costume design and Marc Shaiman's fabulous score, which incorporates that classic theme we all know and love and makes good use of it for varying levels of humor and suspense.And then there's the cast. My lord, this is just an exceptional ensemble of performers. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston frequently steal the show as the demented obsessive lovers Gomez and Mortitia, and their chemistry is out of this world. Particularly admirable is the childlike energy Julia exudes in every scene. Lloyd is a blast and a half as the would-be Fester, and he really nails the character in the best of ways. Jimmy Workman, Carel Struycken and Judith Malina round out the clan in fine supporting roles. And then- newcomer Christina Ricci is a complete joy as the sardonic daughter Wednesday in a wonderful performance. Hedaya and Wilson also do quite well as our devious and bumbling villains, and have some good scenes to shine.In all honesty, it's really hard to say anything critical of the film, because so much of it feels like it's accomplishing and excelling at every goal it sets out to achieve. And yet, there's just something about it that holds it just shy of perfection. Mainly lying in the intrusions of plot that pop in now and again and feel tacked on, and the fact that the film does feel very short and sometimes rushed. There's just some very small squabbles I have that are noticeable enough to hold it back a teeny bit. But even beyond those minor issues, I can't help but give ""The Addams Family"" a whole- hearted recommendation. It's fantastically fun and darkly hilarious, and I love every single second of it. And so I give it a very good 8 out of 10!",The Addams Family
63,mike48128,Closer in Spirit to the TV Series than the 2nd Film,8,10 October 2012,"Having seen both films, (the 3rd film and various reboots don't count) I can honestly say that although the 2nd film flows better, the first one is more like the TV series. The Addams Mansion is a character unto itself, and without it the family's charisma is diminished. When the family is evicted and moves to the cheap motel, they don't seem as creepy or perverted. A great comedic opportunity was lost here. The motel should have been more run-down, with rats and bats. It could have been haunted or sinister like the Bates Motel, with real ""magic fingers"" on the bed. Even better, the family could have moved into an abandon house or a crypt near their own private graveyard. Instead of selling lemonade, I think they should have sold genuine hot dogs (made from real dogs). The ""Girl Scout cookie"" line would have still have worked. Morticia has human legs again but in the magazine she was more plant-like. Gomez was much shorter and looked like Peter Lorre. Here, at least, they act more like ghouls. Not quite zombies or the undead. The Fester amnesia plot only works to-a-point and then it drags down the action of the film. It goes on far too long. (Why is Fester the center of both movies?) However, the mansion sets are far better in this film, than in the sequel: the treasure room, dungeon play room and vault, library-study and the ""flushing"" exits are wonderful. Also, the trains and carnivorous ""Cleopatra"" are all here, as is the growling bear rug. It seems more ""Addamsy"" than the sequel. A very-good but not a great first movie, made better by a perfect cast of characters, except that Christopher Lloyd doesn't seem to fit here at first. He does, however, ""grow"" into the role, once he realizes he is a true Addams. The family reunion party is also a great sequence, with all of the Addams clan and the great fighting ""Mamushka"" knife dance. Far better than the wedding in part 2. The ""Addams rap"" ending title music (by MC Hammer) doesn't fit at all and dates the film. A harpsichord version of the TV theme would have been far better. I can only guess how good the 2nd sequel could have been with Raoul and the gang. The 3rd film, ""Addam's Family Reunion"" is mercifully out-of-print.",The Addams Family
64,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,When movies were still good,10,11 October 2014,"It seems like the film industry today is using the teenage goth subculture to make fast cash, producing bad films such as Hotel Transylvania (2012), Frankenweenie remake (2012) etc. but I still prefer movies like The Addams Family, where rather than trying to make a quick buck they think more about the quality of the movie. The acting is amazing, the movie is creepy yet comedic at the same time, the soundtrack is excellent and overall this is a very enjoyable film to watch.The Addams Family is a clan of bizarre, Gothic people, from circus freaks to punks to murderers to crazy people, and the film revolves around Gomez Addams and his strange family. They live in a mansion next to a toxic waste dump on a hill secluded from the conforming suburbs of the city. Gomez has his beloved wife Morticia, his trustworthy butler Lurch, his two children Wednesday and Pugsley, Granny (Morticia's mom), and their pet human hand, Thing. Although they are extremely creepy they are kind to everyone and avoid harming people for the most part, and are happy to live together in their home.When a long-lost relative, believed to be dead, shows up at the door, Gomez is thrilled. He'd been searching for his brother Fester, a fat bald man in a trench coat, for years, while everyone assume Fester was dead. What Gomez fails to realize is that Fester is actually Gordon, a man living with his loan shark mom and they've set up a scheme, along with the Addams' sleazy lawyer Tully, to take away everything from the Addams Family.I loved The Addams Family as a kid, and I still watch it every year.

They are using the double so then he can break into the house and steal the family's fortune.The Addams family isn't a great movie definitely. But I think that it is entertaining and neat to look at.

Lurch was brilliant just standing around....Although he could have been given a little more screen time.This is one film that I always have time for, it is brilliant directed and gives me the goosebumps the moment the titles roll; the Gothic setting only adds to the attraction, the film is very funny and has a brilliant script with some great bonding between Fester and Gomez.One of the greatest kids movie of all time....",The Addams Family

Could you have chosen any better than Angelica Huston as Morticia or Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester? Stylistically, this film is really reminiscent of Beetlejuice.

71,Stampsfightclub,dark and creative fantasy,9,31 October 2008,"Gordon Craven (Lloyd) pretends to be the long lost brother of Gomez Addams (Julia) in hope of gaining access to the family's money.This 1991 comedy from Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty) is one of those rare gems that will never be praised enough.The Addams Family brings a dark and dismal tale to a vibrant colourful light with its superb choices of characters and settings, not to mention a great use of slapstick comedy.The narrative revolves around a man who has obeyed his mother and gone into the home of the craziest people in the village. The imposition and slight conventional ideology may have you raising an eyebrow as the scheme starts to take place but bear with it as the crazy ideologies and dark imagery will take over and create an ultimate enjoyable fantasy with sensational acting and characters.Raul Julia gives an unusual performance as Gomez Addams, a crazed and vibrant man with a sharp confidence and dominance. When we see him teeing off on top of his roof we know this character is something very different and the writing is so sharp and exquisite that Gomez has become an icon in the comedy horror genre. Every performance in this film is especially sweet but Julia steals the show with an utterly astounding act.Huston (Prizzi's honour) creates another memorable protagonist in Morticia, Gomez's wife. Her delicate and light heartedness somehow fit in the dark and gruesome tale and her on screen moments with Gomez are those of a dark fairytale. Not discounting Lloyd (One flew over the cuckoo's nest) who is always impressive in whatever film he stars in takes himself to an even higher level with his role as Gordon.All characters truly look the part with Oscar nominated costume design. The black clothes and the white make up create a ghostly feeling, a sombre motion in a darkly lit tale, which really adds that extra belief and realism to its own vintage context.The setting of the Addam's mansion is beautifully executed by Sonnenfeld. The dark imagery and specialist field help make the Addam's crazier, such as casual sword fights, bizarre food choices and books that come to life.The use of two worlds is an extra bonus as we see many puns on day to day life. Having this style of comedy revolving around everyday life can be associated with audiences of all ages and adds another dimension to the fantasy. The slapstick comedy is also delicious, original and thankfully not repetitive.Though there is a slight convention in the plot, the dark imagination juxtaposed with the crazy characters makes the Addams Family a refreshingly interesting comedy.",The Addams Family

Raul Julia isn't as over the top as John Astin was, but the movie does have the Gothic tone the series was missing. Thing is a lot more than just a hand in a box, but Carolyn Jones made the better Morticia. Christopher Lloyd gives Fester more dimensions than Jackie Coogan ever did, but the one character that steals every scene is Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. Already showing the smoldering sexuality that would be her trademark, she shines with her facial expressions and one-liners.

Each character has their iconic personalities and set design is loyal to its inspiration.The jokes aren't too subtle but they're still funny. Plot isn't too deep and somewhat cliche.

75,oneloveall,A morbid joy,8,10 May 2007,"Extremely enjoyable update to the old t.v. show retains the eccentric spookiness and oddball humor of old, then proceeds to update the warped family familiarity with a rousing sense of decadent glee. The unexpectedly classy affair benefits greatly from the amazing casting that went into choosing all the Addams clan. What is nothing short of ensemble perfection, a sense of fun had by all on set during production remains undeniably infectious throughout, lending the amusing proceedings a distinct level of class.Directed by easily digestible Barry Sonnenfeld, The Addams Family may be a bit intense for young kids but should stay a delight to all others. A wonderful, gentle perversity that hangs over the entire family might have pushed things a little too far to justify this family film to the younger set, but will stay surprisingly balanced with an outpouring of heart and morality,simply flipped inside out here, for comedic intent.Wonderful set and prop design mixed with it's politely warped sense of humor would have been enough to make Addams Family the success it became, although it was the brilliant casting which continues to uphold a credibility for this film. Led by the outstanding (and sadly missed) Raul Julia, nearly every single family member wears their role with an unreal amount of dignity, making the fairly standard plot completely memorable.",The Addams Family

Goth and humor meshes together well in this outing, never leading to punch-lines that you can easily poke holes in (unlike the sequel); but you never fully feel like you're watching the Addams Family until you find out what really happened to Fester.*** (out of four)",The Addams Family

79,movieguy1021,The Addams Family: 7/10,7,22 February 2003,"The Addams Family is directed by first time director Barry Sonnenfeld, who was cinematographer for movies such as When Harry Met Sally and Big. It's an impressive debut that is finely timed, with the morbid bits thrown in correctly.It's based on the characters by Charles Addams. The macabre family enjoys maiming, although most is talked about instead of acted. It includes Gomez (Raul Julia), who is a dashing and dapper man, Morticia (Anjelica Huston), Gomez's morbid wife, Wednesday (Christina Ricci), a monotoned and pale daughter, and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman), probably the least darkest and pudgiest of them all. Well, the `plot' includes Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) and Gordon (Christopher Lloyd). Their employee Tully (Dan Hedaya) is an insurance guy for the Addamses. He plans to get the Addams fortune by having Gordon act like the long-lost Uncle Fester, with Craven acting like Dr. Pinder-Schloss, the person who found Fester.Funny, well acted, and delightfully morbid, The Addams Family fires on all cylinders. It has some good special effects, and manages to please everyone who wants to be pleased by this movie. If you aren't in the perfect dark mood, it's hard to enjoy. But if you sit back, enjoy, and let this wild ride go, you'll be pleased.Before I get any further, I'd like to say that I haven't seen the T.V. series, so I can't base this on that. I did think that Julia (who passed away in 1994) acted terrifically. Huston, whom I always enjoy in movies, put on a good show and seemed to be enjoying herself doing this role that actually kind of makes her type-cast with me. Ricci and Lloyd are the standouts. Ricci is stone-faced and hilarious. When asked what game they were playing by Pugsley as she was strapping him into an electric chair, she replies, `Is there a God?' Lloyd was perfect, marking his number of great performances up one for me.As fans of the series will know, the Addams have a disemboweled hand named `Thing', who always lends a hand. Along with the sequel, the cousin Itt isn't shown as much as it should. Itt's a giant bundle of hair, who comes out with a surprising wife at the end of the movie. If you enjoy dark comedies, you'll love The Addams Family.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for morbid humor and mild language.",The Addams Family

Here, though, you get to see your favourite characters. My favourite characters are Lurch and Uncle Fester. It would've been nice to see more of Lurch in the movie even though he hardly talks. Can he talk anyway? I'm not so sure. He's quiet, and he's very tall. Wednesday's name is rather odd. Her name is also funny. How she get that name? I find it a mystery. It's one of the days of the week. The movie doesn't explain it. Gomez is very talkative. Morticia is very attractive. Pugsley is the chubby one. Fester is the bald guy.

85,saadanathan,The true definition of scariness and weirdness 7/10,7,29 March 2021,"""The Addams Family"" is a story by Charles Addams, which has later turned into a series and movie franchise. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and written by Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson, this movie is one of the wackiest and funniest I have seen in a while. The movie focuses on the relationship of the Addams Family, a weird, bizarre and scary family that worships death, séance and everything that is gothic. Every member of the family is special in his own way: Morticia and Gomez who are the leaders of the family, Wednesday and Pugsley are the little rascals who make death pranks on each other, we then have Granny, Lurch the waiter and Thing. Fester Addams is the long lost brother of Gomez who comes back and creates a lot of chaos. All the cast members are fantastic and act so well under the whole makeup on their faces. Christopher Lloyd is great as Fester and steals the show with every appearance of his. The interactions of the family members with each other is brilliant and well written due to the script. The better the script is attached to the story, the better the movie gets. Overall this is a very funny film that aged well and is always a pleasure to watch again.",The Addams Family

You have Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston as Gomez and Moriticic Addams respectively, and they manage to portray their roles perfectly, hitting every single necessary note while still being faithful to the source material.
The other standout from this film is Christopher Lloyd, who everyone already recognizes as an incredible actor. Here he plays Uncle Fester, who appears to have come home from the Bermuda Triangle... but has strangely forgotten a lot of his heritage.
Plot-wise, this film isn't particularly strong (but it doesn't have to be), and it's certainly not as rich in subplots as the sequel was, but this is an extremely entertaining film that's well worth a re-watch every Halloween.",The Addams Family
87,DavidSim240183,One of the more successful TV to film adaptations,9,11 April 2009,"The Addams Family was one of the more subversive sitcoms on TV screens back in the 1960s. Along with The Munsters, which came out at almost the exact same time, it offered up a cheerfully morbid account of a spooky, bizarre family living in the heart of suburban normalcy. Although it only lasted two seasons, The Addams Family has gone on to become an iconic sitcom, with no signs of it ever losing its popularity.In 1990, Paramount put up the funds for a Hollywood feature film of The Addams Family. Something that had never really been attempted before. Where all of the old familiar characters are played by new actors, and the series is redressed for the big screen. After the film was a big hit, many others jumped on the bandwagon, turning well-remembered TV shows into features. But many of them have wound up dismal failures. Perhaps because what works on the small screen doesn't always work so well when stretched to fill out a big one.Also, when The Addams Family was made, the whole idea of seeing a time-honoured show as a film was a fresh idea and not the tired cliché it seems today. And happily The Addams Family is one of the few that succeeds. Largely through Barry Sonnenfeld's confident direction and a perfectly chosen cast. When it comes to actresses playing Morticia, there are few suited to the role like Anjelica Huston. Covered in a striking white makeup job, shocking red lips and black spider dress, she couldn't be more perfect. She carries herself through the film with a real regal authority, and although she looks like a walking corpse, she's just as sensual as Carolyn Jones ever was.The late Raul Julia makes Gomez into more of a swashbuckler then John Astin did, but he's also an excellent choice. He throws himself into the role with perfect reckless abandon. He also has great chemistry with Huston, making their morbid love for one another that all the more fun to watch. Christopher Lloyd makes it a hat-trick as Uncle Fester. Virtually buried beneath a fat suit and tons of makeup, he's an astonishing dead ringer for Jackie Coogan. He's even got a similar high voice. Charles Addams would have been proud. The success of the film lies as much in the hands of the casting department as it does in the hands of Barry Sonnenfeld.The Addams Family was Barry Sonnenfeld's debut as director after working as a cinematographer for several years. Usually on Coen films. And working for the Coen Brothers has clearly rubbed off on Sonnenfeld. He seems most at home in the world of black comedy. Something Coen films are renowned for. Which is what makes him such a perfect choice to direct an Addams Family picture. He captures the blackly comical life of the Addams Family perfectly. He never takes the story too far over the top (not until Wild Wild West anyway), and he keeps things ticking along at a sprightly pace.As his later films would prove, Barry Sonnenfeld is only as good as the script he's been given. And scriptwriters Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson do a good job of providing him with one. Some of the gags are a bit obvious (""I'll sell you a box of Girl Scout Cookies."" ""Are they made from real Girl Scouts?""), but where the film shines is watching the Addams Family reacting to the strange with perfect acceptance. They cut the heads off roses. Come after one another with butcher knives. Even the rack is pleasant to them.But even funnier is the second half where after the Addams' have been ousted from their home, we watch them trying to fit in to normal society. Living in a trailer park. Morticia making the witch in Hansel & Gretel into a tragic figure when reading the story to a class of kindergärtners. Thing working as a courier. I especially liked Gomez calling into Sally Jessy Raphael, the topic of the show being witch doctors, and he hoping she can put him in touch with some.The only real fault with the film is that the plotting is strictly average. Fester may actually be an imposter after the Addams Family fortune. That's a type of plot line that belongs more in a sitcom, and it doesn't make for the most interesting film plot. But the film is still enormously entertaining. The fun everyone is having is very infectious. The ghoulish set designs are great. And so is the music too. Good fun all around. Especially from the enormously talented Christina Ricci, who makes a splendidly sinister Wednesday, and far outshines the entire cast. Her icy stare alone is enough of a reason to see this film!",The Addams Family
88,joelwatchesmovies,Endlessly quotable and wholly memorable,8,4 November 2019,"The plot isn't terribly compelling but the upside-down dynamics of the titular family more than make up for it. They're kooky, crafty, and hilariously morbid (young Wednesday of course is a highlight: ""Are they made from real Girl Scouts?"")-and a far cry from the harried suburban Mom & Dad of 90s VHS tapes are parents Gomez and Morticia who ooze romantic passion (""How long has it been since we've waltzed?""

Yeah, I'd say comedy is neither the main course, nor the strongest suit here.Addams family is the happiest when things go bad, mischief reigns and abnormal happenings take place, they are like hardcore horror fans, like eternally stuck in goth's phase. Chaos is order, pain is pleasure. In other words, twisted, awesome, funky bunch of protagonists. They live in their fittingly spooky manor, and sit on some treasure, too, which attracts the scheming mind of a man in need, their bank accountant's. He finds someone, who looks like family's lost, missing uncle Fester, to pull the scam off. Thus the party is joined by Christopher Lloyd's superbly played Gordon, or Fester, joining an array of performances that are really adding some potency to the film. Besides Fester, my two other favorites are Christina Ricci's young deadpan Wednesday Addams, and late Raul Julia's head of the family Gomez Addams. The production design, too, is quite beautiful and almost gives off Tim Burton vibes.It's a fun flick for the whole family, and highly appropriate for a windy October evening. 7/10.",The Addams Family
90,LivingDog,Poor Casting ruins a Good Show,5,26 October 2002,"While all the actors of this movie version (of the much charming TV show ""The Addams Family"") are excellent only Christopher Lloyd manages to do justice to his character, Uncle Fester. None of the others selected for this romp were up to the task of mimicking the original charm, wit, and rhythm of this very fun show.Just today (10/26/02) Channel 11 in NYC had a marathon of ""The Addams Family"" for Halloween. I watched a couple of them because I couldn't keep my eyes off of the most charming, gentile, and best character - Morticia Addams played marvelously by Carolyn Jones. And the show still has its humor intact. It was pure unspoiled fun.But the movie leaves much to be desired. It is pale in comparison and I feel it is due solely to the casting people. Here's a run down of how I see this poor flick:In the role of Morticia Addams: << Anjelica Houston >>A skilled actress, but a miserable substitute for the role of the sweet and gentile Carolyn Jones. Ms. Jones glided - never walked - across the set. Her hands were as gentile waves on the sea shore playing a transparent harpsichord to one of Mozart's Sonata's.In the role of Gomez Addams: << Raul Julia >>I like everything Raul Julia does - unfortunately the casting was not up to the task of filling John Astin's wittiness and charm. Raul was a plausible choice, but that's all.In the role of Uncle Fester: << Christopher Lloyd >>Perfect. Mr. Lloyd's roles are always full of life. Unfortunately his role wasn't key to this movie (Morticia is) and so his presence wasn't enough to carry the whole cast.In the role of Lurch: << Ted Cassidy >>While he did look the part that isn't enough to make a good character come to life. (Compare, from the Star Trek shows: Leonard Nimoy's ""Spock"" and Jerry Ryan's ""7 of 9"" to Tim Russ' ""Tuvok"" and Jolene Blalock's ""T'Pol"" - Nimoy/Ryan make their characters come to life, while the other two are very wooden and stiff, respectively.)That's about it. Not worth seeing at any time - watch commercials before you see this one.Zafoid",The Addams Family
91,RiffRaffMcKinley,Still Creepy... Still Kooky... Still Mysterious... Much Spookier Than Ever,9,3 September 2007,"The only strange things about the Addams family in the classic 1964-66 television sitcom are the things they do. However, in this movie, they act very different from the rest of the world, like true Goths who find real embarrassment in appearing ""normal."" In other words, the performances of this film cannot fairly be weighed against those of, say, Carolyn Jones and John Astin. What can be said is that this remake is witty and intelligent, re-inventing the Addamses for a time when (unlike the early '60s) it is normal to be abnormal, a time when weirdness is not simply enough. In that and in most other regards, they succeed beautifully. Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia are great. Christina Ricci is fantastically frightful. The other cast members (Jimmy Workman, Judith Malina, Dana Ivey, etc.) are great except Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester-- in retrospect, his characterization is a little disappointing for fans of the show, mainly in the fact that the Addams family heredity is totally messed up in regards to Fester (he's supposed to be Gomez's uncle, not his brother) and the eerie but poker-faced dementia with which he plays the character.In other words, die-hard fans will expect more, but I didn't want much more.

Characters are changed and it just doesn't have the same appeal as the show. The fact it changed and not exactly like the show had almost no reasoning in my decision to rate it so low, I just simply didn't find it funny or amusing. The actors here all did excellent jobs portraying their version of the original cast. This movie just lacked any kind of heart. It was over the top childish at times too. This is another good example of bad choice in music because its huge at the time. MC Hammer was big in 91 and now he is a laughing stock. The over all score of the movie left so much to be desired too.Barry Sonnefeld directed this and it was his first movie. Tim Burton was set to direct but didn't for some reason and Barry tried so hard too direct like Tim, In fact for many years Barry continued to try and direct in the style of Burton.Actors here were just great for the most part. Angelica Houston as Morticia and she did a great job, Cher wanted the role and I am curious as to how she would have played it. Raul Julia tried to fill John Astins shoes and did a bad job, Raul is the worst actor on this film. Christina Ricci in an early role was perhaps the best star of this film, she truly made Wednesday her very own and just rocked it. Christopher Llyod is magnificent and donned a fat suit here for Festor. Dan Hedaya, Elizabeth Wilson and Dana Ivey did great jobs too.I don't think this film as as good as the show, it lacked heart, it had flaws (like public acceptance of Thing, for one). The score was bad the direction was not up to par and it was lazy...I did like many actors and it gave me a couple laughs 2/10 stars",The Addams Family
95,RhapsodyReviews,Great Family Film.,8,23 October 2019,"Review:
'The Addams Family' is a supernatural-black-comedy film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. It is based on the characters from the cartoon created by cartoonist Charles Addams and the TV series produced by David Levy.
I don't have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams Family. So, I can't make an educated comparison. However, this film excels in every way with disturbing humor and just plain eccentrically absurdity.
The movie is centered around a family that aren't like your typical family. They enjoy the strange and unusual rather than the normalcy of life. After losing a family member a con artist by the name of Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya), claims he can steal the family's riches he gets the help from Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) and her son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd). Having Gordon pretend to be the family member they lost, Uncle Fester.
Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, and a young Christina Ricci all deliver. They're truly a delight to watch, delivering the most macabre lines without even coming close to cracking a smile, yet having me in stitches every time. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing a far more energetic character, manages to bring in a maniacal edge to the performance. I don't think there's an actor in the movie who doesn't understand the role they play.
This movie does a lot of things right. One of which being the perfect blend of dark humor with the slap-stick humor that was popular in the 19990's. This is Barry Sonnenfeld's first feature film he directed and what a debut he brings us.
Overall, from beginning to end you love this family we are watching. Even though they are strange and like things a considered to be normal person would never like, you can understand why. Also, the chemistry between Morticia and Gomez in this movie is crazy, the actors did an amazing job.

96,The_Orenda,Excellent attempt.,6,31 October 2005,"All star cast and unbelievable remake of the original TV series, Addams Family is an excellent dark comedy movie. While there's not too much for plot, the real beauty of the Addams Family is, of course, the Addamses themselves and how they view the world and vice versa. Their backyard is their driving range, whether the neighbors hate it or not. They view school plays not with the plastered smiles we have but with the real despair we feel. And the family lives for chaos. The world is not complete without them.The Addamses' lawyer is deep in debt and when one shark comes to collect, she finds bigger fish to fry in his spooky clients.The TV series is honored in one of its more beautiful ballroom scenes, where those in the past get an updated, hip, 90s treatment. Who knew Raul Julia would throw himself so completely in his role? While most of the movie tries to carry around what thinks is a plot, characters like Thing and Lurch keep the audience in it. The opening and closing ten minutes are in my view the best part, but please enjoy the whole movie and if you like it, may I recommend the sequel as well?",The Addams Family

Now based on the genre and setting of this movie the acting was fantastic. Very unique and now iconic portrayals of these twisted bubbly characters. What a amazing cast.Cinematography:
Wow what amazing and fun special affects, shots, props and settings. Super gothic and charismatic at the same time. It makes for a very unique feeling and expierence alone.Story:
I loved watching this charismatic family mixed with this interesting plot about trying to steal the family's fortune. Ultra gothic, dark humor and plot direction made this a joy to watch through. You don't really such anything like this in cinemas now.Summary:
Overall I absolutely loved this movie. Now unfortunately I'm not one of the lucky ones who watched this as a kid and have nostalgia over it. Never the less I still really enjoyed it and loved everything from story to set design, and to the great cast. I would highly suggest watching this.",The Addams Family

I also didn't fully understand if the they were all ghosts or what, and yeah, I fell asleep a little of boredom. But when I found out the plot, it started to get my full attention. The humor was so funny.Little Christina Ricci, her acting was awesome, and so the others. Btw, at first I thought the woman who played Morticia Addams was Cher because they looked very similar to me, from the distance. Funniest thing was when the Thing tried to explained the urgent situation to Gomez when it itself had problem talking cause it is just a hand with no mouth, LOL. Also when Morticia acted weird by cutting the all the roses, the red flower, instead of the bad leaves or thorns. So hilarious.",The Addams Family

It's atmosphere is spooky but in a charming way, it's sense of humor is dark but also entertainingly silly and the performances given by the cast make the character's personalities feel full of life and energy even if their abnormal behavior seems to suggest the opposite, resulting in a movie that proves that family movies can be all kinds of weird and that loving families can come in all kinds of different forms.",The Addams Family
103,Morbius_Fitzgerald,"I'm a homicidal maniac, they look just like everyone else.",7,17 January 2014,"The Addams Family TV show is actually one of my favourite TV shows and of course, when I heard about this I decided to take a look because unlike some people, I am open to remakes and reimagining's unless they're done right. This one, I'd say is done okay.First off, the plot is weak. I saw The Addams Family movies in the order of Addams Family Reunion (I'll save you the trouble, its crap) and then Addams Family Values (which I thought was pretty funny) and it seems that the ones with Raul Julia as Gomez and Anjelica Houston as Morticia have the same kind of plot, Uncle Fester is forced by his fake mother to steal the Addams family fortune. In this one the villain is a mother figure, in the sequel its a girlfriend. The problem is that in the show Gomez would throw money at just about anything, even a doctor who treated Uncle Fester after he came out of the Bermuda Triangle and found in a fishnet (thats the story the mother uses to be around the house, and Fester, to blend in).Okay, I've explained my problems with the plot which is actually (unlike the sequel) the one and only focus. What about it is salvageable? This film is dumb fun. Many of the jokes are in character and its all round an entertaining film. The costumes are incredibly well designed (almost matching the show's to a tee) and the sets are amazingly well done.The casting is actually some of the best I've seen for a remake. The best one is surprisingly Raul Julia. In this he does kind of overplay his part but that just makes him all the more charismatic and enjoyable as Gomez Addams. Others I like are Christina Ricci as Wednesday (although, take my word for it, her time to shine was the sequel), Christopher Lloyd as Fester, Jimmy Workman as Pugsley and in this film, I actually felt myself warm up more for Anjelica Houston as Morticia. I love Carolyn Jones in the part but Anjelica Houston does stand firmly enough as Morticia.In terms of what I thought could be improved, the plot for one thing. The ""normal people"" in the show DID go into that house for more reasons than they wanted money out of Gomez's pocket. I also would've loved to have seen more of them interacting with ""normal people"". In this film I can only count one scene where they were with people who WEREN'T THE VILLAIN'S and thats Wednesday and Pugsley's play (some of the funniest stuff in the movie).Overall I'd say this film is okay. Its not absolutely fantastic but even on its own merits, this film is well put together. Do I recommend it? Yes however don't expect too much.",The Addams Family

My favorite parts were when the kids were in the play and they had blood shooting all over the audience. Classic. I also loved the parts with the safe, and how they had to go down a tube real fast and how the bad guys couldn't figure out which cord to pull so they kept going in the wrong tunnel. I also loved the end when they open the book like the hurricane book and out comes a hurricane making the bad guys spin around the room and out the window.

The performance is good and very believable and the effects are good for it's time especially with 'thing' the hand. The film takes you for a ride on a side of life I don't think many people have been on. It's funny how strange it all is and how you begin to like this family abit even when in some ways they come across so evil. In one scene Wednesday is trying to kill her brother in the electric chair, her mother disturbs this by accident and then let's it happen and they both find this amusing all though I know this shows how strange the family is I didn't think it was a necessary scene it almost made me dislike Wednesday for being so sinister.

This is the description fits the movie quite well.The Addams Family movie centers on Fester returning from being lost after a fight with his brother Gomez and his re-adapting to the household. Many dangerous times ensue as he is really an impostor trying to take hold of the addams bank account...Well plot wise this movie is not very original but it is the characters and background that truly makes a movie and the Addams Family is a very strange but interesting background to give to a regular overused plot.The family is perhaps more twisted in the movie version than in the TV version. Wednesday especially has become a very much darker character. They still play the movie that even though this family has very twisted and evil values they still come across as the good guys and have their very own charm.All of the parts are acted out very well, especially the part of Gomez who is played with a flamboyance that even the TV show couldn't touch. You have to give them credit where credit is due in that regard.Despite all the twisted nature of the movie the film is still not one of the greats but is a very fun film to watch.

Sure, the plot was meh, as is the sequel's, but what carries this film are the actors. All the actors live and breath their character. The little interactions and dialogue between them all really gives you the Addams Family experience the way it should be. When I watched it last, I was mostly impressed with Angelique and her of Morticia, no one else can do Morticia like her, just how she speaks and presents herself is everything you want from her character. And the chemistry she has with Raul breathes the iconic Gomez and Morticia romance to life. Excellent casting! And to top it all off, I gotta give a shout out to my girl Wednesday. She represent my inner self and she has always been my favorite parts of the movie for as long as I can remember. There's no one like Wednesday.",The Addams Family

When she read Hansel and Gretyl to the children and the witch was the hero and she said when the witch went into the oven she was writhing in pain. So funny! Christina Ricci as the Gothic Wednesday. She nailed that character. It was just a really fun movie all together.My only gripe was uncle fester. I remember fester as goofy, of course bald and creepy looking, but with that high pitched voice, very sarcastic, almost Paul Linde like on Hollywood squares. Lloyds uncle fester had the very gruff voice and terribly insecure. I realize that lent itself to the plot, but I just didn't like this character much.Other than that; very fun story.

I seen the 1991 film on cable several years ago lets say 2015 so revisiting it felt like seeing it for the first time again. The Addams Family is a good movie, I'm sure some 90s kids called it a comedy classic.The acting was good, you can easily tell the cast had fun. Raul Julia was a charismatic actor, he died in 1994 from a stroke and stomach cancer. Street Fighter was his final film which I want to give another shot. Christopher Lloyd stole the show for me, I guess he stole the show for lots of people.The Addams Family is a goofy, dark comedy. The filmmakers took advantage of the PG-13 rating without going too far. Maybe some really young kids were creeped out but it happens. If you dislike dark comedy, you probably won't like these movies.The visuals are good, they're mostly practical since CGI wasn't exploited yet. I guess Thing is mostly a puppet, he's digital at least once. There's some CGI which is awful.Overall, The Addams Family is a good movie. Its appealing for kids and adults.

115,ranblackman,"Dark, sardonic fun",8,11 April 2019,"I can always appreciate a film that has a great sense of humor about itself. I can also do that with a film that has a genuine personality and gravitas to it. You get both of these with the Adams Family, a decently popular cut type film from the 90s that really still holds up fairly well.The reasons this film work to come down to two simple things. First of is the comedy. There is a ton of dark humor scattered throughout this film, usually poking fun at the fact that the Adams Family is really a deeply disturbed family by pretty much any textbook definition, but in the fantasy realm of fiction, they can still be likable. The next lesson comes from the actors. We have a truly great cast here. You have Raul Julia, Christopher Loyd, Anjelica Huston, Dan Hadia, even the kid actors here are good, most notably the highly sardonic Wednesday played the then newcomer Christina Ricci.They all do good in their parts. That's essentially what this film is, a good chance of dark humor and chairman. It is very fun to watch. The music is catchy and gothic, like something Danny Elfman would come up with, this bleeds into the scenery, all that good stuff with old cobwebs and cracked wooden mansions.The only part that could have used some work is the story with Christopher Loyd's character and how he is impacting one of the Addam's thought deceased relatives in an attempt to steal their money. That story just didn't work for me, but it's forgotten since everything else did, though it does bring it down a few points as if the importance of knowing how to keep a good story going.",The Addams Family

117,myspecialparadise,Good Fun,7,18 February 2013,"First off ... my most important tweek on this movie is that I would have not used Angelica for the part of Morticia. Though she was quite good in the role, I believe, as much as the original role screamed for Carolyn Jones, the movie role screamed for ""CHER!"" As I said, Angelica did a fabulous job, but Cher was more suited to the role! Measuring up to John Astin in the role of Gomez was not an easy task, but Raul Julia was more than adequate in the role. However, the people that stole the show were Christopher Lloyd and Christina Ricci, especially the latter! I would agree with others that Christina needed more center time in the film, and the chemistry between her and Jimmy Workman was exceptional. Getting back to Chris Lloyd ... he was able to fill the shoes of veteran actor Jackie Coogan was no easy task, but he conquered the role and expanded it magnificently. However, when it comes to the role of Lurch ... Ted Cassidy still reigns supreme.As a footnote ... I love that Thing was turned into the Bionic Hand ... that really made my night!

118,fullonrobotchubby,Snappy,6,15 August 2006,"Though I think the sequel is funnier, The Addams Family, another sitcom-turned-movie, stays fresher in the mind. In the Addams' film debut, some no-good greedy villains devise a seemingly flawless plan to illegally inherit the treasures within the family's secret vault: plant their own gruesome goon (Christopher Lloyd, hamming up another kid-friendly flick) in the eerie mansion, and pass him off as their long-lost Uncle Fester. Of course, unfamiliar memories and a snoopy Wednesday (an unknown Christina Ricci) muddy things up for the impostor. Ricci makes quite a debut, but the film belongs to the late, great Raul Julia, playing an eccentric, romantic, and dead-on (sorry for the pun) Gomez, Fester's clueless brother and man of the household. Julia adds a little Latino spice to Gomez's lusty behavior, which doesn't hurt the character at all. My favorite scene is somewhat of a montage of each Addams trying to adapt to the outside life after losing their home, including Thing (the pet hand) working for FedEx and Morticia (Anjelica Huston) switching the perspectives of Hansel and Gretel for a kindergarten class. The montage is sort of a glimpse of things to come with the sequel. The plot is predictable, the MC Hammer soundtrack overload really dates it, and the humor gets a bit monotonous, but strong performances and style wake the dead moments. This sitcom transformation works.",The Addams Family

The casting is superb, giving strength to all the characters. Huston and Ricci are superb as always, Lloyd plays his traditional oddball misfit, and the late Raul Julia gives a performance so full of energy and enthusiasm, that you can tell how much fun he had making the movie.The set design is suitably macabre, however Sonnenfeld's directing does take until the sequel to find the right balance for the movies, and release the full potential of the script.

121,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 3 out of 5,5,17 January 2003,"The Addams Family begins with a hearty chuckle, as a group of nauseatingly cheery carol singers are treated to a dose of Addams hospitality.  The film is of course a 1990s revamp of the 1960s television series with the catchy refrain: ""They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky, they're altogether ooky.""  However, the film lacks the delicate balance between finesse and crudity that marked the original; perhaps this is the result when a cult show is turned into movie fodder for the masses. The Addams' live in a decaying mansion that boasts such attractions as a graveyard, a swamp and a vault full of money.  It is this last which attracts the attention of a crooked accountant and his unscrupulous client Mrs. Craven.  Their plan is to install Mrs. Craven's son Gordon in the house as 'long-lost' Uncle Fester Addams, with the purpose of gaining access to the vault.  Initially Gordon is all for this plan, but once he gets to know and like the family, he undergoes a crisis of confidence and must decide where his loyalties lie.      The plot may be depressingly formulaic, but fortunately it is in the Addams' nature to be quirky.  The humour is generally quite fresh and clever - who would have picked the villain's ultra-conventional wife pairing off with hirsute (and definitely unconventional) Cousin Itt?  But along with the hits, there are some equally spectacular misses, including almost everything involving Grandma Addams.  The other female Addams' are excellent, especially young Christina Ricci as the perpetually sullen Wednesday. Ultimately though, you have to wonder if the mysterious and macabre charm of the Addams has lost something in its modernisation, and if perhaps they should have been left to rest in peace.",The Addams Family

123,Jeremy-93,"So it's not really a comedy, it's still glorious.",8,2 June 1999,"A rather wonderful film, undervalued on release, probably because people were expecting a comedy.  Well, to be fair, this IS a comedy, but its strongest suit is a certain melancholic lyricism, well caught in Marc Shaiman's fine music score.  It's basically a rather meditative anatomy of healthy and unhealthy ways of being completely warped.  That said, a few more good gags mightn't have come amiss; Caroline Thompson (here as in Tim Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas') is stronger on the feel than the actual words.The story is perfectly strong enough - better in some ways than the sequel's, because it doesn't dissipate its energies between different plotlines - and of the actors, only Christina Ricci was to improve on her performance here.  Raul Julia, quite wonderful as a dashingly romantic, athletic, terribly vulnerable Gomez, and Christopher Lloyd in surprisinglycontrolled form as Fester, give performances here that are understated compared with their work in the (more sharply-written) sequel, and much the better for it; Angelica Huston's Morticia has just the same chiselled perfection.  As for Ricci, she already has that intense screen presence that means when she's on screen it's hard to look at anyone else, and she earns the right to a starring role in the sequel (""He's just a child"" is her standout line, ""he"" being brother Pugsley - says it all, really).  Also excellent is Elizabeth Wilson as the phony doctor and and equally phony mother Alison Craven (aka Dr Pinder-Schloss, the name she eventually takes to her grave: in the Addams family, as in all classic American fantasies, you can become who you want to be).Perhaps having Dan Hedaya's oddly sympathetic lawyer villain lose his wife to the, umm, hirsute Cousin It is a bit too much icing on the cake, but it must be said that this film is a lot bolder than its sequel in evoking an unexpected degree of sympathy for all weirdos, good-for-nothings and all-round bad sorts, even lawyers.  Not girl scouts, of course, but there's a limit to everyone's tolerance.

In fact, some moments felt as if they were included for the sole purpose of letting everyone know how weird the Addams Family is, rather than having an actual point.

125,marlyly,Blast From The Past!,5,4 October 2008,"I'm pretty sure the last time I saw this film I must have been less than 6 years old, and now over 13 years later, I caught this film on TV and decided to re-visit the family that, I have been told, as a kid I not only adored watching on film but on the cartoon TV series too. Well, what can I say - I'm sure this stuff must have had some sort of diverse effect on my mental well-being as a child, and I can say honestly had an effect on my sense of humour - I find this kind of stuff hilarious.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. The plot is horrifically predictable, the film just isn't very exciting, never seeming to go anywhere, never raising my excitement or getting me personally involved. But it is funny - full of dark, Gothic humour, and each actor embodies the famous characters to perfection - Uncle Fester is JUST as I remember him, Wednesday is the sharp and cynical older sister I always thought was oh-so cool (except, whilst I used to look up at her as being so old and mature when I was 5/6 years old, I now realise that she was only a child), cousin IT was the memorable mound of walking hair, Thing the detached hand. It brought back loads of childhood memories, and brought many smiles to my lips, but still, the film isn't great, and it would be wrong for me to give it any more stars than 3 just because of nostalgia or sentimental value.I gotta say, something I had never paid attention to as a kid was the acting, but now I'm old enough to actually realise that the characters don't exist and are played by actors, I have to congratulate Raul Julia on his performance as Gomez. I only discovered today that Julia passed away in 1994, and though this unexpected news makes me sad, at least he left behind performances of which he could honestly be proud. The second is Elizabeth Wilson as Abigail Cravern - her ability to switch between accents is incredible (and especially admired by me, who can't even master a single accent correctly).Overall, this film is good, but not great. I'm surprised that this is classed as a children's film, and amazed by how much I used to love it as a kid, but I'm obviously not in touch with my inner child as I once was.

132,Charlesc-5,"Beautiful, but boring. Humorous but not funny.",5,30 October 2014,"TV show was so much more *funny* than this, with slapstick jokes and sound effects. This movie loses the plot and tries to create a world different from the one which was created as an idea for a single panel comic and in a different time where the novelty has worn off.The comic and the TV show were both products of a day when people were learning to break out of the conformity of the 50's and early 60's. ""Goth"" hadn't become an industry yet which stores in the mall catered to.The TV show was *funny*. It wasn't ""subtle"". You didn't have to listen closely to the TV show to ""get"" it.For example, there was a weekly sequence seeing ""regular"" people left running out of the house frightened for their lives, often using under cranked film (fast motion). (not unlike the stock joke of the Casper cartoons) In this movie, however, the house guests are about as weird as the Addams. There was no ""contrast"".On TV, Jackie Coogan's Fester provided pure over the top belly laughs with a vaudeville like cadence. With his light bulb and self-destructive, one-man-three-stooges tricks (his regular headache cure gag), adding the sound effects made us all laugh out loud on a weekly basis.And let's not forget the fact that the original TV show actors defined those roles, esp Carolyn Jones and the guy (pardon me) who played Lurch. In this, however, Lurch dropped into the background. ""Thing"" had a much bigger role (thanks to CGI, we completely lost ""the box"" which was kind of the joke). To be sure, Angelica Houston was very good, but I thought they played up the sex/romance a half-note too much for what was really a kids show.Lastly, as a point of art, the TV show was in black and white, which was fitting for the macabre theme. This movie, however, was a lush production and the attention to detail was fantastic.But furniture doesn't make me *laugh*. (although I remember the laugh track on the TV show tried to make us laugh at it) Often, movie adaptations of TV shows will take some lingering question from the TV show and actually address it. Like, where did Gomez and Morticia meet? What exactly is ""Thing""? (who is way overdone in the movie, thanks to CGI) So many missed opportunities.Instead, they create an story about Fester which was never part of the TV show, introducing a main character (the lawyer) which wasn't part of the original show, and again, focus on a very well done set design (yawn) to weave a story (the vault) which only takes you farther away from the characters you fell in love with or any real jokes.Perhaps it's because we have so many more choices today that ""humorous"" doesn't cut it any more.Interesting and pretty but outside of the pre-title sequence gag, simply not funny.",The Addams Family
133,andymike-75725,Charming story with great performances,8,28 October 2018,"I went into this movie with not expectations and was met with a really charming movie.The performances and presentation are just wonderfully charming and everyone in the cast does a stunning job. In particular Anjelica and Raul does a wonderful job presenting the eccentric and romantic parents in the household and Christopher does a wonderful job presenting Gordon.The story in itself is nothing special though the setting is quite nice. Comedywise it is not the kind of comedy where i find myself constantly laughing out loud, it is more the type of comedy where you sit and watch with amused smile on your lips",The Addams Family
134,BatPhrOg,A great sarcastic comedy!,7,2 January 2001,"The Addams Family is one of the best sarcastic comedies I have ever seen. It's a really good film and has one of the best ensemble casts ever. Bravo to the casting director for casting such great talents as Raul Julia (Gomez), Angelica Huston (Morticia) and Christina Ricca (Wednesday)! The set was also amazing, like the Addams family mansion. It does leave a lasting impression for the quotes that came from this film (see the memorable quotes section and you'll see what I mean). The Addams Family did spawn a sequel, called Addams Family Values, that didn't do as well at the box office, but in my humble opinion it was just as good of a film as the first if not better.",The Addams Family
135,Kit-48,Excellent,9,17 June 2000,"There are four elements that truly make this film and its sequel, ""Addams Family Values."" The first is the gorgeous set - the Addams mansion is splendidly Gothic and full of dark atmosphere. The second is Raul Julia in the role of Gomez Addams - his manic intensity and dashing good looks make the role live without treading at all on Charles Astin's interpretation from the black-and-white television show. The third is the lovely and talented Christina Ricci - her deadpan and deadly Wednesday Addams is a joy to behold, and it's the role I think that best gives a clue to the way her work as a child actor would evolve as she grew older. The fourth is the rest of the cast, particularly Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and the gorgeous Anjelica Huston as Morticia. The entire film really is a triumph, best watched in conjunction with the sequel.",The Addams Family
136,benignifan,Bazaar production designs that blend with a grotesquely humorous script...,7,18 July 2001,"A `dark' comedy based on the Charles Addams' cartoon and famed television series with bazaar production designs that blend with a grotesquely humorous script.  The plot deals with a shyster lawyer who develops a sinister scheme to con money out of the wealthy Gomez and Morticia by presenting an impostor whom claims he is their real Uncle Fester.  This well cast cultural phenomenon has several bright moments but the entire project left me with an unsatisfied feeling.  Impressive production values make way for this average comedy.  Directorial debut for cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld.I give ""The Addams Family"" **1/2(C+).",The Addams Family
137,piajartist,"A good laugh, oddly enough for the common family.",6,2 January 2003,"This movie was a good overall flick.  It's truly a kid/teen movie but I wouldnt die if I had to watch it again.  The directing and concept is pretty general and basic, but the compilation of actors made this to be a funny and much brighter family than they are supposed to be.  Rent it for the family. The opening scene sums it up. Rating:5",The Addams Family
138,Chadderbox041277,Surprisingly Good Update of the Classic TV Series,7,4 January 2002,"Surprisingly good update of the classic TV series has our favorite ""weird"" family in a series of fun misadventures. The sets are outstanding as is the cinematography. Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia stand out as the forever morbid couple Gomez and Morticia Addams as does Christina Ricci in a scene stealing role as Wednesday Addams. Nice directorial debut by Barry Sonnenfeld.",The Addams Family
139,ebqrkhf,Remember when movies just entertained?,10,2 October 2021,"This movie is a GEM . An absolute masterpiece of cinematography, art direction, makeup, costumes, lighting & most of all: The ACTING.Incredible examples of taking on a role and having a great time with it.There's no politics, no social criticism, nothing preachy. Just a great movie to enjoy over & over with family & friends.10 stars!!!!!!!!",The Addams Family
140,Shay17,Still a classic,7,10 October 2020,"I was 8 when this film came out, and I remember it being a firm favourite. I've watched it again recently with my own children expecting to find it a bit frivolous and silly. Well, it is silly but in a brilliantly and cleverly delivered way. It's probably underrated to be honest. The sinister and deadpan acting is superb. The comic timing is on point. Despite their inexplicably weird and creepy antics, the cast portray such an endearing tight-knit family that they manage to make you want to be a part of it!I'm glad to say I still thoroughly enjoyed it nearly 30 years on and I spotted a lot more adult humour that I wouldn't have done as a child. As we know, that's often the key to a successful family movie.",The Addams Family
141,ScarTrek,Stunning performances all round,10,31 March 2004,"The Addams Family are one of the more recognisable families in TV history. With that in mind, let's skip the introductions and get straight to the chase.The performances in this movie are superb. It's a black, black comedy, and as such, it requires a certain kind of actor. The kind who has the right look, the perfect comedic timing, and the ability to deliver lines so deadpan it almost hurts.Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, and a young Christina Ricci somehow ALL manage to deliver. They're truly a delight to watch, delivering the most macabre lines without even coming close to cracking a smile, yet having me in stitches every time. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing a far more energetic character, manages to bring in a maniacal edge to the performance. I don't think there's an actor in the movie who doesn't understand the role they play.The script is great material for them to work with too, extremely witty, rarely if ever falling on it's face, and complemented with some fantastic sets. And let's not forget the music. From the legendary theme tune, to the harpsichord jingles accompanying the visual gags, to the booming organs during the heavier moments, it's spot-on. The whole movie works as one to capture *THE* Addams atmosphere, macabre as it's ever been.Sure, there's a plot too, but while it drives the movie on, you'd watch this movie for the wonderful theme, not for an intriguing plotline.It's a classic, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen it, or if you think you're too sensible for this kind of movie.",The Addams Family
142,brandonshedder,The Adams WHAMily,8,21 October 2016,"The Adams Family movie is one of the best TV to film adaptations ever made. Based off of the beloved television series of the same name, the film follows the odd band of Adams's through a zany tale of mischief and lost memory. The Adams Whamily comes to the big screen with a wham of nostalgia for old fans, and will surely excite newcomers. All of the performances here are excellent, with Angelica Huston and Christopher Lloyd really shining. Christina Ricci is also great, especially for a child actress. Everyone else is superb, as each player brings their roles to life.The film tells the story of father Gomez, who is visited by an oddball stranger claiming to be his long-lost brother, Fester, played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. The imposter Fester has been sent in by his supposed mother to steal a legendary treasure that is stored in the Adams house. This leads to much hilarity ensuing. The production does a great job of recapturing a more modern feel of the TV show, as well as with casting.Notable scenes include the mamushka dance number, the ginger woman falling in love with Cousin It, Gomez's fantastic sword fight with who I believe was his accountant or attorney, and when the family digs up their loved ones at the end of the film.In addition, costume choices and set design were both superb. It was great to see a huge set for the family house, and accurate receations and nods to the show.As for negatives, the Adams Family does include a number of scenes with ""stupid humor."" These are moments that are ridiculous, but that are meant to be this way. It takes a special person to appreciate these jokes. The filmmakers seemed to want viewers to separate themselves from these moments and have fun with them.Overall, The Adams Family is a great deal of fun for fans and the uninitiated. I would greatly recommend it to anyone. Cousin It is bae.",The Addams Family
143,Carlotta-4,FUNNY!,10,5 March 2001,"For people who love Charles Addams' cartoons, you will LOVE this movie! A lot of the scenes were taken right out of those cartoons. The actors do a wonderful job with the parts (I can't imagine anyone but Christopher Lloyd playing Fester).If you need a good laugh, this movie will get you out of your darkest depression!",The Addams Family
144,carolyncortes-32904,One of my favorite family films,10,6 December 2019,Though the Addams Family seems to be odd they are not so different from the normal family in movies. Mortcia and Gomez have one of the strongest marriages in modern family movies. They have strong family values that are not that different from others.,The Addams Family
145,sevreschool,unfortunately not the tv series,1,20 June 2001,Total crap - the worst kind of TV to cinema transfer. The plot is incomprehensible and totally awful. Some of the acting is quite good. Thing is a travesty of the original.,The Addams Family
146,jasmina-1,The best scary comedy!,10,30 August 2001,"I've seen this movie for the first time years ago, but even now when I see it on television I watch it with pleasure. It's because this is probably the best scary comedy that I've seen. And being a big fan of Anjelica Huston I have to comment on her performance. She was great in her role as the graceful Morticia Addams, but no surprises there. Of all the Morticias that I've seen, she is the best. You can also see great costumes, makeup and scenography. The acting is not exaggerated like in some comedies. Combined with great on-screen chemistry between the actors, this makes the perfect 10 I my book. If you haven't seen it yetWell I don't know what you're waiting for!",The Addams Family

148,Gomez-11,"An opposite, but equally valid interpretation.",10,21 April 1999,"The Addams Family was based on the original cartoons drawn by Charles Addams for the New Yorker - and Chaz would have been proud.  Many of the scenes are taken straight from his work, and the whole movie maintains an unmistakably Addamsesque feel.  ABC's classic 1960's television series was also based on these cartoons, and the movie is often criticized for not following the precedents set by the television show, but the fact remains that the movie has nothing to do with the show.  They were both inspired by Addams, and the characters were obviously drawn up from his outlines for the TV show, but the similarity ends there.  The movie captured just as much of Charles Addams' spirit as the show, but in a very different way.",The Addams Family
149,mellowd9,"Far from ""good,"" but a whole lot of fun.",6,11 August 2016,"This isn't that great of a movie. The plot is incredibly disjointed, although in the end the movie is charming as all get out. Also, god-damn these characters are lovable! Especially our Queen and Princess of Darkness. Morticia and Wednesday. Anjelica and Christiana killed it. Looking forward to checking out the sequel! It looks like it focuses a bit more on the kids, specifically Wednesday. She's the most intriguing of the characters. At least, in my opinion.I think I'll have to check out Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands after Addams' Family Values! I'm a sucker for these ghoulish, darkly comedic characters. Can't get enough of them.",The Addams Family
150,silver-starlet,Silly but fun!,10,29 August 2013,"Of course you really don't have to ""get"" the humor of the cheesy 1960's sitcoms to enjoy this movie. The film is much darker than the actual television series itself, but I enjoyed it. It was funny... a silly kind of funny, and that is exactly how the Addams family is.I really liked the casting of this film. Raul Julia made a very suave Gomez. Anjelica Houston was beautiful, and she came off as sweet yet wonderfully macabre, just as Morticia should be! And let's not forget Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester. You could really tell he had fun portraying him. Christina Ricci as Wednesday was also enjoyable. I find most child actors annoying, but she was quiet and kept character very well. The plot was interesting but a bit predictable. The music was good, nothing special, but it fit the movie quiet well. If you're a fan of dark humor you would enjoy this film. I love to watch it around Halloween. And even if it is a bit cheesy, (yes I'll admit) I found it enjoyable, entertaining and overall fun.",The Addams Family
151,laughingtomb,Very good!,8,18 June 2021,"This movie is dumb! Dumb dumb dumb! But in the dumbest, best way possible! The actors are genuinely giving it their all, they're funny, the jokes are really well done, adult but subtle enough for everyone to enjoy, the slap-stick is spot on. This movie stands the test of time in all the best ways of possible, although certainly some moments definitely remind you the film is of the 90s, it's one of the best incarnations of the Addams Family available, and you should give it a go!However, do note, I said ONE OF THE BEST, not the best, now, this film's sequel, Addam's Family Values, though..",The Addams Family

153,wodan di,Raul Julia & Angelica Huston shine in Charles Addams tribute,10,17 July 1999,"This movie is one of the best of the 90's comedy flicks. Raul Julia stands out as Gomez in a rare (for Julia) comedy role, and Angelica Huston's subtle smirks and dark romantic flair is remarkable even for her, Christopher Lloyd is a great Uncle Fester in a role that seems tailor-made for him, and watch for Christina Ricci, though only 11 in this film she may well become one of the most prolific and talented stars of the next decade. From the opening scenes I flashed back to the Charles Addams cartoons (which I seem to be the only person in my generation to remember.) while remaining recognizable from the tv series it transcends it. If you somehow have managed not to have seen this film yet, or haven't seen it in quite a while, do yourself a favor and stop at your local library and browse though Charles Addams ""Addams Family"" comics, then rent and truly enjoy the movie from a heightened perspective.   8v}",The Addams Family
154,EWAdams,Funny and cheerful black humor,8,17 April 2000,"For years movies about families, whether they were comedies or anything else, were namby-pamby and unrealistic. Then they became gritty, dysfunctional, and depressing. Married people with children are almost uniformly portrayed as tired or bored. The Addams Family breaks out of this mold, depicting a completely weird group of people who obviously love and care for one another, while enjoying and celebrating their weirdness.

The Film will shallow you whole with its very complete make-up ,thats scenes, soundtrack and plot, which is both compelling and nested in good morals. this film may not be suitable to people with strong Christian views due to the themes. The Film flows effortlessly and could even keep the attention of young children i suspect. The Film is fairly spooky in parts but in ways your children won't understand.
