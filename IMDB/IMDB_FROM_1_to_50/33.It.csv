0,MartinHafer,Not at all the type of film I usually watch...but I did enjoy it and am glad I saw it.,9,26 September 2017,"Of all the different genres of films, I think modern horror is probably my least favorite. I love old horror films...mostly because they aren't extremely graphic and leave a lot to the imagination. But this is a case which proves I can be won over by a violent modern horror pic. The only reason I saw this one at all is because my daughter wanted to see it...and I didn't wanna disappoint her.I am not going to make this review long...as there are nearly 800 for this hit film already. Suffice to say, the movie is scary, the story very good (the things omitted from the book are generally best not being in the film) and I enjoyed the heck out of the picture. Who knows...maybe I don't hate the genre...just the brainless teens begin slaughtered at the abandoned amusement park/roller disco by a guy in a hockey mask sort of film.",It
1,TheLittleSongbird,Floating with brilliance,9,8 September 2017,"Just got back from seeing 'IT'. Expectations were that of great interest but also apprehension. Eight years ago, back when there was a personal unfamiliarity and ignorance of Stephen King's style and less appreciation for the book, there is the admission of saying don't bother with a re-make.Couldn't be more wrong. This was a case where another adaptation was not only warranted but necessary. 'IT' is such a great story that deserves to be done justice and with one of the best trailers of the year this actually looked good. However, with the other King film released this year 'The Dark Tower' being such a disappointment, there was apprehension as to whether a film based on such a huge book would work.'IT' as a book is one of King's best and one of the best of the horror genre. King's attention to detail, how he writes scenes with children and depiction of fear are unparalleled, with wonderfully drawn characters, one of the terrifying antagonists in literature and many unforgettable scenes, ones that burn long in the memory in how scary they are. The book is much more than just a horror story though, also with nostalgia, comedy, pathos and deep characterisation.'IT' was previously adapted as a mini-series in 1990, which is remembered fondly by those who saw it as children and left them terrified but often derided by fans of the book. To me, it has a lot wrong with it with a vastly inferior second half and an anti-climactic let down of an ending with the infamously terrible effects of IT's true form. But it is nowhere near one of the worst King adaptations, it's not even the worst of the mini-series. Compared to the book it's very poor, as a standalone it's wildly uneven but has more to it than Tim Curry's unforgettably magnificent Pennywise. It has a great first half with strong performances from the child actors, some unsettling moments, a 'Stand By Me'-like nostalgia and a great music score.This 2017 film adaptation is a big improvement and one of the best King adaptations in years. It does have changes, including the change in decade, not following the same structure, different IT encounters for some characters and another motivation for wanting to defeat IT. However, it is very loyal in spirit to the book that is apparent throughout. What makes it better are better production values, explanations and character motivations being more logical, Henry Bowers being more of a psychopath (and he is given a reason for why he came to be the way he is, when it was only implied once in passing previously), Beverly's father and the relationship between the two having more of a creep factor and even better child performances.Not without its faults. Not all the special effects work, the fangs and the overdone Pennywise shaking look cheap. Mike is underused and underdeveloped compared to the others and the other bullies are pretty much given short shrift (Victor Criss practically anonymous).Some people have said that 'IT' is not scary. Personally disagree, finding it one of the scariest films seen in a long time. Not many films recently made my heart jump, covering my eyes, biting nails or stifling a scream. The Niebolt Street, bathroom, George and Pennywise and photograph/slideshow scenes especially are absolutely terrifying, and there are beautifully timed jolts, real tension and eeriness and suspenseful lead-ups, aided by atmospheric intricate lighting and clever effects for IT's forms (that leper!).With that being said, 'IT' is much more than a horror film, and is more successful in its other elements. It has comedy, and it's hilarious especially with Richie and Eddie. There is an affectionate nostalgia, reminiscent of 'Stand By Me' and 'The Goonies' and reminding one of how good King was at writing scenes with children and childhood adolescence, which the writers understood and it translates brilliantly on screen. There is pathos, like with Ben's poem and the two most heart-wrenching moments are in the frightening, heart-tugging and triumphant climax. The characters are written very well on the most part, particularly Bill, Beverly and Ben, while Pennywise is evil-incarnate.Production values mostly are terrific, not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting (Niebolt Street is a standout), taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. The effects mostly are not bad, the make-up is superb and how Pennywise is made up has a creepier effect. The music score is truly haunting, ""Oranges and Lemons"" has never freaked me out this much.Andy Muschietti directs with suspense, potent realism, confidence and affection, while the writing has a great balance of hilarious comedy, touching drama and pathos, references to the time period, King and history of Derry and nostalgia. The story, even with the change of time-line and structure, is cohesive and logical, rich in suspense and emotion but it's the chemistry between the children and the sweet and surprisingly real relationship between Beverly and Ben that resonate most.One couldn't ask for better performances. The children are uniformly wonderful, especially a vulnerable Sophia Lillis, a hilarious Finn Wolfhard and a relatable Jeremy Ray Taylor. Jaeden Lieberher handles Bill's dramatic arc very touchingly while Jack Dylan Grazer is very funny. Mike and Stan are well cast. As for Pennywise, it is a very difficult feat filling the iconic Tim Curry's giant clown shoes, but Bill Skarsgard does so superbly, providing a different interpretation that never feels like a copy and has just as much chilling menace, nightmarish air and dark twisted amusement. Curry's laugh is creepier, but Skarsgard's is closer to that described in the book.All in all, brilliant and if the second film with the adults happens please have the same writer, director and Skarsgard on board, and use this as a model rather than the mini-series' second half with better cast adults and a far better ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",It
2,Leofwine_draca,A breath of fresh air,8,21 September 2019,"IT is the first of a two-part modern reworking of the Stephen King classic, first adapted for the screen with the miniseries back in 1990. I like the miniseries a lot, and Tim Curry's interpretation of Pennywise remains definitive, but the 2017 IT is surprisingly decent. It has a far more adult edge than the miniseries, and it's much, much darker. It seems to capture the dark heart of the King novel very well, the very essence of it, while the real asset lies in the all-child cast; the performances are generally excellent, going for realism over sympathy or sentiment and feeling very true to life as a result. The scares are well telegraphed and perhaps a little too inevitably reliant on CGI trickery, but for a modern horror they're quite effective. I didn't mind the updating to the 1980s setting either as it makes sense to follow King's trend of setting the past scenes 27 years before the present day. Despite the flaws I found this to be one of the stronger horror films to come from Hollywood in recent years; there's something pleasingly old-fashioned about a film that emphasis strong plotting rather than a series of jumps or chases descending into tedium.",It
3,SnoopyStyle,not super scary but very well made,8,12 September 2017,"It's 1988 in the small town of Derry, Maine. Bill Denbrough makes a paper boat for little brother Georgie. Georgie plays with it in the rain and it floats down into the sewers. He encounters Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) and we're off. Bill faces the loss of Georgie with his friends Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris. They are bullied along with new kid Ben Hanscom, home-schooled Mike Hanlon, and abused girl Beverly Marsh. There is a series of missing kids and Ben may have uncovered the disturbing cause.I am not a reader but I did watch the mini-series many years ago (not as a kid). It struck me right away that it obviously needed to be split into two movies. The kids' side could be a great horror and I didn't care for the adults' side that much. It's a decade later and they've made the kids' part of the novel. There are two trailers which really caught everybody's eye and peaked my interest.This is like a darker and more brutal Goonies or more likely, a Stand By Me with more gore. It's not a slasher torture porn. It's not super scary but that's not the objective. Honestly, I laughed more than I was scared. It is surprisingly rather funny. It is super well made. Even the cinematography is beautiful. The kids have amazing chemistry. Each one is an individual. They are fun together and natural. Their stories are honest and brutal. This version of Pennywise is creepy and much more a monster than the teasetastic Tim Curry. There are jump scares but the movie does not rely on them. They aren't that big anyways and the one with Beverly is already given away in the trailer. I would put this comfortably on the same level as the two iconic coming-of-age movies previously mentioned.",It
4,Horst_In_Translation,It was not a triumph by any means,4,16 October 2017,"Let me start my review for the new 2017 horror blockbuster by saying that I have not read the Stephen King novel or seen the old ""It"" from 1990, so my review for this film here has only to do with the film itself and no other version / base material. I have seen director Andy Muschietti's older film Mama and I wish he could have written the screenplay for this new film himself like he did back then as what the writing trio (that is far from a bunch of nobodies) made out of it (no pun intended) here is definitely a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. But first things first: It runs for comfortably over 2 hours and tells the story of a group of kids as they fight and eventually overcome a dangerous demon in the form of a clown. The latter goes by the name of Pennywise and maybe he was the best thing about it all. Sadly, he and the film peaked already very early on in the rain/sewer scene and that one was quite amazing. There he did look like a worthy antagonist. But honestly afterward he fails on so many occasions and cannot even kill one of the kids from the group. Lets keep it family friendly shall we? Thanks, but no thanks.Now about the gang itself: I really never ended up liking or cheering for those kids. One reason for that may be the one with the glasses who is really downright annoying and as his comments were supposed to be the comedic foundation of the film, that is a perspective where the movie didn't work at all. And there's others. In general, the child actors weren't good at all and I would be surprised if we see more than 1, maybe 2, of them acting 20 years from now. The fat kid and the girl were maybe still the best of them, even if their fairy tale like kiss was also one of the weakest moments. The one with the glasses I cannot deny I wanted the clown to kill him, same for the one who got added for diversity reasons towards the end, who added nothing to the film at all. The boy being probably the closest to a lead actor, the one with the dead brother, was not particularly good either. This showed on several occasions, but of course the script did not help either. There is that one scene when he holds a speech that he'd rather enter the house of horrors than his home where his brother is missing was maybe the most cringeworthy moment of the film. You could see how they were desperately trying to make an impact in terms of drama, in terms of coming-of-age. But it all went wrong and not just on that occasion. There's maybe half a dozen more examples. So from the drama/emotional perspective, maybe even romantic perspective, it is a failure too. It was obvious how they wanted to make more than pointless horror fun with the several abuse (physical, emotional, sexual) stories, but the talent just wasn't there to make it work, let alone make it memorable. And at some point, it also isn't fun anymore to see Pennywise with his huge forehead being stopped again and again from killing any of the heroes as he really turned into a clueless impotent clown finally. I guess they still wanted to make it family friendly overall by not killing off any of the good kids except early on. That looked like a really cowardly approach to me. Eventually this film did not come close in its attempt to combine kids and horror, what is a successful formula these days if you look at Stranger Things"" for example. I see a sequel is planned for 2019, but after how weak this one turned out to be, I cannot say I am curious about that one at all. Definitely a contender for my biggest 2017 film disappointment so far. Do not watch and I had a feeling that the mix-up between reality and imagination was handled so shoddily in here that it was just beyond confusing. Maybe even the writers lost their focus as this did not turn out half as smart as they wanted it to be. Do not be fooled by the overwhelmingly positive reception. This is not a good film!",It
5,Prismark10,The killer klown,6,9 June 2018,"Director Andy Muschietti takes inspiration from another Stephen King adaptation, Stand by Me. He has also added a touch of The Goonies. Set in a small town back in the summer of 1989 where some of the kids run away from bigger bullies but the real malevolent force in Pennywise the sinister clown.The kids discover that disaster strikes every 27 years where children disappear and it is for them to take a stand and stop the clown.The story is built up slowly, we first see a child playing with a paper boat which goes into the drainage system where he encounters Pennywise and disappears. His brother is traumatised. Most of the early scenes are kids at school, being teenagers, getting bullied. A girl has an abusive father, one child is ill or is he? However the tension soon mounts as Pennywise taunts them, his appearance being increasingly horrific.We see a lot of the movie titles that came out in 1989 such as one of the Freddy Krueger sequels. Another is Batman, Pennywise as a hint of Jack Nicholson's psychotic Joker.It has certainly garnered a younger audience with the approach it has taken. My teenage son is not fond of clowns but he was reeled in because we follow these young teenagers and their adventures and trauma.The film does run for too long, it could had easily knocked 20 minutes off the running time and this affects the pacing of the movie. Some of the CGI looks a bit cheap as well.",It
6,claudio_carvalho,A Good Remake,7,19 December 2017,"Remakes are usually the dumbest way to explore the success of a great film. However, ""It"" (2017) is not a bad movie; indeed it is a good remake of the first part of the original ""It"". The storyline is the same but the screenplay was rewritten. In the original film, the seven lead characters are adults meeting each other in Derry. Their childhood is told through flashbacks where the viewer learns their experience with the evil Pennywise when they were children and their pact to return to their hometown if necessary. ""It"" (2017) is linear and tells the same story of the seven bullied children since the disappearance of Georgie, ending with their pact to return to Derry. Now there will certainly be another ""It"" with these characters adult. Sophia Lillis, Jaeden Lieberher and Bill Skarsgård have extraordinary performances. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""It: A Coisa"" (""It: The Thing"")",It
7,nogodnomasters,No next time.,10,30 October 2017,"I won't labor on the plot, but will just make a few comparisons. The other film was made for TV and was limited it what it could do. This production only concerns the childhood and not the second part as adults. The special effects were improved to make for a far more scary and intense film. Some of the original dialogue appears and I had a few moments of deja vu. I thought the child actors were better. This reboot is superior to the initial in every way.

9,kosmasp,IT ... is back,8,1 November 2017,"Though I feel like I could use this/headline probably sometime in the near future. But leaving this aside, let's get to the meat of things (no pun intended). It's been a while since I saw the first attempt on bringing this to the screen. This or IT being another story by Stephen King. The first attempt was made for TV, so that and the fact it's been a while I wouldn't be surprised if the effects are nowhere near this newer version and that makes sense.Still I do remember Tim Curry doing a phenomenal job. Something Skarsgaard had to play against. I don't think you should compare myself, but I know that some may not be able to help themselves. Whatever the case, the new clown is terrifying as well. And the effects are really good. So while horror fans and hardcore horror movie watchers may not be as overwhelmed by this then the general audience, this still is a good film overall. And it still has a lot more ""blood"" in it, than one may expect. Just not exactly the way you may expect it ... so don't expect a blood fest. Expect a genuinely scary movie, that will leave an impression with many young ones ... maybe you are one of them",It
10,Sleepin_Dragon,Worth waiting for.,7,15 September 2019,"I made the decision to wait for the second part's release to watch it, and I watched the first one, and went straight to the cinema for this, for me it's one long film.Where do you start? It's a messed up book, with some real dark, crazy horror. Some of it translated here, some of it didn't. The famous scene where Pennywise is first seen I loved, it was terrifying, and from that first moment, I loved Bill Skarsgård, and have nothing but praise for him.People criticising the run time, clearly haven't read the book, it's a long, but rewarding book. As I now can compare the two films, I preferred this first installment. It's very well made, well acted, definitely enjoyable.Sometimes it felt more adventure then horror, it never really felt full on horror, there were some very good scenes, but they could have ramped it up a bit. Many people are terrified of clowns, they could have pushed that vibe a bit more. Lots of humour, too much though? Not sure, I didn't detect much humour in the book.I'm so glad Stephen King is on the big screen still, how about a reworking of The Tommyknockers?7.5/10",It
11,classicsoncall,"""Ain't nothing like a little fear to make a man tremble.""",10,10 September 2017,"For viewers with coulrophobia - beware! That's a fear of clowns if you don't know, and if you don't know if you have a fear of clowns, you WILL know after you see this film. Bill Skarsgard's take on Pennywise the Clown in this remake of the 1980 TV mini-series is a masterful interpretation, delivered for a twenty first century audience that's been desensitized by over the top gore and horror of recent vintage. And that's not meant to take anything away from Tim Curry's portrayal in the earlier film, he brought his own brand of selective nuance to that characterization.I liked the idea that the story takes place in 1989 as opposed to the Fifties in Stephen King's novel. With a twenty seven year cycle between appearances of the evil incarnate known as Pennywise, the second chapter will bring events relatively current into a 2016 time frame. The story reinforces the 1989 time frame with a movie marquee featuring the first modern day ""Batman"" movie along with the ""Lethal Weapon II' sequel. A side view of the same theater also mentions ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5"", a nice touch for horror fans of that series.I agree with a fair number of commenters on this site that mention the natural camaraderie of the members in 'The Loser's Club'. Some of them, like Mike and Stan are underplayed a bit, but not every one of them can be a standout. The manner in which the nominal leader Billy (Jaeden Lieberher) was written was very well done, in a way that handled his little brother's death as real, but holding out some hope that maybe, just maybe there's the possibility that he's a missing person. As the viewer of course, we know that Georgie was a Pennywise victim right at the outset, even though we get teases later on in the story that the evil entity is working through the guise of Billy's little brother.As far as the scary elements go, I've probably seen enough horror films to have become somewhat jaded over the years relative to jump scare moments and other nasty surprises. The one scene I thought was outstanding was when Pennywise emerged from the slide show presentation in Billy's garage, that was exceptionally well done. What really made the film work for me was the bonding between the seven 'Losers', all of whom entered into a blood pact to respond to a future crisis when the time should arrive. With that, the one disappointment I experienced was that there was no 'after credits' sequence to give us a hint of what to expect in the second chapter. If you hang around until the theater employees are ready to throw you out so they can clean up, all you get is that maniacal laugh from Pennywise to send you off. At least he could have popped out of the screen.",It
12,lee_eisenberg,"when dealing with an evil entity, sometimes you gotta be creepy",7,4 July 2018,"I've never read Stephen King's novel about a supremely evil force that terrorizes a Maine town, but this adaptation is worth seeing. Bill Skarsgård plays Pennywise as a truly malevolent being who knows just how to get into people's confidence. Basically, 2017's ""It"" is a creepy movie that hits the right notes. The children do a fine job with their roles. Like some of Stephen King's other works - ""The Body"" (adapted as ""Stand by Me"") and ""Hearts in Atlantis"" - it does a good job showing how the adults are lousy role models, so the children join up to achieve something. But make no mistake, Skarsgård is the real star. Don't be surprised if you want to sleep with the light on after seeing his performance.I also recommend the 1990 miniseries, and I hope to read the novel. Good one.",It
13,jboothmillard,It,8,14 September 2017,"I watched the original 1990 TV made movie, starring Tim Curry as the evil clown Pennywise, (having watched it a second time) it was enjoyable, so I was most interested to see the producers of The Ring, The Grudge, Sherlock Holmes and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter were making a new version of the famous Stephen King novel, directed by Andy Muschietti (Mama). Basically, on a rainy day in Derry, Maine, October 1988, Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) gives his seven-year-old brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) a sailboat made from notebook paper. Georgie sails it in the street gutter, but it goes down a storm drain, Georgie peers inside and finds a man dressed as a clown who introduces himself as ""Pennywise the Dancing Clown"" (Bill Skarsgård, Stellan's son), the clown entices Georgie to reach in for the boat, then severs his arm and drags him in. Eight months later, June 1989, on the last day of term at Derry High School, Bill and his friends Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) face constant bullying from Henry Bowers and his gang. At the same time, young girl Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), who is being abused by her father Alvin (Stephen Bogaert), runs into Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), who has recently moved to Derry, Mike has encounter with Pennywise. Bill is haunted by the disappearance of Georgie, he believes his brother may still be alive in the marshy wasteland called the Barrens, he recruits his friends to check it out. Ben finds a book on Derry's history, he learns the town has been plagued by mysterious unexplained tragedies and child disappearances for centuries, he escapes an attack from Pennywise, then Henry's gang, and flees to the Barrens. Ben runs into Billy's group, as they find the shoe of missing girl Betty Ripsom, after they leave, Henry's friend Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague) is killed by Pennywise in the sewer. The next day, each of the children have a nightmarish encounter with Pennywise, Eddie is attacked by a rotting leper, and Stan is traumatised by an animated figure from a painting. Beverly has a a fountain of blood spurting from her bathroom sink, coating the bathroom, Bill is lured into the basement by a vision of Georgie, he narrowly escapes Pennywise. Weeks later, the group, referring to themselves as ""The Losers Club"", come to realise they are all being terrorised by the same entity, ""It"" assumes the appearance of what they fear, Ben also deduces that the creature awakens every 27 years to feed on the children of Derry before returning to hibernation. The group determine It moves unseen through the sewers around Derry's well, where 29 Neibolt Street is built, Bill, Richie, and Eddie enter the house while the others remain outside. After the encounter with It, Eddie's mother arrives and is horrified by her son's broken arm, she takes him away, the group begin to splinter. It is now August, Beverly incapacitates her father with a porcelain toilet lid when he tries to rape her, she in abducted by Pennywise, Bill assembles the others to mount a rescue, meanwhile It manipulates Henry to murder his abusive father, and sends him to kill the Losers. At the Neibolt house, the group abseil down the well, Henry struggles Mike, until the bully falls down the well, apparently to his death. The group find It's lair in an underground cooling tower, filled with decaying circus props and children's belongings, there they find Beverly in a catatonic state, along with dozens of missing children corpses, floating above them. Beverly is revived with a kiss from Ben, It tries to trick Bill, appearing as Georgie, Bill shoots It in the head, Pennywise tries to take Bill hostage, but the other help and brutally fight It. It attempts to use their fears against them, but Pennywise is mortally wounded and cornered, Bill coldly tells Pennywise they know It needs their fear to survive, they have effectively starved the creature by making It afraid of them. Knowing it has no more power over the kids, It dissolves and Pennywise escapes into a deep pit, and the floating children slowly descend, Bill breaks down accepting his brother is dead, he is comforted by the others. One month later, Beverly tells the group that while catatonic she had a vision of them fighting the creature as adults, the Losers make a blood oath to return to Derry in 27 years, if It returns they will destroy the creature once and for all, one by one the Losers depart, and Bill and Beverly they share a kiss. Also starring Stuart Hughes as Officer Oscar ""Butch"" Bowers, Owen Teague as Patrick Hockstetter, Logan Thompson as Victor ""Vic"" Criss, Jake Sim as Reginald ""Belch"" Huggins and Geoffrey Pounsett as Zach Denbrough. Skarsgard gives a great performance as the disturbing nasty clown, and the seven young actors are all impressive, it is a simple story, a Stand by Me style story of a group of tween friends who bond together to fight against an ancient evil, it works well with the friendship element, and it is thrilling and scary when it needs to be, the highlights are definitely the opening, and the bathroom blasted with blood. It went on to become the highest-grossing horror movie of all time, and ended as being ""Chapter One"", so I look forward to the follow-up, a most enjoyable supernatural horror. Very good!",It
14,Woodyanders,Very creepy and effective,9,16 September 2017,"This adaptation of Stephen King's mammoth novel works exceptionally well because of how vivid and sympathetic the misfit main characters are: One really believes that these oddball kids are true friends who care about one another and have each other's backs. Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophie Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Glazer, and Wyatt Olaf are all uniformly fine and credible in their roles while Bill Skarsgard makes for a supremely frightening Pennywise. Moreover, director Andy Muschietti offers a flavorsome evocation of the late 1980's period setting (the News Kids on the Block reference is spot-on sidesplitting!), grounds the fantastic premise in a plausible everyday small town reality, and generates plenty of nerve-rattling suspense. Better still, the spooky supernatural evil of Pennywise is nicely contrasted by such chilling real-life horrors as vicious town bully Henry Bowers (a perfectly hateful portrayal by Jarred Blancard) and Beverly's repellent pedophile father. The special effects are likewise sound and convincing, the gore is generous, but never excessive, and the overall atmosphere tense and eerie throughout. An on the money scarefest.",It
15,BA_Harrison,The Right Stuff.,8,9 September 2017,"It's a brave man who takes on the role of Pennywise the clown after Tim Curry's scene-stealing turn in the original miniseries, but this second adaptation of Stephen King's novel sees Bill Skarsgård making the character his own, turning in a memorably different take on the shape-shifting monster that preys on the kids of Derry, Maine (this time in the summer of 1989).Buck toothed with glowing eyes, a disquieting voice and a truly sinister smile (plus a few impressive dance moves), Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise sure is the stuff of nightmares, the actor more than deserving of the praise he has garnered. His is not the only great performance in director Andy Muschietti's re-imagining of the King classic: the kids who play the plucky youngsters who fight back against the monster are all excellent, with Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard putting in a particularly memorable turn as wisecracking Richie Tozier (he gets all of the best lines!).Fright-wise, I can't say that I was ever on the edge of my seat, nor did I jump (years of watching horror films has made me difficult to scare), but I was thoroughly entertained throughout. My daughter, on the other hand, frequently hid her eyes behind her hands, as did the woman sat next to her, so the film clearly had the desired effect on those two.I rate It an impressive 8 beeps out of 10, and look forward to the next movie.",It
16,moonspinner55,"Effective, epic-scaled horror film with kid cast often resembles Goonies in the Temple of Doom",6,8 October 2017,"Stephen King's terrifying bestseller from 1986, first adapted for the small screen in 1990, is brought back to life with this crisp, red-balloon-bloody theatrical version, covering just the first part of King's original story and obviously meant to be followed by a sequel (or more, if Warner Bros. has its way). Every 27 years in the town of Derry, both adults and kids mysteriously go missing (mostly kids); in fact, the woodsy community has an extremely high ratio of missing persons versus the national average. A group of young teenagers in 1989, have-nots and misfits who not only have to face their scary elders every day but also must contend with a carload of carousing school bullies, form a ""Loser's Club"" to fight the evil consuming the town. The ""It"" of the title lives down in the bowels of Derry's centuries-old sewer line, feeds on fear and manifests itself as a killer clown named Pennywise (whose harbinger is a lone red balloon). Pennywise's freaky transmutations are startling and scary, and the kids scream and cower quite naturally until they finally agree to battle It to the death. The film, which is overlong, lays on the brutality with a trowel. It is, in fact, quite vicious and ugly in its mean-spiritedness and, though some may argue this is necessary in the function of the plot, I found the physical violence inflicted on the kids so nasty as to be unsettling. The introductions of the characters aren't very promising, but the young actors do have a way of growing on you (particularly Jaeden Lieberher as William and Sophia Lillis as Beverly). These poor youngsters have it tough, with parents or guardians who are off-balanced and classmates who are out for blood. Director Andy Muschietti makes their surroundings so dangerous that one wonders how anyone survives in Derry.

17,paul_haakonsen,"The way ""IT"" was intended to be...",8,9 June 2018,"I am glad to see that this was actually a Hollywood re-make that improved on something already established, as re-makes tend to be tedious and unnecessary money machines.However, this 2017 remake really upped the game a lot in terms of horror, violence, blood and pure weirdness. They definitely went for a more evil and sinister feel to the movie, and Pennywise shed his family-friendly skin (that he wore in the 1990's version) and draped a cape voven of pure dread.The storyline is much familiar, if you have seen the 1990 edition, but there is so much more added to this 2017 version. It does the novel much more justice.The CGI and special effects are good, and do add a lot of spice to the movie.Pennywise was adequate, although it was a bit difficult taking him serious with those buck teeth and the way he kept pouncing towards the children. The scene where Pennywise was dancing below in the caves was also a bit too comical for my liking.The children were really doing amazing jobs with their characters and roles in this 2017 version.It was definitely worth the wait and the hype.

18,Quinoa1984,"creepy, with a talented director at the helm",8,10 September 2017,"IT, directed by Andres Muschietti, fires on all of the cylinders it has to, and I think my perspective on it is that it does so much that impresses, aside from attempting and mostly succeeding at adapting the ambition of King's book, is that it does a lot that horror movies today DON'T do. This movie doesn't, for example, over-crowd you with jump scares; oh, it has a couple, don't get me wrong, but they aren't so distracting that it ruins the movie (or, for that matter, have the final shot of the film be the character lunging at the camera, like it's a theme park ride and we need one more ""good"" scare), and Andy Muschietti and his DP (who usually shoots Park Chanwook films) pour on the atmosphere here while at the same time NOT doing the thing where horror movies drain the color palette or make things blue. This is a director who trusts the audience and, as the opening weekend would show, it seems to have paid off.He's also attentive to casting everyone just right (only the young actor playing Stan Uris feels like he's just 'okay', but that may be because everyone around him, especially the actors playing Bill and Beverly, are so fully invested in their roles, and by the way casting one of the main kids from Stranger Things to be Richie is so on the nose I love it), and to making Derry feel like a real place - or, if not *as* much as the book does, as much as can be done in a two-hour movie. There are certainly predictable parts to the narrative, as there may have been to its source (mostly this is felt for me when it gets to the second act end and into the third, with some of the CGI in the climax being less than impressive - oh, some of it is really good, and some of it... is not).On top of everything else, Skarsgard surprises with a sinister interpretation of Pennywise. You won't get another Tim Curry performance, you just can't really, but the direction Skarsgard goes in is full of a darkness but also... well, let's put it this way, once you see that scene between Pennywise and Georgie in the opening by the sewer drain, you can believe that this clown *might* appeal to small, impressionable children before, literally, feeding off their fear as well as flesh. It's a turn where every time he came on screen and did something (with the exception of those couple of jump-scares, which made the trailer give the impression it would not be so solid), I was smiling in not a scared expression but simply being entertained by a performer giving it his all. I really hope he gets to do a lot more things as an actor because this is a star-making turn.In closing: the critic who said in one review, ""This is not the best Stephen King movie, but it comes close, but it is the MOST Stephen King movie"" hit it on the head. It isn't great overall and yet I had a blast watching it from start to finish: it's emotional and dramatic and earns those beats; it shows friendship in childhood as a powerful and necessary thing to have and keep a hold of; it's there to scare the hell out of you if you're open to it; and it shows how a good lot of people are... really f***ing creepy. One last thing: it doesn't over-do it's 80's references, and if they're used it's either for actual plant & pay-off in the story (i.e. New Kids on the Block) or a thematic connection (Nightmare on Elm Street 5 is playing at a local theater?

20,Coventry,"No, I don't want your balloon!",5,27 July 2018,"Even more so than with any other Stephen King based horror ""classic"" (although that term is highly debatable), a remake of ""It"" was bound to happen sooner or later. Clowns always were, and always will remain scary, and horror movies with children as the lead protagonists are incredibly popular for some reason. Moreover, the plot about a sleepy little New England town terrorized by a shape-shifting demon feeding on young children is a quite timeless one. It worked in the late 1980s with a fifties setting, it works in 2017 with a late 1980s setting and it will mostly likely work again in 20-30 year, presumably with a turn-of-the-century setting. To be rather frank and abrupt, I found the original film version massively overrated and had little hope that this reboot would be any better; - even despite all the praising reviews and hypes on Internet forums. ""It"" is a very average film, with a very thin plot and exclusively relying on a few strong gimmicks. Come to think of it, the upcoming star-director Andy Muschietti was the ideal man to direct a film like ""It"". Like with his debut ""Mama"", Muschietti again masters in camouflaging a mediocre and derivative plot by throwing in a lot of spooky imagery and seemingly controversial plot aspects. Whilst watching ""Mama"" and ""It"", you quickly get the impression that they are brave and shockingly intense horror productions, but when you start analyzing them, they're not much more than substantially void tales with meticulously pre-measured jump moments. But I must be open and honest about one thing, however, namely that ""It"" has a brilliant and genuinely terrifying opening sequence! The footage of little Georgie chasing his paper boat that is floating in the pouring rain, and then subsequently getting confronted with the smooth-talking yet ultra-menacing clown Pennywise from within the sewer hole, is unbelievable tense and uncomfortable. At the exact same moment when blood stains and heavy rainfall are merging on the street, you already know the film will only be going downhill from here! Unfortunately, 2 hours of film and even the credits then still have to come. The story then unfolds in a very formulaic fashion. A group of social outcast and bullied friends, aptly referring to themselves as ""The Losers Club"", prepare for a long and boring summer in their hometown Derry. One of them is little Georgie's older brother and he still can't fathom that the boy simply vanished. Together, they discover that there's a remarkably higher number of missing children cases in Derry than anywhere else and that gruesome accidents with child casualties strangely occur every 27 years. Peculiar stuff, like evening curfews and numerous ""missing children"" posters on the walls, also appear to be the most common things in Derry. Naturally, all the dreadful clichés and typical Stephen King themes quickly start to follow. Pennywise the Clown is one scary villain, but obviously the real monsters are the adults in town, like the abusive father, the overbearing mother or the violently aggressive cop-father. Outcast kids, including an asthma-patient and an obese boy, transform into brave heroes. When the Losers Club threatens to fall apart, they realize the only way to defeat the demonic Pennywise is to stick together! You know, that sort of moralist nonsense. ""It"" is at its best when the source material, King's Novel, imitates that other great novel ""The Body"", which was also written by Stephen King and turned into the magnificent film ""Stand By Me"" in 1986. Yes, King plagiarizes everybody. Even himself! No, seriously, the child actors are terrific and clearly enjoying themselves the most when they drive around on their BMX bikes and mock each other. Bill Skarsgard is excellent as well, as Pennywise, but the old rule of the horror genre still stands: the less you see of the monster, the more menacing he becomes.",It

22,Hey_Sweden,"What, is, It? It's It! What is It?",7,15 March 2018,"The second adaptation of Stephen Kings' epic-length novel tells the story of seven put-upon pre-teens, living in a small American town called Derry. In the summer of 1989, they discover that all of the towns' children are in danger of being devoured by an ancient, vile entity residing deep underground. Most often, it takes the form of a clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), but can assume the shape of anything that its victims fear the most. These seven kids band together in the hope that they can vanquish this monster.As a fan of the novel who's read it cover to cover a few times, what takes some time getting used to is the fact that Kings' often very specific details and time frames are altered for the current tale being spun. Also, very little of the dialogue from the novel is left intact. Still, the filmmakers, led by director Andy Muschietti (""Mama"") do get some things right - visually the film does play like images and pages from the novel come to life. The ""Barrens"", in particular, look much how I imagined them when reading the novel.Compared to the first adaptation, the TV miniseries back in 1990, this is often more genuinely creepy, and that's a word that may recur to the viewer while watching this. While there is some faithfulness to the source material (the house on Neibolt Street, the leper, etc.), the filmmakers do make up some of their own stuff, such as a painting that understandably freaks out Stan (Wyatt Oleff). In contrast to original Pennywise Tim Curry, who alternated between truly goofy shtick and being a monster, Skarsgard is pretty much just plain Evil.The film is definitely well cast overall, though. As befitting a variation on a King work, the strongest asset is the young cast, their appeal as characters and their camaraderie. Sophia Lillis is a standout as Beverly, the strongest member of the group. This young lady is definitely going places. Finn Wolfhard of the Netflix series 'Stranger Things' has some amusing lines playing Richie, the comic relief of the group. Unfortunately, Stan and Mike (Chosen Jacobs) don't get that much to do. By making Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) the newcomer to town who is obsessed with its history, the film robs Mike of his most potent defining characteristic.All in all, the film tells an entertaining story in capable enough fashion, although it would be true that it doesn't have an exorbitant amount of tension, and sometimes gets by on usage of jump scares.It's a mixed bag, with a rather underwhelming finale, but it does work a fair amount of the time.Regarding the 1990 version, it tended to go downhill when it told part two with the Losers as adults, and one wonders if the sequel to this will suffer the same fate.

It focuses on the kids and their miserable home lives. It moves slow, is full of unpleasant characters and has mediocre acting. Then the second hour starts and things kick into high gear. The pace gets quicker, the blood violence and gore kick in (and barely stop) and it really works. However the main issues here are the slow start and the mediocre acting by the kids.

24,zardoz-13,A Cacophony of Horrific Claptrap!!!,5,17 September 2017,"The best horror movies rely on subtlety to scare the shenanigans out of you. The worst bombard you with CGI galore, and the fiendish monster's arrival is often heralded by ear-shattering, high-decibel blasts of either music or sound effects. ""Mama"" director Andy Muschietti's adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 bestseller ""It"" qualifies as half-baked hokum with its mischievous but demonic, fun-house clown and all the standard-issue shivers that ensue. Muschietti goes for the gullet every time he wants audiences to scream like bloody maniacs in this tiresome, overwrought, 135-minute marathon. Indeed, the movie bristles with heavy-handed homages to 80's movies, including earlier King adaptations, such as ""Stand by Me"" and ""The Shining,"" when it isn't reminiscent of Richard Donner's ""The Goonies"" (1985). The blood, gore, and violence is enough to justify its tame R-rating, but ""It"" never repels you with offensive sights that would generate nightmares. Interestingly, ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984) appeared two years before King's bestseller was published. The ""Nightmare"" influence on King is obvious, and the ghoulish clown Pennywise behaves like Freddie Kruger with his razor-tipped gloves. Freddie preyed on his victims while they slept and sabotaged their dreams, while Pennywise preys on them while they are fully awake. The problem is that only children can see Pennywise and the horror that he unleashes. Meantime, a collection of youngsters, nicknamed 'The Losers Club,' who constitute an ensemble protagonist, is the best thing about ""It."" Although they are adolescent, they are not only believable but also charismatic in their aim to destroy Pennywise. Each kid differs from the other so they are a miscellaneous group. Furthermore, the predicaments that they plunge themselves into are exciting until the cretinous clown rears his ugly head. The actors and actress that portray this motley crew deliver credible performances. Indeed, this youthful group hurl themselves heart and soul into tracking down the wicked clown who has been killing children.""It"" unfolds during a thunderous storm in October 1988 as an older brother, Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher of ""Aloha""), fashions a boat out of paper and wax paste for his younger sibling Georgie (newcomer Jackson Robert Scott) to sail in the gutter. Georgie is having the time of his life when his boat flounders in a storm drain. Miraculously, a guy dressed as a clown, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård of ""Atomic Blonde"") catches the boat. Georgie reaches out to retrieve it, but the clown tears off his forearm and then hauls him into the sewer. Georgie's mysterious vanishing act fuels rumors about a serial killer who slays kids. Bill and his playmates: motor-mouthed Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard of Netflix's ""Stranger Things""), germophobic hypochondriac Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer of ""Tales of Halloween""), Jewish-raised Stanley Iris (Wyatt Oleff of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") befriend a chubby kid, Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor of ""Ant-Man""), who has spent his summer investigating a recurring serial killer in Derry, Maine, that strikes every twenty-seven years. Bill, Richie, Eddie, and Stanley meet Ben after he escapes from the clutches of a trio of bullies led by a sadistic, switchblade-wielding Henry Bowers (Nicolas Hamilton of ""Captain Fantastic"") who carves the letter H into Ben's soft, flabby belly. Ben becomes fast friends with Eddie and company, and later they rescue Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs of ""Cops and Robbers"") from Henry and his hooligans. Each kid suffers from a ghastly encounter with Pennywise the Clown. The guys accept Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"") into their group, and they set out to destroy the horrific Pennywise.Inevitably, Muschietti and scenarists Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauterman have taken liberties with King's thousand page-plus epic novel. For the record, Fukunaga wrote the film ""Beast of No Nations"" about child soldiers fighting a war in an anonymous African nation, while Dauberman penned the infinitely superior horror prequel ""Annabelle Creation."" Whittling the characters down strictly to kids confronting their fears instead of kids as well as adults qualifies as their first editorial decision. The film's stellar box office success has guaranteed a sequel which had been hinted at from the start. If you stick around for the closing credits, you'll see that the film's title has been modified to ""It—Chapter One.'' Comparatively, the flashback-riddled 1990 television miniseries chronicled 'The Losers Club' as both adolescents and adults. Muschietti and his writers have cut the adult counterparts of Eddie and company. Second, they have altered the setting from the 1950s in both the novel and miniseries to the late 1980s. Third, they have swapped around two characters. Instead of Mike Hanlon, Ben has become the group historian who spends his summer in the Derry Library learning about the town's tragic history. In both the novel and the miniseries, Mike Hanlon handled that task. Moreover, Mike was a grown-up when he delved into Derry's past. Fifth, King's novel loosened a monster mash of evil fiends. Not only did Pennywise the Dancing Clown frighten the kids, but also The Mummy, a Werewolf, a ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" gill-man, and Frankenstein's creation got in on the fun. For the sake of simplicity, Muschietti has focused primarily on Pennywise and dropped the other monsters. Furthermore, the kids don't launch silver slugs from slingshots to vanquish their foe in the film. Instead, Mike packs a bolt gun designed to kill animals at his grandfather's farm. Those who have read the novel know that after the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, they got themselves hopelessly lost in the sewer. Beverly decided in the best interests of the group to have an orgy so the guys could come to grips with their hysteria and find their way out of the underground network of sewer lines. Clearly, this scene was left out for obvious reasons. Indeed, ""It"" received an R-rating, but the orgy that Beverly orchestrated in the novel was taboo. Altogether, if you want to scream your lungs out every time that Pennywise makes a startling entrance, ""It"" is your dish of mindless gobbledygook.",It

Director Andy Muschietti punches the scare factor exponentially in this R-rated version (bloodier and more visceral with some gore; um, no not for kids) with a streamlined and affective screenplay by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman by shifting the focus of the group of friends as kids instead of pogo-ing back and forth t their adult versions as the aforementioned TV film did.

The other half, which has the same characters facing up to the reappearance of It (aka Pennywise the Dancing Clown) 27 years later, has yet to be filmed: green lighting the follow-up depends on the success of this movie, and it looks hopeful. Box office seems promising, and deservedly so.If you've never seen a horror film then you'll find this scary. If you have, then I doubt if you'll be scared, but you will certainly find the mood of hidden malevolence effective, especially given the youth of the protagonists. The atmosphere of this film is very well delivered, and captures the feel of the novel extremely well. And it does fairly well at avoiding the temptation to go all Made You Jump noises.The cast of kids are all pretty good although I felt that Finn Wolfhard, playing motormouth Richie Tozier, not only gabbled (completely in line with the character), but did so in a way which made it very difficult to understand what he was saying - I couldn't follow him at all.Sophia Lillis as Bev, 14 years old during filming, is right in the middle of transitioning from child to adult, a fact which is used strongly in her character's arc. You can see the sexuality which is waiting to settle in to a young person who is already striking: she will be a beautiful young woman, and it won't be long until she gets there. Also, she can act.And I suppose I should mention Bill Skarsgard (Stellan's son) as Pennywise. I always thought Tim Curry was deeply scary 27 years ago (there's that number again!): well, Skarsgard is scarier.This is a good film, one of the best adaptations of King's work, and it makes up for the desperately disappointing Dark Tower movie of several weeks ago.",It

But I found mighty little to even creep me out, let alone outright scare me in this film adaptation. I read the book long ago, so my memory might be a little hazy, but as I recall it, this film is only very liberally based on the novel, and only half of the novel at that (the end credits tell us that there is at least one sequel to come). The lack of fidelity, however, is not what I object to in the film. It's the inability of the screenwriters and director to capture on film anything that's remotely as scary as what King conjures in his book. His novel was one sustained note of creeping dread, while the film is hard sell, throwing jump scares and loud sound effects at us, and nothing in it looks like anything we haven't seen in every trailer for every horror movie made in the last 10 years. The cast of young actors is quite good, and indeed the thing I liked best about the movie was its ability to capture that painful and poignant feeling only adults are able to have about childhood because they're looking back on it as something lost. I think I might have been more interested in a movie about that with this cast and director than the one I got, not necessarily a ringing endorsement for a horror movie.The sequel clearly intends to cover the part of the book when all of the adults come back to Derry to once again confront their childhood ghoul, but I don't think I'll be in line to see it.Grade: C",It
31,ferguson-6,beep beep,8,7 September 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. There are two clown schools: Funny clowns (Bozo, Ronald McDonald), and Terrifying clowns (the one in POLTERGEIST, Pennywise the Dancing Clown). Stephen King first introduced Pennywise in the 1986 novel, and the great Tim Curry brought him to life (and our nightmares) in the 1990 TV mini-series (2 episodes). So, that's 27 years since the TV version. How fitting that director Andy Muschietti (MAMA) introduces a new generation 27 years later, since that's how often the supernaturally evil clown visits Derry, Maine to frighten and feast on kids. It's a terrific update.Horror films are similar to comedy films in that it often comes down to one's own personality quirks  what makes you laugh, and what scares you. This new version covers the first half of King's novel, focusing on ""The Losers Club"" – the seven kids who band together to fight their fears. Director Muschietti sets the story in 1989 (rather than the 50's) and the obvious comparisons are to THE GOONIES, STAND BY ME (another King story), and the recent hit ""Stranger Things"". The opening sequence gets us off to a great start. You've probably seen it in the trailer. Young Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) is joyfully splashing through the rain puddles following his paper boat as it disappears into the storm drain. It's there that he meets, and we get our first look at, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard, son of Stellan and brother of Alexander). Giving us an early peek at what we came to see creates time for the development of a long list of characters. Of course the mini-series and the novel didn't have the time restrictions of a feature film, so it's impressive how quickly we connect with the kids.Georgie's older brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberther, MIDNIGHT SPECIAL) is the leader of The Losers despite his propensity to stutter, and his belief that little Georgie may still be alive. Motormouth Richie (Finn Wolfhard, ""Stranger Things"") is the bespectacled wiseass, while Beverly (Sophia Lillis, an Amy Adams lookalike and star in the making) is the tough-on-the-outside female who deals with the rumors that accompany being a teenager. Hypochondriac Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), straight-laced son of the Rabbi Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), chubby brainiac new kid Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), and home-schooled Mike (Chosen Jacobs) round out this group of outsiders who are all frequently the target of bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), creepy parents, and of course, Pennywise.A couple of the set pieces are outstanding. Beverly's bathroom (especially the sink), the creek for the rock fight, and the rickety old house and its corresponding clown lair all contribute to the overall level of menace. Rising star composer Benjamin Wallfisch produces a score that guides us through the thrills and spills, as well as the quieter moments. As for Pennywise, even though the dancing clown had more screen time in the mini-series, Skarsgard is memorable, although the modern day special effects (those teeth!) often diminish the humanistic feel of Curry's clown and escalate things to an other-worldly level. Expect more of the Halloween Haunted House type of scary rather than the emotionally crippling stuff of horror films like THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. The sudden bursts of sinister are surprisingly balanced with the humorous one-liners from the kids, and the actualization of the infamous ""you'll float too"" is a stunning effect. The nostalgic feel complements the best part of the story  the power of friendship and connected groups. Watching these kids face their biggest fears certainly provides a bit of a chill to the upcoming fall season  and as a bonus, it's a fun time for viewers.",It

Somehow missing the title when on at cinema,I was pleased to see a local DVD shop have the title, which led to me finding out what IT is.View on the film:Embodying The Losers Club fears,Bill Skarsgård gives a superb, frightening performance as Pennywise, which clowns around with spider-like stop,start movements, and Skarsgård keeping a murderous wide-grin plastered on Pennywise. The only ones who know the evil in Derry, each of the ensemble "" Losers Club"" give outstanding performances, where the weaknesses they each have are opened up to build a bond with each fellow member, as the ensemble capture the feeling of friendships taking place in a summer long ago.Taking on the first half of Stephen King's epic, the screenplay by True Detective season 1 director Cary Joji Fukunaga/ Chase Palmer & Gary Dauberman do incredibly well at compressing King's tale,whilst retaining its scary soul.

33,Wizard-8,Wrong tone sinks this,3,27 October 2019,"I saw the original two part made for television movie ""It"" when it was first broadcast in 1990, and I enjoyed it very much. I then subsequently read the original Stephen King novel the movie was based on, and not only did I enjoy it as well, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the television movie stuck to what happened in the novel for the most part. When this 2017 theatrical remake came out, I was a little hesitant to watch it, in part because it was already done very well back in 1990, and this remake announced it was updating the time period. But when the movie came on Netflix, I decided to give it a look, seeing that it would be a free viewing.It did not take me long to realize that this remake was pretty much a failure. To sum up how this remake gets it wrong, I'll just say that it's too ""rock n roll"" to work. The novel and the original 1990 movie were calmer, more subtle, and as a result were much more effective in building and sustaining horror. Also, this remake pretty much guts the original story to do its own thing. Maybe that was so it couldn't be compared to the original movie and make it be judged on its own merits. I can understand that, but what they do instead is hammer onto the audience over and over one ""jump scare"" after another with what seems to be random horror images instead of one true menace. This got old REALLY fast, and I soon didn't care about the characters or what was happening. It's almost plotless.With the original novel still in print, and the original TV movie available on DVD and Blu-ray, there's no reason to seek out this remake. I strongly suspect King himself feels it's one of the lesser adaptations of his written works.",It

Had promise, however never coming close to eventuating.Who's the target audience for this film? Certainly isn't me. The film would be too scary and gruesome for little kids nor do I think it's language appropriate, yet it's not for adults. Wouldn't really call it a film either, it's just a bunch of scenes splashed together. Once the kids started having hallucinations, which is early in the film, I kind of felt like turning it off, but I stuck it out. I hate that sort of stuff, it's just lazy writing. The kid actors were pretty decent even though I didn't really care about any of them. Jeremy Ray Taylor's character Ben was the best of the bunch. Please don't show me Beverly having moments with Ben and then being with Bill for no reason. Don't show me Eddie getting his cast signed by the girl bully in the drug store, then walking around with loser written on his cast without even showing Eddie's reaction to it in the moment.

35,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Incredibly fun and enjoyable effort,10,23 December 2017,"Living in small-town Maine, a group of misfit friends finds that the local legends and myths about a demonic clown that terrorizes the community has haunted the town in the past and returned to target them, bringing the group together with their shared bond to fight the being off.This one ended up being quite the impressive effort. One of the major selling points for this one is the fact that there's such an extreme amount of influence here to show the threat the title villain really musters. By constantly being a force within the storyline as everyone essentially encounters the being, there's plenty of buildup here to his threat which is quite important in making him out to be a figure to be reckoned with. His constant freak appearances, from the library-room encounter to the appearance in the meat-store and off in the underground sewer where the zombie-like previous victims appear to help ease the attack in all combine into helping set-up the threat he represents. The fact that they tie into the backstory of the town itself, from the numerous murders and disappearances to the way he's become a figure of myth and legend for the accidents he causes that help to spur this on even further as well as is physical appearance being such a terrifying being. The make-up and overall design is perfectly chilling to make him feel like a malevolent figure that is perfectly capable of committing the atrocities they bring up about him. He comes off as someone at the center of the big exploits within here, from the encounter in the bathroom with all the blood erupting from the sink to the terrifying scene in the garage where it appears out from the projection while the showstopping scene of them fighting him off inside the abandoned shack gives this plenty of utterly fantastic action while having it take place inside the shack has an atmosphere that has a lot to like overall here in keeping with the brutal action inflicted upon kids. Although not as immediately terrifying, the final battle underground does make for a solid and truly fun battle with the clown as the group continually tries to get the upper-hand with their limited knowledge of what's going on as well as utilizing their friendship bond to solid effect throughout the battle. As well, the big facet that works well here is the idea that kids are explicitly and deliberately the target here with plenty of fine graphic action committed against them which manages to add an extra dose of terror and fear to the main villain. Coupled with their stellar bond together that develops throughout here, thone emerges as a rather fine genre piece overall. About the only real flaw to be found here is a sense of hammering home way too many useless and unnecessary points in the final half about their terrible home-life, from his influence on the town to the abusive home-life she has to live with and them simply gaining in numbers merely because it's convenient. This does grow tiresome at points, but it's still not enough to really lower this that much.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language from underage individuals, Graphic Violence against children, continuous notions of children-in-jeopardy and themes of child abuse.",It
36,trashgang,"not scary, but still worth seeing",7,2 October 2017,"And so IT went. After the disastrous summer with all failing flicks IT was going to be the next thing. IT would make up the summer and would become the blockbuster this year needed, so the campaign was up for IT. Everywhere you go you couldn't ignore IT. All jokes aside, I just seen the notorious flick.First of all, with Stranger Things being an instant Netflix hit concerning children as the main lead it was clear that flicks with kids do work. So a remake of 'IT' was in the make. By using children you could go two ways. They are the victims or they are the heroes and in IT, they are a bit victim but mostly hero. Is that a problem, not at all but that means that IT isn't going to be a flick for the hard core horror geeks. Secondly, made as a blockbuster and having kids in IT, you don't have to think twice, no use of red stuff or nudity at all. This means that what could have become a gory flick, because Pennywise is evil, doesn't happen at all, sure, he do bites but the gore is left out of IT. Watch the beginning when an arm is bitten off...and you will get IT what I do mean.Is it all that bad, no, because Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) really looks evil and scary at some moments and the effects used for Pennywise are above mediocre. To be honest, all effects are top notch. And the kids are believable too. But sadly IT isn't scary at all. What does work is Pennywise talking and looking but he doesn't offer jump moments or goosebumps. The creepiest part for me is the thing going on between Beverly March (Sophia Lillis) and her dad (Stephen Bogaert). That do offers awkward moments and you will get it what is going on between the two. The bathroom scene also with Beverly is creepy.Is IT the flick I was waiting for. I thought it was going to be creepier than what I saw, maybe a bit too long especially the end. Worth seeing but unforgettable, I don't think so.

If like me, the viewer saw the mini-series then the same old same storyline of King's group of misfit kids battling in another Stand by me. The flawed characters grab the viewers interest and give real life to a fictional story. Adolescence dealing with dysfunctional parents is a theme of It which creates realistic teenage angst. It's humor and behavior etc reminds me of growing up. Everyone hates the clown too, which represents fears and plays on weaknesses. Well acted and directed etc for a good thriller.

It was something special and is probably the number one cause of people being afraid of clowns now. Not that I get why you would be afraid of clowns though, but my wife is, so to me it's funny to watch her being scared. Is this version from 2017 better than it's predecessor? I would definitely say yes. The story is the same but the make-up and special effects are creepier. But nothing beats the book though. And that's for almost all the movies taken from books. Aspecially the ones from Stephen King. Most of his books are way better than their movie adaptations. ""It"" isn't an exception.

However, it is a bit of a letdown. The CGI and special effects that everyone seems to complain about, I find fine and probably the best thing here. No, it is rather that this is really a very slight tale with so many big bangs and whistles at the expense of character development that there is nothing to care about. There are a couple of very worrying domestic scenes involving the beautiful Sophia Lillis that hold the attention but nothing else. Too much bullying, too many unfunny juvenile jokes, too much cycling in a group, oh and too much like a certain TV series. Even without the participation of Finn Wolfhard this bears a striking resemblance to Stranger Things and, okay, that may have been influenced by the writings of King but this is as if it is three episodes lashed together with all the charm, humour and adult involvement removed. Wonderfully good to look at but at over two hours far too long for something without feeling or engagement.",It
40,siderite,Stranger Things did it so much better,7,17 March 2018,"I cannot say that IT is a bad movie, quite the opposite: it was well acted, scary, interesting. However, you have to naturally compare it with three things: the source material, the miniseries and Stranger Things, which was released just a year before and even featured one of the same actors in the film. And my personal opinion is that with this comparison, the film loses its shine. Admittedly, it only covers the first part of the IT story (with the obligatory sequels coming out soon), but still, it felt like it lacked courage. Compared to the book, only hints (and I am glad they added those) of the underlying themes in the book are found: the constant bullying of the redneck older kids, the adults ignoring with impunity the plight of kids around them, turning a blind eye to anything they weren't comfortable about, the creepy pharmacist and step dad, the sexual awakening of the kids. Oh, and before you say ""God, that girl is beautiful! I totally get the pharmacist."" Sophia Lillis is 15! I felt like the movie went too much in favor of special effects, while making the clown less potent, regardless of Bill Skarsgård's great acting.  However, compared to Stranger Things, it was all done simply less well. Did the movie have to be set in the 80's? It had, because the second part has to be 27 years later and they didn't want to make the sequel in the future (although that would have been rad!). But considering that the group of bike riding geeky 80's kids has been done just a bit before, it felt old! Stranger Things went over the trope of ""bad kid always a bad kid"" which the movie fully embraced. The characters, for a two hour long movie, were also less fleshed out like I would have liked them. The dynamics of the kid group were also better in the series. Bottom line: without comparing it, the movie is clearly above average, but I have to say that with the quantity and quality of ideas at their disposal, the film's team could have done more. I felt that they chickened out. This had the potential to blow Get Out out of the water with social commentary and focus on the real ideas King explored in the book. The movie had the opportunity to take the story and make it better. Instead, they went with a mere shoe shine of an adaptation that brought nothing new to the table.",It

And really this picture has plenty of gore, blood, and fright scenes to try and to be scary in an old fashioned kind of way! The story is simple it takes place in Maine upstate in a small town and the kids all around seem to have a problem of disappearing and seeing sightings of a strange clown, as one by one it's not safe to go out as a curfew is in place all over town. Yet thru history and research it's found that these clowns and missing children have been around for decades it's like it's a history curse.

42,thesar-2,It Follows a Nightmare on King's Sandlot,8,1 October 2017,"And they say remakes are never better than the original. This one highly surpassed the two before it!Yes, two. Not just the 1990 original TV disaster, but Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984 – two years prior to the novel being published. As I watched this movie, I kept feeling the wonder and fright of the original Freddy Krueger movie. And I was laughing to myself when Freddy, himself, all-but made a cameo in this film.This film seems to be following the latest trend of 80s nostalgia, so much so, it stars the same child actor from the best 80s recreation in modern history: Netflix's Stranger Things. I'm certainly not complaining, when done right, as in this movie, it's wonderful to transport back to that era when I grew up. This is probably another reason why I also got the Freddy-vibe since around this film's time frame happened, I discovered and fell in love with The Springwood Slasher.To say 2017's It was better than the 1990 miniseries is like loving pizza more than cancer. There IS NO comparison. I recently watched the messy TV movie and cringed at all the poor dialogue, unintentionally bad acting and terrible decisions of the flashbacks. This timethey got it right.Summer 1989 – my favorite summer (and year) of movies and shown wonderfully here with Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child playing at their local theatre – many kids go missing and so does police procedures. It's almost as if the police, and town, for that matter, are working with whatever's taking the children. (Supposedly, adults are taken, but that's only briefly mentioned and never shown or brought up again.)A trio of best buds (playfully?) nicknamed The Losers, double their size when chance coincidences occur and that's a good thing. They'll need each other to face a hallucinating devil clown after them who uses their fears against them.I have said this so many times, in fact, just in my last review, but Damn! I wish I saw this as a kid, the same age as these boys. While I was already hooked by this point on horror, if I hadn't been, this would've been a wonderful introduction, a gateway if you will, to scary movies. But, be that as it may, I really dug this film.Wonderfully shot, great acting from absolute kids that totally stole the movie from any adult actor and genuine frights. This had a merciful and well needed R-rating that the 1990 version sadly lacked.While it was a tad long at times and scenes certainly could've been cut to smooth out the pacing – the cleaning up blood, rock 'n roll montage really felt out of place here, despite the 80s vibe. I wouldn't have gone as far as to squeeze Stephen King's brilliant 1,138-page novel into one movie, but it certainly didn't need to be over 2 hours. Any fan of horror, the book It, Stephen King in general or new to exploring horror, this is a must-watch. It was refreshing to go back to what horror felt like to me in the late 80s.***Final thoughts: October Day 1: 2017's It. We're off to a great start! Well, until day 2's Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II. But, in my defense, I'm only watching that for the first time as it coincides with the date and I've always loved the name and poster. Oh, and huh, *that* movie was released mere months before this film's opening took place. Go figure.",It
43,cherold,exciting although surprisingly un-scary,8,29 August 2019,"Like the miniseries Stranger Things, It hearkens back to 80s filmmaking, falling somewhere between Stand By Me and Poltergeist. While ostensibly a horror movie, in spirit it is more a coming-of-age drama with a monster.The movie is not particularly scary, even by Poltergeist standards, but it is quite exciting, particularly in the final, thrilling confrontation. The movie also does a lovely job of reminding us that not all evil dwells in the sewer, with some of the most disturbing scenes being purely human; I was ultimately more scared of Bev's father than of Pennywise.The kid's are all excellent. I like how little they fit to typical stereotypes; the stuttering kid is the brave one, the kid with glasses is a sex hound rather than a nerd, and the chubby kid is a scholar.I don't have strong feelings about Pennywise. He is probably most effective in that first disturbing scene, but unfortunately I had already seen the SNL/Kellyanne Conway parody of that scene which was so dead-on that it impacted how seriously I could take the movie Pennywise (it's not the movie's fault, of course, that Kate MacKinnon captured the role so well). The actor doesn't have as strong a personality as Tim Curry did in the previous version of It, and ultimately seems like more a vehicle for evil rather than a distinct character.",It

45,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Impressive, rewarding re-boot of the epic King tale",9,10 September 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the small town of Derry, Maine in the 1980s, a series of children have gone missing, including (through creative licence) George, the younger brother of Bill Denbrough. Bill is one of a group of kids who've banded together and called themselves The Losers Club, due to their respective characteristics that make them social outcasts. Whilst they dodge various obstacles, including school bullies and abusive adults, they are drawn into a battle with the perpetrator of the missing children, a demonic clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who only they can see through their youthful minds.Well, in recent times it's harder to think of a project that has generated quite as much anticipation as Andy Muschetti's big screen adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel, which the near breakdown of the internet on the uploading of the first teaser trailer bears testament to. After years of speculation and lingering in 'development hell', to the point where it almost seemed it would never be made, finally it is here. It will have the biggest impact with big fans of the book, but, perhaps more significantly, of the original 1990 TV movie with Tim Curry (including myself), whose performance as the iconic Pennywise would seem impossible to better.While Skarsgard doesn't better Curry's performance, in his own way he at least equals it, making the role his own and having an undeniable presence and charisma to be a scary Pennywise for a new generation, even if his costume does look like a Smiffy's Alice in Wonderland costume for clowns. Being a younger actor than Curry, he brings a more naïve, childlike persona to the role, and is a lot less frequent on the wisecracks. Comparing the two performances, there's definitely a Jack Nicholson/Heath Ledger thing going on, with Muschetti aiming for something more darker, from the central performance and from the material, displaying far more gruesome and unsettling things from the book that the 90s TV film wouldn't allow, not to mention more extreme swearing from the kids.The shifting of the time period from the 1950s to the 1980s isn't a problem in and of itself, if you overlook the different social attitudes and customs, and one can only surmise Muschetti was trying to appeal to a more modern audience by doing it. Their different personalities made each of the seven losers so unique, and here the individual traits that made them who they are are explored in greater depth, something that extends to the bully Henry Bowers. And, Skarsgard's performance allows Pennywise to blossom into a truly solid character of his own. Unlike the individual flashback to childhood from adulthood segments of the original series, this tells the childhood part of the story all at once, for a flat out 135 minutes, something Muschetti will probabl repeat with part two. On the basis of this, that's something we can all look forward to. ****",It
46,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Feels like two totally different movies mashed together; an occasionally suspenseful horror flick with visual flair.,7,25 February 2018,"'It (2017)' feels like two totally different movies mashed together. At times, the combination is successful, most notably when the rag-tag team of friends (whom are all played remarkably well by the young actors) band together to face their fears and tackle the forces that threaten them. For the first half of the piece, though, these differing genres exist almost entirely in isolation from one another, with only the occasional scare reminding both us and the characters of the danger lurking in the sewers just out of view. This lack of discipline, which leads to a slightly odd structure and a pretty lax pacing, makes the already long picture seem even longer. Yet the film is never boring nor does it ever come close to being so. The teen-drama aspects are compelling enough to carry you through to the horror elements later on. When things truly kick off, the feature becomes much more entertaining and suspenseful. It puts you in the shoes of the kids and becomes incredibly crowd-pleasing when they start to fight back. Even though it is never particularly scary, it is often fairly tense. The inhuman killer clown Pennywise is notably good, too, in both design and performance, though he doesn't appear as often as perhaps advertised. 7/10",It
47,bowmanblue,A competent little remake,7,25 September 2017,"I suppose my enjoyment on the 2017 remake of Stephen King's classic novel 'It' is based on two things (1) the fact that I'm very familiar with the original film adaptation and (2) I saw it a few weeks after it came out in the cinema, therefore I'd already been exposed to the numerous positive reviews claiming that, in a summer of lackluster Box Office performances, It 'saved' the summer's takings. However, once I left the cinema, I was left a little disappointed. I'm not saying that I hated the film, just that it didn't – quite – live up to expectations.It's about seven youngsters who discover an evil creature has been stalking and killing kids throughout the history of their town and need to survive the summer holidays before it gets them, too (think 'Stand By Me' but with a monster). Films with children as the leads do sometimes tend to struggle, however, I'm pleased to say that all the youngsters rise to the occasion and perform admirably and you'll have no problem believing that this band of self-confessed 'losers' would hang out in real life.Despite all the kids being good at what they do, there are seven of them and a couple seem to get overshadowed and pushed to the back burners. I know the original source material had seven, so they had to kind of keep to that template, but a couple could have quite easily been left out. I think the one girl of the group, Beverly, (played by Sophia Lillis) is the stand out star and probably one to watch for future films.But, no matter how good the kids are, most people are there to see the monster – aka 'Penniewise' the clown. He was made famous by Tim Curry's excellent performance in the original and many wondered how this could be topped. Despite some people objecting to how the clown looks now (yes, he's slightly different, but no less scary), the major difference is how he acts. He isn't as vocal as Tim Curry was. Curry was constantly gabbling his gibberish while stalking the youngsters. This time Penniewise relies more on transformations to intimidate his prey. However, this links nicely into the involvement of the special effects which are used well to convey the dread Penniewise inspires in his victims prior to killing them and feasting on their fear.I guess my major gripes came with the fact that it stuck a little too closely to the original, therefore I kind of knew who lived and who died, therefore taking away any worry I felt when one of the kids was in danger. Plus, as I've already said, it's quite a long film (or it seemed like that to me!). By 'long' I mean that I felt like it should have ended numerous times before it actually did. I kept expecting the screen to fade to black and people start leaving the cinema, only for it to start up again and continue.But, ultimately, it was still a pretty watchable film. I can actually see the point in remaking this classic horror flick. I guess it's probably not really meant for me, as the original Tim Curry version will always be my 'It.' However, I can see new audiences who have never watched the audience really enjoying it (as other reviews suggest).Probably a 7/10 from me, but a 8-9/10 from new audiences as there are some genuine scares which transgress old and new audiences alike.",It
48,ThomasDrufke,Blending Horror and a Heartfelt Story,9,9 September 2017,"I always find it difficult to get scared when a horror film stays strictly in the supernatural realm. Luckily, 'It' blends a freaky supernatural-like villain in Pennywise the clown, mixed with some seriously psychological thrills that the Loser Club goes through. Perfectly balancing some thought provoking horror with a heartfelt story, 'It' delivers on almost every level, and gives us one of the best Stephen King adaptations of all time.I've said it before and I'll say it again, the most important thing in a film is the story and the script that services that story. It all starts with the character, and the characters here are written so well, particularly in the loser's club. When you're making a coming of age film, it's very easy to fall into the trap of clichéd Hollywood high school talk between young kids hanging out, which to be completely honest, is the easiest way to lose an audience. However, 'It' plays it far more realistic. Of course, that could backfire, but the interplay between the various kids in this film makes for some hilarious moments. And that's the main reason why the scares later in the movie work so well.I bought into all of the relationships and therefore, worried for the characters when Pennywise does his tormenting. His tormenting, by the way, is downright terrifying. Not necessarily jump-out-of-your-seat scary like some horror films, but visually striking for the audience, and scarring for the characters involved. I'm not going to have nightmares, but living through the characters makes for a terrifying experience nonetheless. Speaking of Pennywise, he does some pretty messed up things to the kids in this movie, and in order to be that satisfying with the scares, you needed that R rating. There are quite a few scenes that I won't be able to get out of my head because they were so dang visually unique. I should give a few words to recognize the director, Andy Muschietti, who has done a little directing before this, but nothing as mainstream as 'It'. I'll definitely be on the look-out for his work now, and hopefully he hops on board to direct chapter 2 as well, because his work here is truly impressive. Managing to direct teenage actors to the likeness that he did, making an iconic character come to life as well as he did with Pennywise, and balancing horror and a heartfelt story are all incredibly difficult but yet he made them look so easy. So great directing, visually distinct style, rapid pace, well-written characters, and one terrifying clown makes for one of the best horror films of the last few years.

And just too much of the kids sitting around talking and not moving the plot along. Having blood spew forth from a sink soaking the bathroom was not scary.

50,gbill-74877,Needed restraint,4,7 November 2018,"A film that needed some subtlety, but then again I'm not into modern horror so take whatever I say with a grain of salt (or ignore this review entirely). I wasn't wild about the canned moments to induce shock, the CGI, and the gratuitous violence, and wish some restraint had been exercised (but I know I'm in the minority, and what the hell did I expect?-) I did like the underlying symbolism of the evil that besets this town and these kids. It's unleashed every 27 years, which I took to represent each new generation that comes along. Everyone has their demons while growing up, their fears, their nightmares. We see evil in the form of sadistic bullying, incestual rape, and in the apathy to kids who simply disappear - all of which are real life things. Adults are rarely to be seen, and when they are, it's certainly not to bring order to the chaos. It's clearly written through the lens of the adolescent and the hell of growing up. Standing up to one's fears and sticking together is the only hope of overcoming them, and it felt like it echoed some of the themes of 'Stand By Me' in that way. I think if it had been tightened up - edited down, less haphazard, less jump scenes, shorter - I think it would have been more powerful. I also wasn't a fan of the unabashed reference to a sequel at the end. If you're into the genre, I'm sure you'll like it better. Hey, I'm just a guy who thinks of the earlier 'It' movie - and no, not the 1990 version of the same Stephen King story, the 1927 lighthearted film starring Clara Bow. :p",It

I was so impressed by how this movie had been hyped up and how it actually lived up to said hype! I was so eager to see this movie that I actually started reading the original ""It"" novel by Stephen King. I am glad to be back into reading novels. I realize I've been so obsessed with movies I've lost an old love. Anyway, this is a film that just keeps getting better and better. I think it's much better than the original ""It"". Then again, I found the original to be just okay. It's mostly the second half where things in that mini-series get goofy.Of course, this did only cover the first half of the book so maybe it'll get worse later. I'm really glad that Pennywise only talked a little in the movie as he became much more intimidating as a silent antagonist. I still loved his voice and I love how they've changed the design from the miniseries, although I don't remember if the book was very different. This movie takes place in the 1980's instead of the 1950's that the book takes place in at this part. It's great to update a story but not changing any important details to make it more relevant to a modern age, or I guess a 1980's age.Richie is probably my favorite character as he had some of the best lines. It's weird how the film works great serious yet it's actually more intentionally funny than a lot of horrible comedies. Well, what wouldn't be? I thought the film was going to end after only 85 minutes as it certainly seemed like that, but the four star rating from this came after they continued it and had this awesome climax. In the mini-series, they just defeat Pennywise with silver. In this movie, they instead beat him up and learn not to fear him. That's way more awesome. There's nothing after the credits, though. ****",It

I was impressed by the young cast and by the unsettling visual effects. The story feels a little repetitive, though, and Pennywise didn't cause the dread in the pit of my stomach that I got from Tim Curry's version. Still, I'm looking forward to seeing the second half of this story.",It
53,lesleyharris30,"Thrilling and Surprisingly Hilarious,",8,30 October 2017,"It is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. Based on the well known Stephen King novel, the movie shines for its range, not simply trying to scare us all the time, it is actually really funny. There is an amazing back and forth between the main characters, with impeccably well written dialogue that had me in stitches, while also being able to effortlessly jump back to more serious moments. I did think it fell a little flat in terms of thrills, I would be lying if I said Pennywise did not frighten me on a few occasions, but he appears so frequently that he becomes like any other character after awhile as a result of how used to seeing him we become. As well as that, the humour was a bit too American at times for me, there were jokes that I simply did not find funny, and that was because it was really only for the state it was shot in, this is only on a few occasions, but it's noticeable. The cast is phenomenal, there is not a big name in the bunch, and it makes for a splendid viewing that is not taken away by star power. All the kids are terrific, they have a tremendous chemistry together and it does not feel like we are watching young actors act, but literally a gang of friends hanging out. Finn Wolfhard is the standout, for me, every piece of dialogue he has as Richie is stellar and he steals every scene he is in. Bill Skarsgård is completely engrossing as Pennywise, a difficult role to take on, especially in following the great Tim Curry, he adds a lot of depth to the part, his eyes being enough to reel us in on their own. Laugh out loud and edge of your seat suspense. As funny as it is thrilling, fans of the novel or the 1990 film will not be disappointed by It, worth the watch if you are looking for a good horror. A group of children band together when a clown that only they can see begins terrorising them. Best Performance: Finn Wolfhard",It

Along the way they recruit more members (Sophia Lillis, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Chosen Jacobs) with knowledge of the town's missing child epidemic.The gang eventually links the disappearances to a demonic clown (Bill Skarsgård) living in the sewer system.The first feature film adaptation of Stephen King's infamous jester Pennywise, newcomer Skarsgård nails the creepy clown, making the scary moments even more so. Condensed compared to the 1990 miniseries, this streamlined version is a flawless fright-fest. Incidentally, the only one powerful enough to defeat an evil clown is a kid's party magician.

57,ironhorse_iv,"Even with some flaws, this horror movie still had the IT-Factor. It was very entertaining.",8,17 September 2017,"Once upon a time, clowns used to bring out, joy out of children. Then, author, Stephen King's 1986's horror novel, 'It' came out of nowhere and nearly destroy that industry; by causing 'coulrophobia' AKA 'the fear of clowns' to become more common. While, it's true, that a few scary tricksters in novels, had existed for a very long time; such as author, Edgar Allen Poe's 1849's short story 'HopFrog', 1892 Italian opera, 'Pagliacci', and most recently, the Joker from Detective Comic's 'Batman' fame from the 1940s. Stephen King's novel takes the carnivalesque performance into a bizarre, but interesting direction by having a mysterious out of this world being, exploited the fears and phobias of its childhood victims by disguising itself with the form of a clown, in order to devour them. If you think, this plot already sounds crazy. I haven't gotten to, the outrageous meat of this novel; which includes under-aged gang-bang, statues of Paul Bunyan coming to live, cosmic turtles, and odd rituals against Universal Movie Monsters. Not only that, but the book was divide, by two major story arches: one focusing on the kids, trying to survive, and the other chapter, the kids reunited as adults to finally attempt to kill the beast. All of this, is way too much for a story! It's come across, as muddled, excessive, and highly gimmicky. That's why, this novel is highly regarded, as one of Stephen King's weakest books & often view as not filmable. Nevertheless, it didn't stop, movie studios from trying; as in 1990, the novel was adapted into a television miniseries starring Tim Curry as the demonic clown. For the most part, the miniseries was a lot better than the book as it omitted a lot of the craziest, and stupider stuff, however, it was still total crap for its bad acting, awful cheesy effects, and pacing issues. Although, the miniseries has many flaws, it has gather, a cult following over the years to the point, that a remake was welcome. In 2017, we got that reboot, and it was surprising, pretty damn good. Not perfect, but entertaining enough, to overlook, its flaws. Directed by Andy Muschietti, with a screenplay by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman. The film really does a good job, cutting the fat. Instead of a dual anachronic order narrative, the film purely focuses on the development of the characters as children; meaning no awkward repetitive flashbacks; making more of a tighter film. However, there was still a structure for this coming to age horror movie, I didn't like. The way, the film intermixed the lighthearted comedy like boy bands with the disturbing imagery aspect of dead people was a bit jarring. It was kinda weird to see characters, in a state of unpleasant anxiety, one second, due to an attempt attack by Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) or sadistic bullies like Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), only for a few minutes, be alright to go outside to hang out with friends at the lake. Also the idea, that these children would be alright, in staying in a town, where a mysterious creatures kills people, the whole summer, was also a bit unrealistic. In truth, these children should be, more scar for life & living in paranoia, than they were. They should be locked up in their house, ready for anything, since the movie never explain, how Pennywise can get you, or not. The idea that they can coexisted with this creature, around, is, insane. Also, the span of the tragic events, should only, take, place, during a couple of days, not weeks. Furthermore, the third act of one of them, getting caught, a month after the last attack, seems a bit force, rush, and highly clichés. The whole damsel in distress, love triangle third act was not great. Despite that, the CGI visual effects and practical makeup effects were great, during the action moments. Lots of really frightening moments like that projector scene; throughout the movie; only a few of them, were duds, like the leper. I just wish, the movie could be, a little more subtle with some of the jump scares like they did with the creepy librarian and the television show playing in the background. Way too many loud noises, kinda ruins the suspense. Nevertheless, Bill Skarsgård does a great job as Pennywise, even if the film doesn't attempt to make his character seem, that deceiving as a villain. I love how one of Pennywise's eyes is always fixed on the camera, giving the impression that he can see the audience watching the movie. So creepy. As for the children, the acting from them, is also great. Mad props goes to Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis & Finn Wolfhard as Bill Denbrough, Beverly Marsh, and Richie Tozier. They did a hell of a job, making these characters, seem real. I really got the loss of innocence story, even if the update piece remind me of a gorier version of Netflix's TV Series, 'Stranger Things', with its homage to 1980s nostalgia. Overall: It's a must watch from me. Highly recommended. Even, Stephen King himself was very happy with the movie after seeing it early. 'It' was a fun enough thrill ride. This movie truly does float.",It

59,The-Sarkologist,Knowing the Story Hurts it somewhat,7,10 September 2017,"The biggest problem with this film is that if you have either read the book, or seen the earlier mini-series, then you have a pretty good idea of what is going on, and that honestly has an effect of really ruining this film. In fact I spent half the film thinking that it was basically a cut down version of the book (which I haven't read yet, but I want to), or the previous film and it was having the effect of ruining what is actually a really well made movie. Honestly, as the film progressed, I was becoming more and more impressed, but I could not shake that nagging feeling that there was actually supposed to be more, and also that the mystery had been ruined. However, one of my concerns was allayed when the film ended and we were told that this is basically chapter one.The story, like a lot of King's stories, is set in a rural New England town named Derry and centres around a group of children who are sort of outcasts – in fact they refer to themselves as 'the Losers Club'. Every twenty-seven years the town is tormented by a spate of disappearing children, and as such they are forbidden to go out at night. However the children suffer horrifying hallucinations, and one of them happens to be a clown, Pennywise, that seems to shift in and out of the corner of their visions. The movie actually begins with a child chasing a boat down the street and is then captured by the clown, and we immediately know that there is something sinister going on.The children, one of whom happens to be the brother of the child from the beginning, decide to get to the bottom of this mystery. Mind you, there is always this tug of war between simply enjoying the summer, and actually finding out what is going on. All the while they are being tormented by hallucinations, and other horrors that the town throws up at them, including some teenage bullies.The film tackles the horror themes that King likes to explore quite well. At times it feels like a slasher flick, but then turns around and proves us wrong. There is a reason why King is referred to as the master of horror because the supernatural always seems to be a side issue to the real horror of what is going on. For instance there is the horror of the unknown – children disappear all the time, and it is not necessarily because some monster is lurking in the sewers.For instance the monsters aren't always supernatural, they may simply be over protective parents. Sure, the parents believe they love their children, but the fear of losing them overwhelms them to the point that they become over protective. The film does well in trying to follow the line of somebody who is normally a good person turning into a monster simply through fear. In fact fear is what is the driving force of the movie, because in part it is about overcoming ones fear. In a way by overcoming one's fear one can actually overcome the monsters that lurk around the corner.The question that bugs me now is whether to look at reading the book before the next movie comes out, or not.",It

63,paulclaassen,Not compelling enough. Not scary.,5,20 June 2018,"There's something very disturbing about a monster hunting kids! This being said, as well, the film is definitely not for children. The film reminded me so much of 'Stand by me' but with a horror twist. This is no doubt a classy piece of work, very well done with a superb young cast. I did find it a bit slow moving, though, with not too much happening, as well. It finally became quite violent, and I'm talking domestic violence here, not from a horror point of view. I get it, the monster lives on children's fear, but it became rather disturbing on an entirely different level. I did not find the film compelling enough, although Pennywise was well acted by Bill Skarsgard and also rather scary at times. The film in general was not scary at all, mainly because ""nothing was real"". The Well House also looked very similar to the house in 'Monster House'.Mother hen, the effects during the climax was great!",It

65,tomgillespie2002,"It is creepy but never scary, and works better as a coming-of-age drama",6,17 January 2018,"After what was a difficult and drawn-out development process, few would have expected It, an adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name and re-imagining of Tommy Lee Wallace's 1990 mini-series, to be such a colossal hit. The project first went into development back in 2009, with David Kajganich penning the screenplay for Warner Bros., who were understandably concerned with adapting such a hefty and thematically complex novel into one feature film. Cary Fukunaga signed on as director in 2012, with the production duties moving to New Line and Will Poulter lined up for the lead, before they both parted ways due to creative differences and scheduling conflicts. Mama's Andy Muschietti signed up as director in 2015, and filming finally commenced in 2016, with Bill Skarsgard on board as the titular alien clown. It was all a bit of a mess, but when the trailer debuted on Youtube and smashed the record for most views in 24 hours, it became clear that It would be a bona fide hit.Since its release, It has pulled in $700 million off a $35 million budget, and is now the highest-grossing horror movie of all time, and the third highest-grossing R-rated movie. And for good reason. It is happy to deliver jump shocks and conform to the genre's tropes, but this is a handsomely-shot and wonderfully-acted coming-of-age drama too. It is The Goonies meets Stand by Me, only with a child-killing clown lurking in the background. Tim Curry's performance in the 1990 original is iconic and pretty scary, and I'm disappointed we'll never get to see what Will Poulter would have done with the role, but Bill Skarsgard proves to be a menacing presence underneath the thick clown make-up and razor-sharp teeth. The opening scene in which he confronts young Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) from a storm drain (""You'll float too..."") is nastier than Wallace's version, and sets the tone for Muschietti's film. It doesn't shy away from the gruesome side of horror, and certainly doesn't take it easy on the kids at the heart of the story.A year after Georgie's disappearance, his older brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) still hasn't given up hope. Much to his father's annoyance, he maps out the entire sewer system of Derry, Maine to calculate where his brother may be hiding, or where his corpse may have washed up. The stuttering youngster is part of the 'Losers Club', a gang of bullied school kids who enjoy spending their summers exploring the town's surrounding areas on their bikes, but always wary of mulleted bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton). Making up the rest of the gang are hypochondriac Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), timid rabbi's son Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), and the motor-mouthed Richie (Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard). They start to piece together an explanation for the alarming number of disappearances in the town's history when tubby new kid Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) researches the history of his new home. Everything seems to point to a deadly entity lurking in the sewers named Pennywise, a shape-shifting clown who changes his appearance based on the children's individual fears. It also appears to sexual abuse victim Beverly (Sophia Lillis) and slaughterhouse worker Mike (Chosen Jacobs), who both find a refuge in the Losers Club.The decision to move the action from the 50's to the 80's seems like a no-brainer, especially for those of us who were born in the decade of perms and massive shoulder pads. It ramps up the nostalgic appeal, and the film is at its best when recapturing the spirit of the best coming-of-age movies. Yet for all of It's positives, Muschietti plays the horror frustratingly safe. It's competently done, but every time Pennywise jumps out from the darkness or contorts his body to an inexplicable degree, it's hard to shake the feeling that you've seen all of this before. Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg and Brian De Palma used King's source material to create something more unique and expressive, but it isn't too difficult to spot where Muschietti's jump-shocks will be coming from. It is often creepy, but never scary. I sincerely hope that directors will soon learn that computer-generated ghouls simply don't work, and that practical effects actually add the level of physicality required to frighten. While it may not make you sleep with the light on, It still makes for engrossing drama, unafraid to tackle difficult issues such as bullying, child abuse - both physical and sexual - and primarily the loss of innocence. It's now a long wait for Chapter Two.",It
66,Thanos_Alfie,You will float too...,7,4 March 2018,"""It"" is a horror movie in which we watch a group of kids who were bullied, banding together in order to destroy a clown monster. This happens in the summer of 1989 in the Town of Derry and after the disappearance of some local kids who were never found. The only clue that exists after the disappearance of each kid is bloody remains.I had watched the first movie when I was a child and I was very scared of it, I thought of it as the most horrific movie and since I was very young it made sense. I have to admit that I liked this movie a lot, the plot was amazing for a horror movie, there were many scary scenes and much of suspense. In addition to this, I have to say that ""It"" made me feel that I was a member of this group of children and made me also feel the stress, the agony and the suspense that felt these children. In comparison with the old movie of 1990, I have to admit that the old movie was more like a splatter movie and of course since the evolution of technology the new movie had more options and greater potential than the old one. I liked the direction of this movie which made by Andy Muschietti. It has also to be mentioned the interpretations of Bill Skarsgård who played as Pennywise, Sophia Lillis who played as Beverly Marsh and Jaeden Lieberher who played as Bill Denbrough.To sum up I have to say that ""It"" is a very good horror movie with a decent budget which was used wisely and correctly. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone and especially to those who love horror movies and of course to those who have already watched the old movie because I am sure that this movie will be better and it will exceed your expectations.",It
67,cruise01,You'll float too. Assuming you can handle the creepy scares of It.,10,8 September 2017,"You know what is the majority of everyone's phobia is? Clowns, the creepiest things ever and to see Stephen King's It being remade into a movie again after a great performance done by Tim Curry. This It film takes the bite and brings in some classic horror movie scares which is what is missing in all these modern horror movies which are filled with lots of clichés and less creepy scares. Bill Skarsgard taking the role of Pennywise is even better. Beside the point that I have rarely seen the actor's performance in any other movie. He does a great job portraying a menacing, creepy looking clown that stalks children and comes charging at you at full force. I thought the original movie was okay but a bit slow. However, this film does build the characters with the kids who are being stalked by the menacing clown and plan on stopping him since no one else will. From the opening creepy sequence when Georgie following his paper boat on a raining day and coming across Pennywise. That sequence sets up the unease feeling. The story setting is in the 1980's this time. The plot follows Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his group of friends, who have been seeing some supernatural figure of a clown around their small town that is trying to strike fear into them. Bill and his friends must find a way to stop It from killing anymore kids around their town. What I loved about the film is it does build characterization with every kid in the Losers club. Bill is struggling with an emotional conflict of losing his brother. Beverly is abused by her father and has rumors of a false reputation against her around town. Richie is a cocky foul language kid always using jokes about mothers. Stan is religiously conflicted. And Eddie is a hypochondriac, who is always informing others about the dangers of germs and being contracted with diseases that are in the air. These characters are different and it is fun to see how they all react on screen. The actors that portrays them were good. And every kid has their own fear of something that It tends to use against them. The direction does rely on some old fashion horror movie techniques to get scares. It is not overbearing with loud sound effects or flashy camera angles. But classic horror movie style, were the story may be slow moving just to build characters and have them all encounter Pennywise individually. Until, its exciting thrilling climax of them trying to stop Pennywise once for all. Sure, the audience will find Pennywise be unsettling and scary. Which brings our fear of clowns into play. The direction is a lot of fun seeing these characters trying to solve the mystery of the towns children disappearing. And when their inner conflict of fear rises when Pennywise shows up with a red balloon. It can be scary. Overall, It is a great horror film. Bill Skarsgard is great as Pennywise. The direction does not hold back on delivering the thrills of classic horror movie scares. The cast ensemble playing as the kids were a lot of fun. (most of them are unknown actors which is even better because they all did great in their roles.) The story is slow moving but fun as it builds up the suspense. I cannot wait for the sequel to see the other half of the story. I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars.",It
68,Dr_Coulardeau,Fear is an admirable human passion,10,29 April 2018,"This new production of this IT novel by Stephen King is only the adaptation of the first older part of the story when the main characters are children, hence twenty-seven years before the present time. And as such, it is a refreshing approach to the novel. Let's hope the second chapter of it will come sometime soon.So we have here no flashbacks about the past but a direct story about the past, of the past. The monster is very clearly and mainly associated with the clown, though it can change shape and appear under different likenesses. It is in no way revealed what kind of real monster it is or hardly. The clown form is obviously effective with the bunch of kids he has to fight against, though he also for one little moment take the form of dead Georgy to confuse the brother of this Georgy who has never accepted his death.The film is also clear about the existence of a band of bullies in the community who attack and harass children, girls or boys, at school, of course since school is a bully stadium, and outside in the city at large, often with no one saying nothing at all and just passing their way as if they were passing water in their private outhouse. These bullies though seem to have a particular attraction for blacks. There are not many blacks in this community but there is one in the band of kids, one who is pure and simple saved from being lynched by the bullies thanks to the girl who is not yet in the band, and the band she is going to be opted into straight away. Note the gay bashing that opens the novel is not mentioned and the entering door of the clown is seen as some kind of sewage well in the underground section of an old abandoned and of course haunted house. The haunted house is a common theme with Stephen King. The research of one of the boys about the cyclical episodes of disappearing kids and other catastrophes in factories is clearly documented and we know then this monster appears every twenty-seven years. The present cycle is broken up and defeated by the band of kids we are speaking of and that includes a girl, a Jewish boy, a black boy and an overweight if not obese boy, plus three more boys who are in no way exceptional. Seven altogether and this number is fundamental in meaning and references: 
1- the Holy Week; 
2- the creation of the world; 
3- the seven planets of the Babylonian astrologers; 
4- the seven days of the week; 
5- the seventh month of September; 
6- the seventh day of the Jewish week which is, in fact, the starting day of the week before the six others (first to sixth), namely Sabbath; 
7- the seven churches to which the Book of Revelation is dedicated;
8- the seven colors of the rainbow as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet; 
9- the opposite sides of a dice always equal the number seven when added; 
10- the seven dwarfs of Snow White: Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy; 
11- the seven Lucky Gods of Japan: Hotei, Jurojin, Fukurokuju, Bishamonten, Benzaiten, Daikokuten, Ebisu; 
12- the seven Cherokee clans; 
13- the seven people privately beheaded on Tower Green within the walls of the Tower of London: William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, June 13, 1483 - Anne Boleyn,2nd wife of King Henry VIII, May 19, 1536 - Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, May 27, 1541 - Catherine Howard, 5th wife of King Henry VIII, February 13, 1542 - Jane Boleyn, sister-in-law of Anne Boleyn, February13, 1542 - Lady Jane Grey, the Nine Day Queen, February 12, 1554 - Robert Devereux,2nd Earl of Essex, November 10, 1601 (this last execution was turned into an opera by Benjamin Britten); 
14- the Seven Sacraments in the Catholic Church set by the Council of Trent (1545-63): Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the sick, Holy Orders, Matrimony; 
15- the Seven Deadly Sins: Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, Pride that are behing Dante's Inferno and the film Sev7n; 
16- and so many others.There is a universal dimension of the number seven in the world and in all civilizations. Note the number twenty-seven is also important since it is close to what we call a generation. It contains seven and it is three times nine, hence 9+9+9 (or 3x3x3), the beast in the Book of Revelation in a way or another. Stephen King in this first chapter of his story is trying to frighten us with traditional children's fears because children are haunted at times by what they love best, clowns for instance, and clowns are the best trap for children to make them do what they know they are not supposed to do. Who does not like a clown? And yet who is not frightened by what we love best, clowns among other things. The best friends of man can often become their most frightening monsters. Stephen King has exploited this ambiguity so often with cats, dogs, cars, grandfathers and so many others.This first chapter is, of course, admirable because of the seven kids, in fact, eight with Georgy. They are perfectly managed and directed in circumstances and scenes that are supposed to frighten the audience, that are extreme. We assume these scenes must have been great fun for those kids. At least they could do exactly what they know they are not supposed to do in everyday life. The cinema is a tool of freedom.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",It
69,zkonedog,Exceeded Even My High Expectations,10,16 September 2017,"Stephen King's book ""It"" is my single favorite fiction novel of all-time. I have read it a number of times and am completely and utterly absorbed by its atmosphere and characters. As such, despite the big buildup, promising trailers, and positive reviews, I wasn't sure that this new film adaptation could ever quite live up to my extremely heightened expectations. Fifteen minutes into my trip to the cinema, I knew I was wrong. This one was going to be great.For a basic plot summary, ""It"" tells the story of the little Maine town of Derry, which seems to have a problem with children disappearing. During the time period this film focuses on, little Georgie Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott) is attacked and killed by a maniacal clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) in a sewer grate. That starts a pattern of child abductions (the cycle beginning again in Derry), which is seemingly only realized by the ""Losers Club"", a group of friends who come together because they really don't fit in anywhere else:-Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), Georgie's older brother, is struggling to come to terms with the family tragedy, an event that afflicted him with a pronounced stutter. -Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), the ""fat kid"" (pardon the judgment...this would have been me) of the group. -Richie (Finn Wolfhard), the loudmouth prankster. -Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), the sickly drink of water with the overbearing mother. -Mike (Chosen Jacobs), the black kid in a community not always accepting of minorities. -Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), the Jewish kid who struggles to even fit in with this gang. -Bev (Sophia Lillis), the girl that of course all the others have a huge crush on.Over the course of that summer, the Losers Club is tormented by neighborhood bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), while at the same time all seeing manifestations of ""It"", a seemingly non-corporeal being who can transform into their greatest fears (e.g. Pennywise the maniacal clown).Director Andy Muschietti's ""It"" is by no means a direct adaptation of the book. The best ones aren't, as they are two completely different mediums. Some of the characters go in different directions, some events are slightly altered, and even the time frame (1950s in the book) is moved up to the 1980s here.What doesn't change, however, is the spirit of the source material. King's novel is all about coming of age, facing fears, and having courage when no one else will. All of those things are perfectly present here. A lot of that has to do with the acting performances, starting with the camaraderie between the young child actors. This may be the best child-led ensemble cast I've ever seen on the big screen, as their antics provide some much-needed levity for material that can be very dark. Then, of course, there is Skarsgard's Pennywise, which is just as iconic as Tim Curry's earlier take on the role (this one being much more dark and violent).A final interesting observation is how ""It"" so seamlessly melded together the horror, adventure, and thriller genres. If you are a fan of either, you'll find something to enjoy. The scary scenes are something straight out of, say, ""The Conjuring"", while the buddy adventure is so much like ""Stranger Things"" (Wolfhard double dipping even!) that one could almost call ""copycat"" (but it's so fun who cares?!). Backing everything up is a very solid story.Of course, this is only the first chapter in the ""It"" story, as King's book also goes into great detail about these characters as adults. That material is saved for a later-date sequel, and this one sets it up perfectly. This original can be viewed as a stand-alone experience, yet leaves just enough unanswered questions to make a compelling ""part two"".Overall, ""It"" was one of my favorite film-going experiences in quite some time. It did justice to a great story, even introduced some new aspects into the mix, and whetted appetites for more to come. I can't wait to return to Derry for Round Two in the future!",It
70,Floated2,Intriguing blend of horror and comedy,7,22 September 2019,"Having little interest in watching this film when it was released, and only now watching for the first time two years later. Having no knowledge about the initial story based upon the novels or mini series, judging the film based on its own merit.The opening scene is quite good and sets a strong tone for the rest of the film. A lot of complaints seem to be about that the film isn't that scary. Well it is a type of horror which has great visuals and many jump scares.Several people seemed to have found Pennywise the clown to be more goofy, silly and over the top than completely terrifying, though found it intriguing none the less. Although the graphic design of the clown is well done along with the overall texture and cinematography. The CGI is noticeable but it works.The kids do a solid realistic portrayal, although there is plenty of cursing from the kids (more than expected and it seemed to get more as the film went on). It was noticeable, especially by Richie.""IT"" is quite lengthy and doesn't feel too long since something is always happening but at some parts do seem to stall and drag on (the 'well' scene for instance). This film does live up to the hype and as a genre does a solid job at not being too horrifying, while also having some comic relief.",It
71,johnnyboyz,"""Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble.""",7,28 August 2019,"Is ""It"" 'very scary'; 'quite scary' or 'not very scary at all'? Well, I would settle on the film being 'pretty bloody scary indeed', if you don't mind(!) Director Andy Muschietti's adaptation of a Stephen King novel, yet to have been given a proper cinematic adaptation to now, is the sort of horror film I find myself being able to get into: rounded protagonists; interesting villains; a real sense of good and evil at play; some genuinely chilling moments and no real reliance on violence to propel the sense you've seen something substantial.The film depicts the exploits of a group of American children in a small fictitious town in the state of Maine during one, long summer holiday in 1989, wherein they dodge bullies; disagreeable parents and a series of odd visions which play on their barest fears. The film opens with a ghostly rendition of the age-old nursery rhyme ""Oranges and Lemons"" which, I think, is designed to call to mind Orwell's ""1984"" wherein it was used as a sort of diegetic overture to the book's depiction of oppression and censorship. Said novel was, of course, about a set of characters living under the yoke of a seemingly unconquerable terror - the likes of which seemed to know your every move and, later on, your inner-most fear...""It"" essentially covers the tale of Billy (Jaeden Lieberher), a gawky looking kid with a stammer and a thin build - think DJ Qualls when he was much younger. During the film's preface, set eight months before the rest of the picture, Billy loses his younger brother on a stormy night when a model boat they build is washed away down their street and into the sewer. There, at the grate, he meets the titular ""It"" - what appears to be a smooth talking clown with a lazy eye and a devilish grin... Suffice to say, Billy's younger brother doesn't make it home.Declared missing, and making it his mission to find him having felt responsible for sending him out in the storm, the audience, and not Billy, is playfully allowed to know what awaits those who don't let sleeping dogs lie. The film unfolds in such a way that we learn about dozens, even hundreds of other kids who have gone missing over the centuries in the same town and we realise, chillingly, what we saw in the opening has, in some guise, occurred many-a time before. Consequently, we might feel as if we have seen more than perhaps has been shown.Billy, having been told in no uncertain terms to move on by his parents, has a group of friends who are, mostly, with him all the way. What is refreshing about the approach here is that a group of people effectively act as the protagonists - all are victims to the monster's stalking and we are spared a lone, increasingly neurotic, lead wading through on their own.The kids themselves are a pleasingly distinctive bunch: one is a little too sexually aware, but has some wonderfully funny lines; another is crippled by a series of allergies. Beverly (Sophia Lillis) is a red-headed girl with an abusive father, Ben happens to possess a deep understanding of the town having just moved there and had nothing to do but frequent a library. As the film whips along, one does not become lost amidst a sea of supporting acts. Some of the boys' feelings for Beverly, perennially with a key hung around her neck inferring only she can unlock something somewhere, are smoothly mixed into the narrative.Another easy card the film avoids playing lies in what it considers frightening, both within the confines of the film for the characters and for us, the audience. Muschietti avoids going down a route of throwing things at the screen such as snakes and spiders, or rats, in order to get across the scares. Each of the characters has their own particular fear. Afraid of germs? Then you'll have a leper chase you down the street. Just cut off your hair over the sink because you're scared of attracting unwanted sexual attention? It'll come back up the plug and wrap itself around you. Not fond of the rendition of a particular image in a painting? Chances are it'll stalk you through the corridors of your own home.These things don't sound especially frightening by themselves, but it is remarkable, for instance, just how creepy your standard zombie-like creature becomes when it's presented within this context. As for the silly oil painting of the old lady playing a flute which we didn't think was especially frightening when we first saw it - well, we don't think the same by the end...There is even a moment towards the end of the film whereby ""It"" suddenly seems to morph its legs to form a kind of arachnid creature in a desperate attempt to frighten the characters because, I think, it is assuming that everybody has some sort of rooted fear of insects or whatnot. This sense of reverting to something at a time of desperation in order to win is noticeable and seems to be the director's way of putting it to other film-makers that throwing things at the screen for sake of it just doesn't work. What does work, however, is part one of this double-header - a pretty outstanding horror feature on its own and well worth checking out if you are a fan of the genre.",It
72,eddie_baggins,A creepy and well-made Horror,7,7 September 2017,"No doubt about, Mama director Andy Muschietti's newest incarnation of Stephen King's well regarded source material and the 1990 mini-series It, is going to be a huge success.Capturing that currently in-vogue 1980's vibe of nostaglia and the equally popular ragtag kids on adventures plot lines, Muschietti's profientially made and polished production is arguably 2017's best mainstream horror event and a potential new franchise starter.Kicking things off with what's easily one of recent memories best opening sequences, It certainly seems set to be a confronting and horrific experience and while it is in many sequences and aspects (this is a film that earns its mature rating and is very far from being a kid friendly horror), It is also not a hide your head behind a pillow type horror, as it focuses a large portion of its time on setting up the Losers Club as the stories main focus.Led by Jaeden Lieberher's stutturing Bill, who is still grieving the disappearance of his little brother Georgie, the Club is a band of high school misfits who decide that they'll take matters into their own hands and unearth the evil that hides in their small town of Derry, after a spat of children have mysteriously vanished and a nefarious history of past tragedies is unearthed.The group dynamic of the Club doesn't always fly and not every eccentric member of the gang are appealing but a lot of the heart and soul of this group rings true with Jeremy Taylor's kindhearted Ben and Sophia Lillis misunderstood Beverley Marsh particular highlights, while Ben's incredible ability to stick to his task despite various slashings also worthy of note; Wolverine himself would have a hard time slashing Ben down!With the club winning and losing their screen time in equal measure, Muschietti's biggest win is Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise the Clown aka a Coulrophobic's least desired creation.For anyone who still has nightmares about Tim Curry's crazy demon clown, this freshly minted Pennywise will be the stuff of true torment, as while you wouldn't call this It a truly scary or even overly frightening experienece, whenever Skarsgard is on screen the film goes up a notch or two, even if certain scare tactics and scenarios are overused by Muschietti as the film's overlong narrative and especially long in the tooth finale kicks in, that gets saddled with an additonal unneeded evil teenager sideplot that really has no need being here.Final Say –It would've been great to have gotten to see original director Cary Fukunaga's version of this film but crawling out of the sewer at just the right time, there's a lot of hype and noise about It and while Muschietti's film isn't anything truly special, this is one of the more solid bigscreen King adaptation's and a likely series kickstarter, that while not floating to great heights, proves not all remakes are bad ideas.3 1/2 rock wars out of 5",It
73,leonblackwood,Surprisingly entertaining and quite enjoyable!,7,11 February 2018,"Review:
I really didn't have high hopes for this movie, as I'm not a fan of horrors but it actually turned out to be quite enjoyable. The freakish looking Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), was pretty scary, and the whole ""kids vs the baddie"" has been done to death but I liked the character building throughout the movie, and the fact that each kid had there own story. When I saw that the film was over 2 hours long, I did think what the hell the director could do with a scary clown which feeds off kids for that amount of time but now that I've seen the movie, I can see that he spent some time for the audience to get to know each individual, who had there own reason to tackle the terrible monster. Anyway, the movie is set during the summer of 1989, we're a group of 7 kids, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Beverly (Sophia Lillis), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Mike (Chosen Jacobs), Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), are all being bullied at school in there small town of Derry. They all of there own strange experiences with Pennywise and scary looking monsters, and when they finally talk about what they have been through, they decide to join forces, to tackle Pennywise, who resides in the sewers of Derry. After the strange disappearance of his little brother, Bill soon realises that Pennywise must have him, so they head towards the house, not knowing what to expect. They soon realise that there task isn't going to be as easy as they thought and some of them lost faith in the whole mission but when Beverly goes missing, they decide to face the wraith of Pennywise once more. The friendship between the kids was really sweet throughout the movie, and the way that they bonded together, under extreme circumstances, made the film a joy to watch. As I haven't watched the first IT, I don't know how this compares to the previous movie but from a stand alone point, I quite enjoyed it. The fact that all of there parents were completely useless, made there relationship that more emotional, and you can't help rooting for them when they were fighting the awful Pennywise. Anyway, I was pretty surprised with the outcome, and I can't wait to see how the characters will progress in chapter 2. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Andy Muschietti, who also brought you Mama in 2013. For his second big budget movie in Hollywood, he must be impressed with the profit of both movies, and he has built a bankable reputation in the Horror, Thriller genre. With 8 movies in the pipeline, including It: Chapter Two in 2019, the only way is up for this up and coming director but I would like to see him tackle other genres, later on down the line. As I haven't seen any of the actors before, I can't really comment on there previous performances but the chemistry between the whole cast was top form, and well put together by the director. I just hope they don't mess up the sequel!Budget: $35million

74,TheMovieDiorama,It is a solid horror flick with engrossing performances.,8,27 February 2018,"We finally have a decent Stephen King adaptation this year (sorry The Dark Tower). The hype for this has been absurd, with an incredible marketing campaign it was bound to entice many. I like to think I'm experienced enough not to get pulled into the hype and watch this with a clear mind, to which I shall agree with most and say this is a damn entertaining horror. A town experiences several children going missing, a group of kids referred to as 'The Losers' take it upon themselves to investigate. It would be too easy to class 'It' as a simple horror film, it's so much more. A story about overcoming fears and maturing from teenagers to adulthood. The power of friendship and the courageous bonds that it creates. Exquisite performances from all the young actors in 'The Losers' gang. I typically hate an all child cast but this worked so well. Clearly harking back to 80's coming-of-age classics like Stand By Me and The Goonies but with the addition of horror elements. The scenes of terror focussed on being creepy rather than constant jump scares (although, still ever present). The problem was, the two genres never really blended until the final act. The narrative structure felt too mechanical in execution switching back and forth between horror and young adult drama. Pennywise the Dancing Clown I'm sure will invoke nightmares for many, played brilliantly by Bill Skarsgård. Very different in comparison to the original adaptation, I found him refreshingly ominous and chilling. Especially the scene involving the photo slides in the garage...damnnnnn that gave me the tinkles. Excellent screenplay that gives 'The Losers' plenty of personality. Great banter between them, found that relatable in my old school gang (I miss those days). The final act was slightly rushed and messy. I grew immune to the scares, and looks like 'The Losers' did too. The visual effects were also hit and miss, again looked untidy in the finale. However, 'It' is one of the most entertaining films this year and is sure to scare many of you.",It
75,Tweetienator,Horror!?,4,4 October 2017,"Well, I got one trouble - It is not a horror movie for me. I wasn't scared once and the suspense level also is low, I dare to say in no moment my pulse leveled up for an inch. And e.g. the scene with the headless boy, boy, I had a got laugh. If this guy Pennywise would ever dare to bother me I would just bend him over my knee and teach him a lesson.The movie reminds me more of movies like Super 8, Stand By Me and The Hole and as those movies are not bad imo they are more like adventure movies with some supernatural/alien/whatever evil powers and kids as main characters in it.Production and acting are good, but as this movie is marketed as horror I got to judge it as a horror movie. My rate is 4, as an adventure movie, I would rate it 5, maybe 6.",It
76,damianphelps,One Review Two Movies,8,7 January 2021,"I am going to review the 2 films together as I don't really know how and why they would be considered separate.Stephen King's movies are, for me very hit and miss. Some are simply jaw-dropping (Cujo for example), others are movies you wish you could un-see (Graveyard Shift). With this in mind I always approach an SK release with a little bit or trepidation especially when its a remake.Firstly my thoughts on the original. Tim Curry is a genius, secondly the, again for me, the entire movie was ruined by defeating the baddies with a rock!As a movie overall the new IT is fantastic, the colour pallet, the style and feel the movie has is outstanding..it looks great. The story is awesome.Where the movie struggles a little (much like Full Metal Jacket) is the second half (IT 2) isn't quite as good as the first half. The childish aspect of the story is just stronger than the adult perspective.Having said that, IT should be considered a great success story!",It

I saw it a couple of times at home and it still left me flat. I watched it again last night and it finally clicked. I finally enjoyed ""It"". It's not a perfect movie but the flaws didn't bother me so much this time around. The young cast does a nice job and Pennywise is a strong villain. I wouldn't rank ""It"" among the best of the Stephen king movies but it in the top half.",It
78,digitalbeachbum,Not as good as other versions,5,18 September 2021,"IT is one of those Stephen King stories which is taken from Three Billy Goats Gruff, which was modified to fit modern times. It is a clown of evil which echoes childhood drama, and the challenges of the children who are now adults to overcome that evil together.This version of the story lacks the intensity and fear. Clowns are inherently creepy even when they are used for children's parties. The idea that you invite one of these people in to your home to perform for your kids is ridiculous. However, this Pennywise isn't so scary. I think the CG is OK, but there is no suspense.There are different versions or segments of this story which have been produced. Some have the youthful kids only, others have them older returning to the town to fight Pennywise again as adults.I'm not sure if this is true, but based on my experience and knowledge fear is universal and that is what Pennywise feeds on, so it is a lot like the various stories which have creatures which try to use the victim's memories to trick the victim in to producing the emotion of fear. I think that is what Stephen King is trying to explain in this story. In that, people who live in fear are subject to the suffering of monsters of fear.",It
79,matthewssilverhammer,I Might Actually Be Underrating This...,7,13 September 2017,"I vaguely remember being at a friend's house for a sleepover once and one of the kids sneaking in the Tim Curry mini-series VHS of It into the VCR, and slowly falling asleep to a creepy clown doing goofy things. However, this newest iteration of Stephen King's cultural behemoth is one of the most utterly surprising and purely fun experiences I've had all year. An endless barrage of horror visuals and teenage whimsy, it's as dementedly scary as it is brightly charming. Eighties set and inspired, it brings to mind Goonies, E.T, and the rest of the Amblin films repertoire, much like Abrams' Super 8 or more recently Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" did before it. The comparisons are inevitable, especially given the casting of the ""Stranger Things"" lead Wolfhard. However, where those sometimes walk the line between homage and straight-up copy bluntly, It manages to mostly stand on its own; and either way, we simply don't get movies this sincere and thoughtful, while also being terrifyingly entertaining, enough anymore. If it takes reminding us of bygone decades to do it, then I'm all for it. This 135 minute nostalgia nightmare can be a daunting undertaking, not just for the filmmakers but for the audience. However, so much creepy goodness is packed into its runtime, it not only doesn't feel overlong, but seems to have a high re-watchability factor. Even with some of the stale drama and less-than-perfect child performances, the screen is so filled with terrifying bumps, sunny disturbia, and a welcome onslaught of tension-breaking humor, I can imagine happily running into Pennywise over and again.",It

81,southdavid,Down With The Clown,8,10 September 2019,"With Chapter Two out this week, I rewatched the first film over the weekend in preparation. Happily, I found that, though not quite as much as the first time, I still enjoyed the film - though admittedly it's not actually that scary.Haunted by the disappearance of his brother several months early, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his friends begin their summer holiday. They, and the rest of the town's children are being tormented by horrific visions that are linked to a clown, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). Their investigation leads to the understanding that Pennywise has inhabited their town for decades, appearing every 27 years to hunt and then disappearing back to the sewers.It should first be said again, as a horror film ""It"" isn't particularly scary. It has a few creepy moments, most of which a either background characters or moments. There's one fantastic scene involving a projector - but for the most part the film scary elements are Pennywise's manifestations. Those are created in CGI and they're fine, just not that frightening. However, if you recalibrate slightly, ""It"" is a wonderfully entertaining (and surprisingly funny) ""Stranger Things-esque"" adventure about a group of children that fight back against an evil that is after them. Finn Wolfhard's presence in the film helps to add to that ""Stranger Things"" feeling and his wisecracking character Ritchie is one of the highlights amongst the gang. It's like ""The Goonies"" but with more horror elements.The cast are great, Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise is already an iconic horror character - without detracting from the Tim Curry version. My only concern is that this is the easy half of the overall story, and the second chapter has some much less cinematic elements to try and find a way to incorporate. I guess I'll find out tomorrow how successful they were.",It
82,Vartiainen,Loses its passion,6,12 February 2021,"An adaptation of the Stephen King book of the same name and a remake of the 1990 TV mini series also adapting the book. The mini series told the story mixing both timelines, whereas this new movie only focuses on the childhood of its main characters. That childhood in Derry, Maine of course being full of disappearing children, indifferent adults, psychopathic bullies and one killer crown straight from your nightmares.In some ways this remake updates just what it needs to and brings the story to a new century. The visual effects are much improved and Pennywise is legitimately scary in this one. Though there are those argue he's perhaps a tad too scary. The Pennywise in the mini series, played by the legendary Tim Curry, was scary when he it warranted, but he was also very funny when he needed to be. Like, you know, a clown.I'm also not a huge fan of the Loser's Club in this one, to be honest. Mostly because the film is in such a hurry, despite being over two hours long, that it doesn't bother to introduce most of them. The only reason I know which of these characters is which is because I've seen the 1990 version. Had I to go with this version alone, I'd be totally lost. Contrast this with the TV version where each new character is given their own little scene that tells the viewer exactly what they were about, mixing scenes from adulthood and childhood alike. A much better way to do it.That being said, there are some legitimately good scares in this film and it works as a standalone horror film. It's a tad janky, but it knows for the most part what it's doing.",It

84,GOWBTW,A whole new level of Stephen King horror,9,12 July 2018,"I've seen the first ""It"" film which was a miniseries. It has a great story, great background, and a great plot. This version of the Stephen King novel takes it to a whole new level of horror.
Pennywise the Clown(Bill Skarsgard) comes to the town of Derry, Maine, entertaining the people, and more....
He lures the children with its charm. ""IT"" feeds on the children. One victim is Georgie, baby brother of Bill, who is a stutterer. When Georgia went out to play with his paper boat, it sails into the sewer where he first encounter Pennywise. It would be Georgie's last as well. 
Bill and 6 other friends would have common things: Being accosted by bullies, and Pennywise terrorizing them. 
Unlike the 1990 version, there were scenes that went a whole new level like the lake scene. Memorable indeed. They may have been the ""Loser Club"", but when it comes to personal demons, the are winners. 
Graphic by all means, it what makes the movie good.

85,subxerogravity,Nothing more terrifying than a clown.,9,8 September 2017,"I remember the first adaption of the Steven King novel when I was a kid. I remember being frighten as a child watching it. In fact, I'm sure it's the reason why I think clowns are disturbing in the first place.I try not to compare both adaptions to one another. Technically, the one back in the late eighties or early nineties was a mini series and this a movie, so I'm expecting this adaption not to be as detailed.It is scary, but it does feed off of the latest trends of ghost stories focusing a lot on jump scares, which is not bad cause it does work really well, but not what I was expecting when the source material is King.But nothing is more scary than Pennywise, man. Clowns are suppose to make you laugh, but they also work too well when they make you scared. As disturbing as he looked when he was showing his monstrous teeth, he was just as scary when he was showing himself as being cute as a button. Either way, I was easily off centered. The film does seem to show off the similarities between the clown and Freddy Kruger (And don't deny it, using posters of A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 to display which period of time the movie takes place)Speaking of which, the best part of this movie was the retro 80s homage it was doing. Not just placed in the summer of 89, but the movie is styled a lot like it was made in 88 or 89, with this hard PG-13/Light R rated horror flick about Goonies like kids in their early teens. It does not hurt that IT stars well known child star Jaeden Lieberher whose been in a bunch of stuff as the kid a little smarter than his age would determine, and features the lead kid from Netflix's hit series Stranger Things (another project that shows mad love for the 80s). Would not be surprise if 30 years from now they do a special auto commentary and these guys are talking about how they get stopped all the time by someone who loved this film as a kid (hopefully, they both wont have any bad drug habits by this time)Overall, the movie is a lot of fun. I had a lot of good scares, and the entire cast of child actors were amusing and great.Worth the watch.http://cinemagardens.com",It
86,jtindahouse,An enjoyable and well made horror film (you read that right),7,6 September 2017,"I went into 'It' with the potential to absolutely love it, or absolutely hate it. The horror genre has been on life-support in my opinion for a long time. So even the mention of expected quality behind a horror film is greeted with skepticism. However the trailers looked promising and an 'R' rating was incredibly pleasing to see. So what was the actual result? Certainly more positives than negatives.The film starts with a scene which sets the tone for the entire film. I had actually seen the majority of this scene in a ""Presented by Stephen King"" prior to another film I had seen in the cinema. The scene cut off before the end though and I have been wondering ever since exactly how it was going to play out. I finally got to find out this morning and I was very pleased. This scene works perfectly to infuse the audience with the notion that 'It' is indeed a genuine threat to each and every character.The things I liked most about the film: * The look of 'Pennywise' - he was genuinely intimidating, mysterious and captivating to watch.* The set designs - rarely do I notice things like this on the first viewing of a film, however on this occasion it was impossible not to. They were impressive.* The cast of children - in particular Finn Wolfhard showed class beyond his years in being the funny guy of the film.* The pacing - while this has a very long run time for a horror movie, it never really feels like it. To say it is non-stop action is probably going a step too far, but it's not far off it. 'Pennywise' was in the film a lot more than I expected which helped with this.The things I didn't like as much: * At times it feels like it is trying a little too hard - for the most part there is a level of subtlety in most scenes, however just on occasion they get a little too in your face with the scare they are trying to give you.* Also (and I'm sure there was a reason for this) I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a single likable adult in the film. In fact every single adult in the film is outwardly unlikable. This wouldn't have been done by mistake, but it is still a very depressing and unrealistic aspect of the film.Altogether though 'It' is a very good horror film. There's definitely the usual substance of a Stephen King film, while still managing to fit in more than enough scares and suspense to keep any type of audience members happy. If you're as disillusioned by the horror genre as I am then make sure you see 'It'. It might just give you an air of hope like it has done for me.",It
87,Turfseer,"King's entertaining pre-pubescent ""losers club"" undermined by repetitious clown antagonist and clichéd horror plot",5,1 October 2017,"Set in the late 80s, Director Andy Muschietti's second adaptation of a Stephen King novel (the first one was a 1990 TV mini-series), takes place in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. What keeps the film from drifting too far ashore as mediocre pabulum (or worse—a series of one clichéd horror film trope after another), is the hard-edged Stephen King worldview and his engaging characters (despite their one-dimensionality).Right away King treats us to an event straight out of a lurid, small-town newspaper headline: the disappearance (and ultimate murder) of a young boy, who is dragged into a sewer by King's monster (whom we'll get to in a few moments). The sense of dread is palpable throughout the narrative, with the suggestion that the town has been cursed since the last century (pictures of a mill explosion in 1908 that claimed the lives of over 100 children, permeate an old book chronicling the town's history and are brought to our attention by one of the protagonists King adroitly assembles in this coming-of-age tale).Indeed, King's motley collection of outsiders (pre-pubescents aptly self-named ""the loser's club""), each possess a particular handicap that allows them to be subjected to bullying by a small group of bad kids in town, emotional smothering and worse (including sexual abuse) by the adults in the community.They include the de facto ""leader"" of the group, Bill, a stutterer who blames himself for the disappearance of his younger brother George (the young boy dragged into the sewer at the film's beginning); Ben, a short, overweight bookworm who is dubbed ""tits"" by the town bullies who subject him to a savage beating; the over talkative Richie, whose foul-mouth continually gets him into trouble; Eddie, a hypochondriac, who is continually subjected to the aforementioned emotional smothering by an overbearing mother; Stan, the Jewish germ phobic, son of the town's rabbi; Mike, an African-American kid who gets little or no support from his strict granddad; and the group's only female member, Bev, who is subjected to apparent sexual abuse by her leering, creepy Dad.Beyond these entertaining characters and thei antagonists (including the effective psychopathic kid, Henry Bowers, who ends up murdering his violent, abusive police officer dad, and Alvin Marsh, Bev's depraved father), Stephen King has little elsewhere to go in developing his principal antagonist as well as offering an effective plot.The principal antagonist of course is Pennywise the clown, the ""It"" of the film's title, and proves to be hardly believable or scary. That's because once he engages in his ""scare routines,"" they become perfunctory and repetitious. By the time he receives his comeuppance at film's end, we hardly care whether he comes or goes. Not only that, Pennywise's powers have no basis in reality which might be good for teenagers but hardly for more critical adults.A long-winded explanation of the film's plot is completely unnecessary; suffice it to say, that the ""loser's club"" does battle with the clown in a haunted house (on two occasions), and finally end up victorious. They accomplish this by realizing that the clown draws its energy from their own fears, and once they're able to rise above those fears, the clown no longer has any hold over them.The subtext underneath King's nasty fairy tale is that the bullied victims in our society may rise up and defeat the forces of evil if they join together and believe in themselves— not allowing their assorted so-called handicaps to undermine their self-confidence. King's good triumphing over evil reveals a rather simplistic weltanschauung but an appealing one to the masses who purchase tickets in droves, and who demand a resolution with few shades of gray.",It

It was made as a two part TV mini-series in 1990. After 27 years, I don't remember much about it. John Boy Walton and John Ritter were the stars, with Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown. Bill Skarsgard is the evil clown this time around, and he is the best thing in It. The kids are all the standard fat kid, the stutterer, the black kid, the Jewish kid, pretty much a predictable mix of ""losers"" who are considered outsiders. Stand by Me had a similar concept but is a much better movie. It runs over two hours and I was ultimately bored. Pennywise is not given sufficient screen time and the boys and one girl are competent but pedestrian. The final scene hints at another chapter, and I may just skip that one.",It

The kids must band together in order to defeat him, but will they? Not only Bill Skarsgard scary performance is what makes the film, but the performance of the young cast, all really click you buy there friendship, things they deal with, is what most kids have to deal with.

90,jamesrupert2014,Yet another nightmare for coulrophobics,7,12 June 2018,"A group of misfit children deal with evil in the form of a clown. This is the second version of Steven King's eponymous novel, and while the CGI effects allow for horrors that are magnitudes better than those in the 1990 made-for-TV version, I didn't find the new film to be that much better than the miniseries. The kids are fine but, between Spielberg films, other King films, and shows like ""Stranger Things"", I felt like I'd seen it all before. I also found the film slow and meandering as the various kids, and their problems, were introduced. Only the first part of the novel is covered and there really didn't seem to be enough material to fill 135 min. There were some very effective scenes (the opening death of Georgie and the dancing clown comes to mind), but my primary criticism is central to the story: Bill Skarsgård's interpretation of Pennywise the Dancing Clown was too creepy when in 'friendly' mode (compared to Tim Curry's version), which to me diluted the impact of the transition from 'good' clown to 'killer' clown. Anyone familiar with the story will know that in the second half the kids return as adults to Derry to challenge the demonic harlequin. It will be interesting to see if the follow-up film follows a simple horror trajectory (as did the first version) or tries to stay true to the new-agey weirdness of the book.",It

The director Andy Muschietti followed what worked in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (i.e. the visions) and the friendship of Stand By Me. It is far from a scary film but is a good offering as a mainstream horror film because of the relationship and performances from the young actors, giving the film an '80s Spielbergian feel.

I'm a seasoned horror fan, it takes a lot to scare me, but this had me jumping out of my seat more than once. Brilliant. The child actors that make up the Losers Club are all superb, to me they surpass Bill Skarsgard's excellent Pennywise, and are the real stars here.

If you haven't seen the original or if you are unfamiliar with it, it tells the story of an evil monster-in the book, he was an alien but that fact is never mentioned here-that terrorizes the town of Derry, Maine, every 27 years. He is a shape shifter but prefers to take the form of Pennywise, the dancing clown. Bill does a fantastic job in the role of Pennywise. FYI: If Bill's name is unfamiliar to you, you might know his father, Stellan-Avengers, Thor- or his brother, Alexander-the recent Tarzan movie, The Legend of Tarzan. Jaeden, Sophia and Finn are some of the kids that are tortured by Bill as he feasts on their fears and phobias. If you are familiar with the original miniseries, this version is a lot scarier and violent. There are some scenes that were in the original-such as the floating boat scene at the beginning-but are much more graphic here- there is no doubt as to what happens to little Georgie. Now, there is some humor scattered between the horror, mostly in the dialogue between the kids, but make no mistake, this is not one you want to bring your little children to see-and I saw some people that brought their little tykes to the theater. Also, this movie focuses on the kids' story and does not jump into the adult lives of the characters- want to bet there will be a sequel? Another hint to a sequel is at the end, when on the screen appears 'It Chapter One'. It's rated ""R"" for violence/horror, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes. I really enjoyed 'It' and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",It

96,drqshadow-reviews,"A Familiar, Visually Impressive Remake, It Lacks a Human Connection",5,25 January 2018,"A fresh-faced adaptation of Stephen King's horror classic that's staunchly loyal at times, decidedly less so at others. Some removals make sense, like the tremendously cringy sex stuff that King likes to pepper among his novels, but others are a detriment. The production regularly goes to great lengths for a knowing wink - repeated close-ups of a silver bicycle, for instance - but then often fails to follow through with appropriate explanation to make less-familiar viewers do more than furrow their brow and move on. That's a disease that plagues much of the picture: it's in such a rush to touch all the right scenes that it forgets to make them mean anything. King's book can be grotesque and macabre, but it's also very human and patient enough to let its characters establish themselves. On film, there's the hint of a rapport among our child protagonists, but they fall together so quickly that it can be difficult to tell them apart, let alone empathize beyond a base human compassion. Everything looks great, and a legitimately terrifying performance from Bill Skarsgård does well to distinguish itself from Tim Curry's earlier take on Pennywise the Clown. But with so much budget to swing around, glossy special effects and a creepy villain aren't quite enough for me. Negative points for jamming the screen with every trick in the modern horror playbook, too, trying way too hard to fit camera judder and triple-speed jump scares into a story that already had more than enough going on.",It

Great performance by Bill Skarsgard. He nailed Pennywise .I couldn't picture anyone else bringing the character of ""IT"" to life as well as he did. It was an awesome thriller that keeps you on your toes. Can't wait for ""It Chapter Two""!",It
98,st-shot,Too much bump in the night waters It down.,5,16 September 2017,"It has plenty of chills and thrills, along with too many characters and dead moments that weigh heavily on the pace of this dragged out horror that runs well over two hours. With Pennywise on the scene the film roars with sadistic terror but with a crowded field of unpleasant adults and vicious teens to hassle our small platoon of heroes the film slowly implodes into tedious Stand by Me bonding.In the Maine town of Derry kids are disappearing at an alarming rate and the parents don't seem to be concerned as much as a half a dozen loser kids confronting a real demon or their own personal fears. A bookish new kid discovers that every 27 years something dreadful befalls Derry convincing them to investigate further but that entails circumventing parental disdain and indifference to the situation along with the sadistic ever present teen thugs.Horror films like It demand a lot of suspension of disbelief that should be dished out at a healthy pace. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) is an outstanding iconic villain that brings a real fun house feel to the theatre with a patient impish leer and sudden violent acts. Whether present or hinting of it Penny knows how to lay on the big scare. Unfortunately director Andy Mushietti slackens the pace by wasting time on the mawkish sensitive interplay of the children, each a heavy handed cliché in a group that could have been halved to save time and amp up pace. But I guess Stephen King's book which I have not read placed heavy emphasis on growing pains which is misguidedly overplayed in a movie being sold as a terrifying roller coaster ride stalling on the interludes with a few too many creepy adults, bully scenes and obnoxious whiny kids when they should be allowing Pennywise to do his dirty work in under a hundred minutes. I only hope the heavily hinted at sequel will tighten things up with less adolescent growing pains and more of Penny's unique terror.",It
99,parry_na,Great family horror.,8,2 October 2020,"Derry, Maine: we follow the tumultuous and often very funny day-to-day lives of six youngsters, all of whom suffer regularly at the hands of some typically bratty bullies. Making juveniles the film's focal point is a risk - often, precociousness takes a hold. Happily, there's not a trace of that here, because the casting and performances are excellent and often provoke genuine laughter. This is just as well, because we spend a *lot* of time in their company. At over two hours, this is a long journey.I'm familiar with Stephen King's original story but have not seen the 1990 production. For all the imaginative set-pieces, Pennywise comes across as a Freddy Krueger-type, in a clown's suit and without the finger-needles. This is no bad thing, and as we see him so seldom, Bill Skarsgård's various appearances are always a highlight. His machinations and trickery are far more prevalent.In the second half, things enter true horror movie mode. The youngsters, by now well established, face Pennywise at his most fearsome and malevolent, especially when they have cause to enter the clown's realm. Here, we're treated to a wealth of dark effects, some CGI, but always realistic, horrific and convincing. Without the earlier focus on the characters and their humour, we wouldn't fear for them anywhere near as much as we do. A terrific film. My score is 8 out of 10.",It
100,GiraffeDoor,It came from beneath my expectations,5,16 March 2020,"I've always been a bit sour grapes about King since he seems to be everywhere: every award list, every internet top 10, every bookshelf of people who say they like this genre...It's tempting to make some joke about this being a remake of the Clara Bow vehicle but I can't think of a good one. I hate it when people don't research what titles have already been used. I guess this movie is actually ""It: Chapter 1"" according to its credits.I tried to go into this with an open mind. I haven't the book but I want to give whoever is responsible props for adapting it, not only in two parts, but for dedicating each part to a particular time period. I find that 90% of the time when a story keeps switching between two time periods it would have been so much better if it had just stayed in the past. I found this to be the case with Tom Stoppard's ""Arcadia"", the recent ""Hill House"" Adaptation and a little known book called ""Blood Sinister"". One really good example however is Isao Takahata's wonderful mangamation ""Only Yesterday"".But now to review the actual movie. This is one of those pictures that always seems to be teetering on the edge of being a classic of its kind. There's a ton of evident professionalism in how it's realized, in the camera work, the special effects, the locations etc. Story-wise too, I can really feel what this could have been: an epic story of friendship and facing your fears against a formidable villain.To try and pinpoint the negatives to one thing, I suppose it's all about judging the tone. From the first scene I said to myself that I would not watch it as a horror movie anymore, I'd just watch it as an adventure like Gremlins or Jumanji, where it's all about the seen, not the unseen since they really blow their load very quickly with that paper boat and drain scene. And I was fine with this.With this movie they so could have been a chilling film with strange imagery and building tension or else have gone the other way and just been a goofy, zainy movie like an R rated Roger Rabbit (which was actually pretty terrifying in a PG remember). But what we get is an unhappy medium of a movie that can't quite seem to make its mind up on what kind of feel it wants. Contrastive moods and tones in different scenes, including a well judged use of mood whiplash can be effective but for whatever reason, the terror elements and the more in-your-face elements basically cancel each other out so you can't really enjoy either, not even as a horror comedy.One reason is Pennywise himself. He looks terrible. In the bad way. I used to be really freaked out by clowns but he is such a Scooby-Doo-esque vision of the creepy clown he feels like he belongs in a comedy parodying the scary clown trope. If he had looked like a sincere attempt at a clown that you might really find in at a preschooler's party then he would have looked more terrifying. There's something especially chilling about something about something which clearly isn't trying to scare you but which you clearly should be scared of. Tall order to create I know... At least he's very well acted and has tons of charisma.The human element is frequently charming, cute and engaging. Every character feels well thought out and the whole is just one long nostalgia trip about one strange but beautiful summer of self-discovery, due in no short part to Molly Ringwald Junior (I totally called her out on that before the character did). I hear in the book she gets a bit more jiggy with it. There is no cowardice worse than keeping cool stuff in the book out of the movie.When we see these characters integrated into the actual plot, that's when the stuffing starts to show. These horror movies that are themselves about fear are always taking a big risk. They can indeed be powerful stories that help us look into ourselves or just lazy, portentous claptrap. Perhaps a lot of meaning and nuance got lost in adaptation; I've listened to the first chapter of the book and boy does ol' Stevie lay it on thick with the narration. Sample: ""it was something your Mom said to you, not your brother"" SHOW DON'T TELL!You can feel the picture sagging beneath the weight of it's own ambition. Elements like slaughtering the cattle, the fire, the licentious father and the stammering don't really seem to go anywhere and ultimately the whole narrative seems to abandon all the philosophical threads it seems to want to establish and the last act is all about the strictly material struggle against not-Tim Curry.On another note, am I dumb or was anyone else confused about the rules here? Is Pennywise Tangible? Is he vulnerable to physical attacks? He seems to morph and teleport and conjure up visions as freely as Uncle Grampa. He feels super powerful and then suddenly very mortal. It made it very hard to keep emotionally involved with the action.And also that stammering kid was such a sanctimonious..the kid with the glasses was my favourite.But there are a lot of kooky images and nifty sequences if you just make no effort at all to follow what the context is.I feel like we missed out on a real classic of it's kind; a unique hybrid of horror, a philosophical novel and bildungsroman all because of a complacent approach to the writing.",It

Also having never seen the Made for TV adaptation from the 90s, I have no frame of reference. I knew something about a creepy clown (is there any other kind?) and some kids. That's about it for It. Trying to be both a horror film and a coming of age dramedy, It never quite finds that simpatico balance between the two. As a result, the two elements often work at cross purposes instead of pulling the rope together. The young cast is uniformly excellent and buoy the overlong film when it threatens to sink. Bill Skarsgård is effectively creepy as Pennywise, but the character--and the film--might've fared better had they simply let him do his thing w/o the overwrought CGI hocus pocus.",It

A group of 7 friends discover that a shape-shifting monster who disguises itself as a clown is the one responsible for the children's disappearances. Realising that no-one will believe their story, the 7 friends must band together to defeat the clown in order to keep Derry safe again...I watched the mini TV Series that this film was based upon a number of years ago so was intrigued by this film and wanted to see how it compared. In my opinion, this is a slight notch down on the TV series, but is still very good overall.The film has quite a long and rather slow build up, but to its credit it never feels dull or boring. Director Andy Muschietti directs with a degree of skill and competency - a great number of the scenes with Pennywise and the children are creepy and chilling, but this, in part, is down to some wonderful camera work. The cinematography and some of the sets are also top notch and as a whole the film is professionally mounted and well made.The young cast are all on pretty good form and put in reasonable performances; they were all likeable enough with the possible exception of the Ritchie character who could be annoying at times. However, the real star of the show is Bill Skarsgard whose turn as Pennywise the clown was energetic and rather unsettling - the film would be nothing without him and he is every bit as good in this film as Tim Curry was in the original.There are a couple of very slight weaknesses with the film; character development is a tad on the weak side, the dialogue and parts of the script aren't quite up to the same standard as the TV Series and I also didn't feel that the kids had quite the same camaraderie here as they did in the TV Series. I felt a tight bond between the characters in the original and sadly I didn't quite get the same feeling here with the kids in this film.Overall though, this has far more strengths than weaknesses and perhaps the only other thing that may upset some people is the fact that the film has been split into two halves (this seems to be the done thing these days in order for filmmakers to get more money, but I think it's necessary to the story to split the film into part 1 and 2 - anyone who has seen the TV Series will understand why).

Excellent scary story about a small town haunted by disappearances. The story begins with the disappearance of the young brother, Georgie, of the main character - Billy. Than, 1 by 1, we are introduced to the cast of outcast kids and their real-life fears. A scary clown, named Pennywise - is the reason for all the disappearances every 27 years, but - of course - only the group of outcast kids are revealed this - while the rest of the town ignore the issue. This movie works in a lot of ways - 1) As a scary movie, 2) As a story about facing your fears, and 3) a coming of age tale. There is no major stars in the film, but it is played out and directed almost flawlessly. It is all portrayed from the perspective of the kids - as the adults in the movie are mere window-dressing. Every child in the group that determines to confront the evil character has a backstory, and a reason for their fears except one who just fears clowns and we don't know why. As the kids each have strange visions they begin to come together sharing these stories. They determine the epicenter of the issue being a well, in town, which is now located in an old deserted house, and they visit it together to confront Pennywise. The ideas of togetherness and facing your fears is evident in the story, and these things become important to the conclusion of the movie.

Tim Curry nailed his fantastic performance as the terrifying supernatural Clown pennywise & is totally iconic for that role & scaring the hell outta thousands of kids who grew up in the 90's like myself!!!The new pennywise is more over the top,almost silly & funny but not terrifying like Tim Curry's Pennywise.There's alot of cool & fun stuff in the new film & some great scenes but i need to watch it again really as of now i think the 1990 film is probably still better.
Anyway the new flick is made well & has a good creepy atmosphere & a cool bunch of kid actors & there's some great scenes but it does feel like it's made for the stranger things cult phenomena that's taken over & i love Stranger Things but it's made with that in mind.
Some Awesome new stuff here in this version of it & the bunch of kids are Cool & gives that Goonies vibe & being set in the 80's is really Cool.",It
108,kluseba,Brilliant mixture of a coming-of-age drama and a supernatural horror movie,9,21 September 2017,"IT offers an excellent mixture of a coming-of-age drama and a supernatural horror movie. What I like about this film adaptation is how the film respects both sides on a perfectly balanced level. We are introduced to the lives of outcast teenage boys and one teenage girl who have to deal with severe cases of bullying, complicated family issues and their conflicting feelings for one another. As if that weren't enough to deal with, they also realize that the fact that numerous kids have been abducted in their hometown Derry isn't a mere coincidence. Behind its peaceful, calm and boring small town appearance, Derry seems to be a cursed place with a hideous past where a mysterious supernatural entity feeds on children's fears before consuming them literally. The outcast teenagers decide to take action and stop the monstrous entity with their curiosity, friendship and perseverance as weapons.IT takes place in the late eighties and this movie manages to take its audience back in time thanks to the timeless small town buildings, particular hairstyles and clothes and a fitting soundtrack. The film works so efficiently because it's easy for the audience to picture itself in these settings during their childhood years. The acting performances only increase this movie's authenticity. The teenagers all have different strengths and weaknesses and are refreshingly grounded and normal which is a welcome alternative to the popular world of superheroes and super-villains. The movie also has a strong cultural and intellectual side as it includes many allusions and references to Stephen King's other works. Some examples for this would be the town of Derry that serves regularly as setting for Stephen King's novels, the friendship between outcast teenagers in the key of Stand by Me and several allusions to thrash metal band Anthrax that has written numerous lyrics inspired by Stephen King's novels.You won't see the one hundred fifteen minutes pass as this immersive movie is very entertaining thanks to its mysterious story, authentic settings and profound characters. Due to the fact that the film takes place in the eighties, it is quite accessible for adults who will experience numerous deja-vu moments but its timeless brilliance should also be appealing to older teenagers who might easily identify with one or several characters in the movie. IT is a late summer blockbuster you shouldn't miss.On a closing side-note, this movie is the first part of a duology. The content of this movie takes place in the late eighties while the second movie is supposed to show what the characters, the supernatural entity and the town have become twenty-seven years later with some flashbacks from the past. These two story lines are similar to the way the original novel was written. You can watch this movie separately from the sequel but it wouldn't be possible to watch the sequel without watching this first instalment.",It
109,davispittman,Entertaining but could've been better,7,18 November 2017,"It (2017) was a pretty good movie overall, most of it was entertaining and well made. I will say that it wasn't as good as I expected, there were parts that could have been better. Well first the positives. One of the positives is the acting, great performances were given by all, I was impressed by the child actors, clearly very talented. I think the child actors really committed and showed the level of talent that you'd usually see in an adult actor. The special effects were also very well done. Pennywise's look was well put together and all the wild effects with him looked good. The beginning sequence was very well done, I loved the exchange between Pennywise and Georgie. The middle part of the film was alright, it had good acting and it set up everything for the finale, but to be honest, the beginning and the end were great, very well done, and I felt like the middle portion was alright, but my mind wondered some and I just felt like there wasn't enough substance to the middle part of the movie. Yes, the characters were good and the acting was still good in the middle, but I feel like the story needed more support in that section. I haven't seen the original Tim Curry It miniseries yet, so I cannot compare the two, all I know is that the original is basically like two films in one. I am excited for an It 2, which I feel is on its way since the original had two parts to it. All in all, a 7/10. Overall enjoyable, and I was entertained by the end of it, even though there were places in the movie that could've been better.",It
110,Kdosda_Hegen,Wow.,3,9 April 2020,"What the hell? It was quite long, very stretched out. In short: Horror scenes are pretty good, actions scenes (yes, action scenes) are great. But damn, this movie is extrememely unrealistic, all this world the characters live in: Children dissapears and nobody cares exept for the kids, crime is happenning and nobody cares exept for the kids, people are dying nobody cares exept for the kids... I just don't buy any of background of the world this movie is set up in.",It
111,TdSmth5,A disaster,2,10 January 2018,"Some loser pre-teen kids start being chased by something that confronts them with their fears. Occasionally some downright stupid-looking clown shows up. More terrifying than visions and clowns though is pretty much everyone else--the teen bullies and the parents that give the kids a hard time. There's the backstory of the town where kids disappear every so often. The kids are given something of a personality. It takes the kids more than two hours to figure things out and to confront the fugly but not scary clown. The editor and director struggle mightily with this underwhelming material and ultimately fail miserably in making something remotely interesting or thrilling out of it. The concept from the beginning is doomed. A movie about kids, written as if it were for kids yet actually for adults as is fashionable now, yet R rated for no good reason really with no scares or nothing else R-rated and clocking in at more than to tortuous hours. Unfortunately producing junk paid off this time around for everyone involved and we can look forward to a bunch of sequels that promise to be no better than this embarrassment in any way whatsoever. There's one thing this mess has going for it and for that I give it two stars and that is the stunning Sophia Lillis.",It
112,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,It,8,4 August 2021,"I have good memories of watching It in the cinema where I did find the film rather spooky. But much like the original Blair Witch once you've seen it, you know there is naught to be afraid of, not that it isn't still quite jump-scary in different places and disturbing in others, it achieves what it sets out to do very well, I very much enjoyed the plot it was all very entertaining and interesting.Had I been reviewing this after my cinema viewing a nine would very likely have been given, but I feel the thing that prohibits my giving of a nine is that some of the spooky affects (not many but a noticable few) looked very fake, clear computer whatnotry. Whereas other computer animations in this film were done well, why a couple looked suspect is a mystery to me.",It
113,s3276169,IT's back and better than ever.....,8,12 October 2017,"I would not have thought a new version of IT could much improve on the original but I was very, very wrong. The newest film iteration of the novel by Stephen King actually improves on the 90's film. It does do many of the same things but it does so in a way that's somehow fresh and has an exuberance and optimism, that inexplicably sits comfortably alongside the fear and horror that IT evokes. This is in many ways a very hopeful film about friendship with the cast of youngsters who face off against the malignant horror very much front and center. Their courage in the face of an appalling otherworldly monster, nicely captures the tone of the book. Casting for this film has been handled with great care. The chemistry between the self confessed ""losers"" a small group of social outcasts could not be better. Equally, IT is even scarier. It's playful, child like nuances and mannerisms are deeply disturbing, when juxtaposed with its savagely sadistic, predatory nature. Suffice to say, IT's back and better than ever. Looks like we might be in for a sequel too. I personally can't wait! Eight out of ten from me.",It
114,truemythmedia,Fun and Exciting!,8,18 June 2019,"As a horror film, I can't say this movie is incredibly scary, but I would argue that it is a good film overall. It's spooky like The Haunted Mansion at Disney World; it might make you jump, but you'll laugh in spite of yourself right after. If you're a Stephen King fan, I can't recommend this enough, it's one of the better versions of his books we've gotten to see on screen.",It
115,TheFearmakers,This is IT,10,8 September 2017,"Both the 1990's IT miniseries and the overload of recent reboot trailers must have left an impression: the now famously established red balloon of Pennywise the Clown flies over the dark blue New Line Cinema logo before even the opening credits are shown: Either way, here's a film that, within the first minute, sets up the main teenage boy character during the 1980's. On his bedroom wall is a poster of GREMLINS, and when all his buddies are together they do seem extremely Spielbergian. Meanwhile, this is a Stephen King adaptation, and the last project combining Steven and Stephen was STRANGER THINGS so, who knows, maybe cable binge-viewers will think that show inspired all this — but even they should realize that IT is a lot tighter and has way more rhyme, rhythm and purpose.While the youngster's dialogue is ridiculously over-sexed and mundane, seeming written by adults who wish they knew that much back then, the film's initial awkward stage grows up quick. While Tim Curry's original Pennywise was just plain weird, the rebooted clown lurks more in the shadows up-front and, as already spoiled in the trailers, has a way of quickly rushing forward for the kill, along with an explosion of music, that's seen in most horror movies (highlighted in every trailer) lately...Only this beast has layers, taking different forms to fit within the five boys' and one girl's worst fears while the chaser is always the same, and the clown never wears out its nightmarish welcome. Most important (for this genre) is a sort of lurking ""cursed vibe"" that films like THE SHINING and THE EXORCIST have: No matter what's happening on screen, there's an overall feeling of being watched and stalked, even before the inevitable pursuit.Leading to more than one climax and featuring side-villains, from white trash bullies to parents so terrible a killer clown may seem welcome. But everything connects as a whole, and flows together nicely as this small town gang called The Losers are fleshed out both together and alone. We'll have to see if forty-year-old's during modern times, with cell phones ready to snap a picture of anything, will be as effectively shocked and spooked as these kids were.

116,Amari-Sali,"Though marketed as a horror movie, Stephen King's IT (2017) is really a coming of age dramedy. One in which Pennywise sometimes becomes an afterthought.",7,17 September 2017,"SummaryAfter the death of his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) remains the only one who has faith that he is just missing. He isn't dead. Something his friends try to humor but it gets difficult after a while. Especially after they all have their introductions to Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård).With meeting IT, Bill's friends find themselves joining him in the hunt for this monster. Making a group which came together either for protection or to battle loneliness, into much more than the losers everyone thinks they are. For between facing their fears and sometimes ridding themselves of them violently, the would be losers prove they are perhaps the bravest people in Derry, Maine.HighlightsThis Adaptation Takes Advantage of Being on The Big Screen (And R) Perhaps the first thing that becomes abundantly clear is that this group of kids, they are not some PG ""Gosh Darn"" saying kind of group. Between talking about having sex with each other's moms, dick sizes, and cursing galore, we are given real deal teenagers. Of which, Richie (Finn Wolfhard) and Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) will be the main ones whose language will tickle you throughout the movie. Richie through him being a bit of a comedian (naturally), and his commentary causing constant giggles. As for Eddie, with his germophobia, among other things, he'll constantly make you roll your eyes, in a good way.With A Little More FeelingAnother thing quite notable with this adaptation is that the child actors they got, they know how to do more than crack jokes or seem like awkward teens. Each one's backstory is given some real oomph so that the source of their fears actually has weight. Take Mike (Chosen Jacobs) for example. His parents in the movie died in a fire and while, at first, them being dead leads to some real eye roll inducing teen angst, when he speaks of it with the Losers you can see the pain that caused. Especially as he expresses what sounds like guilt over it.The same can be said when it comes to Henry (Nicholas Hamilton) and Beverly (Sophia Lillis). Their issues with their dads are something which you can strangely connect with, even if you have a good relationship with your own. For Henry, as much as he abuses everyone, even cuts into Ben's (Jeremy Ray Taylor) stomach with a knife, seeing him with his dad, sniveling, kind of made you feel bad for him. Then with Beverly, well it isn't explicitly said or shown what he may do or has done, to her, but between anger and your skin crawling, the point comes across.CriticismSometimes, Everyone Tries Too HardSome kids are better at conveying their emotions than others. Bill usually holds it down, but every now and then he gets a corny line which makes you roll your eyes. Skarsgård does his best to seem scary, but even for those like me who shy away from horror movies, films in the thriller genre as well, some scenes you can tell should have been scary, just don't pop. On The FencePennywiseBetween Skarsgård's voice damn near sounding, at times, he is auditioning to do the voice for the next live action Scooby Doo movie, to him being more creepy than scary, he just didn't really do it for me. Yet, even though his jump scares were weak, I got startled about 4 times, I will say he did make Pennywise his own. He stripped away Tim Curry's comedic take on it and tried to bring about the more sinister side. Though, unfortunately, Pennywise was also allowed to look more pathetic as well. Especially as the kids started to not become afraid of him. So while he was presented as more creepy, unfortunately, the longer you see him, the more used to his antics you get. Sort of like the kids.The Romantic SubplotThere is a love triangle in the movie between Bill, Beverly, and Ben. In it, Ben is really pulling out all the moves between his poem, being the one to awaken Beverly from whatever spell Pennywise puts her under and more. Yet, he is constantly curved. Something which is a bit heartbreaking to watch but does help setup what may happen in the sequel.But what has this topic on the fence is because it ultimately doesn't do much for the movie. It is sweet, authentic, and the setup is needed for the sequel, but ultimately everything that happens seems more for the sequel than this movie. Which sucks since the love triangle is kind of compelling to the point you do wanna see it get fully resolved.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)I adore what the young actors did with their characters. They vastly improved them in comparison to what was done in the mini-series and truly left a mark. The kind I expect for Lieberher, Lillis, Wolfhard, Taylor, and Grazer, will certainly lead to bigger and better things. However, Skarsgård, as expected, falls into the trap of most modern villains. That is, the fear you are supposed to have of him being far too forced and while he gets point for his creepiness, after a certain point, be it because we see him too much or his tricks get old fast, you build up a tolerance.Hence the Mixed label. Mainly because the young actors overshadow the star attraction despite Pennywise being the selling point. For between him overstaying his welcome, to the kids just having such rich backstories and comedic scenes, you almost forget this is a horror movie with one of the genre's iconic monsters. For you serious, at times, get the vibe this is just a drama which features the kids all dealing with their trauma in their own unique way.",It
117,valleyjohn,Pennywise is back !,8,18 December 2017,"I loved the original IT film/Mini series and the Stephen King book even more so , so it was always going to be hard to live up to expectations especially when my opinion was that a remake was unnecessary but I actually really enjoyed this. 
Director Andy Muschietti tells the story in a different way that the book does. Where in the original it skips between the kids and the adults story this solely concentrates on the kids battle with Pennywise the clown. It does feel a little bit like The Goonies or Stranger Things and for that reason I didn't think it was overly scary but it does have it's moments. 
Bill Skarsgård had massive boots to fill ( excuse the pun) to be as good as Tim Curry's Pennywise and he definitely isn't as scary but he does a good enough job and at no stage was I bored . It's a really good film and I'm looking forward to the adults story in part 2.",It

The young cast all give incredible performances and have fantastic chemistry. Bill Skarsgård is perfect as Pennywise in an extremely committed performance. The humour works really well and it's full of extremely suspenseful and scary sequences throughout. The music by Benjamin Wallfisch is amazing and it's well paced. It's also beautifully filmed with excellent direction from Andy Muschietti.",It
119,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Reimagining of a Classic Novel,9,4 August 2019,"Now I will admit, when I first heard about this film, I fell into the hype. I went to see it opening night with my roommate at the time and to be honest I loved it. I've tried to keep it in perspective as at the time of writing of this, the sequel and the rest of the story isn't out yet. I'm updating this review after my fourth viewing, second time in the theater. The synopsis is in the summer of 1989, a group of bullied kids band together to destroy a shape-shifting monster, which disguises itself as a clown and preys on the children of Derry, their small Maine town.We then see two boys in a room. The older boy is sick and named Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher). He is making a paper boat for his younger brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott). Bill tells him that to complete it; he needs Georgie to go to the basement to get wax. He's scared of the basement, but does get what he is supposed to. Bill uses it to seal the paper and allow it float. Georgie takes the boat out and puts it in the water that is moving toward the storm drains. He hits his head and his boat gets a lead on him, going into one of these drains. He thinks it is forever lost when Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), the dancing clown, appears. He isn't what he seems though and attacks Georgie.We jump almost a year into the future. We meet another boy, Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) who works on a farm with his grandpa. His parents have passed away and he is asked to kill the sheep on the farm with an air gun. He can't do it and his grandfather scolds him for it.It then shifts to school for the last day and we meet the rest of the cast. Bill hangs out with Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff). Richie is the comedian of the group, or at least thinks he is. Eddie is a hypochondriac who has an overbearing mother and Stanley is a Jewish kid who is afraid of pretty much everything. We are also introduced to Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis). She smokes in the girl's bathroom and is bullied by her classmates. They spread rumors that she sleeps with everyone. There is also Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), who is a heavy-set new kid. Beverly is nice to him and warns him where the bullies are. He has a huge crush on her.We see Bill and his group have a run in with a local bully and his friends. The bully is Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton). His friends are Belch Huggins (Jake Sim), Victor Criss (Logan Thompson) and Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague). Henry has held off on Bill due to his brother going missing. We learn that there is a curfew for the city and a lot of children have also disappeared. Henry goes to hit Bill when an officer looks over and stops him. This turns out to be the bully's dad, played by Stuart Hughes.All of these kids have run-ins with Henry. We see one with Mike where he goes down an alley to avoid him. When he does he sees something behind a locked door that reminds him of his past. When it opens, he sees Pennywise. He is almost killed by Henry and that's when he notices it isn't real.The rest of the group one by one has their encounters with Pennywise as well. Ben does research on this since he didn't have friends and being the new kid. He learns that there is a high average of kids turning up missing here, much higher than the national average. These kids band together to form the Loser's Club, at first to prevent Henry from hurting them, but it ends up leading them to a much darker battle.Now I did want to go a little bit vaguer with the recap here, as this film has a lot packed into its two hour plus running time. I personally think that a lot of it should be experienced as well. I've heard people on both sides of the fence with the film, but I will be honest, I like the changes that were made here. I've read the novel twice and seen the original mini-series quite a few times. Now I don't really want to compare too much, as this is a re-adaptation of novel. I will say, this one is different from the book, while keeping some of the major interactions still.This film to me went darker and a lot of that is it is actually a film, not made for TV. Bill's family really fell apart after Georgie disappeared. We really don't get a lot of it that though, aside from what Bill tells us. Beverly also has much darker implications that her father is sexually molesting her. Those are really the only two characters that we delve into their back-story much though. Eddie though is intentionally told he is sick so his mother can control him, Mike is forced to do his duty on the farm and Stanley seems to be kind of a disappointment to his father who is a rabbi. These last three are pretty brief though.Something I did want to bring up here though is Henry in this film is given more of a reason why he is a bully. Now in the original he is a greaser that is just a jerk. Here his father is a police officer who mentally abuses him. He belittles him and the only way he can feel better is to exert dominance over those around him. I did find this intriguing to kind of humanizing him before he snaps.To move next to the pacing of the film, it actually doesn't feel like its 2 hour and 15 minute run time. It really just moves smoothly through everything and I like how they sprinkle in the scares as well to keep it fresh. The original obviously introduced us to the adults before showing their encounter with Pennywise, but much like that mini-series, this first half has been quite strong. I do think that the ending of this one works much better for me and how brutal it really is. I don't necessarily care for a change that is revealed during this end sequence, but that is neither here or there to be honest.Now to the acting of the film, the elephant in the room is Pennywise. I've heard a lot of people stating who is better as this character. I thought Tim Curry was great as Pennywise, but he also played the character much differently as well. Where he brings kind of a wise cracking element to it, Skarsgård plays it much more like a monster and we get the feeling that it is more of a façade for sure. I thought all of the kid actors were pretty solid for the most part. Martell, Taylor Lillis, Jacobs and Grazer were all solid. I'm a big fan of Wolfhard, having seen him on Stranger Things first. Oleff did have some moments of overacting, but he is a kid so I won't hold that against him. I also really like Hamilton, Scott and the rest of the cast as they rounded out the film for what was needed.Another point of contention with film is the effects. I really didn't have any problems with them to be honest. There are some practical effects, but a lot of is CGI. It does look good to me though. It does seem to be a lot more of touch-ups on some things. Plus I've heard debates about some shakiness with Pennywise, but I still don't see it. Skarsgård can do some creepy things to help make his character creepy for sure. I also thought the cinematography was well done. There are some nice wide shots to allow to see things at different levels of the frame which I likeNow with that said, I thought this was a solid update to the first half of the story here. They made their changes, which I'm glad they did as they made it their own and shot for shot remakes don't really seem to work. They definitely went darker with this one and I can appreciate that. The editing and pacing of the film are good; I also like the darker ending to this one. The acting is good across the board, which really helps to bring these characters to life. I know some people have issues with the effects, but I really didn't, even though they're mostly CGI. The soundtrack of the film did fit the era and it also plays with some humor for the film. There are also some creepy sound effects that help drive the tension as well. I am really curious to see how the second half plays, but so far, much like the original mini-series, I think this is really good.",It
120,robertemerald,Outstanding original horror,10,22 August 2020,"It Chapter One is highly original horror. It Chapter Two is magnificent as well, but has the air of a blockbuster cashing in on the originality of the first chapter. Of the two movies this is the one that'll knock your socks off, while the latter continues the entertainment but doesn't really surprise anymore (I'd still give it a 9 out of 10 though!) Chapter One is full of perfectly realised visions of evil, perfectly contrasted against the innocence of children. The more I see of Stephen King the more I am impressed. I'd argue, cinematically, that this movie is one of his finest adaptions. The combination of inspired classic image and well considered special effects is awesome. Oh, and yes it is spooky and suspenseful as any good horror should be. The casting for the clown really couldn't have been more perfect.

121,TheOneThatYouWanted,4/10,1,24 September 2017,"Boring and completely overrated. I swear I'm going to stop watching movies backed by Hollywood generated hype. And Hollywood wonders why the overall domestic box office numbers keep going down despite inflation. It is because we, the people are told a movie is awesomely fantastic by media and paid off film critics (and now the ones on YouTube are paid off too) but once we watch the film, those of us with an independent thought process call it garbage while those people how are frankly sheep just mindlessly echo the Hollywood hype machine narrative until they wake up a few months later. I can list a million recent examples but I'll just jump right into reviewing this piece of overrated snoozefest. The major issue with the film is that it is not an actual film. It comes off as a series of semi related 15 minute scenes within a single movie. And because of that, it becomes boring as all heck once you see the pattern of each scene. Basically it plays out like this; the kid or kids are chilling out doing whatever, almost as if they forgot about what just happened during the last scene. Then the clown comes as spooks them while failing to kill them almost all of the time. Literally that is the whole film.",It
122,jadepietro,"As Horror Films Go, It Works Very Well",8,9 September 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: There are plenty of scares in this well-made predictable horror remake. SYNOPSIS: Children are mysteriously vanishing and a band of young sleuths battle an evil force named Pennywise.JIM'S REVIEW: Clowns get no respect. Once the target of laughs and the butt of jokes, they now are coming into their own as repressed sick murderers bent on revenge and mayhem. Their reputation is evolving and Andrew Muschietti's It will cement its new incarnation.The phrase, ""a penny wise and a pound foolish"" might mean to be careful about unimportant things and careless about important matters, but the film adaptation of Stephen King's It is very smart to pay attention to the small details that build on the tension and phobias of many moviegoers and then lets the overall storytelling and plot create the horror. The film is also very clever to deal with its evil It, namely Pennywise, a sadistic killer clown and perfect villain vs. its Stand by Me coming of age innocent teenagers who come together to save the inhabitant of their New England town.Many years ago, Mr. King's successful novel was an even more successful 1990 television mini- series. Just as that version allowed strong character development and its intriguing plot to unfold in order to build suspense, so does this newer installment...plus it has the freedom to be more graphic in its violence, which has its built-in pluses and minuses depending on every moviegoer's taste. While the story still remains formulaic and the killings are a tad more bloody and gruesome (enough to earn a R-rating), the film sets out to do what It is meant to do: scare and satisfy its audience. (The screenplay by Chase Palmer. Gary Dauberman, and the film's previous director, Cary Fukunaga, follows the book fairly faithfully. Based on the original source, this film doesn't tell the whole story and only deals with the earlier lives of the adolescent crusaders before they reached adulthood...there is already a sequel about the novel's later chapter.)Director Muschietti skillfully makes this fright machine work and he paces his film with enough bumps in the night for audiences to relish this genre. Too often, he relies on too much CGI, an overabundance of quick cuts, or sudden loud noises to create the cheap thrills, but he also knows how to set up the action, generate the fear factor, establish the characters enough for the audience to invest in their deadly peril, and slowly build scenes of suspense to well earned horror. (My favorite moment: the slide projector sequence.)The plot may be redundant but it is serviceable. Children of the tiny village of Derry, Maine are disappearing with no end in sight. No one, especially the dysfunctional adults, are unable to solve the mysteries or unwilling to believe a group of teenagers who decide to investigate. The kids are a cross section of young misfits and loners that are more clichéd characters than real, but, let's face It, this ""Loser's Club"" are mere plot devices to move the action along to the next creepy encounter.The young actors are fine in their roles, especially Sophia Lillis (a real find), Nicholas Hamilton, Jeremy Ray Taylor, and Jaeden Lieberher. They are all totally believable and give some nuance to their stock generalizations of childhood stereotypes.But to make this all flow, the evil villain needs to be menacing and terrifying. Pennywise's make- up, with its cracked white greasepaint, sharp rotten teeth, and elongated forehead, defines this monster so well. More ghoulish than clown-like, the effect is chilling. Special mention goes to the hair and make-up artisans for creating such a memorable creature and kudos to the man behind the painted mask, actor Bill Skaragard. It's all scary fun.NOTE: Nice poster design too.",It

124,rgkarim,IT rocks,9,8 September 2017,"Remakes, remakes, remakes. It seems every time you turn around, Hollywood is out once more make money by simply updating a previous hit. Often these remakes pale in comparison, but every once in a while, you get a film worthy of social media blow up and hype. This weekend, the highly anticipated, and over-advertised, IT remake crawls out of the studio shadows and attempts to make us face our fears. Can Hollywood bring King's famous work into the modern century of film, or will it merely make us scream in fright at horrible it is. Robbie K back from a two-week hiatus to bring you another review. Let's get started!LIKES:Creepy: Horror movies are supposed to be scary, and fans of my work know I love it when the studio crawls under my skin. IT has plenty of moments that creeped me out, primarily the use of shadows, sound, and those small details that teased the audience to the scares. A nice variety of tactics exists in this movie to make you squirm in your seat, all led by the deliciously evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) and all his pasty white glory. One may find another of disturbing scenes in this movie, primarily in that cold, seeking stare he loves to use so much. Yes, It certainly mirrored the atmosphere portrayed in the book. Acting: Seldom do I say a horror film has good acting, but IT hit a home run with all the actors chosen to bring the characters to life. Instead of the usual airheaded, shallow characters who did nothing but scream and curse, this cast portrayed a much broader emotional rolewhile still cursing. This group did such a good job that I actually liked and invested energy into the characters, which isn't usually the case in modern horror cinema. While I can't give shout outs to each one, I certainly will give props to how much they sold the summer adventure to me, almost like Stranger Things meets the Goonies, with a little more demented atmosphere on top. Of course, the real props go to Skarsgard, whose portrayal as Pennywise is certainly a major part to the horror he brings. His delivery is incredible, that shadowy, whisper like voice that mimics the element of the movie. Throw the laugh and creepy body acting, to get the complete demonic nature of Pennywise. The Story: Stephen King knows how to write a story, and thank goodness, this director knew how to bring it to life. IT finally proves you can have a scary movie with a plot worth investing in. This version follows the book very well, managing to develop the characters, lay out the story, and still bring all the creepy parts into beautiful detail and length. The result is a more engaging movie, increased suspense, and an emotional roller coaster as you live the adventure through these kids. This aspect is my favorite component of the movie and certainly worth the price of admission, including the little revelation at the endwhich fans of the book will know. DISLIKES:More Suspense, Less Scares: IT might be creepy, but I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be. I, nor my friends, didn't jump at all. Despite creepy build-ups and a setting that welcomes scares, IT still has the same predictable foreshadowing that is used a little too often that it dilutes the big revelation. While it was certainly more suspenseful in regards to the adventure, I don't foresee myself getting nightmares from this movie. Unbalanced at times: IT has a lot of things perfectly done in this movie, but there are a few moments where they seemed to drop the ball on their characters. True, I haven't read the book in a long time, but I seemed to remember each kid having almost equal involvement in fighting the shapeshifting embodiment of fear. In this film though, I felt they dropped the characters at time to the backburner, choosing to focus on just three of the main characters. The Computer Effects: The past two dislikes are minor and just space filling, but the only major dislike was the CGI effects. When IT conforms into the more realistic entities crafted by makeup and costumes, I would feel grossed out, sickened, and get goosebumps. However, when the CGI moments came into play, the realism faded away to cheesy effects that were more humorous than terrifying. Sure, the creatures themselves would make anyone wet themselves, but their portrayal In this movie could have been maximized if they stuck to makeup effects. In addition, some of the convulsing moments were funny to watch, again due to the semi-realistic effects. While certainly not the worst visual effects, it could have used a little tune up to be honest. The VERDICT:IT proves that you can make a remake that doesn't stink and may actually be truer to the book. While not the scariest movie to haunt the theater, it is fantastically creepy and will certainly get your skin crawling. In addition, the acting and story are fully developed and bring about a wonderful tale that will keep you hooked into the movie wondering where the end of the adventure would be. Yes, the computer effects need a little work, but otherwise a solid addition to the horror genre and a worthy trip to the theater. My scores are:Drama/Horror: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",It
125,invisibleunicornninja,You'll float too...,3,18 March 2018,"I saw this movie in theaters. That was a mistake. I heard it was good and was looking forward to watching it and enjoying it. Instead I sat in a theater for 135 minutes confused as to what the hell was going on. If you're going to watch this movie, I'd recommend not paying money for it. Or not watching it at all. This movie is just bad in so many ways, and I don't understand why so many people like it. I guess its the book. Characters - The acting is really bad. The problem with having children as your main characters is you have to cast children to play them. I've got nothing against these kids, but they're all cringeworthy in this movie. I'm sure they'll all come to realize this looking back at this movie a few years from now. I can't blame them though. The ""characters"" that are written for these kids are terrible. They're not even cliches, they're just boring nothings. Most of the characters don't even react to seeing crazy things, they're just extremely calm. Also a lot of these kids make really dumb decisions. I'm not saying children are geniuses in real life, but in this movie, most of them are pretty stupid. A lot of the dialogue is bad as well. Its hard to get invested in a movie when none of the ""characters"" act like real people. They're all so unlikable. I liked Pennywise. He was kinda entertaining in the first few scenes but then he gets utterly ruined in what I am assuming is the finale. The First Scene - This is the only scene in this movie that I liked. It would've worked better as a short film. Too bad everything after it is terrible. Tone - This movie isn't scary. There are a few predictable jumpscares and a few creepy moments, but nothing was scary. Two things that contributed to this are the bad effects and the unlikable ""characters."" I don't understand why there are people who were scared by this mess. The Plot - What plot? This ""movie"" is just a collection of scenes. Nothing is explained. There are constant continuity errors. This is just a barrage of nonsense. There might be a plot in the book, but there isn't one in this thing.The Cinematography - Some shots are ok, but for the most part the look of this movie is very bland. Some of the practical effects are good, but for the most part everything that is CG looks very fake. The audio is pretty bad as well.Logic - There is not logic to this movie. Nothing is established. Things just happen. No-one reacts to things like actual people would. This thing is so nonsensical that I don't think its even a movie. Its just a mess. Someone dumped a bunch of nonsense on the floor, whipped out a camera and tried to market it as a movie. Looks like it worked.",It
126,framptonhollis,"not very ""scary"", but still magnificent none the less",7,1 October 2017,"31 Days of Spookoween: DAY ONE Film #1: It (2017) Review: So far this year I have seen only one other film in the theaters, and that was the restoration of Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker which came on in the seventies, making It the first 2017 film I saw at the movies so far, as well as the only feature length film I've seen that came out this year period. And, It made me feel like maybe I should go to the movies more often.The movie certainly has its major flaws, particularly the obnoxiously high volume of the music and sound effects during the ""scarier"" scenes, despite the fact that those scenes would likely be far more effective if they were left with total silence. But, otherwise is was a brilliantly constructed blockbuster that is really about far more than creepy clowns and shrieking jump scares. The coming of age material surpasses the scares in both quality and entertainment in my opinion. The kids are constantly exchanging in hilarious dialogues and the film takes its time to allow the viewer to really get to know and care for this group of charming, funny little characters.There are definitely a few creepy visuals (I actually thought the special effects in this movie were well done despite their lack of believability, it gave the film some mild surrealism that is somewhat reminiscent of the new season of Twin Peaks, and anyone who knows me knows that I absolutely ADORE almost everything about that brilliant spectacle of a series, but let's not get too off topic) and some disturbing concepts (there is a brutal bully character in this movie who eventually turns to practical insanity; it's clear to me that this was probably ripped right from the pages of the novel, which further fuels my interest to read that horror classic!), but overall It did not really scare me. The scares relied heavily on shock value and that just doesn't work on me. I enjoyed a lot of the horror-type material, but it simply did not effect me as much as it seems to have other people. And that's largely because floating and balloons are not among my biggest fears, no matter how many sound effects are layered on top of them. But whether or not a horror movie scares me doesn't ruin or make the film exactly, at least not most of the time, and this is a perfect case of that. I found the movie to be entertaining, engaging, funny, exciting, and, in the end, surprisingly heartfelt, and therefore It deserves plenty of praise, and not only as a ""scary Halloween movie"", but as a really wonderful coming of age story that just so happens to contain some brutal depictions of children being chased by horrifying entities.",It
127,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A nice update for a new generation,8,26 December 2020,"Of all the works written by horror novelist Stephen King, none of his creations were fully recognized until the late 1980s to 1990s. Yes, Carrie (1976) and The Shining (1980) had come out way earlier than that, if anything though, they were the launch pad for King's properties into the film industry. Yet, the one creation a generation would remember most was not even from a theatrical film, but a mini-series. Stephen King's It (1990) with Tim Curry was successful at leaving an impression on viewers. It had a likeable cast of characters, a memorable villain and an interesting way of telling the story. Despite the fondness though people have for the whole series, it wasn't perfect and suffered from a datedness that the 1990s only had. This new reimaging of the story not only updates it but raises the bar slightly, which is rare. Thankfully it stands out enough that it does nothing to harm the reputation of the first effort.Instead of book ending the story with two different settings simultaneously, this entry just covers the early years. This is definitely a better way to approach this since it's a theatrical film. Credit to writers Cary Joji Fukunaga, Chase Palmer and Gary Dauberman for having the foresight to do this along with director Andy Muschietti. When a group of ragtag children join forces for being considered outcasts, they also realize that the town they live in has something to hide. For some reason people, especially children go missing. As they continue to search for answers, they realize a dark force has been creeping on them, only known as It. While the premise is the same, it's quite surprising how well things are handled considering Fukunaga and Palmer had no previous writing credits to a horror film before it. Dauberman does have experience, but his best known credits to this point was Annabelle (2014) and most recently Annabelle: Creation (2017).No main characters featured in this project are adults, except It. Jaeden Martell plays Bill, the stuttering leader of the group, who also lost his brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) to the mysterious force. Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is the new kid on the block who enjoys reading and has the biggest heart. Beverly (Sophia Lillis) is the only girl of the group, but is able to stand her own even to them, mostly because of her abusive father. Richie (Finn Wolfhard) is the jokester and seeks to be the grounder of the group. Mike (Chosen Jacobs) is the farm boy who lost his parents in a house fire, but does his best to stand out. Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) the germophobe is a smart kid who has the clearest common sense from anyone else, but also has asthma. Then there's Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), the kid of religion who has other things he needs to accomplish but is just as much an outcast like his friends.There's also the Bowers gang, led by Henry (Nicholas Hamilton) and his cronies Belch (Jake Sim), Victor (Logan Thompson) and Patrick (Owen Teague). All of these actors perform well off each other and their chemistries feel natural in every situation. Lastly there's Bill Skarsgård as It. Taking the form of his best known character as Pennywise the dancing clown. His performance as Pennywise is definitely one in itself. Skarsgård made it clear from the beginning he had to make his performance different from that of Tim Curry because he knew how many people regarded the original incarnation. Skarsgård as Pennywise is ravenous and quite sadistic, yet has moments of dark comedy for good measure. And unlike the mini-series where Pennywise looked like the mainstream clown, here he looks like a clown from another century. The only thing that could've been changed was not having the child actors dropping F bombs so frequently. It seemed like almost every sentence they used.For a film that came out in the late 2010s, the look of it is praiseworthy. The cinematography shot by Chung-hoon Chung is beautiful to look at either during the day time or in dark settings. Chung was also the cinematographer for the original Oldboy (2003). The sets built for the film also look great. Whether it be the sewers the kids go searching in or the old abandoned house. The interiors look amazing. Finally, the film score composed by Benjamin Wallfisch is unique to listen to. The score is a mix of orchestra and heavy synthesizers but still manages a balance between dark themes and the lighter ones. There's also the use of a creepy organ and a children's choir for Pennywise, which makes it all the more unsettling. All around though, a great work from this up and coming composer.Aside from a slight overuse of the F word by children like it's their favorite word, this updated version of Stephen King's popular novel is a worthy addition. The performances from the actors, unique music and beautiful cinematography all elevate the experience of watching this movie.",It
128,justin-fencsak,A new horror classic for millenials to enjoy..,8,11 February 2018,"When the book came out in 1986, it was a hit. When the miniseries came out four years later, it was also a hit. When part one of a two part movie series came out last September, it became a mega hit. This movie is worth a buy if you're a fan of horror films based on Stephen King's best selling books. While not as good as The Shining, It is worth watching for the costume design, which sadly wasn't nominated for Oscars. It's definitely not for kids under 17 despite featuring a cast that's mostly underrage kids hanging out in a small town in the late 1980s (as opposed to the 1960s setting of the book and the miniseries). Shot mostly in Canada , this modestly budgeted film packs scares, laughs, and drama into a true horror classic that will be seen again and again for years to come. You'll float too.",It
129,Kingslaay,Decent and enjoyable,7,23 September 2017,"It was not a bad film and not as scary as expected but with horror films its the anticipation that is nerve wrecking and It had plenty of that. The comedy worked surprisingly well given its morbid nature. It also peaked everyone's interest. If you can get over the obvious flaws such as kids being able to be kidnapped and killed by a clown every 27 years without being found out its a decent film. The kids of this film did a great job and showcased their fear quite well. This is not one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's novels as some of those films (The Shining, Misery etc) were outstanding. Overall decent film.7.5/10",It
130,Rob_Taylor,It sinks... It all sinks down here...,5,30 October 2017,"So, as far as adaptations go of Stephen King works, this is one of the better ones. I should qualify that by saying that, although decent, it is by no means a mirror of the book. In fact, the earlier mini-series starring Tim Curry was a more faithful adaptation in that respect. However, when we consider the usual butchery done to King's stories when translated to film, this isn't the worst offender by far.With all that out of the way, you'll note I have given the film a middling five score. The main reason for that is simple. The movie relies entirely on jump scares and strident Inception-like horn blasts for its scares. It is, essentially, the horror movie equivalent of a laughter track, designed to prompt the audience to be afraid. However, once this formula becomes apparent to the viewer in a movie - any movie - its power to scare you actually diminishes almost to zero.A lot of so-called horror movies rely on this audience prompting. It's sad in a way, because I'm old enough to remember when old horror movies of the 70's and 80's realised this mistake and tried at least to change it up so that not every jump scare (or setup for a jump scare) actually resulted in a ""shock"". Nowadays, it seems like modern film-makers have forgotten even that much guile when they make such movies. Or maybe they just don't care to make a movie that keeps you on your toes anymore. Or perhaps, they just don't care.So, It isn't a very scary horror movie. It relies too much (entirely, really) on these jump scares and an amount of gore that, sadly, is all too present in these types of efforts.As a movie it does its job reasonably well. I mentioned earlier that it isn't a bad adaptation of King's book. Certainly it is miles better than the recent Dark Tower mess. However, the story isn't fleshed out sufficiently to make you really care about the characters and, honestly, this Pennywise is far less creepy and disturbing than Tim Curry's version.Once again, I am forced to conclude that King's books are better in a serialised format rather than a standalone movie (though this is set up to be a duology). Accordingly, things feel rushed and some of the editing is a bit abrupt. There's no steady build-up. Just a succession of jump scares and thinly dealt with backstories.It's not terrible, but neither is it as good as you might be led to believe.SUMMARY: Jump scares! Loud noises! Gore! Thin characterisations and rushed story. Tried to pack too much into too little. Typical horror tropes that drag it down into the sewer. It doesn't float, it sinks.",It
131,Matt_Layden,"Killer clowns are scary, right?",8,11 September 2017,"Stephen King terrified people with IT, his second longest novel next to The Stand. Bringing kids fears to life with the embodiment of Pennywise the dancing clown. In 1990, the 'epic' story was turned into a two part TV-Mini series starring Tim Curry and John Ritter. As a kid, that film was terrifying due to the performance of the friendly clown with a sinister undertone. Looking back now, it's incredibly cheesy and 'of the time'. So an update was needed and Stephen King has had a huge year; with The Dark Tower, Netflix's Gerald's Game and a new TV series The Mist, he's back in the spotlight. In the town of Derry, Maine, kids go missing. So much that the rate is six times the national average. One of those kids is Georgie, a little boy who disappeared down the sewers. His brother Bill, has never stopped looking for him. Along with his friends, he plans to search the sewers, hoping to find at least a body. Along with his friends, known as The Losers Club, they make it their mission this summer...but when they find out the answers lead to a child killing clown, their nightmares become a reality.IT was going to be a big success, but no one anticipated how big a success. After a massive weekend at the box-office, people are looking to be scared again, in R-rated territory no less. The road to the finish line was a long one for the film, with Cary Fukunaga wanting to write and direct. Those plans fell through and his reasons were that the studio wanted to make a generic 'jump scare' film, where he wanted to tell a deeper story about the kids. The finished film, courtesy of Mama director Muschietti manages to balance those two aspects quite well. The decision to split the film in two and use the first half to focus on the kids only was an interesting move and one that let the story breathe a little bit more. We're already being pulled in plenty of directions with the numerous characters, to have to be pulled into their adult version too would be too much. The story has been ""updated"" and takes place in the 80's. Hot off the heels of Strangers Things, IT plays into some nostalgia here and it works.The kids look and act the parts very well and all have great chemistry. I was particularly impressed with Sophia Lillis who plays Beverly. She looks like a young Amy Adams and has enough charisma to have a career in the industry. With just enough sass, but obvious fear lurking under the surface, she has the most to engage with. Her nightmare sequence in the bathroom might be a tad bit of overkill and doesn't feel as sinister as the 1990's TV version. Something about the father touching the blood on the sink irks me more from the TV version than him simply not noticing the room completely covered in it in this film. It also makes the 'clean-up' part a little bit less believable here. Bill, our defacto lead character, is tormented by the loss of his little brother, this is his defining characteristic. These two characters get the most attention while we just float around the rest of the kids stories. The one with the least amount of screen time has to be Mike, who is the outsider of the group. These kids made me laugh and made me believe in their friendship, which makes the film work and connect.Skarsgård had the difficult task of following in Tim Curry's footsteps. He does a really good job with Pennywise though. His otherworldly eyes were not CGI, he managed to move them in different directions himself and his creepy voice added to the sinister feel the character needs. One look at him and some audience members gasped. There are plenty of jump scares and the audience fell for almost every single one. Surprisingly enough, I didn't. I'll fall for a good jump scare any day of the week, but IT failed to get even one out of me. I don't know why, maybe it was the obvious horror beats leading to each one but the film didn't 'get me'. It felt scary, but not once was I scared, if that makes sense. Maybe because the whole film takes place during the daytime it adds a sense of security? I don't know, but plenty of people in the theatre seemed frightened. Muschietti has a creative eye for the unnatural. Looking over Ben's shoulder in the library and seeing an old lady stare him down without him knowing is effective, as is the use of the stabilizing camera effects on Pennywise's face while everything else shakes wildly. Small camera movements, such as straightening a picture, are done creatively here and add to the immersive feel the film wants. Even though the film feels predictable in the horror beats, with each scare simply leading into more anticipation for the next one, the film as a whole works. IT does a great job of me wanting to see the next chapter.",It
132,pc95,Only as Good as Your Source/Script,6,16 September 2017,"I remember seeing several people I knew reading a very thick looking Stephen King's ""IT"" paperback novel, and asking how it was with a ""so-so"" initial response. I've never been much of a fiction reader. That reaction is about the same as my take on this new 2017 remake movie from director Andy Muschietti (whom I've never heard of until now). It has the feel more recently of Super 8 and Muschietti is reaching into 80s material (ala Goonies, ET, or Stand by Me) to recreate it. This aspect of the movie is endearing, but the comedy shtick is cliché and repetitive and the horror only marginal. In short the source material is not strong enough. So while the slick updated effects help, especially with Pennywise the Monster clown, the movie is disjointed, clichéd, and repetitive thanks to a disjointed, repetitive story. Maybe recommended for Stephen King fans though 6/10, but it's no ""Shining"" though.",It

The cast of unknown child actors handled the fear, and humour in perfect balance, while Pennywise was even creepier than in the original. There were also a few brilliantly subtle music cues, amongst a lot of crescendosI want to see horror films return to having a physical villain ( as last year's Green Room, and Don't Breathe, as well as this film has ) rather than yet another ghost story/ supernatural/ haunting flick, like we've had seemingly never ending examples of in the past several years. Granted, this film has supernatural elements in it, but it simultaneously has an actual villain, a physical entity threatening the protagonists, which is where I hope horror films return to. Its 135-minutes long run time basically flew by quickly.The opening credits call the film, It, while the closing credits call the film, It Chapter One. The Cult, my all time favourite band, are on the soundtrack, also. Fifteen minutes in, we hear about thirty seconds of Love Removal Machine",It
135,vengeance20,Better than the Original!,9,8 September 2017,"Now before I start, I know the Original wasn't a Film, but a 2 Parter TV Series. But that don't mean this vision doesn't replicate & remake the original vision. Just wanted to clarify that.Now I caught a screening of this at my local & was blown away by how epic IT was! See what I did there...! Anyway, it was dark, gory, bloody & extremely creepy & sinister! The Pennywise in this vision is far more creepy & sinister looking than in the original, not to mention with the amount of clown scares going about over the past couple of years in the UK, this really added to that fear & phobia, not to mention how it connects with a new generation on what we find scary & sinister! It's also perfect timing too!The story in this vision is from the kids POV, so that mean in maybe 2019/2020, we'll see Part 2 with from the adults POV! It'll be great as I'm looking forward to it!The film unleashed a lot more & was simply more extreme in terms of fear factor! The gore was a lot more intense & realistic! So much so I'm surprised this wasn't an 18 certificate, as this film was rated a 15!As I said before, Pennywise was a lot more creepier in this vision that he was in the 1990 vision, as he looked too cartoon like & simply not scary enough! I also felt the dialogue was more real to life in this too!Only thing I would say I disliked about this film was the run time, I felt the film dragged towards the end & was a bit too long, but I suppose considering the book (which I've never read) it's pretty short in comparison! Overall, I say this was epic & great film, aside from the run time, it was a truly epic remake, with a dark, sinister & very gory twist on it!9/10",It
136,begob,Brilliant first half,8,11 December 2017,"After his little brother is taken by a ghoulish clown, a teenage boy and his gang of loser friends are threatened by visions of the killer and must uncover the secret past of their town to figure out how to defy him.First instalment of an adaptation of a big, fat novel. I remember reading this way back, finding it a great story while skipping much of the overwritten prose. Then came the mini-series, which was OK but didn't do justice etc. So with all the hype, and budget, and marketing I was expecting this to be a bit bloated, and defanged in a James Wan kind of way.But Woh! The first half is brilliantly rich and balanced. The opening sequence introduces the scares immediately, with a wonderful re-imagining of the clown, including rabbit teeth and a voice that melts from candy to bile. Then the small-town environment is introduced as we meet the characters growing up with the constant threat of bullying and adult oppression. Yet there is some lovely humour over teen awkwardness and young love - one scene has a passionate little fella trudging off with his headphones trailing on the ground. Reminded me of Homer Simpson in his tattered rags. And another where the lads gaze at the sleeping dreamy girl, only to look away when she opens her eyes.So lots of themes and interactions are delivered, interspersed with the frights, and I don't think I've ever been as happy watching a horror movie at the 60 min mark. After that we get a climax, then suck it up and go again for a second final act. This is where the movie reaches for the big set piece, and it works well, not perfectly, with good pacing.One thing that may have been misjudged was the synagogue scene with the strange painting, as it seemed to introduce a religious element that wasn't necessary - perhaps they were laying pipe. Whatever - there is plenty to build on for the next instalment. And one joke I thought they missed: the writing on the cast should have spelled out LOOSER.Acting all round is good, with some stand out performances from the kids - I liked the actors playing Bev and Ben. Photography is good, but a lot depends on CGI despite the early brevity of the fright scenes. The music and sound are lavish but not overwhelming.Overall: Brilliant introduction, plenty to chew on, and hopefully the next one reaches and maintains that standard for the whole movie.",It
137,bkrauser-81-311064,A Funhouse Thrill Ride,8,11 September 2017,"The hot early, summer sun hits the tiny hamlet of Derry much like any other. Kids empty the démodé 50's style school house on the last day of school like inmates scurrying away from work detail. The Tutor style bungalows and quaint farmhouses fade into the rolling hills. The library, the druggist, the tiny two-house movie theater, all prominent features in what is by all accounts an idyllic New England town. The fact that the disappearance rate in Derry is six times the national average is a little known but morbid detail that most ignore. That is until the summer of '89.This is when seven friends collectively known as the Losers' Club first realize that something is amiss. Bill (Lieberher) the self-assured leader of the pack becomes convinced that many of Derry's child disappearances can be attributed to a shape shifting demon that lures his victims into the sewers to be consumed. Bill has a personal stake in this scenario, as his brother Georgie (Scott) was carried off during the fall. Now he fears he and his friends might be next.This movie has been a long time coming and in 2017, the stage couldn't have been more set. Stephen King fans have been pining for a theatrical version of It about as much as general audiences have recently been looking for yet another nostalgia trip to rub their back and tell them ""shh it's fine, the 80's were as good as you remember them."" 27 years since the release of the miniseries and a little over a year since the release of Stranger Things (2016-present), it's inarguable that the stars couldn't have been more aligned for It. If I were a short-sighted, no-nothing Hollywood producer I'd say the pressure's off on It being any good. It's going to make money regardless so why put forth the effort? Well I'm glad to say the film's large slate of producers and director Andy Muschietti did not skimp on the good stuff. It is a fun, thrilling, endlessly entertaining horror show whose artfully rendered atmospherics is paired well with some really stellar child acting. It's briskly paced and ludicrously creepy with Bill Skarsgard turning in a monster star-making performance as the devious Pennywise. I'm actually kind of shocked It is as good as it is! Lieberher, Lillis, Wolfhard et al. all turn in masterful performances as the young indomitable kids who take on the menacing Pennywise. Grazer and Taylor specifically breathe incredible life into their roles as Eddie the hypochondriac and Ben the (cough, cough) new kid on the block. Though each child actor has such immediate chemistry among each other that I'm confident audiences will walk away with the room roughly split between them all.The screenplay as written by Cary Fukunaga, Chase Palmer and Gary Dauberman gives the kids incredible opportunity to show off their range and Muschietti seems hell-bent on reinforcing the film as character first; an instinct he previously honed in Mama (2013), his similarly themed debut film. Yet even if you remember that film, nothing can prepare you for just how good this sophomore film is; how scary, how funny, how heartfelt and how violent it is.And can we just take a moment to talk about Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise? I don't want to say its perfect casting as the villainous child-eating demon is less of a character than a force of pure evil. Plus to the nostalgically inclined, nothing can beat Tim Curry. Yet as an angrier, more primal version of Pennywise, the Scandinavian actor has the intensity, presence and uncomfortable seductiveness necessary to bend the role to his will. He's not so much better as he is different – like Jack Nicholson's Joker when compared to Heath Ledger.Of course the film is not without its faults, the largest of which is there are considerably less scares than expected. Don't get me wrong, the scares are there, they're memorable and they're earned, but the increasing suspense becomes more heart-pounding than spine tingling as the film wears on. Considering the novel is a seminal work of modern horror, one can be jarred by liberal injections of summertime horseplay and kid-styled humor – not to mention taken out of the movie entirely with so-so VFX. Additionally the reductive sexualization of fifteen-year-old Sophia Lillis who plays the loser's only female companion is a bit of a minus. Even though believe me given the book; it could have been so much worse.And yes as with any book to film adaptation, It does shorten, cut out, thematically alter and otherwise change swaths of the original story in service of making a quicker, cleaner movie. Being a Stephen King adaptation, It walks an even tighter line untangling the interconnected mythos of its tale. One can't help but think that if the funhouse frights were given more time to coalesce with the stories most primordial horrors, It could have transcended from being a great killer clown movie to a great movie period.As it stands however, It is so much better than it needs to be, providing an equal mix of genuine genre thrills and gregarious nostalgia. It's a wild ride of vivid, macabre amusements. It's a great looking piece of pop entertainment. It's a breezy, fun and fiendish coming-of-age saga. It's It.",It

And for good reason- the tale of a group of children haunted by a shape-shifting creature with a preference to appear as a demonic clown is horror heaven for audiences everywhere. So another adaptation has long been rumored, and even entered production at several points in time. However, it wouldn't be until 2017 that the classic tale of terror returned. This time to the big screen in director Andy Muschietti's long-awaited new film.And as someone who grew up petrified of the 1990 TV-movie and who is aware of the book despite never having been able to read it, I'm very pleased to report that Muschietti's film is absolutely fantastic, and was everything I wanted it to be and then some! Absolutely petrifying, filled with devilish jumps and expertly crafted atmosphere... and also chocked full of a surprising amount of heart and humor, ""It"" is a winning achievement and one of the best King adaptations since ""The Shining!""It's 1988 in the town of Derry, Maine- a place with a checkered and tragic past. A group of young friends collectively known as the ""Loser's Club"" all begin to independently experience strange and haunting hallucinations and visions... frequently involving a disturbing and twisted figure who calls himself ""Pennywise the Dancing Clown."" (Bill Skarsgård) As the Loser's Club grows and adds new members, they all slowly begin to realize their common plights, and dig deeper... eventually realizing that whatever Pennywise is has been tormenting the town for generations. And together, the eventually resolve to solve the mystery and stop this treacherous force once and for all...The greatest strengths at the film's disposal are the absolutely phenomenal cast of child actors, and a thoughtful script that delivers consistent laughs and a lot of heart despite also being filled to burst with non-stop scares. Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs and Jack Dylan Grazer are all just perfect in their respective roles as a group of children haunted by a common supernatural threat, and they all knock it out of the park and have incredible and highly believable chemistry with one-another. You never for one second doubt their friendship, and they pull you into the film instantly- you can see yourself as a child in each and every one of them. Their banter is also completely adorable. They will certainly remind you of other, similar groups of child actors from classic films like ""The Goonies"" or ""E.T."", and I see promising futures for each and every one of them.The script is also a ton of fun and is extremely well handled, paced and structured. The movie wisely gives us plenty of time to get to know the Loser's Club throughout the two-hour runtime, in addition to pacing out the scares quite well. There's never a single dull moment, and it all flows perfectly. Writers Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman also make sure to keep an emotional core for each character- particularly Lieberher's ""Bill"", whom serves as a sort-of lead amongst the group after his younger brother Georgie was taken by Pennywise. You'll definitely find yourself misty-eyed more than once as you see his struggle to solve the mystery of what happened to his brother.Then there's the scares. Oh, boy... this is one creepy flick! While it was never overtly petrifying, the film does a remarkable job at racking up tension and paying off major scenes with some clever and sometimes subversive jumps and shocks. Director Muschietti revels in piling on nonstop, stylish atmosphere, and he delivers each scare very efficiently and effectively. Don't worry... this isn't a film where every jump is spoiled in the trailer... There are some real shocks here that even as a seasoned horror-veteran I just couldn't see coming.Unfortunately, I do have to bring up the elephant in the room and the reason I cannot bring myself to give ""It"" a perfect ten... And that is the performance Skarsgård gives as Pennywise. He's not bad. Trust me, he's not. But what he is... is inconsistent. When he's at his best, Skarsgård easily rivals the original and iconic take Tim Curry had in the 1990 film adaptation. Problem is... I think he plays it a bit too safe. He's trying so hard to be the creepy clown for a new generation that I found it a bit bland after a while. Because you knew he was only going to be playing it scary. And sure, it does work about the half the time, when he's actually trying to be overtly threatening. But the other half of the time? It just comes off as a bit forced. Thankfully, this is only a minor problem in an otherwise completely exquisite and sublime horror-film, so I can easily forgive it.With the benefit of a remarkable cast of child actors, a great mixture of horror and heart and a wonderfully eerie sense of atmosphere, ""It"" triumphs and excels as one of the biggest treats of 2017. It's an absolutely fantastic return to the screen for one of Stephen King's most iconic works, and it comes highly recommended from this fan. They nailed ""It!"" ...see what I did there? A near-perfect 9 out of 10!",It
140,denis888,Scary And Genuinely Excellent,9,10 November 2017,"Stephen King's books are awesome to be turned into excellent movies. I remember old It with its absolutely great scare jumps and terrifying atmosphere. I was a bit skeptical as for a new rendition, but never have I been more relieved of my doubts - this new It is a great and thrilling 2 hour horror experience which is very well done, decently performed and immaculately delivers the message of fear and friendship over this fear. I am very much pleased by Bill Skarsgård's excellent part, he as Pennywise / It is a great choice and he is surely scary a lot. Younger actors are excellent as well, with Sophia Lillis being a certain winner and a decent performer despite her tender age. I do recommend this very dark, brooding, genuinely scary thriller to all KIng's fans as you won't be disappointed at all.",It

Georgie takes the boat out onto the flooded street and accidentally sails it down the gutter. As Georgie is peering into the drain, he meets a strange man who introduces himself as ""Pennywise the Dancing Clown"".

143,Abdulxoxo,Not scary but it's still good,7,18 February 2021,"The fact that I didn't find the film scary was a massive disappointment. That said, it was still enjoyable, just take the movie for what it was and there are a lot of positives to speak of. The film's main strength is the children, all of whom were really impressive. They each have their own unique personality, which we get to see early on. As the story develops we get a look at each of them individually and discover their fears and other issues including difficult home lives. Their individual sections I thought were great. They all had different and interesting back stories. There's no doubting when they're together it feels like a mash up of classic 80's movies. The interactions between them were fun and you can't help but like them. Some of the imagery looked really good. Individual stills of Pennywise (or some of the other things that scared the kids) were fantastic and would make for great posters. I also liked the score. Skarsgard as did a decent job. The parts when he spoke certainly were certainly creepy. I just wish there were more scenes like at the beginning where we see his threatening predatory side, rather than the supernatural side of him. Overall, It might not be all that scary, but it's still a really good film.",It
144,arungeorge13,Feeding on your fears! [+67%],7,11 September 2017,"'It' has a spectacular opening scene. Little Georgie goes out to play in the rain with his new boat (made by his brother Bill) but finds himself encountering an eerie-looking clown in a sewer. Here, director Andy Muschietti (of 'Mama' fame) and writers Cary Fukunaga (writer/director of 'Sin Nombre' & 'Beasts of No Nation' and director of 'Jane Eyre') and Chase Palmer get right to the point and offer in a nutshell, what the movie is going to be all about. In the town of Derry, a bunch of kids (that comprises of Bill, Richie, Eddie and Stan) who tag themselves the 'Losers Club' are persistently hazed by the school bullies and begin experiencing distinctive hallucinatory nightmares prominently featuring a shape- shifting clown by the name of Pennywise. They're joined unexpectedly by Beverly, their classmate who's labeled a 'slut', and by Mike, whom they happen to aid in fending off the bullies. Director Muschietti succeeds to an extent in overturning the demon- horror-movie template that Hollywood seems to have embraced in recent times. The usual 'fright followed by a short span of peace followed by fright' format is done away with. Muschietti chooses to never let the viewer breathe easy, effectively blinding harrowing scares with humorous dialogue sprinkled heavily with F-bombs. Well, then the question arises for the viewer on whether these kids are worth backing. The answer is both Yes and No. Bill's yearning to find closure for his brother's unnatural death is believable. Ben, a chubby loner who loves looking up history (and has a secret crush on Beverly) is also a neatly written character. Richie, the foul mouthed attention-seeker is half-written but his lines evoke the kind of reaction that they're supposed to. Stan and Eddie too don't really stand out but at least we know the quaint bits - Stan's Jewish and scared of contamination too much, while Eddie is a hypochondriac.Their individual encounters with the demon (that takes up the form of a headless boy, a living painting - an obvious nod to Muschietti's earlier flick 'Mama', and a leper) are dexterously shot, performed well by the respective actors and backed by blood- curdling imagery (mostly using CGI). Fukunaga's insightful writing backs Muschietti's knack for formidable scares in a great way. It is indeed a wonder how the kids of the town manage to keep their heads up and be excited about summer when horrible things like disappearances and delusions are happening around them. The romantic angles between Bill-Beverly and Ben-Beverly are silly, adorable and childish as they're supposed to be. Where they could've improved a bit was on the characterization of the parents. Most of them (whenever shown on screen) seemed to despise their kids' presence, be sexually turned on, or appalled at their antics.Even though the film runs for a 135 minutes, there aren't a lot of instances that make the viewer question the decisions taken by the protagonists or ostensibly feel bored by the proceedings. A lot of the action unfolds at rapid pace, not giving the audience a chance for second thoughts. For lovers of the novel and the mini-series, there should be plenty to cherish. Skaarsgard plays Pennywise to near-perfection and his efforts are reinforced by masterful application of CGI. The climax too, is engineered adequately well to incite viewer interest in a sequel. Verdict: Definitely one of the better horror films of the year!",It
145,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Extremely over-hyped, a cringe-worthy missed opportunity",2,8 September 2017,"I'm a huge fan of the 1990's TV film of ""It"", especially for its aesthetics and soundtrack, but it left out a lot of content from the original novel, leaving me confused when I first saw it at the age of 12. This remake, or perhaps actually a ""re-adaptation"", is certainly very timely, what with ""Stranger Things"" becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere. I'm still not sure it hits the ""scary"" factor very well, especially without Tim Curry's tremendous acting, but it's certainly creepy. It's not nostalgic though, nor does it retain much of the original novel, including the 50's setting, changed to the 80's to obviously market itself with ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Goonies"".My problem with this new adaptation of ""It"" is that it's addled with CGI and jump scares, neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal. At the risk of sounding like a film snob, if you're trying to make a film set decades before this era, you don't use CGI at all if you can avoid it, unless you really know how to camouflage it. The constant profanity did nothing for the story either, it only gave the false illusion of being edgy. Yes, the book had profanity, but King knew where to draw the line and keep the perfect balance of immature vulgarity and true friendship. The sheer level of nerdiness here made me cringe, unlike the TV movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love and joy amidst the horror, just like King's novel. Did one of those boys seriously just say ""Get me my bifocals, I hid them in my second fanny pack""? What the hell kind of child wears bifocals? Why not just rename him Poindexter while they're at it? The kids in the book and the miniseries were never this obnoxiously dorky. And what's with all this New Kids on the Block stuff? There was a scene in which for no apparent reason all these close-ups of NKOTB posters pop up on-screen. Why? Just because earlier in the film a kid had been listening to that music? It made no sense! We get loads of terrible one liners from Richie comparing the blood in the sewers to ""period blood"" (lovely, eh?) and trust me, no way does any thirteen-year-old talk like this. All kids at that age swear and tell fart jokes and stuff, but even they have their limits.Mike is only added as an afterthought, which seems borderline offensive, as if they only added him as a token minority whereas in the book and film he was such a complex, central character. He had a strong bond with his father that's totally absent from this film. Stan is unlikable, and the newly revamped Pennywise the Clown has teeth that could rival the most inbred hillbilly, and the most scary thing he seems to be able to do is hop around like some kind of wino. Uh yeah, real ""spooky"", I'm shaking in my boots. Then we have the film's complete disregard for the friendship, the glue that holds the story together. Killing and gore and sex and violence and swearing is not what horror is about, it's about the darker side of life, and this film only portrays it in a cheesy slasher film type of way. I'm not trying to sound preachy, but where's the love and friendship between the characters? When it is there (which isn't very often) it feels forced. In the old miniseries, it felt authentic and true, and the kids were actually portrayed as kids, not young adults. This new film is completely void of the book's special qualities such as the ""hi-ho Silver!"" thing and Eddie's ""battery acid"" line. The film just doesn't have the stunning scenery that the miniseries had, either. The miniseries had an actual gothic revival pump house as the sewer building (the Buntzen Hydroelectric Station of British Columbia), and it was creepy and nostalgic and absolutely the perfect choice. It had nailed down the industrial small town in an economic slump kind of look perfectly, too. This film looks too clean for that, with CGI used in all the wrong places to create what looks like fake looking stage sets.This film isn't completely terrible. It passes the time, but the only thing it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some 80's vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad video game full of childish jump scares. I was hoping it might be more like the 2012 film Sinister, a genuinely frightening and timeless boogeyman that leaves a subtle unsettling presence wherever it goes, but no, it just looked cheap and lazy, an obvious cash grab that's being WAY overhyped. A 7.5/10 rating, are you kidding me? Even King's 1995 notoriously bad film The Mangler was better than this! It's like with good marketing, this new film was able to pull the wool over everybody's eyes and fool them into thinking it was a classic masterpiece.",It

The scary parts that are in this movie, which are few, are some of the most scariest scenes ever put on screen. It is a delight for horror fans.

147,Screen_Blitz,Modern adaptation of Stephen King's legendary tale of horror tightly grips audiences for a terrifying experience,9,6 October 2017,"It was 1990 when Stephen King's killer clown jumped from the pages of his acclaimed novel and made his debut in the celluloid with the hit mini-series 'It'. The chilling scare factor that made the series a hit, however, has slowly diminished over the past many years by its outdated effects and horribly aged scares. That is why it is up to director Andy Muschietti, the man responsible for 'Mama', to honor the nostalgia of the killer clown we all know as Pennywise with this contemporary adaptation of King's acclaimed source material. Crafted with an absorbing blend of spine-chilling scares and shocking emotional touch while defying against cookie-cutter clichés, this film straps audiences in for a genuinely terrifying experience. With director Muschietti taking on the source material with a grimmer and more psychological approach, the final product is an absorbing taste of effective scares mixed with solid characterization and an emotionally stimulating many horror films tend to neglect. Set in 1989 in town of Derry, the film focuses on a group of bullied middle-school children consisting of Bill (played by Jaeden Lieberher), Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (played by Jack Dylan Grazer), Beverly (played by Sophia Lillis), Ben (played by Jeremy Ray Taylor), Stanley (played by Wyatt Oleff), and later joined by Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs); as they scout through their town in search of Bill's younger brother Georgie who has mysteriously disappeared. The kids soon find their lives spinning dangerously out of control when they are haunted by the devious little clown Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgard) who threatens their very existences. He's mean, he's scary, and he has a rude thirst for flesh and blood that makes him everyone's worst nightmare. For kids, teens, and even adults with a fear of clowns, the eponymous clown operates as an uproaring force that dares to leave viewers squirming in their seats. This is purely demonstrated in the opening scene when a little boy loses his paper boat in the gutter, only to be paid an unwelcoming visit by the devious clown. The atmosphere warmly lets up from there, but only temporarily and the majority of that time swaying away from the scare tactics is dedicated to setting up the characters, establishing their backgrounds and chemistry with each other that captures the innocence of childhood. The strongest element of character development comes from Jaeden Lieberher's Bill, a young boy who scarred the disappearance of his little brother and constantly defies against the possibility that he may be dead. It is an element is that is handled with subtly and pays off with an emotionally powerful resonance during the final sequence. The film carries an ambition in the character department that allows us to grow an emotional attachment for the children when the story eventually strolls into a spine-chilling scare-fest once the youngsters are forced to confront against the terrifying monster of a clown. Each scene the sinister clown storms on screen roars with a palpable sense of terror that pierces the heart as the vulnerability of the kids is heavily amped up with psychological thrills and jump scares that work almost consistently. And the hair-raising performance by Bill Skarsgard is partly to thank for this, channeling a sinister demeanor that manages excel above what Tim Curry showcased in the 1990 mini-series. As for the kids, they are all do pretty fine job never letting their talents go to waste. Whether they are cracking funny (and vulgar) one-liners like many kids do when their parents are not around or screaming their hearts out at the terror that lurks them, these children show they have what it takes to let themselves shine. ""It"" is a profoundly terrifying experience that respectfully honors Stephen King's source material. Among many of Hollywood's attempts at translating King's works to the big screen, this one genuinely stands out among many. It is an entertaining and carries a strong muscle for splashes moviegoers with a powerfully effective horror experience that really works.",It
148,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,One of the best Stephen King adaptations in years!,9,11 September 2017,"IT surprised me; it took a story that some consider unbelievably corny and updated it to have some genuine scares that aren't your clichéd jump-scare tropes in most modern horror movies. Pennywise is terrifying in this film and looks like he 'will f@cking eat you' if you're not careful enough, a far-cry from Tim Curry's well-meaning but too funny portrayal of the character. Bill Skarsgard's take on the notorious clown child-killer is one for the ages. If the other material of the story bothers you, you can probably forgive them thanks to Skarsgard's incredible Pennywise performance.I think the film analyzed King's clichés in the stories and added some needed depth to make them believable instead of being placeholders on the author's behalf. The bullies are the typical bullies but here they may actually kill you instead of spewing meaningless words, the kids here are interesting and they're individual in identity and don't share the same struggles as the other. The cast is wonderful and they compliment the story's original intent. This movie surprised me and it's sure to surprise you to.Stephen King may have suffered from The Dark Tower's under-performance, but IT forgives him and redeems him of that baggage beautifully.",It
149,pyrocitor,Stranger Kings,7,7 October 2017,"In The Lego Batman Movie, the titular caped crusader, tasked with naming his greatest fear, rasps ""Snakes! Clowns! SNAKE-CLOWNS!!!"" And while Indiana Jones may have echoed one phobia, the rest of the literate world certainly quivered at the latter after Steven King's 1986 masterwork - both the longest horror novel ever written and most successful book named after a pronoun - was uncorked upon fearful readers. Clowns. It {HA!} had to be clowns. And, if the only thing scarier than Pennywise was the prospect of him being done a disservice by a hackneyed contemporary remake, fear not (at least, not in that way): 2017's It is as respectful to King (arguably overly so at times) as it is gruesomely fun and nimble. And scary. Oh yes. Say goodbye, Snake-Clowns - you've just been ousted. It {heh!} is hard to conceive of a more frightfully fun film this year. To nip the (circus?) elephant in the room in the bud: yes, It inevitably owes a symbiotic debt to the nostalgia-chic fanned from the rampant popularity of Netflix's Stranger Things (which, in turn, paid homage to King, in a Möbius strip of intertextuality ). Still, the neo-nostalgia works just as well on the big screen, lending the film a grandiose, larger-than-life nature, as it treads (almost overly) familiar horror beats with the confidence of a rock star playing the greatest hits. Mama director Andy Muschietti ardently defies tacky, contemporary 'jump-scare' horror trends in favour of more classical tension building. He plays conventional set-ups to the hilt - shrieking Bernard Herrmann strings, memorably grotesque Kubrick-esq imagery, and tantalizingly obscured shadows creeping down long, ominous hallways and all, trusting that a committed robust, old-school fright is sufficient without deafening, migraine-inducing conceits. It {ho!} is. The film's transposed 80s setting perfectly accentuates the story's Stand By Me coming-of-age schtick, as sweet and sincere as it is rough-and-tumble. King's novel has stood the test of time for its patient commitment to character development amidst the spine-tingling frights, and Muschietti is similarly unhurried, playing up the individual pre-teen neuroses and tribulations of each ragtag member of the 'Losers' as more terrifying than the clown demon systematically popping in and out to torment them like an elusive, dementedly cackling Jaws shark. Granted, Muschietti buys into the cult of King so wholeheartedly that he pushes the limits of 'would you really follow a mysterious noise into that dark, deserted house' well past acceptable standards of suspending disbelief at times, threatening chortles of incredulity from a media-savvy audience that should be emitting squeaks of fright. To be fair, it's hard to chart which of the film's spate of horror clichés King pioneered, but Muschietti integrating them with such doe-eyed sincerity ultimately hurts his film almost as much as it helps it. And let's be honest - even the 80s didn't have bullies so '80s-movie,' so decked out with mullets, switchblades, and grotesquely overkill acts of violence It {hoo}'s almost distracting. Still, character development of our pre-pubescent leads is all well and good, but digging further into our spectral clown's raison-d'être is the film's real fascination. For those squirming in their seats from cliché or fright, there's a whole level of alternative viewing to be had unpacking the rationale behind Pennywise's teasing tormenting. Most horror monsters frighten unintentionally simply by existing. Pennywise feeds on fear, making his every appearance and act an intriguingly calculated reflexive performance. Poignantly, this also provides a rather nifty screen writing 'get out of jail free card,' as incongruous narrative reversals prolonging the plot can be explained away as, rather than screen writing convenience, Pennywise retreating due to failing at scaring his target demographic. It {errgh}'s actually deceptively clever, and plays into the film's tongue-in-cheek nostalgia with amiable ease. Of course, any good horror movie should spook beyond academic subtext, and It {really?} is appropriately terrifying in Its {ugh} own right. This is thanks largely to Bill Skarsgård, cleverly sprinkling whiffs of Tim Curry and strains of Heath Ledger's Joker into a scene-stealing masterwork as riveting as It {ahhh} is f*cking terrifying. He's used sparsely and effectively, and, granted, the makeup does a fair amount of heavy lifting, but It {stop}'s Skarsgård's subtle touches that Pennywise 2.0 come to gut-wrenching life, with his whimsical eye contact, absentminded drool, and segueing between gurgling giddiness and rabid snarls that make him a truly unforgettable foe for the ages. On the youth frontier, the sheer number of King's Losers mean that many suffer from being one-note archetypes, making our prolonged time with them feel superfluous (Jeremy Ray Taylor's exposition-doling, requisite fat nerd and Chosen Jacob's nearly silent token black kid are particularly ill-served in this regard). Regardless, all the young actors give excellent performances, finding notes of humour and humanity in their moments to shine, no matter how rote. Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer spice up the film with acerbic humour and sass, while Jaeden Lieberher shoulders the thankless burden of stoic lead with raw, emotive vulnerability and vinegar. Sophia Lillis may be hit hard with King's patriarchal preoccupations (ANOTHER pre-teen girl bathed in a not-so-subtle torrent of blood and hair?!), but she's sparky enough to sell it with aplomb. At least the novel's disturbingly tone-deaf child-orgy is, mercifully, left out. Nice one, Steve. It {please }'s not often in contemporary Hollywood audiences leave a would-be franchise clamouring for a sequel, but there were ever an exception to the rule, this is It {please stop}. Sold by an airtight cast, unnervingly effective Skarsgård, and Muschietti's robust, affectionate gruesomeness, the film may not reinvent the wheel, but certainly gives It {sigh} a hearty, affectionate spin. So - is It {arrgh} worth the hype? Don't take my word for It {noooo} - check It {fuuuuuu} out for yourself. -7.5/10",It

I was prepared to be let down, as I always am when a movie is talked up so much, but I was left with mixed feelings overall. There's no doubt that 'IT' is a brilliant production and there are some effectively frightening individual scenes but, as a whole, it just doesn't live up to the hype.The first half of the film is too slow. It contains more laughs than scares and, while I appreciate the need for character development, many of the scenes are completely pointless and not at all relevant to the overall plot. It also relies heavily on cheap jump scares, which is particularly disappointing given the naturally creepy and disturbing nature of Pennywise. The film picks up though and the final quarter of 'IT' is a real treat for any horror fan. It moves at a breathless pace, maintaining a high level of tension with a long, relentlessly creepy final sequence.

158,educallejero,I totally get if you love it!,5,23 September 2018,"But it just didn't work for me. The story is well told, I think. All the arcs ""made sense"" (more or less). And the cast is stellar. So if you loved it (as my cousin did when we watched in the theater), I totally get it.Having said that. There is just too much that is weak.1-Pennywise: One of the few great things about the 90's IT, was that Curry made for a freaking scary clown. An adult, going totally insane and terrifyng kids when he should be the one taking care of them. That's scary. In this case, it looked more like punk bored 20 something trying to prank kids for a youtube chanel. Even if Bill Skarsgård was good, he was just too young.2-Horror scenes: At very best 5 good scares (including jumpscares). The use of horror was super weak. We see the clown too much and too often. The first scenes with him should've been teases, but nope, from the start he goes full on ""scary"" and then we get 1h 20m of.... pretty much the same. (On the flipside: the ""human"" scary scenes were all perfect. Which makes the lack of them really upsetting).3-Updated kids... until we need the old versions: They let the kids swear and make dark jokes to make them look more realistic. And that was awesome. But then, when they needed to use melodramatic speeches (totally dated, by the way), the kids turned back to the old and dated versions. You either update the kids, or you let them fake enough to make those scenes less jarring and eyes rolling.4-Pennywise's powers and needs: It would probably be explained later. But I just coudn't escape the fact that Pennywise made dumb things that made no sense and it wasn't explained. We don't know ANYTHING. Not even hints. We know he wants them with fear because he says so. But other than that, we don't why he makes the other kids float (Beverly because she wasn't scare enough for him to eat her. But then why the others? All of those kids weren't scare neither? Then, he SUCKS at scaring kids. And by the way, our hero kids were super scared through out the movie. Why he didn't eat them then?). A mess.In the end:-It didn't even have good fun jumpscares.
-The clown looked too young and sounded idiotic not threatening.
-Too much clown opening his spidey mouth for nothing.
-Broken updated versions of kids with super old cliché speeches.
-Pennywise powers all over the place, making it incomprehensible.",It
159,aciessi,We'll All Float On,9,22 September 2017,"You'll float too.You'll be floating on air after seeing It. The creepiest, coolest film of 2017 so far. Easily, the most entertaining popcorn horror film in ages. Most of today's horror genre consists of dull jump-scare ghost movies and gnarly gore fests. It takes us back to the golden age of Horror, the 1980's. The film takes place sometime in 1989, complete with soundtrack and memorabilia. But the film itself could've easily been made in 89'. It's scary without being gratuitous. It's funny, without being a comedy. It's over-the-top, without being purposely terrible. It's got a standout cast of profane kids. Think of Stand By Me or The Goonies. You will sit back and smile away. You'll say to yourself ""If only every movie could be this way!"".Pennywise, while not played by the incomparable Tim Curry, is freighting in his new incarnation by Bill Skarsgard. This clown isn't a jokester. He's a shape shifting homicidal maniac and this time, that's a good thing. We have both versions and you can compare which one is superior if you wish, but you must concede that both are entirely different takes on the character and each stand on their own merits. The jump-scares all work here, which is something I don't usually say for horror movies. The creatures that Pennywise turns into are all terrifying and awe-inspiring. You may jump out of your seat, but you will appreciate the nuance.Seeing It in a large theater is also something you shouldn't go without doing. The audience reactions are priceless. The screams, the laughs, the shout outs! DON'T GO IN THERE! It was made to be a sheer crowd pleasure. An event of a movie and we sure are in need more of those.",It
160,rockman182,It (2017),8,8 September 2017,"I grew up with the 1990 TV miniseries adaptation of this Stephen King novel and really liked it. Admittedly, the second adult portion of the film wasn't as good but as a whole the film resonates with me mostly for its very memorable Pennywise the Dancing Clown, played by a stellar Tim Curry. I caught a late night of showing of the 2017 incarnation of this story, and wow. I'm quite impressed with what I've witnessed. The trailer for this film actually looked really promising, with Bill Skarsgård looking menacing as the clown.The film takes place in the town of Derry during the late 80's. A group of outcast and bullied kids band together to form The Loser's Club. Their social issues are not the only reason they bond; all of them are being terrorized by a monstrous entity that takes the form of a clown. The losers must find a way to overcome this clown that feeds on their deepest fears and feeds on children in the town every 27 years. Most of the cast for this film are fairly new (including the not so well know Bill Skarsgård), apart from an excellent Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things. However, a giant strength this film has over the original is the chemistry between the cast, and the overall humorous and identifiable nature of the child actors.I had doubts about this when Cary Fukunaga dropped out as director but liked that he stayed on to co-write. I've got to say Andy Muschietti does well to put his name out there with this film. Well done on making this film Rated-R. The violence and terror and adult themes really get to be portrayed well, which really amplifies the horror level. The initial scene with Georgie and Pennywise in the sewer was legitimately horrifying and we can thank the rating for that. The film is a coming of age film but also a real loss of innocence film. The kids in the film face very disturbing adult themes. The bullying is downright traumatic, the sexual abuse and death surrounding these characters isn't even the worst of it with a maniac clown stalking you to death.Skarsgård does very well as Pennywise. I still prefer Tim Curry' Pennywise more but this film has one to closely match. Skarsgård's tall lanky frame and disturbing delivery make the 2017 incarnation of the clown a thrilling, captivating and even more evil update to Curry's. The film does well to blend humor, emotion, and horror together. The kids are funny, there are times they will have you rolling. Finn Wolfhard with his unfiltered potty mouth is a standout. Sophia Lillis delivers a deep and mature performance for a child actor.There are many similarities between the 1990 version and the 2017 remake. I never read King's novel (although I am planning to do so) but the new film keeps mostly faithful to the last, albeit with an update on the horror value. I didn't find this film to be downright scary or anything but its very satisfying because its able to get so much from its cast and writers and makes for a pleasant experience. Although, the film has child actors do not mistake this for a children friendly film. Its completely adult and much more adult than the TV miniseries.Its quite obvious whether you have seen the film yet or not that there will be another film. Come on, you should know that the original miniseries is two parts with an adult portion where the kids grow up and get terrorized once again by Pennywise. If the writers, filmmaker, and clown stay the same, then I am game for the next chapter. Overall, its a great remake that benefits from being more modern and more mature. Watch It.8/10",It
161,RforFilm,"Pennywise returns after a 27 year slumber. As a coming of age story with horror elements, It is very entertaining",9,12 September 2017,"Within the misty Northeast of Maine, rests a place called Derry, that seems like any other white- picket fence small town with a main street and a parade every forth of July. In the sewers, however, lies an evil that has appeared in many forms, but for the children that have encountered it, see him as Pennywise, the dancing clown. This is the description of one of the most famous Stephen King stories, It. Though the books goes into a lot of existential material on how the creatures comes from outside the universe, the story of a clown haunting a town has scared a generation a book readers. The material seemed almost like an urban legend.Many people were introduced to It through the 1990 miniseries that had Tim Curry as Pennywise. Split into two parts, it had some problems as while the parts set during the childhood was entertaining, the adult parts were underwhelming and unimpressive. It seemed that the strength of the story was about the children having to face their fears while they tried to defeat this evil clown. A movie would need extensive rewriting, but had potential. It brings Pennywise back after a twenty-seven year slumber, ready to haunt a new generationperhaps the old generation as well. On a rainy day in 1988, a young boy named Georgie is eaten by a figure in a storm sewer who introduces himself as Pennywise the dancing clown (played by Bill Skarsgård) Without a body, the adults of Derry, Maine simply report him missing, along with many other children that seem to disappear over the year. In June of 1989, the kids are out of school as they try to make the most of their summer. The overweight new kid on the block Ben tries to research the history of the town and the missing children, but has an encounter with Pennywise and a group of bullies lead by Henry Bowers.Beaten, his wounds are tended by stuttering Bill, big-mouthed Ritchie, Jewish bookworm Stan, hypochondriac Eddie, and outcast girl Beverly. The kids declare themselves ""The Losers Club"" as they have always sensed something wrong with the town, as each have encountered Pennywise in a form that strikes their fear. They come to understand that the clown is powerful and may have been around for hundreds of years. Understanding that the curse will continue, they make their way to the sewers to try and defeat Pennywise.I'll admit upfront that director Andy Muschieti understand that It is not a horror story, but rather a coming of age story with horror elements; think The Goonies meets Nightmare on Elm Street. For the most part, it really work as a whole. The movie does take its time to show how each kid grows up during that eventful summer. Fear is a boundary from adolescence to adulthood, and the writing shows that with a town as crazy as Derry, just why these losers needed to go through this experience.All the child actors are very likable in their part. Like The Goonies and The Sandlot, you get a sense that they must be friends in real life to reflect this kind of honest chemistry. There wasn't a moment where I dreaded having to follow one over the other; they were interesting enough that you want to see through their troubles. How about Pennywise? Bill Skarsguåd is simply terrifying and unnerving as the clown. I won't say if he's better then Tim Curry as the performance is different. Unlike the miniseries, this Pennywise is more childlike and unearthly. His design his fantastic and better draws from the fact he's been then for a while.Does this make It a masterpiece? Almost. There were moments that the humor and drama don't match the situations. The ones with Pennywise do, but its with the kids that's a tad harder. There are moments where after an attack or something bad happening, one of them (mostly Ritchie) will try to let off a joke or swear that just doesn't fit the situation. It's something that might have worked with more thought put into the dialogue. But other then that, this will probably be Stephen Kings most watched movie in a while.I'll give this nine red balloons out of ten. Despite an R rating, I'd say that this may be a good start for older children (I'll say twelve to be safe) that want to get into watching horror movies. It may even be an interesting family outing to talk about this, the book and everything the kids just went through. If you have a fear of clowns, brace yourself. It is a lot of things, including an entertaining movie.",It

They come across a monster that takes the form of a clown named, Pennywise(Bill Skarsgard). Now, it is up to the kids to stop Pennywise, before 'It' causes any more harm. It is a mind blowing film. Director Andy Muschietti has perfectly maintained the creepy atmosphere, throughout the movie's run-time. The effortless camaraderie shared among the principle cast of young actors, is what makes It superior to many other horror films. There are two or three superbly executed jump scares. What makes It flawless, are the heartwarming & humorous moments, the growing feeling of dread throughout the movie & the unpredictability factor. Jaeden Lieberher is brilliant as Bill Denbrough. Jeremy Ray Taylor is outstanding as Ben Hanscom. Sophia Lillis is amazing as Beverly Marsh. Finn Wolfhard is awesome as Richie Tozier. Chosen Jacobs is good as Mike Hanlon. Jack Dylan Grazer is spectacular as Eddie Kaspbrak. Wyatt Oleff is great as Stanley Urich. Bill Skarsgard has given the performance of a lifetime, as Pennywise. Nicholas Hamilton, Jake Sim, Logan Thompson, Owen Teague & Stephen Bogaert are impressive as Henry Bowers, Belch Huggins, Victor Criss, Patrick Hockstetter & Mr. Marsh, respectively.

165,bankofmarquis,One of the best film adaptations of a Stephen King novel ever,9,8 September 2017,"I met the clown and IT is...fascinating, gripping, thrilling, humorous, intense and good.But...is it scary?  Sure...scary enough, but this adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller is much, much more than a scary movie.One of the best screen adaptations of a Stephen King book, ever, IT tells the story of a group of13 year olds in Derry, Maine (one of the main towns featured in a variety of King's stories).  It is 1989 and children have been going missing at an alarming rate.  The adults in the town seem impassive about this, and when the younger brother of one of the gang goes missing, this ""Loser's Club"" investigates.  What they find is a horrifying evil at the center of it all.Like the plot of this film, there is much, much more going on in this film than what that last paragraph suggests, for this story is not only about the mystery of the missing children, it is a loving look back at childhood, friendship, caring and bonding.  Think of this film as STAND BY ME meets...well...a killer clown.And the clown IS killer.  As played by Bill Skarsgard (TV's THE CROWN), Pennywise The Dancing Clown is slyly sinister, drawing the children in as a spider would a fly.  It is only when the children are close (and alone) does he drop the guise of niceness and pounce.  This is an intense and terrifyingly terrific performance, keeping the fine line between realism and camp (a line that Tim Curry trounced all over in the TV Mini-series version of this material in the 1980's).I'm a big fan of Stephen King's writing (having read nearly all of his books and short stories) and I walked out of the theater thinking ""finally, someone figured out the right way to make a Stephen King thriller work on the screen"" and that someone is Director Andy Muschietti (MAMA).  He guides this film with a strong hand, not wavering in his vision or sense of purpose as to where (and how) he wants this story to go.  He let's the young actor's lead this story, with Skargard's clown pouncing every now and then.  This works well, especially when infusing something that is sorely lacking, typically, in these types of films - humor.And the humor, mostly, falls into the hands of Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard, STRANGER THINGS).  He is an absolute bright spot injecting just the wrong (or maybe it is right?) comment in a tense situation, just as a 13 year old boy would do.  As part of the ""Loser's Club"", he holds a bright  spot in keeping things together when the mood threatens to get too grim or dire.  And grim and dire is what is following this set of ""Loser's"", a veritable ""who's who"" of loser stereotypes.  There is the ""fat kid"", Ben Hanscome (Jeremy Ray Taylor, ANT-MAN, in a sweet performance), the ""always sick kid with the overbearing mother"", Eddie Kasbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), the ""Jewish kid"", Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) and the ""Black Kid"", Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs).But the heart and sole of this film is the two main leads of the ""Loser's Club"", Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher, star of two criminally under-viewed gems MIDNIGHT SPECIAL and ST. VINCENT) and Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis, a relative newcomer that bears watching in the future).  Both are harboring deep, emotional scars - Bill blames himself for the death of his brother by Pennywise and Beverly is (wrongly) viewed as a 13 year old slut by school rumor and innuendo and is sexually harassed by her father.  The relationship between these two and the rest of the Loser's Club is the real treat of this film and the actor's are up to the challenge to draw us in and care about what happens to them when they are, ultimately, separated and confronted by Pennywise.I was surprised by how little graphic gore there was in this film (though there is plenty of blood) and there is a little too many ""jump scares"" for my taste, but these are quibbles for a very good, very intense ""scary film"".I floated out of the cinema after seeing this film  You'll float too.Letter Grade:  A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",It
166,rbrb,Teenage Angst meets Stephen Kings' Ego....,3,7 September 2017,"This for me is is a theater of the absurd ludicrous movie.In a small town a group of teenagers are going through puberty and other rites of passage including body development and monthly cycles.This in my view causes many of them to collectively imagine an evil presence-maybe a fear of the onset of adulthood-which is played out in various gruesome scenes featuring a killer clown. Notice that the macabre events seem to only arise in the presence of or in the minds of the children.Whilst Stephen King is a brilliant writer, the problem is that his stories are usually totally ridiculous.No doubt many film reviewers and others will rave over this nonsense which ominously reveals this is just a start being called : Chapter 1.There are a few scenes that will have some viewers frightened plus the cinematography is good, yet despite these pluses I can only award this picture:3/10.",It
167,Ruskington,"A masterpiece on the outside, a mess in the middle",6,16 August 2020,"There was so much to like abut this adaptation. An amazing score, beautiful cinematography, an impressive young cast and a very authentic looking Derry. Sadly, the film is let down by two major problems.Firstly, the reworking of the story is just a complete mess. It is totally incoherent and has zero flow. It's just a bizarre patchwork of scarcely related scenes. As someone who is very familiar with the book (and considers it an all-time classic), I was often confused by what was actually happening. For someone completely new to the story, I can't imagine how they would be able to interpret any of this.Secondly, the horror scenes are really quite poor. The movie relies heavily on jump-scares and has no ability to create actual tension. Stephen King is masterful at working suggestive and imagined horror into his writing but this adaptation is lacking any subtlety or guile. It feels like idiot bait, designed to get popcorn-munchers to gasp aloud while not really knowing what's going on.",It
168,fernandoschiavi,"Despite the stumbling blocks, It can pride itself on being a great youth adventure, where horror is indeed present, but mixed with a beautiful story of friendship",8,6 November 2021,"By portraying the children's cast having fun and strolling around the city, director Andrés Muschietti (""Mama"") faithfully reconstructs the style of 80s films such as ET and The Goonies, highlighting the interactions between the characters, filled with jokes about mothers and sex. In these scenes, the camera that films the characters from the bottom up, often attached to the asphalt when it portrays the boys cycling through the city, prints a nostalgic, relaxed and adventurous tone. When the movie goes into horror, though, there's a sharp shift in tone. In managing two such disparate genres (children's adventure and horror), It would need to find a middle ground to balance the nuances, and does so by trying to break the horror with Pennywise's punctual jokes and comedy with surprise appearances by Pennywise - which works for prevent the work from embracing extremes. Muschietti still shows a remarkable affection when portraying the relationship of the children's cast with fear, as when Georgie, at the beginning of the projection, observes a corner of her house's basement and sees two eyes where there is only one object reflecting light, something typical of a kid.It takes place in the late 1980s. Intelligently, objects typical of the time are placed on the scene so that the ambience sounds believable. In one boy's bedroom we can see a poster of The Ghosts Have Fun (1988), while in the other boy's walkman the ""new"" hit of New Kids on the Block plays. Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise is wild, devoid of the previous appeal of Tim Curry's iconic conception of the ""thrifty"" in the 1990s production. It is important to highlight the care of the art and photography direction in creating an atmosphere of suspense and tension for the quiet fictional inner city. Derry is portrayed as a decaying, dirty, dangerous place with abandoned houses. Although the film takes place most of the time in the summer, the viewer does not contemplate the freshness or pleasant atmosphere of a small town. On the contrary, while there are a few jokes to tone down the harrowing tone, for most of the story, the feeling prevails that something terrible and surprising will happen. Because it's a small and insecure town, there's a constant expectation of being cornered by.Muschietti manages to deliver a consistent film that remains faithful to the horror genre. The option to focus exclusively on the characters as children, allowed the story to develop each one very well. Over the course of more than two hours of film, we got to know one by one, from its characteristics to its main fears. That's the way the director looks to focus on true horror. Each of the children is tormented by something different and has their own moment in the face of fear. The calm used by the director in building each of them helps to create empathy. In the end the fear is with what can happen to each one of them, not a monstrous creature. The direction is right not to hide the monstrosities coming from the clown, as well as the brutality of the attacks on the victims. And even though it's violent with children, the film doesn't offend or bring some unnecessary scene. Everything is in place. The only caveat is for the exaggerated use of some computer graphics effects in the clown's movement. This removes the rawness with which he is represented in the rest of the film, as the rule here is to use the close-up to show the very detailed makeup, the dripping saliva and the gushing blood.But the film lacks the same patience used to introduce the ""Losers Club"" in the construction of Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton, ""The Dark Tower""). He is the stereotype of the troublesome student, who bullies for fun, but in the scene where he attacks Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: On the Road""), the act sounds over the top, as the construction of the other scenes is over. Missing here. His attitude may sound too exaggerated, as if the boy is just a lunatic. This exaggeration ends up being reinforced in the second act, when the film presents a forced conflict between Henry and his father, just to justify future action.As for Pennywise, if we compare it to the clown from the 1990 telefilm, Bill Skarsgård's has both pro and pro points. Starting with the costumes: while Tim Curry's had a more childlike look, with a wide body and colorful clothes, Skarsgård's wears a pale outfit, practically colorless, being highlighted only in his makeup, making the air docile and The villain's deceit gives way to a macabre figure in all his appearances. But, as said, there are hits. In small elements, like the monster's squint, It finds a way to convey both an air of innocence at times and to suggest that the humanoid body is just a disguise for a faceless creature, as the eyes become more cross-eyed as the Pennywise's mouth opens.So It has enough time and interest to stuff the characters with something more than dread and a need to resist the bizarre. As we follow the individual contacts of the class led by Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) with the ""dancing clown"" who chases them, we get a good hint of the mundane difficulties they all go through. One of the accentuated traits in this regard is the recurrence of oppression from fathers and mothers, and, in a broad scope, from adults' neglect of growing infants. Therefore, in the midst of discovering something grotesque that feeds on the fear and flesh of the missing, they need to deal with the demands of abusive, overprotective, aggressive parents, or simply the lack of someone to guide them better along the path of doubt. And uncertainties invariably traversed.The story is not limited to that. Whether to reinforce the mood or to reach a wider audience, Muschietti sometimes takes advantage of jumpscares to raise the tension. For the most part they don't make as much impact and may sound too obvious, but they are well used for the plot. What is initially presented is a frightening situation for some character in question. The jumpscare comes after he is already tense and wants to get rid of where he is. So the final scare is more a release of tension than a scare itself. More often than not, the sudden appearances of Pennywise or some fanciful translation of the fear of others are valued beyond their presence, resulting in an immediate and short-lived effect. The repetition and accumulation of this testify against the permanence of the state of suspension. Although successful in working the human side and, therefore, prosaic of the plot, the director fails in trying to compose a constant atmosphere of tension, precisely because he bets more on the impact of the moments.The sequence that records Georgie's capital disappearance already gives a good idea of the tone of this It. Unlike the (sometimes loose) suggestion recurrent in the weak It (1990), the first film version - actually, on television - of one of Stephen King's famous books, the violence here is more graphic. Filmmaker Andy Muschietti does not shy away from presenting truly shocking images, such as the one of the recently amputated boy struggling to get rid of the macabre clown that pulls him into the manhole. Indeed, Pennywise has been a menacing figure from the start. He terrifies children with his perverse look, the impact of which is accentuated by the voice that unmistakably denotes extreme danger, without using the clown's classic characterization to properly seduce them. He's a more brutal representation of this entity soon fought off by friends called losers by school bullies.The feature of the feature is the balance between horror and comedy, helping the fluid rhythm. Pennywise's ""getting ready"" sequences are, at one point, subsequent to the boys' fun and ironic dialogue. And, consistent with the age of these characters, teenage dilemmas, such as first love and bullying, bring a greater depth to the story. To the watchful eye, however, some script problems prevent the experience of watching the movie from being more fruitful. Horror feature clichés make an appearance here and there, when a character, in the second half, decides to pursue alone, through the dark tunnel, the personification of his fear. Or, also, when the outcome of a great difficulty culminates in the classic scene of the good guy's seduction by the monster that, transformed into a loved one of the first, ends up being defeated. Furthermore, the film has a certain excess of subplots. There are some characters, for example, who appear only once or twice, not adding anything to the story. Replacing these scenes with more moments of communication between the Losers could have been a good option, as well as a better balance in each one's screen time.After a long but efficient first stage, the film sees the need to explore all of the cast's fears, and does so schematically, repeating the same formula of expectations and jump scares in every case. On the other hand, it is interesting how the work explores from fears related to the characters' traumas to more situational horrors, such as when one of the boys sees a headless child in a photograph and is chased by a beheaded monster. It is unforgivable, however, to choose to create practically two climactic moments, at the end of the second act and in the third, separated by a disheartening, dragging moment, causing a break in the rhythm that creates the feeling that the work simply refuses to finish.But despite the stumbling blocks, It can pride itself on being a great youth adventure, where horror is indeed present, but mixed with a beautiful story of friendship. After all, the horrors dumped on those seven children by a cruel murderous clown are just representations of adulthood, which comes with horrible things like the pain of grief, and the awareness of human evil that can only be faced by the genuine union of people who they not only accept, they love their differences. That's more than most blockbuster horror movies can say.",It
169,dave-mcclain,"It is a very good horror film, but it has some problems.",7,9 September 2017,"It is terrifying. It exploits your fears in order to make you It's victim. It wants to kill and eat you. It is not of this world, which is why it is called It. The character of It was created by horror novelist Stephen King in his 1986 book, which became a successful two-part four-hour television mini-series in 1990, and then, 27 years later, the extremely successful feature film ""It"" (R, 2:15). All three incarnations tell the story of a demonic alien entity which basically rode an asteroid down to earth millions of years ago and emerges every 27 years for a year or so to feed on the residents (especially the children) of what has become known as the (fictional) town of Derry, Maine. It can shape-shift, appearing in forms which best exploit the fears of It's intended victims, but It's go-to manifestation is a clown called Pennywise, who looks like a combination of Bozo, Clarabell and Ronald McDonald, but is both child-like and pure evil. The people of Derry seem to forget the disappearances caused by It and simply move on with their lives. During one of It's feeding cycles, a motley crew of socially outcast kids work together to kill It, if possible, or at least to vanquish It from the town. After they're at least partially successful, the kids take an oath to return to the town to fight It again in case It reappears in another 27 years. Of course, It does, and they do. The novel and the miniseries covered both halves of that story, taking place 1957-58 and 1984-85, while the movie sets the first part in 1988-89 and then ends by setting up a sequel taking place 2015-2016. It uses the sewers below Derry to move about the town and snatch up as many kids as possible so, naturally, It's first appearance on screen is from inside a sewer grate. As Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), It lures a little boy named Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) close enough to grab him, leaving his older brother, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) unable to accept the reality of Georgie's disappearance. Several months later, it's the last day of school and we see Bill as the de facto leader of a group of 11-13-year-old social outcasts who start calling themselves the Losers Club. They are tormented by a group of bullies led by the sadistic and unbalanced Henry (Nicholas Hamilton). The Losers each have a defining characteristic which fuels the bullying: Bill stutters, Richie (Finn Wolfhard) is a loudmouth, Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) is a hypochondriac, Stan (Wyatt Oleff) is Jewish, Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is fat, Mike (Chosen Jacobs) is black and Bev (Sophia Lillis) is a girl who is rumored to be having sex, which is not true, except possibly with her father (Stephen Bogaert), who we see speak to and touch Bev inappropriately several times. Besides the bullies, It uses each of the Losers Club members' special characteristics against them.As the summer begins, Bill is trying to lead his friends to help him find Georgie, whom Bill wants to believe is simply missing in the city's sewer system, but the guys find much more down there than they bargained for. When the Losers Club is complete (with the addition of Ben, Mike and Bev, thanks to the actions of Henry and company), the group bonds while swimming in the quarry, getting into a rock fight with the bullies and, especially, chasing It. Through their combined knowledge of the town, these kids piece together the reasons that so many kids disappear in Derry and they seem to be the only ones willing and able to do something about It. It must feel threatened, because It begins to haunt each of the kids (appearing as Pennywise and in various other frightening forms) and attempts to kill all of them. Trying to outsmart It, outrun the bullies & outlast their abusive parents makes for quite a summer vacay. ""It"" is a very good horror movie, but it has some problems. Most importantly, this is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel and is one of the scariest movies of the year. It's kind of like if Steven Spielberg remade ""E.T."" as a horror film. The script, by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga (the film's original director) and Gary Dauberman features good character development and tells an exciting and complete story, even as it leads into the follow-up film in this pre-planned duology. Director Andy Muschietti (who helmed 2013's ""Mama"") gives us plenty of good scares and disturbing images and gets remarkable ensemble work from his cast of mostly child actors (most of whom had very little experience before this movie), while Bill Skarsgård (with the help of great costumes and makeup) puts the perfect combination of creepy whimsy and dangerous menace into his performance. Unfortunately, we also get bullies who are unrealistically aggressive, kids who use an uncomfortable amount of adult language, universally useless adults who range from impotent to abusive, and plot points which aren't sufficiently developed. ""It"" is imperfect, but it definitely entertains. ""B+""",It
170,agmoldham,Good Fun,6,13 September 2017,"As usual I didn't know too much about IT heading for the cinema beyond it probably being based on the Stephen King novel. It was indeed based on the Stephen King novel and tells the tale of a group of bullied school kids. The school kids also suffer rather dysfunctional families, but they have an even bigger problem ... They are being terrorised by a supernatural clown in a town which suffers more than the usual number of missing children. The movie is very nicely played by the actors and it's nice to have a connection with the characters. It's the usual horror film formula with a mix of laughs and frights throughout the movie. If you love the genre then you'll probably love IT and it's a pretty entertaining couple of hours.",It
171,Vivekmaru45,This is the second time the novel by Stephen King has been adapted.,5,18 September 2017,"The first, was a miniseries made in 1990 directed by Tommy Lee Wallace and adapted by Lawrence D. Cohen. name. The name It, derives from a predatory shape-shifter which has the ability to transform itself into its prey's worst fears, allowing it to exploit the phobias of its victims. mostly takes the form of a sadistic, wisecracking clown called Pennywise.It: Chapter One stars The film stars Jaeden Lieberher and Bill Skarsgård as Bill Denbrough and Pennywise the Dancing Clown, respectively, with Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer, Nicholas Hamilton and Jackson Robert Scott in supporting roles.Plot: In October 1988, Bill Denbrough gives his seven-year-old brother, Georgie, a sailboat made from paper. Georgie takes the boat out onto the street and is unable to stop it from sailing down the storm drain. In the storm drain, he finds a figure dressed as a clown who introduces himself as ""Pennywise the Dancing Clown."" The clown severs Georgie's arm when Georgie reaches into the drain for his boat, then drags him into the sewer.Eight months later, in June 1989, Denbrough and his friends Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak and Stanley Uris run afoul of bully Henry Bowers and his gang. Denbrough, still haunted by Georgie's disappearance and the resulting neglect from his grief-stricken parents, discovers that his brother's body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He recruits his friends to check it out, believing his brother may still be alive...Verdict: the film heavily relies on its special-effects that are superior to the 1990 miniseries because of the great advances made in CGI and computer-technology as a whole. The cast of the film is adequate but not outstanding. Indeed if one thinks about it, the 1990 miniseries had a very good cast and altogether a better film, even though the special effects cannot be matched by this new remake. Tim Curry played Pennywise in the first adaptation, here he is replaced with Bill Skarsgård, the son of the veteran actor Stellan Skarsgård.The special-effects rely heavily on the shape-shifting aspect of Pennywise. There are some strong scenes present in the film mainly dealing with bullying and child-abuse. Other than that there is nothing worth mentioning about the film.

172,swilliky,Solid horror film and adaptation of the iconic Stephen King,8,9 September 2017,"The latest iteration of the horror classic creates a vivid sense of terror while telling a heartfelt tale of youth while reinvigorating the iconic image of Pennywise from our generations most popular horror writer. Stephen King's book is a very long, yet great, read. I'm only about three hundred pages in and enjoying it more than most books. The massive amount of information is compressed nicely in this film that serves as a first part of the story, the childhood part. The liberties they take only add to the horror and keep the pacing moving somewhat swiftly though at times it felt stalled and the scares don't compare to other prominent films in the genre. I found the movie very entertaining and I think it will grow on me but there were certainly flaws that I would like to see improved upon if there is a sequel. With positive reviews and a crowded theater, I think it's likely that we will get to see the second half in a few years.Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) struggles with a stutter especially after he sends his younger brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) out with a boat and the boy goes missing. Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is the new kid in school and has to deal with the ruthless bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton). He retreats to the library but not before awkwardly blushing in front of his crush Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis). Beverly has to deal with own set of bullies including her abusive father. Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) works on the sheep farm with his grandfather bolting the animals in the head but he's haunted by the images of his parents burning behind a door. Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard) is the loudmouth who is skeptical of the hauntings. Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) studies for his bat mitzvah when a horrific image comes to life.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",It
173,markthomassintek,A film of literally 2 halves,6,19 September 2017,"REVIEW - ITSome films need to be remade, a prime example of this is a previous film I reviewed called 'Would You Rather' and some films should be left well alone, for example the countless remakes of Spiderman, Ghostbusters and of course Nightmare On Elm Street (which is being remade yet again).I first saw IT a very long time ago and I'll admit at the time I just didn't get IT (sorry for the pun) but I'm glad to say that with this remake I actually understood the story. Honestly the first hour is slow and in places I felt it dragged on but from about 70 minutes into the film (half way through) IT picked up the pace and became an enjoyable watch. IT reminded me of another classic film called 'Stand By Me'. A group of kids facing the challenges of growing up with parents who are.........So in summary, skip the first 70 minutes and just watch the second half (you won't miss anything important).A film of literally 2 halves.I will make one prediction, there will be a sequel and I'm guessing it will be called IT lives. Rating 6 out of 10",It
174,bob-the-movie-man,IT... didn't really float my boat.,4,20 September 2017,"IT is based on the Stephen King novel, and tells the disturbing recurring events that happen within the town of Derry in Maine. Kids keep disappearing and sightings of a spooky clown, other visitations and red balloons occur. A group of bullied high school kids – one directly impacted by the disappearances – work to get to the bottom of the supernatural goings on. (Fortunately they don't have a dog called Scooby).I had in mind that with the disturbing and dangerous ""clowning around"" that happened in the summer of 2016 that this film had been shot a while ago but the release delayed until now for fear of adding 'clown- flavoured fuel' to the fire. But it appears that filming only completed in September of last year, so that appears not to be the case.The film starts memorably and brutally with the ""drain scene"" from the trailer. And very effective it is too. ""Great!"" you think this is a spookfest that has legs! Unfortunately, for me at least, it all went downhill from there. The film really doesn't seem to know WHAT it's trying to be. There are elements of ""Stand By Me""; elements of ""Alien""; elements of ""The Conjuring"", all thrown into a cinematic blender and pulsed well.The most endearing aspects of the movie are the interactions of the small-town kids, with this aspect of the film bearing the closest relationship to J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"". This is carried by the great performances of the young actors involved, with Jaeden Lieberher (so memorable in ""Midnight Special"") as Bill; Jeremy Ray Taylor (""Ant Man"") as Ben ('the chubby one'); and Finn Wolfhard, in his big-screen premiere and sporting an absurd set of glasses, as the wise-cracking Ritchie.Standout for my though was the then 14-year old Sophia Lillis as Beverly (the nearest equivalent to the Elle Fanning role in ""Super 8""). This young lady has SUCH screen presence, reminiscent of Emma Watson in the Harry Potter films. I think she is a name to watch!While commenting on the acting I do need to acknowledge Bill Skarsgård (""Atomic Blonde"" and son of Stellan Skarsgård) who is creepily effective as Pennywise the clown.Having a film that just centred on the pubescent interplay between the youngsters and their battles against the near-psychopathic school bully Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton, ""Captain Fantastic"") would have kept me well-entertained for two hours. However, in the same way that the hugely over-inflated Sci-Fi ending of ""Super 8"" rather detracted from that film, so the clown-related story popping up all the time just irritated me to distraction. (""WILL YOU JUST FECK OFF AND LEAVE US TO FIND OUT WHO BEVERLY GETS OFF WITH???!!"")While the film has a number of good jump-scares, a lot of them – especially those with excessive use of CGI – just don't really work. There are normally no ""outcomes"" from the scares. It's all a bit like a ghost train where the carriage rounds a corner, something jumps out, and then the carriage moves on round the corner again! What makes a great horror film is where the ""science"" of the horror is well thought through. ""Alien"" was an exceptional example of that, where the science wasn't just ""physics"" but also ""biology"". Here (and I'm not sure whether this is true to the book this is one of Stephen King's I haven't read) there seems to be no rules involved at all. Things happen fairly randomly: shape-shifting and effects on physical objects happen with no rational explanation; the kids can see things adults can't see. (Why?). In fact the ""adults"" – the usual mix of Stephen King dysfunctional small-town crazies – seem to have no significant part in the story at all. It's all like some lame teenage fantasy where actions (a number of individuals in the story meet their demise) seem to carry no legal consequences whatsoever. I half expected Bill to wake up – Dallas style – at the end and realise it had all been an ""awful dream""!In particular, the denouement is highly dissatisfying. An opportunity for a (very black) twist in the plot is discarded.  Pennywise the clowns departure is both lame and unconvincing. And there are numerous loose ends that are never properly tied down (what was that ""floaters descending"" dialogue about?. it was just never followed through!).It's not all bad though. The location shoots in Bangor, Maine and the Ontario countryside are all beautifully rendered by cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung  (""Stoker"") and where the film clicks with the young cast it clicks well and enjoyably. I just wish that the overall film wasn't just such a jumbled-up mess: blame for that must lie with the screen writing team and director Andy Muschietti (""Mama""). I'm going to give it a kicking in my rating, since with all the marketing build-up it was certainly a disappointment. I see though that at the time of writing that this film sports an unfathomably high IMDb rating of 8.0/10 so I'll acknowledge that somebody must have seen something more in this than I did!!(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",It

The characters themselves were highly enjoyable as they mixed humor, friendship and heart in with the absolutely scary events that were taking place in the film.

178,ofpsmith,Solidly done adaptation.,9,18 September 2019,"Stephen King's novel upon which the film is based strikes alot of people different ways. Personally I enjoyed it, though I felt it was longer than it needed to be and a few sscenes were far from neccesary. Luckily this film (unlike its sequel) does not fall into the trap. If you don't know the story it concerns a group of 11-13 year old kids living in the fictional town of Derry, Maine where a malevolent entity makes an appearance every 27 years. They come to realize the existence of the monster and so come together to fight it. Alongside the monster they also have to fight psychotic bullies, variously troubled family lives, and growing up. The film did a good job of bringing the story to light without making it too dense and long (again, not a feat shared by its sequel). The child actors are all apt at portraying the memorable characters and it is a legitamitely scary film. I'd say to go check it out if you liked the book but you've most likely seen it already.",It
179,Prichards12345,Average adaption - too many horror set-pieces and ear-bleedingly loud,6,12 September 2017,"IT could have been a horror classic. Instead we have an okay film which doesn't quite grip as it should, and two hours after seeing it is already starting to fade from my memory.Part of the problem is that Pennywise is a bit overused. Bill Skarsgard does a good job, but he pops up roughly every five minutes or so, and his effectiveness is diminished as the film goes on - until the climax, when the creepiness factor goes into overdrive.The child actors are all okay, but some of ""The Losers Club"" are underdeveloped. Mike Hanlon's interest in the history of Derry is transferred to Ben Hanscom, which left very little to go on. Mike is thinly sketched and so is Richie. It fumbles Eddie's story very badly.It was probably just the cinema I saw it in, but the volume was way too loud - it was ear-splitting. And as the film, as so many modern horror films do, over relies on jump cuts, it felt like a jack hammer each time it happened. Jumpcuts don't improve a horror film, they are a cheap go to for lazy film makers, and there were too many of them in this movie. Too many horror set pieces in general, and more character stuff needed for me.There are some good moments,though. Stan's creepy painting - a sequence not in the novel - really works, though again it means reducing characterisation, as we get to know Stan through his bird watching in Stephen King's novel. He's also a boy scout, another aspect totally gone. Ben's library encounter with Pennywise is also effectively spooky....a trail of little Easter eggs leading straight to Pennywise. Beverly Marsh was really well done, until she apparently killed her dad - WTF? - and Henry Bowers is much more effective than he was in the t.v. adaption.I'm also pleased that some of the background to Derry made it into the film, though did it really need to be updated to the 80s? Part of the book's charm is that it is set in the late 50s. I can't get nostalgic over the era of Ronald Reagan and awful music. I missed a lot of the ""growing up"" stuff from the book. This was a movie that badly needed more character development. All told, though, I enjoyed it to a degree, and I will be back for part two. Maybe more enjoyable if you haven't read the book or seen the much loved t.v. mini-series.",It

181,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble""",6,20 February 2020,I was first introduced to Stephen Kings IT back in the 90s when I was a kid watching the IT mini series on VHS and after seeing Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise the Clown from that point on I had a fear of Clowns.Now if your like me and you watched the original mini series back in the 90s then chances are your not really going to enjoy this remake as much as the original and not because it's a bad movie or even a bad adaptation of the book it's just different from the original mini series mainly because the mini series was more quiet and intense it's budget was nothing compared to movies in the modern day and it was developed for television so the violence and bad language had to be very minimal so instead we got a slow and interesting story that built up fear with clever writing and short but intense scenes with pennywose as he terrorised the losers club in dark often comedic ways so when pennywise finally attacked the losers club it was scary to watch as he showed his teeth ready to feast on them.IT 2017 follows the same storyline as the original give or take a few minor changes to the story as an excuse to fill it full of 80s nostalgic references and call backs the movie also uses a lot of CGI which is disappointing the scenes that do use practical effects look good but just there's so few of them to enjoy but the main issue I had with the movie is just how unnecessarily loud and in your face the scene's with Pennywise are there's no real tension in the scenes with Pennywise and the losers club he just runs at them shouting and drooling at the mouth while typical jump scare music and children's voices play very loudly over what is supposed to be a scary scene when really all it does is give you a headache and makes you blink a lot from all the flashing it's pretty funny that with all today's modern technology they can't make a single horror movie that is actually scary and practical for a new generation this is the norm and they will enjoy the movie but if you were around in the 80s and 90s it just makes you wish you could go back to the days when horror movies were actually scary and innovative.With all that being said the movie is still well shot and is very colourful and makes good use of modern day camera technology to give us a great looking film.All the actors involved really do their best and all give a fantastic performance they all do a great job giving their characters individual personalities and quirks Bill Skarsgard is ok as Pennywise at least for a new generation but for me and a lot of other people Tim Curry will always be Pennywise and will always be the reason I am scared of real clowns.I recommend watching this movie at least once because it isn't a bad movie but just don't go into it expecting it to be a upgrade to the original mini series because you will be very disappointed.,It

He was scary, funny and he had the creepy movements down during his scares.I could find lots of fun and scary moments that I think a lot of people will like, I suggest you watch this.I did also like the TV miniseries with Tim Curry as Pennywise and found it entertaining, but that wasn't as scary as this.",It
183,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,24 September 2017,"By far, the best Stephen King's movie adaptation I've seen in years ... Well, I'm not saying much having in mind the most recent films, am I? So, to be absolutely clear: It is one of my favorite movies of this year!The story is very intriguing and mysterious during the whole runtime, therefore it doesn't allow a single dull moment or a misplaced scene. Tonally, the film switches between horror and slight bits of comedy (kids' banter) masterfully since it never feels that the funny moments are forced or without reason.Andy Muschietti flawlessly directs this movie. I honestly think it's one of those films that without this director, it wouldn't be even close to the success that it achieved. The way he explores and connects each one of the kids' fears and their backstory is truly unique, which elevates the screenplay even more. It's beautifully edited and the unconventional plot transforms It into something special.Even if Muschietti is technically perfect, the cast steals the whole show. I can't go through everyone, but keep in mind that every single one of the young actors has a fantastic performance. Besides, it's kind of awkward to point out flaws in kids' acting, but thankfully everyone is so great that I don't need to.Obviously, Bill Skarsgård is freaking terrifying as Pennywise. He's the cinematic proof that clowns can be strangely scary and I'm sure that now kids have a pretty good reason to fear them. Bill doesn't really show up as himself or without CGI that much, but when he does ... He portrays Pennywise brilliantly. From his laugh to his voice, he's perfect. Awesome job!Jaeden Lieberher plays Bill Denbrough, who is the main protagonist. He's the one that wants to find Pennywise at all costs and make him pay for all his crimes. Bill's story is remarkably emotional and compelling, something that Jaeden interprets amazingly. Sophia Lillis is a beautiful surprise as she represents Beverly Marsh! Her character's family issues and school problems make her feel real and she's probably the one who the audience is able to connect with better. Once again, another breakthrough performance from an unknown actress to me.Finn Wolfhard is by far the most recognized actor due to the success of Stranger Things. He plays Richie Tozier and if you ever saw one of Finn's interviews, you're not going to be astonished that Richie is basically Finn. He's the funny kid that's always teasing about the others' mothers and he's the main source of comedy through the whole movie. To my delight, he never gets annoying and the script for him is on-point.Finally, Jeremy Ray Taylor plays Ben Hanscom and he's the chubby kid that everyone loves because he's just so innocent and cute that everything he does and says is simply funny. The actor's expressions are hilarious, especially when he's sharing a scene with Sophia since their chemistry is marvelous.Actually, the whole cast's chemistry is off the charts, it feels like they have been friends since they were born! I also love the fact that this is a group of kids that entitles itself the ""losers"" gang since all of them suffer some kind of bullying, either from colleagues at school or from family members. This detail instantly relates to almost everyone in the audience so there's every reason to root for them right from the beginning.As for flaws, I can't really find anything big. The jump scares work really well, but some just follow the cliché setup and they don't effectively scare me. I might flinch, but apart from one scene that I admit I was caught completely off guard, it's pretty standard.The one thing that I didn't fancy at all is the way that the bullies are handled. Not that they aren't required, but there are a few moments that seem absurd and too far from reality. I can only understand why one of the bullies is harassing the ""losers"", but even that one does unimaginable things.All in all, It is one of 2017's best films and it's undoubtedly the best horror movie of this year. Andy Muschietti flawless directing skills elevate the screenplay and the scary scenes are indeed very creepy. However, the cast strongly shines with special praise to Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Jeremy Ray Taylor and, of course, Bill Skarsgård as the terrifying and beautifully designed, Pennywise. Excellent tone balance, amazing storytelling and great character development throughout the whole runtime, with the exception of the bullies that seem a bit off and even absurd.MSB Reviews | Full Spoiler-Free review on my blog :)",It

186,RussHog,Good - but IT needed the adult plot,7,8 September 2017,"The remake of Stephen King's IT is pretty darn good. It has good acting. Well filmed. The special FX are not always great but the actor who plays Pennywise rules. Whenever he is on screen the story really engages - when he is off screen the young leads do a solid job. It is really good to see an actual monster movie in the theaters. We have so many found footage horrible stories, and bad CGI, and weak stories watered down to protect feelings...it is nice to get a straight up child killing Dead Lights thing that disguises as a clown. The film has two key weaknesses - however. One, for the story to have work at its highest level it really needed the adult plot mixed in with the kids. Even a little bit - like in the beginning there is an action that causes the adults to be summoned and then at the very end they unite for the first time in many years. For me, IT deals with adults who have to face that IT happened long ago - and now IT is back. It is a mission critical story element. Second - it should have been set in the 1950s. Either way, it is great to see a monster movie in theaters.",It
187,Andres-Camara,Go a disappointment.,4,30 December 2017,"I like watching scary movies, it's a genre that I like, when it's well done, when it's scary and credible. In this case, the truth, I have not felt fear at any time. What's more, when the clown came out, he took me out of the movie. I do not know how the director does it but he gets that about the clown.The final part of the film is total nonsense. I do not understand anything of what happens, the clown's transformations, I do not know why he does them. You have to create the world of the clown and I imagine that in the book it is like that, but to me at least, it did not seem credible to me.It is a sum of cheap scares. It never manages to put fear into your body. There is nothing that intrigues you and when it seems that something interesting is going to happen, the clown comes out and everything falls down.The children are very well, yes, it's a pity that the movie does not follow them.
The soundtrack, also does not help anything. It has no intrigue.The picture that should be scary, when they are on the street is very white and when they are indoors it is too dark and you can not see anything and you are more worried about discovering what you see on the screen than about the movie.The director does not know how to take her. It is boring, it does not make a beautiful plane and less a plane that causes fear.The truth is that I expected a lot more from this movie",It

Starring Bill Skarsgård in the title role, the film not only succeeds as a terrifying horror film but also as one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date.In 1989 in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of outcast kids known as the ""Losers Club"", are each terrorised by a frightening, shape-shifting entity they collectively refer to as ""IT"". When no one else in town will come to their aide, the kids decide to band together and fight against ""IT"" themselves while also overcoming their own personal demons.Like with comedy, horror is a highly subjective genre. What one may find scary may cause others to roll their eyes in annoyance. Thankfully, IT provides enough scares that seem as realistic as possible and prevent the film from being silly. This retelling takes itself very seriously and doesn't constantly rely on jump scares for legitimate horror, instead by building a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and individual torment in each of the kids. The cast is fantastic, Bill Skarsgard's performance as IT, in particular that of his clown form Pennywise, is terrifying, almost on par with Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. He definitely feels like more of a threat than Tim Curry's version, whom by today's standards seems a little too goofy and wacky to be scary. In addition to Pennywise, all of the child actors are brilliant. Not once did I ever feel unconvinced of the fear that they were feeling. Even the usual Stephen King tropes seemed more subdued in this film, aside from the usual setting in Maine, of course. If this is the future for adaptations of Stephen King's work, then I am most certainly on board.I rate it 8.5/10",It
190,meydiana-65242,The perfect blend of comedy and horror,10,18 October 2020,"Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening. Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate description!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark, yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works. My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not for the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as if this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brilliant two-for-one if you ask me!Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch!",It
191,eva3si0n,One of the few horror stories you can watch,7,18 September 2021,"I did not watch the previous It, I did not read the book. But I enjoyed watching the cinema adaptation of 2017. Horror has outlived itself for a long time, and It vividly confirms this, screamers, is and is not done badly, but it is not frightening at all. Children's characters did not play their roles poorly. One of the few horror stories you can watch.",It
192,Alexander_Blanchett,Stand by It,9,5 October 2017,"A new kind of terror. It was a great film. Not only as a horror film but also as a coming of age drama of a couple of outsider friends and their bond which is probably the best interpretation since ""Stand by Me"" in that matter. Yes the horror works, it is scary, definitely scarier than the original which is mostly due to the unbelievably charismatic performance of Bill Skarsgard who with his actually sympathich aura makes the character even more worse .. more evil. Excellent performance. I also liked that this adaption was very faithful to the book which remains as one of my all time favorites. The characters were introduced in the necessary detail so you care for them from the beginning to the end and this really makes you look forward to a potential sequel as you are desperate to know their fate (well if you haven't read the book). The direction was excellent and director Andy Muschietti created some scenes that are already iconic. Wonderful atmosphere, soundtrack and surprisingly great cinematography. I liked the kids, especially Sophia Lillis was exceptional and so was Jeremy Ray Taylor. Jaeden Lieberher was also fine in the lead as was Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer. Did not care too much for Wyatt Oleff nor Chosen Jacobs but they were definitely decent enough. I really look forward to see it again. One of the best films of the year so far.",It
193,LoneWolfAndCub,An almost perfect adaptation of King's epic horror novel,9,8 September 2017,"A brief foreword: Stephen King's It remains my favourite horror novel ever since I read it 13 years ago. It terrified me then and terrifies me still. I always wondered how they could adapt this huge 1000+ page novel into a well-made, scary film. In 1990 a miniseries was released and unfortunately failed miserably. As much as I like Tim Curry as Pennywise and the flashback scenes the series is generally terrible and fails to do the book justice.Enter this adaptation which, while not 100% faithful, captures the essence of the book. The film is set in the 80's, not 50's, and follows only the parts of the novel that deal with the group as children (rather than flashing forward and back). A few other parts of the novel are changed or left out which I won't go into much detail about so as not to spoil anything. Some of the omissions I can understand, others are slightly disappointing as I think they would have made the film scarier.Briefly, the film follows The Losers Club, a group of seven children who face day-to-day challenges of overprotective, ignorant or abusive parents while trying not to get eaten by a shape-shifting entity that often takes the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown.The movie's biggest strength lies in the casting. The group of child actors are just so fantastic and an absolute pleasure to watch. In fact, I could just watch a movie about their antics without any of the horrors for hours. The actors give life to such an eclectic group of children and they deserve all the praise they are getting. Bill Skarsgard absolutely nails Pennywise, rather than Tim Curry's more human looking version, Skarsgard appears demonic and alien from the get go (also thanks to a fantastic SFX team).Thanks to cinematographer Chung Hoon Chung It looks beautiful, every shot feels carefully framed, clearly a lot of effort was put into making this so. Everything from the opening scene with Georgie running through the rainy streets of Derry to the children playing in the quarry could be framed a work of art.Andres Muschietti is the man behind all this and I must respect his vision for It, even if others may not see it or agree with it. Previously he has directed Mama, a fairly standard horror film and not in the same league as this. Maybe this was a special project for him, whatever the case this is a massive improvement and a fantastic showcase for his directing abilities.As I mentioned earlier the screenplay deviates slightly from the source, generally not to the movies detriment. However, it feels somewhat light on scares and tends to focus more on ""Stand By Me"" type scenes. If there is one thing I would have liked more of is scares but not at the expense of spending time with the characters. The films running time is over 2 hours but this goes so quickly a few more scenes of horror wouldn't have gone astray. What is there is genuinely frightening with some scenes more effective than others. The film is not overly graphic (I expected more honestly) but stays true to some key scenes, particularly young Georgie's famous encounter at the beginning. What I did find interesting is the stories focus not only as It as the villain but the adults almost like secondary villains. Aware of the evil present but preferring to turn the blind eye. This idea stood out quite prominently, and further highlighted the children's struggles, which in turn makes the film even more satisfying come the credits.Ever since I read It I dreamed of what a film adaptation would be like, and how scary it could be. This may not be exactly what I pictured, and there are things I would have done differently, but as it stands this is an excellent film. A beautiful blend of drama and horror with a group of lovable kids and a terrifying villain. This is easily one of the best King adaptations put to screen and quite simply a high quality horror film, something I haven't seen in some time. Consider me thoroughly excited for Chapter Two, and for The Losers Club to confront It one last time.9/10",It
194,Jithindurden,Upgraded but not necessarily better,6,21 November 2017,"IT uses all the conventional horror elements in perfect harmony with King's novel's parts dealing with the kids. An upgrade from the cheesy 1990 TV version but even with the help of the most modern technology, it's the core story of King that shines above all. The whole cast of kids did a fantastic job and the backstories were also solid. But it feels kind of incomplete without the next chapter releasing in 2019. The overuse of jump-scares and CGI monsters is a bit tiring where more mysterious approach may have worked better.",It
195,CANpatbuck3664,It Subverts Expectations With Well Drawn Characters and an Interesting Yet Scary Story,9,14 September 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* IT begins in 1988 where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) is trying to take his paper boat to sail out in the rain. His brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) would normally go with him but he's feeling under the weather. Georgie takes his boat out and it races down the street with the rain and the prevailing current. The boat takes a turn into the sewers and when Georgie bends down to reach it, he discovers Pennywise ""The Dancing Clown"" (Bill Skarsgard). Pennywise is maybe too friendly and while Georgie is apprehensive of him at first, Pennywise coaxes him closer to the drain. He promises to give him his boat back but Georgie is snatched and dragged into the sewer.One year later, more kids are vanishing yet the adults seem to either not notice or don't care. Bill and his friends: Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrack (Jack Dylan Grazer), Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), Mike (Chosen Jacobs), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) and Beverley (Sophia Lillis) are all separately visited by Pennywise and experience nightmares. Together, they combine their efforts to face him and discover how through their friendship, they can overcome anything.A lot of movies about kids don't trust kids to be able to handle some of the tougher subjects. I've read a few of Stephen King's books and a consistent theme is the dirtier side of small town living. IT has that at the forefront and I think its a better movie for it. Sure, it will make for some uncomfortable moments for more sensitive viewers but the problems facing The Losers Club (minus Pennywise) are all very real. I can't say really young kids should watch this movie, it can be graphic. But instead of shying away from how dark King's material, they play into it and it really helped ground the movie.So while they don't shy away from the dark environment facing these kids, the other big surprise from this movie was how they put the time in to make you care about these kids. I can't remember the last time a horror movie made me feel this scared for the potential victims. None of these kids deserve the fate that Pennywise would subject them to. They aren't dealing with Twilight or Degrassi problems, these are some very serious issues (almost homicidal bullies, possible sexual assault, dealing with the premature death of a young sibling, hypochondria etc.) and I felt for every single one of these kids. It also helps you get attached to their friendship, camaraderie is hard to buy unless its done right but IT excels at that. When they must band together to face this evil, instead of it being corny, I bought into it and I wanted them to survive.Moving from developing the characters, the actors/actresses more than carry their share of the load. They did a great job finding capable kid actors and they all shine. If I had to single out a couple of them, I would credit Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis, Jack Dylan Grazer and Jeremy Ray Taylor as being the standouts. Where child actors usually struggle, they thrived in this movie. I also have to tip my hat to Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. He's helped up by some impressive special effects but he makes Pennywise threatening and lends an unpredictable element to the character that may not have come through with another actor.IT is being advertised as the next great horror movie and while I'm happy to report that IT is genuinely frightening, it isn't perfect. There are scenes filled with terror (my favourite is a scary set piece with a slide projector) and there are even some really funny scenes. This is mostly carried by the character Richie who is vulgar but completely believable (so many dick jokes). My only complaint is that while Pennywise is motivated to frighten the children first, he beats around the bush a lot. He is so powerful and his abilities are crazy, there were so many times where he had these kids isolated and vulnerable and for no reason he didn't kill them. It was just one of those situations where the villain is more concerned in playing with his food more than getting the job done and there isn't a believable reason why.I had some minor problems with IT but very little of those issues coloured my overall opinion of this movie. With all the hype surrounding IT, this could have been a big letdown. But this movie was excellent and I get why so many people are going nuts over IT. With this being advertised as chapter 1, I'm excited to see the next entry in this potential series. If you're in the mood for some backwater horror thrills, IT could be the film you're looking for. I would grade IT at 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9. IT also might make you scared of clowns and make you double-take at red balloons as a side-effect. Keep that in mind as the trade-off.",It
196,apryla-58795,"""You'll die (laughing) if you try"" (watching this film)",5,14 October 2018,"I was fully expecting to be terrified while watching this. In fact I was so apprehensive about watching it that I put it off for a long time. I had even decided at one point that I would not watch it at all BUT I'm a horror film aficianado and I haven't seen a movie that has truly terrified me in so long that I finally gave in and decided to watch this with the hope that I'd be scared...alas with the exception of the first scene I was not scared. If anything I was laughing throughout the film.The kids do a pretty good job. The only two that didn't work were the actor who played Ben and the actor who played Mike. They were both pretty dull and boring. Any actor could have played those roles - they brought nothing special or unique to the film. You either have screen presence or you don't and those kids don't have it. I particularly liked the kid who played Eddie and the actress who played Beverly. They were both really good.I had an issue with a couple of scenes. One is the first scene. I don't like that they showed a small sweet innocent child getting his arm ripped off and then dragged into the sewer. That was very chilling and disturbing especially because the child actor was so young and cute. That seemed gratuitous. The scene would have been just as scary without that because what made it terrifying was how creepy Pennywise was. The way he was trying to manipulate this trusting child was disturbing. They didn't need to show him writhing on the ground trying to get away after his arm was ripped off. I think that scene will haunt me but not because it was scary - it is more that it was just kind of heartbreaking to see a small child suffer. The child actor was so darn cute. It was upsetting to see him meet such a brutal end.The other issue I had is with the two scenes where Ben got cut pretty seriously yet he gets no medical attention. There's no way he could have survived the second attack without getting some major stitches. At the very least he needed the cuts cleaned and you never see that happen. In fact after he gets carved up the first time he runs through a bacteria filled stream of water which would surely have given him an infection yet he has no issues from that point on until he gets cut up again by Pennywise later on in the film. And where were his parents? You never see them. I didn't see the first It but I read that film's extensive synopsis and nowhere do they explain why the red balloon keeps popping up. I get that balloons go with clowns but so do fake squirting flowers, tiny cars and never ending handkerchiefs but you don't see those portrayed at any time throughout the films so...why one red balloon? The idea is that ""It"" takes the form of whatever fear a person has and no one was scared of clowns except for Richie so why would ""It"" keep popping up as a clown and why the red balloon?Also I would have liked to know more about the Pennywise back story. We get some but not much. It made it hard to be too afraid without knowing why we should be afraid. A town presence takes kids every 27 years...ok great but why?This film was actually funny. The kids had funny lines and some of their facial expressions and reactions were hilarious. There was so much hype about the prep Bill Skarsgard went through for this film and yet once you see it you wonder if they spent too much time overthinking it because really he's not that scary after the first scene. The ending was good. Usually horror film endings are lame, weak or cliche but this one worked really well and actually was a perfect setup for the next film. I'm looking forward to seeing that one. I would suggest watching this only if you want some good laughs but avoid if you're looking for something scary. I'm not clowning around...this kind of fell short and my search for a truly terrifying movie continues...",It

198,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,24 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Being a big fan of the 1990 mini-series, I went into this one extremely critical. ""It"" has always been a personal favorite of mine and I loved what Tim Curry did as Pennywise. I was hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. However, when I walked out, I was smiling from ear to ear and already looking forward to the 2nd movie. This re-imagining of Stephen King's classic story did not let me down.This first chapter focuses in on 7 young kids who, through different incidents in their lives, find friendship and support with each other. They become known as the Loser's Club, mainly because the town bully, Henry Bowers, is perilously pursuing each one of them forcing them to finally make an eventual stand. The main ""loser"" is Bill Denbrough, who's little brother, Georgie, goes missing. Bill believes he's still alive, but after each of the kids endures their own hardships and run-in's with Pennywise the evil, dancing clown, Bill decides to go after him and find his brother - leading to the film's climactic conclusion that will pit the 7 friends against not only Pennywise, but Henry Bowers as well.Okay - I think we can all agree that it is Pennywise who makes this movie work. He is the centerpiece. If you don't have a good, scary clown, then this film fails. Tim Curry's Pennywise was a success. Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise was a triumph. The make-up effects, special effects, voice and laugh of the maniacal clown was just excellent. The use of colors, lighting and shadows was done to near perfection. Everyone was cast just right and the acting by everyone was invested and completely believable - and since this first movie hinges on the kids' performances, they did a wonderful job and delivered on all levels.This film is one to be applauded. It has plenty of good jumps and scares, and one that I would watch again and again. Great movie! It comes at a very high recommend. Now off to watch the 2nd chapter. I cannot wait! 9 stars out of 10.",It
199,ronakkotian,Lives up to the 1990 mini-series,7,3 September 2019,"I liked the 1990 It mini-series. The adult part wasn't good but I always found the child portion to be fascinating so it's great to see another good adaptation of the first half of It.The film follows a group of kids, known as The Losers Club, who try to get rid of a monster that frequently takes form of a clown and feeds off the kids of Derry.Straight off the bat, I thought the acting overall was really good. Whenever I see a child actor in a film, I'm always worried about their performance since it can be over the top or not good at all but thankfully this wasn't the case. All the child performances were really good. Each character felt relatable and so I could connect with them. All the kids played off each other which made their chemistry seem believable. Bill Skarsgard had a lot to live up to since Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise was the best part of the mini-series and I found Skarsgard to be sublime. His take on Pennywise was very scary. Every time he was on screen I could feel a strong sense of threat. It wasn't just the effects that made him scary because his expression alone gave creepy and unsettling vibes.Visually, this film looks great. Andy Muschietti's direction is really good. The movie is shot well and the cinematography portrayed the 80s just like how it would be. The writing was pretty good. We learnt a lot about each character and this made me want to root for them more. I thought the character of Henry Bowers was well realised and it made sense as to why he acts as a bully. I wish the character of Mike was more developed though since we don't see or learn much about him.As for complaints, I didn't like the overuse of jumpscares sprinkled throughout the film's entirety. It took away some of the fear and scare aspects of the film. The sewer scene would have been much more effective and creepy without the use of a jumpscare. It would have felt more terrifying if they scared the audience visually rather than a loud noise which makes you jolt for a few seconds.Aside from that, this is a well made Stephen King adaptation. For me, this is on par or even better than the first half of the mini-series. I look forward to see how Muschietti handles the adult segment of It and his future films.",It

201,owen-watts,The Dancing Clown,7,28 January 2021,"While mercifully truncated compared to King's bloated book (and thankfully free of the dated dialogue, terrifying sexism and THAT SCENE) It also sheds a fair chunk of the creeping existential dread, heady sense of place and heavy character work that also define the story. Pennywise is the star of the show of course, the young cast are solidly characterful and a few of the billion jump-scares/set-pieces here are pretty great.

203,statuskuo,Dumb Beyond Belief,1,23 September 2017,"I pity this society. Because they would champion this stupid adaption of Stephen King's novel over the mini-series. I'm trying to figure out if this is dumb or stupid. Dumb implies they purposely ignored the source material and went for...a dusting of the heart of what made the novel so great. Here's a hint to these retards who made this...it isn't kids swearing like morons. Nor was it a decidedly forceful creep like Pennywise. How stupid do you think children are that they wouldn't see a dumb dead-eyed clown in a sewer and reach in? Here's what made the miniseries so much better...he was a playful clown. This one is a creep. It's not fun at all. Tim Curry was legendary in this role, this dunce couldn't hold a clown shoe to Curry.God, I hate this movie. Here's another thing...how stupid are kids that split up...in a house they are afraid of entering in the first place. Also, the town is suppose to be haunted by this tragedy. Saw NONE of that. The miniseries also did something much creepier than a two part money-grab could do...they prefaced the fear by seeing them FIRST as adults. They overlooked the idea that whatever freaked them out as kids back in the day shock them into reality in the present. This will be addressed in the next chapter (laughably, they called this ""Chapter One""...really, idiots? Who did this?). But it's diluted. The miniseries followed the structure of King's book which bounced back and forth which made it infinitely better.People who liked this garbage...too bad you've been conditioned to watch turd. Your brain has been saturated with that 80's feel. Eat ballsack ""Stranger Things."" You're not clever and you're not fun. This is hot hot garbage and society praises mediocrity.

And what excuses do they have for making these remakes? That they can tell the story in a better or more creative way? Has any remake ever accomplished that? Of course not.This film has no respect for the original, and it doesn't understand (or try to understand) what the film is about. You see, the original film was about friendship, about confronting fear, about the power of faith, and about a really creepy presence menacing the kids. This film just has a silly monster doing silly things, but there is no real purpose to it. The monster doesn't seem to know what it wants, and the kids look like they are just puppets for the monster to abuse. They never become the likable characters from the original, that become true friends and struggle to overcome their weaknesses and fears. Thus, in the remake, all we have is a bunch of kids being scared at random by a CGI monster. The film seems to wish to compensate for lack of substance by turning the violence up. In the original, the fat kid is threatened with a knife, but not actually cut. Here he does get cut, and the rock throwing episode is a real war, with people getting seriously hurt. Likewise, the scenes with 'it' are protracted, yet pointless. You see, the monster in the original film had a clear sense of purpose, and the confrontations with it were not so much about action, but the meaning behind it. This film has no meaning, but it has lots of silly action that really bored me from beginning to end. Another thing is that this film hates to leave anything to imagination. Thus, little Georgie not only gets his arm bit off, but we have to see it in detail, then watch the kid crawl around, without his arm. Again: the film fails to generate sympathy and meaning, and treats us to nothing but gore. Why? Why would anyone make such a nasty film about kids, and even make it a remake of a wonderful film? This is bad film making, the kind that makes you want to throw up. The people who made this have no artistic ambition, and they are utterly cynical.Ironically, they do reflect the soulless, nihilist age we live in, in which there is no truth or beauty, and nothing to fight and die for. The courage the kids muster at the end of the film won't do them any good in this world, because they will have nothing of any value to fight and sacrifice for. Value no longer exists. Only search for pleasure. And that kills the soul. Just as this film killed everything good about the original.",It
215,frosty-44431,Better As A Book,5,6 February 2021,"This film just wasn't for me. I personally don't like CGI in thriller and that spoilt it for me. I'm just not a fan, but I can see why people would like it.",It
216,JoelChamp85,Visually Decent,6,17 March 2021,Some really good looking scenes but for some reason the scares just don't work. The CGI fest is a bit much and takes away potential for true horror. IT's more like a horror for Kids.,It
217,Darth_Osmosis,Loved it,9,17 May 2018,"A Great adaptation, well the first half of one at least! Takes some liberties and changes some stuff(ending most notably and obviously), but is true to the source where it counts. Actually manages to be quite creepy and even scary at times, the child actors were also really good!",It
218,baileycrawly,Meh,6,15 March 2020,"Upon first few viewings in the theatre, I had a much more positive reception to this film. With the passing of time, however, the cracks start to show and the positive opinions have now given way to reveal the negative underneath the positive.It's perhaps most important to start with the positives and highlight what this film does correctly. The relationship the kids in the film share is amazing. The chemistry between them is second to none and, considering it consumes the vast majority of the screen time, is a major positive talking point. There's a definite feeling that these kids have been friends for the better part of their lives, and the viewer can easily relate to each of them on a certain level. Everybody knows somebody like each of these characters. The movie creates a drama with them reminiscent of Stand By Me, with some of the very same coming-of-age elements that King so likes to write.
This film also gets a better representation of the book, choosing some of the stronger points and leaving behind the filler, making this a passable adaptation of a book that I never thought to be that great to begin with. It's better than the 1990 miniseries version in that aspect. When writing for the TV audiences, there's only so much you were permitted to portray on TV, which is the only major shortcoming of the original miniseries.
Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is decent enough, offering a menacing performance despite nearly everyone of his appearances being ruined by digitally enhanced attempts to make him scary. Which is where the negative aspect begins to come into play.This movie just isn't scary.
Many attempts have been made to justify this, the weakest being that the film is told from the point of view of these kids and, thus, what is scary to them is what we see. That, of course, is redundant given that the film is general deemed unsuitable for that age demographic by many critics and review boards.
Bill Skarsgard is robbed of the chance to give a decent performance by the subpar CGI that permeates this movie. A character truly menacing on its own is destroyed by digitally altered teeth, ridiculous visual distortions and that run that easily ranks among the worst artefacts of horror movie history. It's not creepy, it doesn't induce anxiety, it offers nothing to the story. It simply exists to be the laughingstock of the film and to take audiences out of the story.
Pennywise is far more frightening on paper. Being a creature of fantasy it's simply impossible to accurately portray IT and be realistic. And perhaps that's for the best. Perhaps this is a story that belongs in the hearts and minds of the Constant Readers who picked up the book and enjoyed it, and who return to the book time and time again (I am not one). The 1990 miniseries had it's flaws and laughable special effects, but the cheapening of this film by the horrid effects is much more successful in destroying a movie that could've been great.",It
219,funtasticfour,My favourite movie of 2017!,9,30 April 2018,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and It has been near the top of my favourite books ever as well. Of course this movie only covers half the story, but it was very well done! Lots of changes, but that ok. The kid actors were great, and the clown was amazing. It almost feels like a cross between Stand By Me and The Shining. I can't imagine the sequel living up to this, but I hope it does. I hope they don't get too many famous actors because it's often is better with unknowns.",It
220,Offworld_Colony,"A fun, classic, Amblin inspired and completely recognisably Stephen Kingian buddy horror.",7,10 February 2020,"Stings of 80's moments, little character moments and all the classics of 'don't go in the monster house' make for a glossy, seat-back horror that's a lot of fun to watch. Enough of the source novel and lore; turtles and the deadlights etc. are used well enough to make me want to google what their relevance is but not enough to get in the way or detract from the tone and thrust of the core story. The horror is squealingly good fun, not too disgusting or crass or affecting, and instead like good camp fire horror.
Pennywise is well realised and the child actors are all solid, dialogue and script is enjoyable and the directing and cinematography is top notch.
I have issues with it. But it was a blast and I feel no need to tear it apart when it glides from start to finish so effortlessly.",It
221,chicagopoetry,IT . . . was just okay,6,9 September 2017,"I haven't read the book.I actually paid $22 to see this on IMAX (well, what they're calling IMAX at the Regal anyway), that's how up for it I was. I very, very rarely pay to see a film in a theater with so many online options available, but hey, Richard Roeper said it was not only one of the best horror films ever made but one of the best films of ANY genre ever made. I should have known better. I lost respect for Roeper when he gave Jupiter Ascending an F. Anyway, no, it's not one of the best films ever made, not even one of the best horror films ever made, and I'll tell you why.Mind you, I haven't read the book.So what we have is Goonies or Stand By Me or more recently Stranger Things (you know, a group of boys, sometimes with one girl thrown in, having an adventure together), except this time around these kids aren't naive or innocent so to speak. They all have dealt or are currently dealing with some horrific trauma. It's a nice plot twist that IT feeds on their real life fears, but since their real life existence is actually in a way just as or more terrifying than a ghost clown is, it kind of makes the ghost clown less terrifying. All the adults in this film are just sons of bitches, so compared to this ghost clown, who isn't real so to speak and who isn't going to be around permanently, the adults in this film are more horrifying than the monster is. And the bullies, who are but a mere pack of caricatures, are so conscienceless and ruthless that they defy plausibility and once again come off as more menacing than even Pennywise.Like I said I saw this in IMAX. I didn't really want to see it in IMAX but that just happened to be what was playing at the time of day I was available. And let me tell you it was LOUD. Way too loud. Too loud for a horror film. A scary horror film has to have some subtly. This thing was just a constant barrage of obnoxious music you'd expect from Indiana Jones not a film about a killer clown, people screaming, Pennywise screeching, the bullies yelling. Never in this film are you given a chance to relax, which makes the jumps scares, and that's pretty much all the scares there are here, much less effective.In my opinion the kids couldn't act that well. Often times they seemed to be reciting lines. All the cute one liners that were suppose to be funny fell flat. It was very formulaic. I didn't understand why the female lead was being bullied. She's borderline gorgeous and smart and witty but for some reason the homely dumb girls pick on her. It just didn't work for me. And there were a lot of other things that were completely implausible. Early in the film the short chubby kid gets a really major wound (trying not to spoil things) on his gut, but in the next scene he's swimming in a quarry. Lol. What? As for Pennywise, was Bill Skarsgard even there? Most of the clown scenes were CGI, and the ones that weren't, I mean he's so heavily made up in costume and white face did it really matter who was behind there? And without fail, just when he was getting creepy, suddenly there'd be a big bang of music and the CGI clown would scream and come rushing at lighting speed at whoever was the victim at the time. This happened so many times it stopped being scary because we expected it. And we never get to know why Pennywise is even haunting these kids. We knew why Freddy Krugar haunted kids. Their parents burned him to death for being a child molester. But what's Pennywise's motivation. Some vague things are mentioned about the history of the town but it's never revealed why this ghost clown has come back to haunt the kids of Derry. Didn't make sense.And the movie is way too long. Way too long. It's a movie about a killer clown, for crying out loud, not Schindler's List. I was yawning by the end and could barely sit through yet another scene where the kids are all bonding together. These are my thoughts. I could go on or edit this thing to make a much finer review but there's already over 200 reviews here for this film so this will be all the time I'll invest in it.I give it six stars.",It
222,hellholehorror,Harrowing,9,16 December 2018,"Harrowing! This is the best horror movie for a long time. It is relentlessly attacking your nerves with an onslaught of creepy imagery, supernatural moments, gore and a funking clown that will not leave you alone. There is one sequence that I will never forget. I went all out with massive TV, UHD HDR, headphones in the late night and the experience did not disappoint. I genuinely jumped out of my skin numerous times. The story, the build-up, every scene, almost every moment it gripping. The scares are perfectly choreographed. I cannot wait to see what they do with the sequel.",It
223,donaldricco,Who done IT?,8,17 January 2018,"The clown. The red balloon. The sewers. All horrible! The book scared me, the mini-series scared me, and this scared me! But with Pennywise, an evil, killer clown, how couldn't you be scared? Even knowing what was going to happen, the first 10 minutes still freaked me out! As a fan of the novel, I found it interesting that only the kids story was told in this movie, and I'm assuming the adult story will be in part 2. I don't know if I'm a fan of this division, but this movie still worked on it's own. I'm definitely on board for the next one! p.s. - not to be mean, but I think Tim Curry was the better Pennywise!",It
224,blackmamba99971,Creative retro memory,10,10 September 2017,"For a long time there have been renditions to some of the most famous authors of all time. Stephen King's 'IT'... this movie removes boundaries in the vein of horror, which has now become a cult favourite. IT or Pennywise comes to life again on the silver screen as the irreverent childish clown who uses his ability to instill fear among children, and their nightmares. Only once in twenty seven years does Pennywise show his ugly face to feast on only one emotion to keep its life force intact... Fear.Yet for seven kids who band together they must overcome their fears of both the supernatural, and life itself in order to stop the murderous rampages of IT's hunger. Each with their own stamps of emotional strife in either family life, or among the town of Derry's populace such as school, or simply enemy forces that wander the streets providing delinquent instances that test each of the groups' mettle.I find this movie one of King's better adaptations for its rich horror, and stark realism to Pennywises' dark antics to gain children's favour through so called innocent mischief, which leads to their heinous deaths at the hands of IT. Incredible dark scenes with a sense of nightmarish figures that pop out from every shadow reinforcing dread and misery. The music was top notch using mid-eighties pop that blended well for the time period along with the clothes as well as coming out of the seventies haircuts.Nearly every segment held surprises after surprises coming together for the final showdown between Pennywise and the tormented teens who wanted nothing more than to have a quiet summer vacation in the small little town of Derry. The complete sense that although horror comes in many forms, says that not all sleep with both eyes shut. IT wanted more victims using his fear inducing talents but found that just a small handful of kids decided that fear was just another fad, then tossed it aside like trash, which is why they succeeded in defeating Pennywise. Older aged kids is his weakness.Adaptation to the nether realms of darkness for teenagers is like going to a concert with all of the trimmings. Nothing surprised them anymore, and that was why IT slithered back into the pit to have his long twenty seven year sleep. Excellent cast, great acting, wonderful location which helped to mystify King's tale even further and last but not least... wonderful detail to Pennywises' features through transformation. Heart pounding action with a dose of sheer panic inducing scenes to leave the king fans very satisfied walking home in the dark. Sadly enough although The Dark Tower was also released this year, it did not fare well with the fans. The movie was too short. An hour too short in fact, which did not help with the character development. If it is to be redone... it would be a good idea to have one out of three top directors to film such a rich, and detailed story. Such as Peter Jackson, or James Cameron, or... J.J Abrams.",It
225,stevenrotherforth,This movies title had a couple of letters missing,5,12 June 2019,"ITI think this movie's title had a couple of letters missing!
Despite this film's hype I found IT to be a tedious bore.
Apart from the promising opening this film soon descended into Hollywood horror movie cliches.
Jump scares that don't make you jump and a clown villain that just wasn't very scary.
The young cast do what they can to try and recreate a Goonies/Stand by me vibe but their best efforts can not elevate this lacklustre horror reboot.
In this remake based on Stephen King's novel.
A group of bullied kids band together to try and stop a demonic clown.
Absurd as this may sound Pennywise the clown has become somewhat of a pop culture icon.
In the original screen adaptation Tim Curry played the role. Here Bill Skarsgard fills the Clown's shoes.
Make up and prosthetic effects are admirable and Skarsgard is creepy but only frightening if you are ten years old.
IT is let down by some dodgy CGI and a plot that doesn't flow.
This movie looks likes a mashup of every horror classic from the 80's.
Speaking of such decade.
The producers of IT have tried to cash in on the recent rise in interest of all things 80's.
Even as far as to go as casting Fin Wolfhard from Stranger Things.
Unlike that show IT lacks its own originality.
Ok I understand that this movie is a remake but at least trying to do something fresh with the material would have been nice.
Don't get me wrong I don't hate this movie but I did find it to be instantly forgettable and rather difficult to sit through.",It
226,LloydBayer,Cinema has a new and ferocious monster yet It is much more than a just a horror film.,8,10 September 2017,"What is it about clowns that many people find creepy? Because they hardly ever talk and are full of nasty tricks? Or perhaps because they are supposed to be funny yet that perpetual smile seems to suggest that an evil plan is being hatched. If you are one of those people who are uncomfortable around clowns, then brace yourself for It, a well-made horror film based on a classic story from none other than the 'Master of the Macabre' – Stephen King.As a horror writer, many of King's novels have found its way to the big screen, of which The Shining and Misery are still considered horror film classics, while The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile received multiple Academy Award nominations even though these are not horror films. From personal experience, I still consider Salem's Lot his most terrifying film adaptation. Both the book and the 1979 film adaptation resulted in many sleepless nights. That said, when King's books do well in cinema, it is almost always due to the director and production quality of the film being adapted (The Shining + Stanley Kubrick = classic). The same is also true when his books flop as films, which was very unfortunate for Pet Sematary and Cujo, as these are both terrifying books to read. Published in 1986 and adapted into a two- part TV series in 1990, It was generally well received but mainly due to actor Tim Curry's praiseworthy performance as Pennywise the clown. Now exactly 27 years later, It gets a shiny new remake for the big screen and it works, but not just as a horror film.The number 27 has significance in the story. You'll know why when you watch the film, but going by the book, the film adaptation is only half the story. Directed by Andrés Muschietti (whose previous effort was the lukewarm horror film Mama), the film opens with a terrifying prelude that introduces us to Pennywise, the central and evil antagonist often seen in the form of a clown. This is the scariest part of the film owing to watertight tension and an atmosphere thick with dread. But by the time we get to the end, Muschietti has traded some of that atmosphere for several jump scares. Thanks to well-engineered sound effects, these are not cheap or clichéd but nowhere near that dose of terror we were served at the beginning of the film.While It works as a horror film, it really shines as a coming of age film amped up with a strong retro vibe. As an 80s kid watching this film, I was latched on with boyish nostalgia. Outside Muschietti's method of inducing fear, what is done right is capturing the mindset of pre-teen kids from a small town in Maine (many of King's books are about towns in Maine). From that perspective, this film stays true to the book by bringing back a great sense of adventure, mystery, fantasy, puppy love, peer pressure, and then heart-break and even terror. Together all seven of them are great, but it is when these kids are on their own or isolated from the rest that the horror mechanisms in the film goes to work. It is also where imagination conjures the most bone-chilling images and sounds that only a kid that age can manifest. Pennywise, remarkably done by Bill Skarsgård, is one of those images and the very definition of a ferocious monster in modern cinema. And as far as clowns go, something tells me there could be a huge drop in kids' birthday parties at McDonald's. Just saying.",It
227,sunznc,So dull I was falling asleep.,1,24 September 2017,"1 star. Awful. Why? They stripped it of all it's mystery and instead made a bombastic movie that is NOT interesting, not engrossing, not scary. It is DULL! I was falling asleep during the dialog. The characters aren't interesting and the actors aren't interesting. The only pleasant thing about the entire film is the scenery.This is a screeching, loud, overdone film that lacks any fascination. The first film with Tim Curry draws you in and doesn't let go until the spider comes out of the cave. Then, it loses it's audience. This film loses it's audience in the first 10 minutes and they are gone, not to be drawn back in. People were looking at their watches. Just go get the original on DVD or re-read the book. This is BAD.",It

The setting for the flash backs to kids is set 3 years after the book was actually wrote, setting this up for a failure from the start!!! You don't have to make it modern times to be updated as a film!!! Also on the timeline, the flashbacks are 1989 in this movie making the present day be 2019 & this movie came out in 2017!!!

229,skybrick736,It (9/10),9,21 October 2017,"A basic common fear among many people on the level of spiders and tall heights is creepy clowns. Stephen King's second adaptation of It, really illuminated that fact by becoming one of the top five highest grossing films in 2017. It became one of the most successful horror, let alone R rated movies of all time. Whether it's the concept of creepy clowns, the climate of what people feel in 2017's society, or the fandom of Finn Wolfhard, it is unbelievably hard to fathom that an old Stephen King horror adaptation would kill the box office this hard. However, the simplest answers are usually the right answers, It, really is that great of a movie.The film's strength lies within its young cast that really played their roles to a tee, bouncing lines off each other naturally. The character's stories are also key, building great character development in the first half of the film really made the viewers attached to their hero's when they came face to face with Pennywise. The Pennywise makeup was top-notch and introduced beautifully with a classic scene right in the beginning. The only gripe of It would be that too much CGI was used for some of Pennywise's scenes. Most importantly, the film's lasting message, that conquering fears gives people will power, was so strong it was really inspiring in a way. The second adaptation of It, shocked everyone, scared everyone and will be remembered as being one of the best horror films of this decade.",It
230,Lebowskidoo,Exceptional Adaptation,10,4 August 2019,"I remember it took me the entire summer of '87 to read Stephen King's chunky novel. It seemed equal parts Stand By Me and Dean Koontz's Phantoms to me at the time. The TV mini-series was very well done and seemed to go on to become iconic. So, when a theatrical remake was announced, I was wary. Turns out I had no reason to be.This movie best encapsulates Stephen King's storytelling, childhood and fear itself. It's just beautiful. One of the greatest adaptations of his novels, ever.Pennywise is a truly terrifying cinematic monster for the ages. I've seen way too many horror movies in my lifetime, so a lot of things bounce off me, movie wise. But just as King always intended, Pennywise is horrifying, creeps into your brain and under your skin to show you your worst fears in the most sinister ways. This story has been copied many times in many ways over the years, but here is the unfiltered original. The filmmakers really have done a great job.",It

232,EthanBJones_03,Highly Recommended,9,15 October 2017,"'IT' - 2017Directed by Andy MuschettiStarring ​Bill Skarsgård, Jader Liebherer and Sophia LillisPlot Overview: ​Seven young outcasts in Derry, Maine, are about to face their worst nightmare -- an ancient, shape-shifting evil that emerges from the sewer every 27 years to prey on the town's children. Banding together over the course of one horrifying summer, the friends must overcome their own personal fears to battle the murderous, bloodthirsty clown known as Pennywise.Right, let me start of by saying that.... wait for it... THIS MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY! People are complaining that the film is bad because its funny. Oh, you don't think the JOKES were designed to make you laugh? That is the point of the jokes! The humour is what MAKES this movie so compelling. I've watched this film twice. Once with my sister and the other with some friends. And I loved it just as much both times. It's not gonna win any Oscars or change cinema forever but it's a fun, inventive comedic-horror movie with a couple effective scares and creepy scenes. What more do you actually want? Oh you do want more? Let me break it down why I love this movie so much.Firstly, the impeccable cast. Every single member of the Loser's Club was cast to perfection and each child actor provides an adult- actor level of quality. I would normally condense them into one statement to converse space but each and everyone of them deserves their own praise. Jaeden Liebherer was absolutely fantastic as Bill Denborough. He sold the dark, troubled child in search of his younger sibling and provides an excellent leader for The Loser's Club. Jeremy Ray Taylor was excellent as Ben Hanscom. He was so likable and sells both the emotional and funny scenes to perfection. ​Sophia Lillis was phenomenal as Beverly Marsh. She struck a spectacular balance in performance between herself with the other Losers and herself not with them. Finn Wolfhard(greatest name ever btw) was excellent as Ritchie and was easily my favourite character in the film. He was so witty and funny and strangely likable. He was a primary source of comedy and he did is excellently. Jack Dylan Grazer was also excellent as Eddie Kasbrack. I really should have more to say about him but I don't really know what to say. Wyatt Olef and Chosen Jacobs were both good as Stan and Mike respectively but I 100% need more from their characters in the sequel. They weren't utilised at all and they may as well have not even been there.Then there is the man of the hour: Pennywise. ​Bill Skarsgård is both funny and terrifying. I understand that a lot of people won't find his portrayal of Pennywise to be all that frightening but I think he nails both aspects of the Clown perfectly. He was very funny when he needed to be and could be genuinely creepy and scary when he needed to be. I highly commend the man's performance.I love the story of this movie. I love the story and the premise. It is such a fantastic idea. A clown that preys on your fears and eats kids? That is a horrifying concept but truly an excellent one. The story surrounding that was also great. You could argue that there isn't really much of a story, more of a knitted together collection of just barely connected scenes, and I understand where you would be coming from. That said, I personally think the story is about the underdogs overcoming their fears and fighting back against oppression. And that is a pretty excellent story in my opinion. Then there are the visuals. It is a gorgeous movie and the cinematography and editing and stunning. I absolutely love the way this movie was shot, edited, lit and directed. It looks absolutely fantastic and is truly a treat for the eyes.I am gonna defend an aspect of this movie that gets CONSTANTLY picked apart: the tone. 'It' is one part horror movie and one part comedy. The horror aspect is generally well done and has a lot of great buildup and some genuinely intense sequences. The comedy side is also excellently done and is pretty consistently in making the audience laugh. So what is wrong with it? Please explain to me what is wrong with the tone. Both sides of the movie work very well and I honestly think that Muschetti has blended the two together very well. I honestly think people are just complaining for the sake of complaining because there isn't much wrong with the tone. Is it irregular? Of course it is. But would you rather they try something new or stick to what they know. I don't know about you but I want innovation in my movies.As for flaws, I can name one main one. The CGI wasn't the best. Obviously it looked decent occasionally but, for the overwhelming majority of effects, it looked cheap and lazy and fake. I rarely believed something was really there. I wish more time could have gone into making it look more realistic.In conclusion, I loved this movie. It's fun, it's goofy and can be at times genuinely creepy and tense. It is an excellent movie so, even though I don't think it's the second coming of Christ, I can highly recommend 'It'. I'll rate 'It' 9 'Red Balloons' out of 10!",It
233,ericrnolan,"A short review of""It"" (2017)",9,17 September 2017,"""It"" (2017) succeeds on a number of levels; it's both an excellent horror movie in its own right and a faithful adaptation of Stephen King's incredible 1986 novel. It's rate it a 9 out of 10.The movie works so well because it captures the book's key juxtaposition of sweetness with horror. There is a gentle innocence about the story's circle of adolescent protagonists, who remain kind and good in King's story — despite facing an incredibly powerful monster while being alienated by adults who are shifty, feckless, or monstrous themselves. The screenwriters understand that juxtaposition, and successfully bring it to the screen. The kids here feel real, three-dimensional, quirky and damned likable. (My favorite was Eddie, the wisecracking hypochondriac, played by Jack Dylan Grazer.) It adds great tension to the story.And the monster itself is truly terrific, thanks to an inspired, menacing portrayal by Bill Skarsgard and startling visual direction that nicely summons summons both coulrophobia and grotesque (yet sometimes subtle) body horror.The film might suffer just a little from something its makers couldn't avoid — so many of its basic story elements are overly familiar tropes. King wrote his novel more than 30 years ago. ""Scary"" clowns are now omnipresent in popular culture. (It's something I'll never understand. Clowns are mysteriously and positively irritating to me. They're a lot like David Tennant before ""Jessica Jones."") We've also seen more than a few alienated adolescents, period settings and shape-shifting monsters that impersonate our worst fears, in everything form ""The X-Files"" to ""Stranger Things"" to  other Stephen King adaptations. We don't want the filmmakers to neglect these key story components. That would ruin the movie. But they feel like overly common tropes in 2017.Still, this was a great fright flick.

234,Mike_Devine,'It' is more than your average horror film,7,1 July 2018,"Among the entries in the Stephen King library, few stories have frightened audiences the way 1990's made-for-TV movie 'It.' Flash forward 17 years, and Pennywise the clown has made an impact on a new generation in Andy Muschietti's take on the classic coming of age tale.The reason 'It' works so well is because it's not just about chocking up cheap scares for the sake of being scary. The way the story evolves really helps us get to understand the young crew from Derry, Maine, who cross paths with the demonic clown (played by Bill Skarsgard). We get to see the rapport between the friends, who bond through experiences with being bullied, trying to enjoy their summer and coping with disappearances of their peers without explanation. Of course, once everyone begins to understand what's happening, thanks to run ins with Pennywise and strain visions, their bond becomes stronger and is put to the test.A reason why 'It' succeeds is because it is pretty evenly balanced. It's a dramatic horror film rather than a generic, standard horror film. There are some scenes that are actually pretty funny due to the fact that the main stars are all adolescents - it would be odd if the film took itself too seriously. It's also not dry or boring. As a result of the pacing, there is enough taking place onscreen to keep the audience engaged. From an acting standpoint, it's hard to overlook the performance Skarsgard gives. He brings out the cheeky yet sinister demeanor in a way that you'd expect a pro like Jim Carrey to be able to do, and his presence (or implied presence) is the main driver of events in the film. Specifically, the opening scene is something that sets the tone for the rest of the film - and will stay with you for days after watching it.Again, 'It' is not just about a killer clown - it's about friendship, acceptance, young love and many other things. 'It' should be appreciated for the way these concepts are captured in an otherwise terrifying story.",It

Stephen King at his very, very best.",9,8 September 2017,"Right.  This is 'Stranger Things: The Nightmare'.Which means it's; 'ET, The Goonies, Stand by Me: The Nightmare.'Not least because it stars Finn Wolfhard.And, if nothing else it has unearthed the preternaturally beautiful Sophia Lillis, as Beverley, who, like Wolfhard, surely has a massive career ahead of her.It is proper scary.Kids fight monsters.  What's not to like?Nothing beats proper scary in my book and few writers create scariness better than Stephen King.  The Shining and Carrie are two of the best horror films ever made and this is his hat-trick.We open in year 27 (1989 with lots of neat historical references) of a 27 year cycle in which mayhem descends on the small town of Derry (in Maine?) and follows a group of Losers; geeks, fatties, stutterers, black kids, scaredycats and a tomboy with attitude (Beverley) who also provides the love interest.The movie starts with stutterer Bill (beautifully played by Jaeden Leiberher) losing his beloved younger brother, Georgie, to a demonic clown who lives in the town's sewers.  It's the start of a series of disappearances amongst children in the town.  And the clown, played superbly by Bill Skarskgard, called Pennywise is out to wreak havoc having been let loose in year 27.The movie has plenty of jumps.  And some of the appearances of Pennywise are frankly terrifying.Despite its length, over two hours, it maintains interest throughout and the story develops brilliantly.  Top marks to director Andy Muschietti who is adept at creating mood, atmosphere and moments of humour.""Who invited Molly Ringwold"" asks Wolfhard in reference to the short red haired Beverley.  It's a laugh out loud moment (and Wolfhard has them all).There's a neat subplot about school bullying (that begins a little clichéd but develops nicely) with a good performance from Nicholas Hamilton as a proper bully, Henry Bowers.But the heart of the movie is dedicated to scaring the 'you know what' out of you.And it succeeds triumphantly.It's a great horror movie.  It really is.",It

It was just not the best movie of the year it was the best movie I have ever seen in the theaters and I just didn't see it once, but twice. By far Bill Skarsgård should win an Oscar for Best actor and the movie itself should win for Best feature film.Parents IT is rated R and when you see Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise you will see why it is just plain out scary.

240,coreyjdenford,It definitely floats,8,8 September 2017,"This review of IT is spoiler free**** (4/5)IT WAS THE year 1986, Benny King's chart topping hit Stand by Me had stepped back into the charts as the film as soon as the film, yet another Stephen King adaptation (adapted from The Body) was released. King had started writing his next novel the seminal 1,136 page novel IT where a small town in Maine has had a spate of child disappearances from a demon called Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Which back in 1990 was adapted into a TV mini series, when the aptly insane British actor Tim Curry played Pennywise in a terrifying, show stopping performance. And after years of waiting King Fanatics are yet again treated to a new adaptation of the novel, from Mama 's director Andy Muschietti. And as the aptly written tagline says it definitely does float.In reference to Stand By Me within the first five minutes after the introduction of the 'loser club' a bunch of kids who constantly get bullied by kids bigger than them, they communicate with banter, they curse and they pick on each other. Perhaps it's a subtle entry to another King adaptation, but it plays a major part to their story, gradually forming a sense of comedy and heart ship between them. There's drama to their story too, the leader of the group Jaeden Lieberher's 13-year-old Bill suffers a loss, his younger brother. His parents have given up. He is insistent on finding his brother he insists that he's missing somewhere. This emotion affects the other members of the group. As they start to explore the town for any evidence, they start to see Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise haunting their inner fears in confident form.Skarsgård is terrifying as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, sporting a clown face, the painted smile which goes above his deep red eyes, dressed in white baggy clothes, a catchy voice and laugh to go with it, essentially he's a friendly figure drawing in an audience at a circus. He can shape shift into the kids' inner fears from a dead child, through a narcissistic father to germs which thanks to the effects team look as real as possible. Like Godzilla or the Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park Pennywise appears in short yet terrifying spouts, which as the film progresses become scarier than the last. And thanks to Skarsgård's heart stopping performance it doesn't get any better than this. The child actors' performances are incredible too; they deal with drama, with fear and with the emotion that comes with it all in spades way beyond their age group. How scary is IT? You're probably asking. This seems to depend on your average horror intake threshold. Seemingly oblivious to any trends or the changes to the genre in recent years - Muschietti, seems to go with the straightforward approach to some of the horror tropes, he opts for the jump scares, the fast whipped camera pans zooming into the terrifying faces and finally the Psycho-esque strings banging and striking harshly at elements of the film. Muschietti's approach is slow; he slowly adds these jump scares each more effective than the last striking the kids' fears one take at a time. This all adds up to the film's final approach in the third act, when Pennywise shows himself for the monster he really is. The group has one final fight to get rid of the threat once and for all. And it all pays off in the end as this is perhaps the best horror film in recent years, it's terrifying, it's spooky and it's darkly entertaining as the new Pennywise may just be the best horror demon EVERVERDICT A potent, bold, and terrifying horror story which solidly manages to deal with the collection of scary, hallucinatory, ludicrous, nightmarish images from King's novel. And may just be the best King adaptation in recent years.",It
241,baunacholi-86159,A modern classic,8,27 September 2019,"IT - if u hear this word and are a bit at least into horror or suspense you know what to expect. A novel, a coming of age masterpiece. Movie adaptions are hard to match against a book like that.
The 1st 10 min are probably the best part of the complete movie. It's full of tension, atmosphere and a terrifying and haunting villain appearance. Setting, music and the feeling something awful is happening ...and than the teeth...
After this opening sequence IT becomes for my taste a bit too polished, to crisp. Whereas a more subtle and sinister atmosphere would fit better Derry's dark history. I would have loved to get more of this notion. The cold side of a cursed town and his population. Also quite a few so called funny or melodramatic scenes are not helping the overall flow and tension of the story. This said, IT definitely has it's very dark almost disturbing moments where it becomes again more raw and unexpected.
Overall an entertaining movie with several highs and some minor flaws but in general definitely worth the 2,5 hrs!",It

IT is no exception, and this latest reincarnation boasts excellent performances all around. (One of the more horrifying aspects of the Pennywise personification- that's only very subtly touched on in the movie- is the influence of Real World killer clown, John Wayne Gacy.) (Here in Crack Town, we had an old man nicknamed ""Snake"" and his wife who were both pedophiles. They were caught a number of times, but never went to trial ""to spare the children."" When the couple left the neighborhood, the kids they'd assaulted began to sexually assault even younger kids, culminating in the kidnapping of two five-year-olds by a young teen. Once again, the local ""authorities"" refused to prosecute. And you thought ""Derry"" was a scary place...)

When I finally saw it I was stunned, at how great the child actors are, how engaging every scene is, and how fresh everything felt.There are many freaky and creative scary situations which I really liked. Even a little nod to Five Nights at Freddys I picked in one particular jumpscare sound. You'd think this movie will rehash some cliché scary spooks and have terrible child actors like any other movie, mixed with the typical Hollywood ""just gotta send a political message"" garbage but no - this is the first film in years that I can recommend. It's 100% clean of Hollywood garbage.The only thing that threw me off is a smirk one of the kids seem to do out of character in one of the intense scenes. It happened for a fraction of a second but was enough to ruin the otherwise flawless pace and realistim of the movie.Obviously we have to mention the shockingly young actor who played the clown (my age) - he did such an amazing job at not being a cliché, I loved the performance. So much that I want to see more of it.Basically, best movie to come out in many years.",It
244,eagandersongil,The hybrid terror,8,14 September 2017,"A mixture of Count S. King and Goonies, coupled with an exploration of fear, ""It- The Thing"", plus a film inspired by the literary work of Stephen King has set out to be several things, a horror film, suspense , adventure, comedy, romance and manages to be a little of each, in a convincing and well elaborated way, besides touching on subjects like abuse, friendship, fear, puberty, etc. With a well- crafted script, the director Andy Muschietti develops 7 protagonists, who are all very well worked and deep, some more than the others, but the script develops their personalities through dialogues, interactions and familiar coexistence, besides of each young person an anguish present there, anguish that develops through their fears, unlike most of King's books, where the supernatural takes time to appear, not here, we already have an impact in the first scene, and then it becomes and a hybrid terror is built, capable of making the viewer scream in one scene and laugh in another. The film touches on many points and delves into a few, but even so, something is explored, such as loneliness, loss, protectionism, puberty, adulthood and responsibilities, self- confidence, and these are the 7 fears of our 7 protagonists, who need to break their fears to grow and Pennywise is more than the embodiment of their fears, it is metaphorically a rite of passage for these children, but in a literal and visceral way, some subplots are treated with focus in abuse, many of them already had their ""Pennywise"" in the house, who were supposed to kill the clown, they had to get rid of the one that tormented him in their home, and the abuses dealt with are sexual and of authority. The film has a good technique, where the main highlights are the mixing and editing of sound, these two elements are great, besides the good portrayal of the 80s, with an almost clear photograph, and the good use of the tracks, although sometimes the film does not know very well which way to go, sometimes we have the use of music to make up the scare, sometimes not, sometimes we have dry cuts, sometimes no, we do not have a linearity, the director uses the camera very well, mainly in the footsteps in Pennywise, always with the divided look between the character and the viewer, in general the technique is good and leaves a hot rhythm. Bill Skarsgård is amazing as Pennywise, he makes a contained smile that passes a pure and full feeling that complete horror, beyond his look that divides the fourth wall, Bill really is completely delivered to the role, outside it, all the children of the cast are very well, with a highlight for Finn Wolfhard, who again proves to be a good actor, in addition to a beautiful comic relief. Andy Muschietti is a new director, this is his second work directing the film, the first is the weak ""Mama"", but here, the director orders very well to adapt with some vehemence and quality a work of the Master Stephen King, which is not always easy to do. ""It's the thing"" has its charm and charisma, it scares and amuses, and it's a movie with a scent, taste and flavor of Stephen King, and in an increasingly mature cinema of the same horror films, IT is the different thing, even having some problems, such as his third act or the unnecessary replays of scares, but nonetheless, it's a great movie because it's complete.",It
245,Ramascreen,"Take the boat, Georgie!",10,5 September 2017,"The brand new #ITMovie scared the heck out of me and I don't throw that around loosely because just when you thought that ""Annabelle: Creation"" may have set the bar for this year, bam! ""IT"" comes along and smashes that bar into pieces. Wow! This is one incredible horror film, everybody involved should get a congratulatory pat on the back, definitely a huge upgrade from the '90s miniseries. This is best Stephen king adaptation yet.Directed by Andy Muschietti, based on Stephen King's timeless novel of the same name, IT is set around the mysterious disappearance of children in Derry Maine, when a group of young kids will have to come face their biggest fears and square off against an eternal evil clown named Pennywise who comes around every 27 years to repeat his reign of terror. It's no secret and it's not really a spoiler that New Line and the filmmakers of this new version have planned to re-imagine this story into two installments, with the first focusing on the children and then chapter two will be about their grown up selves once again battling Pennywise. So with this first chapter, I think the timing of its arrival couldn't be more perfect especially with last year's debut of the hugely popular series, ""Stranger Things"" that brings up '80s childhood nostalgia while presenting mystery at the same time, ""IT"" offers you that same vein and I think that's OK because we haven't gotten to the point where it's played out so for the time being you're going to love that aspect about ""IT."" There's definitely a ""Stand By Me"" vibe to it as well, and the whole thing does feel episodic, at one point while screening it I didn't want it to end, it felt like I was binge-watching, it was so cool. Kudos to all the young actors featured in this film, they really hold their own and each of their characters' distinct personalities stand out. Their backstories and their process of slowly but surely coming together as some sort of a team is both honest and engaging. Now, if you've ever read Stephen King's book, ""IT,"" you'd recall that it is a super duper thick book. You can use it as a stool to stand on for when you need to change that lightbulb. But the point is, I think the screenwriters of this new film did well in condensing the story to just the right amount of time that contains just the right mix of kids camaraderie and the horror fest that is Pennywise. And if you've watched the '90s miniseries, you'd recall how much that version held back plus the low quality practical effects that they had at the time. Well, I'm happy to tell you that this new ""IT"" doesn't hold back, this is Pennywise unleashed, it's practically proud of being R-rated, which is great because it allows for the scary parts to be really really scary and not second-guessing or pandering. And if you have never liked clowns before, you're going to hate clowns even more because Bill Skarsgard's performance as the new Pennywise will haunt your dreams for the next few weeks after you've watched this movie. What I appreciate about Skarsgard is that he doesn't try too hard to emulate or imitate or channel Tim Curry, Skarsgard does his own take of creepy. And because Pennywise is pretty much invincible to a certain extent, you'll see him pop up in the most unlikeliest of places meaning when you least expect him, that's when he'll scare you to your core so brace yourselves for surprises around every corner. Another reason why the timing of this movie's arrival could not be more perfect is because today's visual effects compliment Pennywise's limitless abilities and so director Andy Muschietti and his crew have the creative freedom to not only realize some of the scare points in the book but they managed to also go beyond that. ""IT"" goes for massive, it goes for bold, it goes for bloody, not a single boring minute, it goes for the ""Goonies"" fan in all of us. You will laugh, you will scream, you will have nightmares, hands down one of the best horror movies ever made. -- Rama's Screen --",It
246,jamiedarlow-37510,A modern horror classic!,10,27 October 2021,"Genuinely spooky and expertly told, this adaptation of Stephen King's iconic novel is truly spectacular. This is my third time watching upon writing this review and I can safely say that it still shocks and entertains me to this day. Director Andy Muschietti (Mama) had a strong connection to King's story, in particular through the central group at the heart of the story; in his own words '... developing the film, I was retrieving my emotional experience reading the book. I wanted to communicate the feeling of intimacy and innocence of the Losers.' His goal was very much achieved and then some! The bullying the group encounter along their journey is severely repulsive, captured perfectly on screen and making us root even more for the already immensely likeable characters, played to utter brilliance by the terrific cast.Then, there's the genius casting of Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the Clown... the bodily and vocal contortions are creepy as sin and it's an extremely memorable performance. Considering there's only 4 minutes of actual dialogue from the character throughout the movie, his presence is astounding. The visuals effects used to project Pennywise's disturbing visions upon the children are masterful, contributing to a powerful cinematic experience. Taking inspiration from iconic movie psychopaths like The Joker, Jack Torrance and Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange, Skarsgard has stated '... I have to scare a whole generation. My take was that Pennywise functions very simply... he's animalistic and instinctive.'With absolutely beautiful character work, gorgeous cinematography by Chung-hoon Chung (Oldboy, Stoker), captivating music score by Benjamin Wallfisch (The Invisible Man) and just stunning work from the entire cast and crew, IT is a gem to be cherished and remembered.",It

248,DeBBss,"Not Scary, But A Good Thriller...",8,15 February 2018,"In my opinion, I think that IT was overrated, People saying it was the scariest movie of the year, but to me it wasn't scary at all. IT was a good movie overall, but it lacked the scare. Honestly, I didn't really mind that I wasn't scared, because everything else was done so well. Everything about IT was perfect, the acting was on point, the characters are interesting, and the subplots were well done. Since there was so much characters, not all could have the same amount of attention as other characters, and I think there was a good balance between how much screen time the characters got.Story: 10/10The story was well done, I was never confused or lost in the story. I love how I'm constantly learning about Pennywise and the other characters throughout the movie, even at the end. The script was also amazing, some movies struggle to make a young character believable through the dialog, but the writers were on point, and they did an excellent job making the characters likable. The story is about an evil clown feeding off of kids' fears by shapeshifting into their biggest fear. A group of kids later realize what's going on and band together, calling themselves ""The Losers Club"". The idea is creative and unique, and only Steven King can make up something like this. There's also a lot of foreshadowing in IT, one of the quotes ""You'll float too"" is genius. The idea of ""You'll float too"" is that the kids who got caught by Pennywise float in the air in Pennywise's secret layer. IT is a long movie, with a 2:15 hour run time. I really can't blame the movie for being so long because of all the things they had to include, but I felt like it was too short. I wanted to see a little more from the forgotten Characters' subplots. Overall, the story is very strong, and it's creative and interesting.Characters: 9/10I loved all the performances from all of the actors. Every actor played their role great, and I was surprised how well they acted. Each character had their own fear, some of the fears weren't explained much, like the painting lady, but I could see why she was scary. Some of the fears were explained very well and even emotionally, like Mike's fear, which was about his death of his parents. The antagonist, Pennywise was strong and creepy. I wasn't scared of Pennywise, but his creepy presence and his mysterious past truly makes him a good villain. Bill Skarsgård did a fantastic job as Pennywise, he made the character Pennywise so psychotic and unpredictable, and that's why I think he did a better job as Pennywise than Tim Curry. Obviously, some characters were weak, like Stanley who was afraid of the painting lady. If the movie spent just a little more time on the weaker characters, than then the movie would be a perfect 10/10.Action: 8/10As I said before, I don't think IT was scary. At some points in the movie, there was comedy, and some people say that it takes away the whole horror aspect, but I don't mind it. Some people even say the CGI was bad, and yes at some scenes the CGI was iffy, but it wasn't too bad. I also liked how Pennywise attacks, he has these rows of teeth that come outward just before he attacks his victim, it adds the whole unpredictable freight to the character. Overall, the horror was weak, nothing really was burned in my memory, like what Alien: Covenant did. I was however, very disappointed of how overrated it was.Overall, IT was a good movie, with an interesting story and believable characters. Although IT didn't go down in my books as a scary movie, it did go down as one of the best remakes ever made. I strongly recommend IT to anyone who hasn't watched it yet. And hopefully chapter two will go down as one of the best sequels ever made.",It

It's set in Derry, Maine in 1989, and kids keep going missing - including Bill (Lieberher)'s brother, Georgie (Scott). Bill and his ""loser"" friends - Richie (Wolfhand), Eddie (Grazer), Stanley (Oleff), Mike (Jacobs) & Ben (Taylor) - go searching for Georgie in their summer break, thinking he might be in the sewers. Of course, we're introduced to Pennywise the clown (Skarsgard) before the titles, so we know what happened to Georgie.If you don't like clowns - this films not going to cure that! However, I didn't find it really frightening, with some jumps (mostly thanks to the score), but not too much that it truly horrific or ultra-creepy. Sure, there's some blood, some teeth, plenty of shadows and things popping up, but it never really felt to me like the kids were in too much danger. What is excellently conveyed is the apathy and ""off""-ness of the adults, meaning it's all up to Bill & the gang to figure out.Ben figures out the ""every 27 years"" connection and Beth (Lillis) gets involved, after they've each encountered their worst fears and Pennywise. The film's a great ode to friendship and sticking together - I just feel like it's done better in 'Stranger Things', which is why it's a shame Wolfhand is in both.

Every single ""scary"" scene is lazy and dull, and brings that awful, millennial, ""you should be scared"" flavour. Pennywise himself has something wrong in his look, I'd say he's cutesy and stupid, not scary. He runs squirming, and that's supposed to be creepy but it's absolutely not, so that it comes out just as an unnecessary and clumsy vfx. The worst thing about Pennywise is that being these scenes so lazily directed, when he unmistakeably fails to catch the kids he just seems totally unharming.The movie starts the wrong way, with Georgie who is unreasonably amused by a clown with a creepy face. Right there, you know that the director will be forcing the scare all the time.""It"" fails to deliver that truly nightmarish atmosphere that was so strong in the book, the eerie deaths and missing kids.Even the real-word dramas and some characters are quite poorly depicted, particularly Bev's abusive father and Eddie.Overall, It ends up more like a kids movie than a horror movie. I'm surprised by the metacritic score.Furthermore, offsetting the year from the fifties to the eighties was a huge mistake. The fifties were much harder on the kids than the eighties, family dramas were probably too, and characters like Bowers would have been much more menacing.Lastly, I really don't understand why they cut the whole 27-years-later setting.

257,deepfrieddodo,Engagingly Creepy,9,2 November 2021,"A brilliant horror with depth throughout, everything involved in IT is great. The acting (from a very young cast) is perfect, visually phenomenal, and genuinely scary (whilst not terrifying); IT is so unsettling from the very start, but still allows the plot the develop and character arcs to blossom.The creepy start is immediate, and from the very first scene the audience should be able to figure out whether or not they will appreciate this film. A fluctuating level of tension throughout, well supported by the soundtrack, there are plenty of jump scares and opportunities to hide behind your hands as things turn graphic and gross.Skarsgård is perfect as Pennywise, being able to match the creepy-horror with the levity of creepy-childlike. The cast in general cannot be faulted, from the 'child' actors leading the story, to the supporting adults creating the environment. Each main character is given a deep arc illustrating their fears and backgrounds, and these interlink well with one another.Long for a horror, but never dragging and building towards a great climax, IT is brilliant.",It
258,SilverOrlov,"""One time shot""",7,2 January 2018,"Interesting story that prove genre horror, but totally absurd behavior of the characters. There is a difference between simple trying to make some little foolish for the maintenance of the plot, and banal stupidity of behavior like ""That kid cut me with a knife but we will not go to police - we will buy some tablets and bandages"".",It
259,kaptenvideo-89875,The best King adaptation of the year (which isn't saying much),6,10 September 2017,"There are different approaches and styles of storytelling but I have always thought that bestselling novelist Stephen King has a good grip over the most effective one of them. He has the image of horror master but his stories offer actually much more than quick thrills. You possibly couldn't churn out up to 1100 page opuses based on just thrills, could you? King's focus is always on careful character and world building because why would one want to just follow a bunch of events if one didn't care about the people in the story and what's happening to them. And he's usually scarily efficient at creating characters that we want to form emotional connections to. I have read most of King's 57 novels by now, and I am often hooked already on the first page, or maybe the second. The careful character and world building doesn't just happen at once, it takes time and room. This is one of the main reasons why most of King's adaptations are not great ones. There is no way to compress hundreds of pages into a screen story lasting about two hours. Take IT"", for example. In an original novel, there's more than 1100 pages. As a movie, it runs 135 minutes, including end credits. There was never gonna be a chance to see more than main events on screen, not to mention Hollywood's nasty way of often taking a famed literary work of fiction and throwing out almost everything but the main plot points and character names. I read IT"" more than ten years ago, so I don't remember it all that well, but the movie version feels... right. They have taken the best of both worlds: sweet nostalgia-tinged coming of age story as a backbone and the horrors served in short intervals aside. Both aspects work well, neither feels fresh but they are effective. Coming of age story resembles 1986's Stand by Me"", one of the most acclaimed King adaptation of all time. Horrors are created the cheap way, that is to say, mostly by editing and sudden creepy music or sound effects. Nothing essentially wrong with that, most horror movies do the same and they still have plenty of fans. I myself have quite tired of this and would have preferred slow and creepy building of suspense – this would have fit more closely with King's original work too – but whatever. The problem me is that there's just too many horror"" moments, after one hour it's starting to feel like a carnival show. One has to be a true horror fan to not feel exhaustion before the end, or possibly reaching the middle of the story. Two-plus hours is a long way to watch somebody attacked over and over again by the same two or three evil creatures. I mean, I like Pennywise and his crew as much as anybody but there's only so much times it feels cool to see some monster suddenly jump out from somewhere and say ""boo"". I was quite curious about how the adaptation would solve"" this famous sex scene from the original novel. There's probably no tasteful way to offer it in mainstream movie, so they have opted to not use it all. Wise choice. King should have left it out in the book, too. So. For a horror movie, IT"" is good enough if overly ready to use the same couple of tricks over and over again. For a movie inspired by King's work, it's also good enough, giving you the simple but clear taste of what the bestselling master is possibly about. For a King adaptation, it's mediocre as most of them, setting the bar too low to start with. So, you just have to go catch it and see whether you'll float too. There's a possibility of part two although it's hard to tell how concrete this is. Probably depends on the box office success. The movie ends the same way as the novel, which means there The young actors in part 1 are good, by the way.",It
260,CountJonnie,"I was never afraid of clowns, until now",8,30 October 2017,"This movie succeeds on more levels than I could imagine. I was a fan of Stephen King, the book version of IT, and the original movie. Stephen King captures the spirit of children, childhood fears and growing up, while Tim Curry's acting did the rest.As a lover of classics, I wasn't happy with a lot of remakes and reboots. Same with IT. But watching the movie changed this. The opening scene immediately reminded us of the gruesome start of the original movie. This also showed that the remake pays its tribute to the original by respecting both the book and the original movie. The first moment you see the clown, is where you'll see how they deviate from the original movie. The clown is scarier, not because Skarsgard adopted Tim Curry's ways, but by inventing his own. For example by using a psychiatric approach and consulting a body contortionist. But also by not shying away from exposing children to violence. Where the original used practical effects, the remake uses some CGI, but never too much or too obvious. So the movie relies on the acting of the clown, and the acting of the Losers club and they do great.The success of the original depended on the amazing chemistry of the kids. Something the older actors were less capable off in the original. But the child actors and Skarsgard stand firm. We hate to admit it, but we were scared a few times during the first 30 inutes, thanks to good, unexpected and original horror moments. A lot is suggested (rape, sex, abuse) but never shown completely so it'll create an eerie atmosphere, effective, relying on your imagination, but never crossing a line. Instead they depend on subtle tricks instead of ""in your face"" horror.Fun fact: We decided to watch the original a week before the remake. I can honestly say that the original is still a great movie, but it didn't pass the test of time. The remake does, with respect to the original, and it will make you hunger for a sequel. But please, not prequel, we heard the rumors and didn't like them.",It
261,WalkdenEntertainment,Watch This And You'll Float Too...,8,10 January 2019,"A group of young friends team up together when they discover a demon is appearing within their town: a demon who has the appearance of a clown. This demon type figure, who introduces himself as ""Pennywise"", begins to hunt for children.For those who are unaware, 'It' is based on a famous Stephen King novel and has already been made into a motion picture film in 1990. I still remember this film adaptation being rented out to many customers on VHS when I worked in my local Video Ezy store as a teen. Back then, the original film was over 3 hours long and required 2 VHS tapes to complete the viewing. To this day, I still remember seeing Pennywise on the front VHS slick (Tim Curry), staring at me while I cleaned and dusted the horror section. And yes, it was creepy!In the year 2017, the famous horror tale returns to the big screen to tell the same story once more. How does 'It' compare to other horror movies today? And not only that, movie goers have been disappointed countless times with remakes and have left cinemas feeling empty. However, surprisingly enough, this is one horror film that dishes up a tasty surprise.The key with this story is the fact there's more than just an evil, haunting clown to make the film scary. I mean sure, Pennywise is ugly and creepy but the other side of the horror element is what these young kids are facing in their daily lives at school, and, even worse, at home. I found the issues the kids were dealing with more disturbing than Pennywise himself. The director does a great job at building tension. The kids were already having a bad time, so by the time the evil clown element is added, the film delivers a pretty full dose of tension, suspense and horror. At no point did this film make me jump out of my seat. But, it did make me feel very uncomfortable at times (more than once). That's clever enough to make to make you want to run away not because you are scared, but because some things here are just messed up mentally.The child actors are fantastic. They are witty, funny and provide great humor when the film calls for it. I give a full shout out of credit to each young actor within this film. The emotion is here and at no point did I feel a performance was weak or soft. As for the clown himself...flawless. Actor Bill Skarsgard has surprised and shocked the world of cinema with his outstanding performance of Pennywise. For those who have a general fear of clowns, his work here is guaranteed to keep you awake at night after viewing. The scenes and introductions that are used to showcase Pennywise were clever, crafty and totally creative. Creative moments included things like using a handful of red balloons to reveal an evil smile on the clown's face and is genius for the horror genre in cinema. The director has also used colour very cleverly through the film to build tension. And trust me, the colour Red is very unique and cool within the film.'It' is a reboot that deliveries a fresh and creative story of pure horror that many fans have been asking for. Without a doubt, the director and cast members have done a fantastic job at creating memorable and dark characters. The film's visuals are also worth mentioning and I cannot wait to demo this film again on a HIFI system (4K disc!). The film's story does fall of the rails once it enters the third act and does struggle with the final wrap up of the film, otherwise, as mentioned, fans will be most pleased with this film as it brings the horror once again to the big screen.8.4/10

263,shobanchittuprolu,IT is more of an adventure film and less of a horror and strongly reminds us of recent Stranger Things.,7,6 October 2017,"IT (2017): While The Conjuring 2 is the most hyped horror film in 2016,IT has the credit as for 2017.Based on Stephen King's 1985 adventure horror novel which was made into a two part TV mini series back in 1990.That explains the hype around IT as all the 90's kids are waiting for Pennywise Clown to bring back their childhood memories of IT.But what about the newbies who never read the book or watched the TV Series?I belong to the mentioned category and watched IT with only vague idea about Pennywise Clown and interesting trailers which shows lot of scary promise.SO How is IT? Plot: When young children in the little town Derry, Maine goes missing a group of seven kids find out that the killer is not a man. The killer is the evil clown Pennywise who can shapeshift into the thing you are most afraid of. The kids, also known as the Losers Club, decide to fight and kill It. But how can you fight something who knows all your biggest fears? My Review: IT's opening scene is really one of the most nail biting scary scene in recent times.There is always a phrase ""What's hiding in Sewer's?"".The same phrase is given a brilliant visual where a kid named Georgie loses his paper boat which goes down the storm drain and he meets Pennywise there and the entire conversation raises the expectations on the movie.But after that scene,the movie completely changes into adventure mood which strongly resembles Netflix's Stranger Things.The entire first half of the movie depends on the children's friendship bonds and the way everyone encounter Pennywise in the form of their worst fears.Even the scenes aren't scary as Muschietti relies too much on your garden-variety jump scares and now-standard special effects, things like ghoulish limbs twisting every which-way and innocent figures shape-shifting into malevolent ones. As always, the horrors you get a close look at are much less terrifying than those that remain unseen.In latter half of the movie,the movie picks pace with continuous thrills in garage,and the spooky house.Pennywise is at its own but scary from during these scenes which promises hell ride once more but again the pace becomes repetitive with not so engaging climax.The interesting part is whenever a TV set is shown in the film,it features a kid program about adventure in sewers.Skarsgård,is quite effective as Pennywise. It helps that he's kinda scary looking even without makeup. But when you put him in that puffy, Elizabethan-style costume and give him that bulbous forehead and glowing, off-centre eyes, his impish smile can really creep you out.The young cast's performances are impressive too.So,IT is more of an adventure film and less of a horror and strongly reminds us of recent Stranger Things.My Rating 6.5/10",It
264,SafReviews,"Good movie, not that scary but still good",8,22 July 2019,"This is a good horror movie, I didn't get scared at all, but there a few times when I cringed. The plot was intriguing, although during the middle it kind of got a bit boring, but after that it got really intriguing and thrilling. One thing I liked about the movie is the good relationship between all the characters which made it very interesting and sometimes funny to watch. I see this movie getting criticised, mostly by the users saying that it wasn't scary enough; I think that's probably because its stars mostly kids and they probably have rules about how intense the horror scenes must be when it involves kids.",It
265,SamJamie,A future horror classic.,10,17 January 2020,"I'm a massive horror fan, always have been and when I first saw this movie I was blown away. The films cast is outstanding, especially for child actors which can be hit or miss. You could see how much effort was put into the film to stay faithful to Stephen Kings source material and I truly think this is his best film adaptation. After watching the I'm sorry, awful, made for TV series I found Pennywise laughable - and I half expected that from this one too, but after the opening sequence with Georgie I knew the film was going to be a home run. I personally can find little I can fault with this film as it's one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time, low ratings I find unjustifiable unless you think just describing a horror film as ""un scary"" somehow makes you different from the majority? Completely forgetting about the other elements that make the film great? I don't know. But I loved it.",It

267,zac-04879,Not Just the Typical Clown Horror Flick,8,9 August 2021,"This monster-clown horror reboot based on the classic Stephen King novel isn't just the simple jump-scares and plain gore played over and over that we usually expect from most horror movies. Instead, It is a superbly entertaining, perfectly-designed and downright terrifying coming-of-age tale. Expect several moments featuring blood and jumps, but they are unexpected and surprisingly add to the amount of tension throughout the film. How freaky and thoroughly horrific the entire film is already labels how skilfully-crafted it is. It is genuine terror for true horror fans!Pennywise the clown, played by the undeniably talented Bill Skarsgård, is the majority of the film's scariness. Skarsgård's expressions, voices and the clown's creepy appearance makes a true horror character. On the other hand is the cast who mastered performing 'the losers club'. There's a surprisingly compelling coming-of-age side of It.It isn't anything like Friday the 13th or A Nightmare on Elm Street, it feels like a nightmare with deep fear. Other than horror is the mild humour, which is loveable, and the stunning effects. The soundtrack is super-unsettling and the plot is engaging.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",It
268,pranayjalvi,'IT' float above an usual horror Script,7,10 September 2017,"IT contains some very effective and well-executed nightmare imagery. While Pennywise (the lead monster) is legitimately terrifying, overall, It is more intense than it is chilling. It's maximalist approach also extends to the movie's pacing. Nearly every scene builds to some kind of climactic jump scare—not just the appearance of Pennywise, but such alternative horrors as leprous zombies, menacing wall portraits come to life, and bathroom sinks that spurt fountains of blood. The extended, effects-heavy final sequence, in which the youths descend to Pennywise's dank underground lair to battle both the clown and their own deepest sources of dread, was a very good and emotionally built scene.

But what was great about them, was Tim Curry. As a child I'd close my eyes to sleep and just see Pennywise grinning at me, it was petrifying. This guy, no. Pennywise just isn't scary, I don't know if it's the makeup, the actor, the script or, most likely, a combo of all 3. Such a shame this has turned out to be a tick boxing checklist of a Hollywood movie, everything was too structured and safe. But my main gripe is how the guy got the gig of playing Pennywise, makes me not want to watch the second one, of course I will though, and I'm sure moan about the same things again.",It
272,austin0731,A brilliant new direction for the horror genre,7,12 September 2017,"As someone who is not a massive horror fan this is the type of horror film that I would enjoy and that I wish studios would do more often. It elevates the horror game completely, it shows us that a horror film can be done well and done right and still have a central storyline that is engaging and full of interesting/relatable characters. It really tries to separate itself from the crowd, avoiding common horror tropes like jump scares. This is something that I really liked, it is a very inventive film that does just replace the central 'monster'/threat with a new one making no attempts at character building and actually telling a coherent story. The balance of horror and story telling was grasped very well as we don't feel too expositional or a sense of pointlessness.It has a wonderful cast of characters, all the child actors did great at portraying children in such a situation. They had great chemistry with each other and gave performances that showed such courage and love that is truly beyond their age. Alexander Skarsgard who played Pennywise also captured this character very well, from the way that his eyes pointed at different directions(one directly at the audience), his speech pattern and movement were all done impeccably. It also tackles a few central themes very well, the themes of fear, bullying, small town ugliness and a coming of age story. The fear element was done very well, the way that It can morph into the physical appearance of one's fear gave lots of space to explore fear and specifically what children fear. For example whenever Bill felt afraid we see rain or water, relating to his greatest fear of losing his brother. Or in Beverly, where the theme of blood can be seen, relating to her fear of maturity and sexual impulses. These subtle details were dropped in very well and ties in perfectly with the sense of fear that the story tries to explore.Also, there is a very interesting way in which It depicts the adults in this small town, the movie shows us the most grotesque angles of humanity. This may be another way of depicting how children view adults as monsters and fear adults, but it may also be tieing in with the idea that the small town feel is just a mask for grotesque humanity. The way that the adults carry out disgustingly immoral acts and simply turn a blind eye to all that is happening in the town are just a few examples of this. Overall, It was a great film that reminded me a lot of several mature movies/TV shows about children. Stuff like Goonies and Stranger Things just to name a couple. If this film must be criticised I think it is with the lack of development in Pennywise's character, even though this could be to preserve a sense of mystery and may be resolved in the second film. Also the middle area of the film verges on being slightly repetitive with the scenes of each child being attacked by Pennywise, but these really are just minor, personal complaints",It
273,FallenEye,It Was Good.,7,31 October 2021,"I enjoyed It thoroughly, but I'm quite curious as to how Chapter Two can achieve and maintain being scary when considering what was necessary for the children to accomplish for them to be able to defeat ""It.""Though I enjoyed this movie, I did feel that it perhaps ran longer than it needed to, or maybe it didn't quite use the time as efficiently as it could have, because as fun as it really was, something about it wasn't as satisfying as I would've liked it to be. I understand the point was to focus on the children, but something about just focusing on them, made other parts of the story feel somewhat unattended. And yes, I'm well aware that when it comes to the mystery factor, it is Stephen King's style to leave certain areas of the story to the imagination, but in how Andres Muschietti told this story, the full on focus on the kids didn't feel enough for me.All the kids played their parts very well though, and after watching this movie, I see now why Jack Dylan Grazer was as good as he was in SHAZAM!, and Bill Skarsgard was great at it/It too. The movie overall was quality, and a very good addition to the horror genre, and though I have my gripes about either its length or the use of it, the acting however, as well as their dynamic as a group, and the horror elements were quite the enjoyable spectacle though. 7.3/10.",It
274,rlaine,Fun horror in style of Stranger Things,8,10 September 2018,"I enjoyed watching this. I'm a huge fan of Stranger Things, The Goonies, Stand by Me etc. It's somewhat weird movie as all the main characters are children, but the movie is definitely way too intense for smaller kids. There are some seriously spooky moments as well as very well made fx.Acting is good all the way through, even tho some of the characters are a bit under developed. It's strange considering the movie lasts for over two hours and is definitely long for it's style. It doesn't feel long tho, it entertains very nicely, but you'd think some more substance would fit all that duration. I can't honestly say where all that time went.So the story. I'm puzzled what or who the clown was or what did it represent. What was it's intention? What was this floating thing? Maybe it has something to do with growing up as the clown seemed to manifest when fears often concerning parents and growing up surfaced. The girl was getting her periods and there's all this blood her dad can't see. But not all fears seemed consistent with each other, so I was definitely a bit puzzled. Maybe the sequel wraps the story up.Entertaining and very well made, but not perfect.",It

277,FelipeCarrillo,A diabolically unlaughable clown,6,25 September 2017,"When children of all ages begin to disappear mysteriously in the small and the acerbic town of Derry, a clan of little boys, self- recognized under the pseudonym of The Losers' Club, will have to face their biggest and most remote fears, coming in the form of saffron hair, creepy nose, accused forehead, manipulative eyes and puffy balloons with great amounts of terror. Now, say hello to Pennywise!After Will Poulter dropped out, Bill Skarsgård was the one who seized with propriety and promptness of the star antagonistic role. His Pennywise is rogue, disturbing and dreadful, however, having to keep solid his function of film adaptation, the character relegates his duty to produce fear in order to have a preference for a more fantastic vision, utopias that seriously impair the impact it must have in the genre. Most of the jump-scares coming from Bob Gray are discredited by the perceptible and even crappy CGI saturation, however, ingenuity and originality in the introduction of each of his appearances is laudable and is one of the most remarkable and spooky facts as far as horror is concerned. It's disappointing to testify that despite his performance full of strength and magnetism, he never managed to reach the levels of glory of the opening sequence; Vocal and gestural nuances are impressive and the variations of color tonality in the eyes are to symbolize his persuasive purposes, strengthening and simultaneously portraying the ecstatic and the legendary scene in the sewer, simply a horror classic moment.After the abrupt and disquieting Cary Fukunaga departure, Argentinean Andy Muschietti, one of the greatest exponents representing the Latin American potential within the mecca of cinema, is put behind the cameras impregnating his hoarding touch for horror in every frame, marks revealed by impressive Hollywood debut ""Mama"". It has to be recognized that Muschietti fathoms the ways to conceive and play with the camera in order to set up an in crescendo atmosphere, Besides having a critical eye to conceive beautiful visuals and moving characters, however, the filmmaker loses control of the film at the instant that sets aside the importance and coherence of the story by cheap and ephemeral scares. It's also worth highlighting a homogeneous mixture of genres and original tension sequences, having the ability to revolutionize the ablatives of the audience in the twinkling of an eye. In addition to being the greatest pillar for the movie, he proudly exhibits clear references to today's horror film; to name just one: ""The Conjuring"" universe, with the use of infinite horror tricks, in fact, one scene and one character resemble some particulars of the third installment of Wan's world. Yet in spite of the above, it presents great scope flaws as inconsistencies in the script or perceptive licenses in the editing room that takes seriousness and credibility out, namely raccord failures.The under-age actors are, far and away, a mass appeal for the plot, their performances are sparkling and touching in the formation of the audience-characters fundamental link. While the infants will always be much more likely to create a true connection, the young septet achieves a relatively high-performing level, however, many of them do it with sadly stereotyped characters as Finn Wolfhard's big-mouthed comic relief (Richie Tozier), Jeremy Ray Taylor's loving and credulous paunchy (Ben Hanscom) and Chosen Jacobs' tormented boy (Mike Hanlon). But the tradition is broken with tremendously novel characters and zero clichés as the tough-minded and human protagonist Jaeden Lieberher (Bill Denbrough), the incredibly Jewish Wyatt Oleff (Stanley Uris) and, of course, Sophia Lillis' subversive and bad-ass role (Beverly Marsh), who is certainly one of the most fascinating female juvenile performances in recent horror.Written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, of course, on Stephen King's legendary pedestal, the story and script are below average in general terms. They choose to focus attention explicitly on the meetings between the members of the club and the Dancing Clown, giving sub-plots of dramatic weight to the supporting characters, in addition, the self-same main character doesn't get a short mention about his mother and father, it merely presents the moral and emotional conflict with his traumas, comrades and his little brother. A diligent approach to the problem of Bullying and social marginalization becomes apparent, which are accompanied by others that have long been among us, such as child abuse, maternal over-protection, puberty and overcoming from the most terrifying fear to the most harmless; in short, dramatic genre stands out totally. However, the most serious flaw, which is noticeable from the middle of the footage, is heightened in the third act, spilling pure fantasy/fiction that snatches horror category away, alternating situations that clearly come from the wonderful mind of King.Andy Muschietti doesn't disappoint, but sadly he doesn't overwhelm us. His remake/revival of Pennywise tale, which will come in only two installment, provides sufficient amount of fidelity in the visual field, however, the movie clearly fails to show its narrative aspects and horror tools, which fall apart, gradually, because of the sudden ton of fantasy that stifles the last act. For habitual audiences, ""It"" (2017) will endure breaking records thanks to an efficient marketing campaign, global childhood nostalgia, the sincere literary followers, the great doses of suspense and traditional jump-scares, however, for the most draconian and true lovers of the genre and the works of the author, the film doesn't really explore new horizons, besides, suffers from a lack of true horror nuance, slighting it by drama and suspense experiences that leave us a sense of nonconformity and even sadness when we see rolling down the closing credits, due to the abrupt ending of the story that does not have the same horror dimensions as the acts of its evil villain.",It

279,TheVictoriousV,"Well-realized 80's nostalgia and, oh, a few spooks",7,7 April 2019,"As much as I doubt in those who claim to be frightened by the original It mini-series with Tim Curry, it is at least a funny (intentionally or not) and distinct horror piece. When I spotted previews for a newer iteration of Stephen King's 1986 doorstopper, my sense was that they opted to remove that aspect of it as well and make it into a more generic fright night with a clown that actually looks like it wants to be thought of as scary, which somehow makes it less so. As you can imagine, the reviews knocked me for a loop.I was dead wrong, by the way. The clown in this film is not nearly as over-the-top as I was expecting, instead being a rarely-seen, unpredictable force of torment, and the film itself will encapsulate you as much in its moments of horror as in its moments of comedy and wholesomeness. Like most films, it has problems, but many of them are atoned for in other areas.Much like in the soon-returning Netflix series Stranger Things, the 80's nostalgia of It is well-realized, complete with the unfortunate kid characters who see things the adults can't (or won't), and the beautifully true-to-life bonds they share in an age of bicycles and slingshots. This simpler time is where we begin, with a young boy going out in the rain to play with a toy boat, which floats into a sewer where Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgård) reveals himself. Soon after, the boy is gone.The boy's brother Billy (Jaeden Lieberher, now getting to star in a considerably better call-back to the child-life of the Carpenter era than The Book of Henry), refusing to believe that his sibling is simply dead, eventually teams up with his ""Losers Club"" to find Pennywise. The club is designed for the outcasts of Derry High School, Maine and is traditionally meant for male bully victims and nerds, until the troubled and frequently slut-shamed Beverly (Sophia Lillis) asks to join.The remaining members are the overweight Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) who is another new recruit, a germaphobic Jewish boy named Stan (Wyatt Olef), the frequently ill Eddie (Jack Grazer), and the near-sighted Richie (Finn Wolfhard of, what do ya know, Stranger Things). They are also joined by Mike (Chosen Jacobs), an orphan who lives with his grandpa. Pennywise visits each of the kids, crafting visions based on their worst fears and prompting their investigation. On the note of said clown, let us talk about performances.I've never really had a solid opinion on the younger Skarsgård but he does so well in this role that I didn't get the sense that I was watching him to begin with - rather, I was in the presence of Pennywise. And if a more serious and horrifying version of this character must exist, I'm just glad it was this well done and subdued (he appears very little during the film's first hour and even when Skarsgård cranks it up a bit, it is far from ""Leto's Joker"" territory). I dare say, this may be one of the least pointless re-imaginings I've seen in a while.Additionally, the child actors are inordinately gifted, selling the aforementioned relationships as well as the emotions and dialogue. The only truly distracting problem is, as I'm sure you've heard other critics mention, Lieberher's not entirely convincing stutter. Still, they capture that which matters, and the scenes where they form their bonds make a good contrast to the often well-executed moments of horror. We can also see such performers as Javier Botet as a rotting vagrant in one of their Pennywise visions, which is always a fun thing for aficionados of the genre to notice.A big-screen adaptation of It has been in development since 2009, with all sorts of directors ""in talks"". Ultimately, the job went to Andy Muschietti of Mama fame, and the wait seems to have been worth it. Even if it loses some of its effect during later parts, it is still wonderfully old-school without feeling all too tiresome or primitive.The best part about the movie, or rather the best part about its surprising mainstream success, is that it has opened people's eyes to how tired and obnoxious it is when horror films rely on sudden noises and loud pop scares to rile their viewers. It is not innocent when it comes to this, mind you, but its unusual reach (by horror film standards) has seemingly made viewers more aware of the over-reliance. You can be just as effective through atmosphere and psychological torture, guys. Oh and practical gore effects. That's nice too.",It
280,gabriel_sanchez,IT is good,8,6 October 2019,"When you go to watch a movie that is an adaptation from a novel, you basically fall into one of two categories: you're either one who read the novel and wants to see how the novel's adaptation into the cinema will play out, or you're one who didn't read the novel and just want to watch a good movie. I'm the latter.So, basically what plays out is that there's this one evil entity that wakes up once every 27-ish years and, when it does, it goes out hunting its favorite prey: kids. It feeds not only on human flesh, but also on their fears. There are a bunch of kids going missing on the city of Derry, Maine, and people seem to pay little attention towards this; it kinda bothers me. Then again, people seem to be f'ed up on their minds on Derry; pretty much everyone we are introduced in the movie has some sort of psychological disorder, as minimal as it may be.One thing that I'm not so sure is how the Losers' Club realise so fast what is going on. We see It playing tricks on them all and, all of the sudden, they know what they are in for. Once again, I didn't read the novel, so I'm not sure how the story unfolds there, but in the movie, I felt that they were way too smart; soon they know pretty much everything they need to know. I don't know...Acting is great! Everyone is awesome on their expressions and emotions. It even has some comic relief that made me chuckle for a while. Great stuff.It is a good movie.

283,Gresh854,"Not Just Your Typical Horror Movie, It's Much Much More Than Just That",6,9 September 2017,"Yah I grew up with the 90's original TV mini-series, and yes I have read the extensive but unique Stephen King Novel, It. I've been waiting for this movie to be made for quite some time, cause all though I do find the original 1990 It to be a harmless, cheesy horror flick that you can have fun with, I felt as if it did not do too much justice to Stephen King's sufficient story. The 2017 It movie, I can gladly say was one of the biggest surprises of the year. This film not only was a horror film with some good scares, but a emotionally impacting coming of age film, about friendship and lost. No joke, I actually got very emotional towards the end and even throughout the entirety of the film, due to some of the very important themes this film portrays.     What I surprisingly actually liked the most in this film was the relationship between all the kids in this film. Every kid in this film acts so well, and they're all given very entertaining dialogue that was consistently intriguing throughout this entire movie. The film doesn't tone down on kids cursing or anything, these kids will make sex or immature jokes all the time and I enjoyed it so much, because it felt real. To my knowledge I definitely remember most kids at my middle or high school making inappropriate R-Rated jokes a lot so that was real treat. This film also, is actually quite funny. Particularly this kid in the film named Richie played by Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things, was absolutely hilarious. All the kids stand out, they're all given really emotional backgrounds, that are sometimes really disturbing particularly with Sophia Lillis's character that really added to the films levity. I thought it was very unique for this horror movie to develop these characters for most of the run-time of this film, in having to sacrifice scares and what not. Most horror movies these days typically never develop the characters a lot, and rather throw a bunch of scares at random people instead of having the chance to allow the viewer to understand certain people's backgrounds. Thank you, to the screenwriters, noticing that a bundle of character development, would ultimately save this film from going under the radar as your everyday cliché horror flick.As for Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, I thought he was incredible. Probably the most perfect adaption of Pennywise we will ever get. He really killed it. Nothing for me about him particularly scared me, maybe because I don't find clowns scary, but every scene he was in made me feel so unnerving. It was almost like I had such a level of intensity built up with me, cause every time I saw him on screen I was just waiting for him to do something terrible. Because generally, most of the time Pennywise is on screen, he does normal clown stuff like normal clowns do. He does his silly laugh, smiles a lot, talks about balloons and what not, it just really disturbed me. I can't exactly explain it, but the eeriness of Pennywise really just blew my mind in this film, No spoilers of course, but there is a particular scene at the very beginning of the film, that I will stand by as probably one of the all time best scenes I have ever seen in a horror movie. There was so much uncomfortable but satisfying vibes going throughout me when I saw the scene, and it just basically gave me the predicament that this film was going to be pretty exceptional.As for flaws I don't have many, but I do think they overuse CGI a bit too much sometimes. There's a particular form, that is shown in the film a couple of times that really didn't work for me. All though, sometimes they do use the CGI for good reason, involving Pennywise's scenes that didn't bother me whatsoever.So overall It is pretty much a near perfect adaptation of King's novel. It didn't really scare me, so that might come across to some as very disappointing, but the fact that this film allowed itself to be more of a coming of age, emotionally impactful, and exceptionally fun and thrill-riding, mystery, adventure throughout, I was satisfied to the highest level. I can actually say, that I can see It becoming a possible horror classic in the near future. I think It is one of the better, Stephen King adaptations I've ever seen, and if you're looking for something that is going to enthrall you, for 2 hours and 15 minutes, I definitely recommend checking out It. I'd give It a grading of a solid A, and a score of a 9.5/10.",It
284,mattiasflgrtll6,You'll pay too. You'll pay too.,5,24 September 2017,"The marketing for this movie was brilliant. Following the big clown scare of 2016, and feeding on many people's fear of clowns and Stephen King fans (including those who were let down by the mini-series), this movie was bound to build a lot of hype. And surely it did. People couldn't wait to see Pennywise rise again, and to see how professional Bill Skarsgård's take on the title role would be.What did I think? Well... It was pretty mediocre. Kinda bad actually. But let's get to what I liked about it at first:1. The Losers Club - The kids had a lot of charm, and the scenes where they are just having fun like taking a dip or having a rock fight with the bullies were fun. Acting was very good. Richie constantly amused me, and the boy who played Bill was the best one out of the young cast.2. The start of the movie - Good atmosphere, and builds up well to the shocking first encounter with Pennywise. Of course, like every damn scene in this movie the sound was really loud, but generally speaking it did spook me a little. Not bad.3. Some of the directing - I'll admit, some scenes of It are well-shot, and has some nice-looking cinematography. When you see someone just standing in the dark, like when Bill sees Georgie in the cellar, looks pretty creepy! Shudderworthy at least.Unfortunately, the small potential there is ruined by what was the movie trying to pander too much to a specific audience demographic: those looking for some good jumps. Nothing more, nothing less. The problem is, a lot of people actually *do* want more than this, believe it or not. At first the jumps had some sort of effect on me, but after a while when the movie wouldn't go 10 freaking minutes without another one... it got really, really annoying. Couple that with the CGI and you lose a lot of the tension. What about Pennywise though? Was he scary? No. No he was not. But it's not really Bill Skarsgård's fault. He was decent as Pennywise. At times his accent got a bit distracting, but he still did fine for what it gives. But he barely got any time to act, since every jumpscare with him was so heavily CGI'd that it didn't feel like you were watching someone acting. It was like watching a special effect. I also found him way too silly. Some of the things he did and the ways he popped up were so stupid that I found him to be quite a nuisance.And something I thought was absurd was how everyone had the worst parents on earth. In the original movie some of them were bad, but in this one one terrible parent after another popped up. It turned into a joke. Beverly's dad, sure he was creepy, but whenever he showed up it felt like watching The Stepfather.Not an utter disaster, but if you're looking for a horror movie with some brains, or something less corny than the mini-series (it's WAY more corny), you'll be disappointed. Or maybe not. Some people seem to like it.",It
285,GomezAddams666,Will make clowns scary for a new generation.,9,6 September 2017,"Making a remake or a new interpretation of a classic film is no easy task, much less when we have the original film still ingrained in our minds. New adaptations of classic horror films are an even greater risk, as there have been recent abysmal failures such as the remakes of A Nightmare on Elm Street, Fright Night, and the new version of Carrie, based on the novel by Stephen King.Andres Muschetti took a huge risk by adapting one of Stephen King's best-known and iconic stories, his job was to create an iconic and scary Pennywise, and to lead a film with unknown actors with whom the audience can identify, and create scenes of terror and suspense that would traumatize new generations, and despite this great risk, the director majestically achieved his task.IT is a great film, this time the Losers Club is led by the young actor, Jaeden Lieberher, who along with the charismatic Sophia Lillis and the rest of the gang give us performances worthy of much older actors, their emotive and sometimes funny interpretations not only make the audience truly identify with these characters and care for their well-being, but it also gets the viewer to see the mysterious events of the town of Derry from their eyes, and feel their emotions.And as for Pennywise, Bill Skarsgård offers an interpretation that will no doubt scare audiences for years, his voice, his contortions, that sinister look, and his magnificent performance will make the 27-year-old actor become the nightmares of new generations to come.Andres Muschetti doesn't make extreme use of CGI, which gives the film a more realistic touch, and his camera effects, plus the color variations not only recreate the year 1989 where this story takes place, but they also create a spooky atmosphere where the chaotic events that happen in that town that has been cursed feel intensified to a maximum level.This film by far is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best horror adaptations that I have seen in my entire life. My rating is 9 out of 10.I highly recommend that you go to theaters to enjoy IT, you will marvel at the incredible performances, the great landscapes, and maybe even the story will captivate you so much that there is a remote possibility that you'll float too.",It
286,CabbageCustard,Not just a horror movie. A triumph of friendship and courage,7,8 December 2017,"I've never been a fan of horror movies, but I really enjoyed the latest iteration of IT. I've tried to work out why that would be. I think it is because this is more than just a horror movie, with the protagonists battling the eponymous evil clown. Sure, it has its creepy movements - and some which are just silly. I think, however, that the real strength of this movie is that it is a story of courage and friendship. And the courage is not just the young stars dealing with the sinister Pennywise; it is in the way they deal with much more evil and malicious monsters in their daily lives - bullies, manipulative and abusive adults and more. Some of the characterisations are a little bit over the top, but that doesn't detract from what is, essentially, a powerful coming-of-age film. In that sense, this movie has strong similarities to 'Stand By Me', which is also based on a Stephen King story. Acting throughout is great. The young co-stars do a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing them in the inevitable sequel. The clown, Pennywise, is suitably creepy, at least till he starts to speak. (The voice isn't particularly frightening.) There are a number of plot holes too, but no movie is perfect and none of these flaws detract from the enjoyment of the piece.In short, I recommend this movie, even if you're not usually a fan of the horror genre. The movie has much more to offer than just cheap scares.",It

288,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Where was the tension?,6,8 September 2017,"I think the film was good, but didn't really live up to expectations. I didn't find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That's for sure. And I liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. There was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And I think that's a big reason why I just wasn't very scared.The other dumb thing I want to mention is that sometimes the characters fell into predictable horror movie tropes. Its just kind of silly when they've already been scared by Pennywise many times. Knows this all ""isn't real"" and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going ""Come here"". I mean, really? You're going to fall for that? I think what does save this film are the performances. Bill does a good job with Pennywise. However, he does lack the charm that Tim Curry had. But those were always going to be big shoes to fill. (Clown pun not intended). The kids though were amazing. In particular Jaeden Lieberher (who played Bill) and Sophia Lillis (who played Bev) were the standouts. I also want to give a shoutout to Nicholas Hamilton (who played Henry) for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully. Finn Wolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie who is meant to be the jokester of the group. And Finn does well with that character. I just wish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times. You're supposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when he opens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever.I see the potential in this film. And I think it could have been really good. I just think they spent too much focus on ""shock value"" rather than building on an atmosphere.",It

Maybe my tolerance level for horror isn't as seasoned as lifelong horror movie fans, but since I've only seen about two new horror movies in the past fifteen years, this one really gave me the creeps. I'm still not a fan of horror movies, but this was a good enough one in my book.

The problem with this movie is it tries too hard to not be like the original and has added random jump scares that make absolutely no sense. The Pennywise in this movie is somewhat creepy but lacks the flair of Tim Curry's version of the same character. Which made him both appealing and frightening. This Pennywise clearly is dark, there isn't any sense of being put at ease prior to the scare.
This was a good movie to watch if there was nothing else on TV and you were curious to see what this remake was all about. But I can see myself being disappointed if I had paid to see this in the theater. Good thing I didn't!

291,Jared_Andrews,IT Delivers the Scares and Humor in an Endlessly Fun Ride,8,9 September 2017,"Don't overthink it. Don't overthink IT. That's a plea from the novel's author himself, Stephen King. He didn't want anyone to delve too deeply into analyzing this movie, so respect the man's wishes. He knows his work better than anyone else possibly could. After all, he wrote it.I understand the temptation to explore the layers of IT. We see the themes of community, transitioning to adulthood, bullying, racism, friendship, yada, yada, yada. I'm telling you—don't fixate on that. Focus on IT. And by IT, I mean not only Pennywise the Dancing Clown, but also the embodiment of all your worst fears, everything that IT can be. Because that's what this movie is really about above all else—being afraid. This 2017 adaptation of IT provides a litany of reasons to be afraid, not the least of which is Bill Skarsgard's terrifying, devious, vicious performance of the infamous clown. This is very much of modern version of Pennywise, equipped with special effects to illustrate his shape-shifting abilities and showcase his considerable power. There's nothing cheesy here. Pennywise is only ever funny and charming as a means to lure children. The humor is intentional when it hits. The most brilliant element of IT is its self-recognition. The movie (or its writers) understands that stories of this ilk (i.e. an unstoppable monstrous figure is killing people) are inherently kind of silly. Take Michael Myers, for example. Sure, his is scary, but he is also partly ridiculous and silly because it's ridiculous and silly to believe that a human child would ever turn into an unstoppable killing machine that has no reason for killing and also cannot be killed by gun shots or fire or seemingly anything else. The movie makers understand this and respond accordingly by embracing the silly: they make the unstoppable killer a dancing circus clown. Now, I understand that to many people clowns are terrifying even if they aren't killing anyone. That's fair. Clowns don't really stir up those fears in me, but I find dolls endlessly creepy, so I get it. The fact remains that Pennywise most commonly takes the form of a clown, and clowns are silly. So, the movie also contains some appropriate silliness. The kids make crude jokes. A lot of them. Some of the things that Pennywise does blur the lines between silly and scary. Certain scenes, or at least certain moments within scenes, can be perceived as either scary or silly. The movie navigates this blend of silly and scary brilliantly. The scares begin early and strike with ferocity. The jump scares come only as necessary; they do not wear out their welcome. There's also a satisfying sprinkle of disturbing images and prolonged stints of dread to deliver frights. Many of the scariest moments contain no surprise element. The movie simply presents a terrifying image then shoves in down your throat until you gag on the creepiness. If this sounds uncomfortable that's because it is. After moments like those, the silliness provides a much-needed dash of comic relief to ease the tension. Other times the silliness lulls the audience into a false sense of security before slapping them in the face with something horrifying. This makes for an unpredictable and endlessly entertaining thrill ride. Entertainment is the primary goal of this movie, perhaps the only goal. With that in mind, don't think too much about how absurdly useless or villainous the adult characters are portrayed. Don't think too much about the one-dimensional and token nature of many child characters. Most of all, don't think too much about how this movie is different from the book (books and movies are separate entities; of course they are going to be different!). Don't overthink this movie. Just sit back and enjoy the silliness and scares. From the spectacular opening scene to the warm and comforting conclusion, this movie aims to entertain. It delivers.",It

Though it technically is a horror film, this adaptation is less horror and much more of a coming of age story dealing with a barrage of heavy topics like loss, child abuse, murder, bullying, etc. Since the filmmakers took away a lot of the explicit moments from the book, it detracts from the shock factor and the scares in favor to make a film more suitable for it's audiences.

296,kingofdanerds,Probably the biggest horror film of my time,8,21 June 2021,"If you ask anyone who is 30 or older what the biggest horror film of all time is, chances are they would say Scream or Blair Witch. But for me, being born in 2002, the biggest horror film of my time is certainly It which is the second adaptation of King's (overrated) 1000 plus page tome. Just imagine it being 2017 and being really pumped for this film. I actually got the chance to see this film in theaters but much later to a point that I went with a friend and we were literally the only people in the theater, so it is kind of sad to not have been able to be in a large crowd and feel the energy. It was really hyped up to an all time extreme and well worth it for many. The film was released in 2017 and was such a financial success that it is the highest rated horror film of all time. The film was directed by Andy Muschietti and stars Bill Skarsgard, Jaeden Martell, and Finn Wolfhard.Evil is afoot in the small town of Derry, Maine. Kids are disappearing and when a little boy named Georgie disappears, his brother Bill and a group of kids band together and call themselves the Loser Club and fight the evil which disguises itself as their deepest fears.It is probably the best adaptation of the 1986 novel. Not only does the film play up the novel's biggest strengths, it does more than just be a standard horror movie. It also is a good coming of age story as well. Now, as a horror movie, this does deliver on the scares. Not only is there great suspense in certain scenes, there are some truly scary jump scares that are present in the film. The film is just all around creepy. From their home life, to some of the tragedies that some of them have faced, to the evil that they will at some point have to face. The special effects are mostly, if not entirely CGI. I have seen people complain about the special effects but I never had a huge problem. Sure, the Pennywise character did this strange jerky CGI run that does not make too much sense and outside of that I might have only seen one other instance where the CGI did not work for me. Tim Curry's portrayal of Pennywise the Dancing Clown is rather memorable. Tim Curry's Pennywise was creepy and silly but effective because that is how (realistically in a sense) evil clowns should act like. Do not get me wrong, Bill Skarsgard does a fantastic job as Pennywise from everything to line deliveries to some great facial expressions too. But the character of Pennywise in this film is too dark. There is no apparent friendliness to this iteration of the character. For me, it does not bother too much because I am still scared in the end but it would have been nice to have that off-puttingness to the character here all around because there are instances where Pennywise tries to be friendly. But the two iterations are so different that I cannot really choose which one is better. This is only Chapter One, so this film only deals with the characters as children which, if you ask me, is probably the best way to going about adapting the 1000 plus page novel onto the big screen. The children here are a major improvement over what we had seen previously with the miniseries. Here, the kids feel more realistic as we see when facing life issues and whatnot. Funny enough, what really makes this all apparent to me is the fact that the kids swear a ton in this film because believe it or not, kids swear all the time. We get a sense of friendship and camaraderie when interacting with the other characters that are apart of this Loser Club. They are well acted with a group of child actors that have great chemistry with each other. Sure, some characters deserved better like Mike Hanlon who had a bigger role in the previous versions of the story. I am sure people who are bigger fans of the source material would have a bigger problem here. With that being said, this film follows the source material fairly well. Sure, the setting is updated and whatnot and yes, certain elements of the novel are not present in the film and for those who have read the novel know what I am talking about. I think the elements left out were smartly left out and had they been included, would have affected my opinion of this film. For a film that is 135 minutes long, it really does feel like it is longer. Honestly the first two thirds of the film flow nicely but once we get to that final third it does sort of drag and I do remember while watching this film in theaters how much longer I had to sit and watch this film and not because the film was bad (because it is not), but rather because I felt like it has been an eternity for lack of a better term. The finale itself is fine. Just fine and only so because it does not really hold up when compared to everything that came before it in this film.It is a fine adaptation of a novel that I find overrated. But I actually dig this version more than the miniseries and the novel itself. Great characters and great scares will surely entertain anyone who wants to see this film.",It

A group of teenage recluses decide to find out the source of the evil clown and face every one of their fears to defeat the clownThe film did great on many aspects, it's a very well paced and intracatley shot movie with genuine scares and moment of horror. Pennywise is mysterious and fearful which is fitting to the movie very well. He is entertaining aswell as very creepy looking thanks to his design and makeup. The child and teenage actors are all great and are believable and play their roles very well.I'm not really a big fan of horror, but I'll see one every now and then but this movie did impress me with it's scares and character development. Kudos to the DOP for making this movie shine and look suspenseful, which the movie is abuntant with. I do like it more than the original IT and do think it's a huge step forward in rebooting the franchise, but I'm only going to see this one, this is my limit when it comes to horror. I'm too scared to see the sequel",It
298,pinkarray,Disappointing film with horrendous language and full of clichés,4,15 September 2017,"After hearing about all the critical praise for it and because I like horror films, I decided to give this a try. The teaser didn't look so bad despite this being a remake. What I got was middle school kids bullying, ignorant parents, and children swearing throughout the whole film. All quite common and tiresome in fiction.Though, I'm not a fan of the violence portrayed in this film, that's not the only problem, though.I didn't care for any of the characters except possibly the villain Pennywise, he was the one who caused all the action in this film. I just couldn't root for the heroes because I didn't give a crap about them since they were constantly swearing throughout the film. I especially do not like how the language was used unnecessarily.The only fun parts were pretty much some of the action scenes. They were interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat.I missed the ending of the film because my mom forced me to leave early for a meeting that I didn't really want to go to and because she thought the movie was over. But there were a lot of previews for it.I haven't seen the original It so I don't know how this compares to it. But I know that remakes tend to not be as good as the original. So, I recommend Hollywood to stop making remakes to everything.Just skip this one and go watch Annabelle: Creation instead. Though, it's not great and even though it's grotesque, it's got a lot more likable characters, charming story and less clichés.",It
299,scb_coldsteel,Strong first opening film,8,2 October 2018,"Just saw the new movie IT. I really enjoyed the film. They updated the gore and jump scares from the original, but stayed true to what made IT a great scary movie. The movie provided a nice combination of horror, suspense, and a coming-of-age drama. The movie really captured the spirit of the Stephen King novel. The kid actors were all outstanding. They had real chemistry together and were fun to watch all around. It is hard to find kid actors that feel like they are actual children. These kids felt like genuine best friends. They played together, joked around together, and helped each other out. These actors were the centerpiece of the movie and they made it work perfectly.The special effects were all around pretty solid also. It was a smart move dividing the film's into two parts, letting the kids roles and their interactions with It really shine. I did miss Tim Curry's voice though lol. A 8.5 out of 10.",It
300,randyfromscream,Easily my first favorite film of 2017.,10,9 September 2017,This movie got Pennywise right in this film and scary performance. A great cast and good story. I like how they copy some of the things from the original one from 1990. They have great CGI effects like they look real like most CGI today. I think this is the best horror reboot like most failed or mix review sometime praised like this film is possible better than Rob Zombie Halloween films and it's better than Micheal Bay's horror remakes.If you float we all float too. If you float too we all float too. IF YOU FLOAT TO WE ALL FLOAT TOO! (sorry if I screw up),It
301,papanloveu,Very Well Made Horror Comedy!!!,8,28 July 2021,"Definitely one of the best horror movies of all time. Not only is there horror, but there's action, humour and drama. It definitely made me feel a mix of emotions throughout the entire movie, which is why it makes it so unique. I feel fear at one moment then happiness at the next then sadness, it's truly amazing.Every character is so thoughtfully put together, along with practically the perfect cast. It really does feel like I'm experiencing the moments myself, as if I'm right there. The Losers Club shows such great development, they overcome challenges together and they really are true friends.Would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves something that gets their heart racing.",It
302,Morten_5,Better as an adventure than as horror,7,21 October 2017,"For once, Hollywood delivers a remake with heart and inspiration - and good screen writing. Bill Skarsgård is truly frightening as Pennywise.Director Andy Muschietti and his team have created that magical Spielberg-Zemeckis adventurous 80s feeling, also reminding of King-based ""Stand by Me"" (1986). The fine performances by the young cast, the quick, funny and good writing, the nice score by rising Benjamin Wallfisch and the cinematography by skilled South Korean Chung Chung- hoon (frequent collaborator of Park Chan-wook) all help in making ""It"" a well-working and enjoyable film.",It
303,tr91,It,9,13 September 2017,"First of all, I am yet to read the book or see the original from 1990 with Tim Curry as Pennywise (I hope to put this right on both fronts asap) so when seeing the 2017 version, I had nothing to compare it to and no idea of how the story should be going. I went to see 'It' on opening night at the cinema and it was one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had. For a start it was actually more than half full and there was a certain buzz in the air, a really great atmosphere.I will say that I personally expected it to be scarier but I suppose if your fears are clowns then this will probably be terrifying, Bill Skarsgård gives a menacing performance as Pennywise. He changes his voice at times so one moment he can be hilarious and seem almost innocent and then the next moment he will have a real menacing look to strike fear in to the audience. The costume/make up that went in to this is spot on. Although not as scary as expected I can still see why some would find this terrifying, although some moments did make me jumpy slightly, I found that the film in general was just creepy due to the excellent atmosphere created. The film got the mix of horror and comedy spot on, there were a lot of people in the audience laughing out loud and then gasping the next minute.There have been a lot of comparisons to Stranger Things as well as classic films like Stand By Me & The Goonies. It is a horror film but it gave me equal enjoyment watching it for the comedy/coming of age aspect. I thought there might have been some sort of back story about Pennywise as well as more from the kid's parents/locals of the town etc but I think maybe that might be taking the film a bit too seriously. Unless this is explored in more detail in the sequel, like I said I'm yet to read the book so I am a bit unsure. I think the casting was spot on, I can't praise Bill Skarsgård's performance highly enough (hopefully he will win some awards) and then the chemistry between the Loser's Club is terrific. All of them gave great performances and provided plenty of laughs but I have to praise Finn Wolfhard (Richie) who had some excellent one liners.Overall an excellent film, probably my favourite film of 2017 (so far anyway) and I can't wait for the sequel.",It
304,RhapsodyReviews,Great Remake!,8,6 September 2019,"Review:
'It' is an American supernatural-horror film directed by Andy Muschietti. It is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Stephen King. In my opinion 'It' is visually one of the best and most beautiful horror movies I have seen in recent years. The movie creates a scary atmosphere with some humor, which some people say could be too much for a horror film, I think it's the perfect balance. It has charming characters that have very different but equally interesting personalities.
The film tells the story of seven children in Derry, Maine, who are terrorized by the eponymous being, only to face their own personal demons in the process.
I've got to say I really enjoyed everyone's performance in this movie. Child acting has come a long way. It seems like good actors keep getting younger and younger, when in the 80's and 90's we just had Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore (E.T: The Extra Terrestrial) and that's all I can think of as far as really good child actors go. The chemistry between the kids in this movie is incredible! As I previously stated, because of the chemistry, we believe that they're friends and would do anything to help and protect each other. Without that the movie wouldn't have worked as well as it did. Also, we can talk about the acting without discussing Bill Skarsgård. He shows incredible acting skills and makes Pennywise so much creepier.
I know lots of people say it's no where near the original. That's just people being stubborn and stuck in their ways. There is no denying that this movie is better - we have the CGI and the digital technology to make things better. Don't get me wrong - I hate when Hollywood does remakes, but when it's done like this I'm totally on board. Things worked in this movie that didn't totally work in the original, and some things were altered to make more sense in this day of age. I will say however, that it did feel a little longer than it needed to be and maybe somethings could have been cut out that felt a little redundant.
Overall, if you're a fan of the original 1990 film or a fan of Stephen King in general check this one out. You won't be disappointed.

305,fredschaefer-406-623204,IT delivers.,8,9 September 2017,"To be honest, I cannot not remember the last time I was really stoked to go and see an R rated horror movie in the theater, but the remake of Stephen King's IT got me back there, and the film was well worth the matinée ticket. There are many who have fond memories of King's novel and the 1990 TV mini-series that gave us Tim Curry's terrifying take on Pennywise the Clown and this new movie will do nothing to sully them, but I think this new film is an improvement on both the book and the TV version, because, first of all, I thought King's book was somewhat overwritten and bloated in length, if the story had just stayed with the kids in 1950's Derry, Maine, it would have been a classic, but, for me, the contemporary 1980's story with the grown up kids, just did not grab me. I know that is not a popular opinion, and I respect anyone who begs to differ. As for the old TV series, the best thing about it is Curry and his interpretation of Pennywise, a performance that has given more than one generation a phobia of clowns, but the rest of the show has not aged well. So as far as I am concerned, IT was a good subject for a 21st century reboot.What works so well about this version, is that director, Andy Muschietti, and screenwriters Chase Palmer and Cory Fukanaga, did not forget what worked best in King's book: the battle between The Losers, a loose collection of junior high misfits, and the awesome evil of Pennywise, an ancient entity that lives beneath the town of Derry, Maine, and feeds off the fear of children, whom it murders at will. One of King's best talents is the ability to create great child protagonists, and Bill, Eddie, Mike, Stanley, Richie and Beverly were among his most memorable. The movie lets us get to know each one of them; what makes them unique, what makes them losers in the eyes of their classmates, what the fear the most, and most of all, what makes them heroes. One of the secrets to making a great horror movie is giving us characters we really care about and fear for when they are in peril, and in this aspect, IT delivers. Too bad so many other horror flicks fail miserably in this regard. All praise to the young actors, Jaeden Lieberther, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Finn Wolfhard, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer, Wyatt Oleff, and Sohpia Lillis for bringing making The Losers such winners.But the other secret to a great horror movie is having a compelling Big Bad, and in this, Bill Skarsgard is a great Pennywise; he won't make you forget Tim Curry, but his take on the most evil clown of all is a winner. Skarsgard's Pennywise is buck toothed cartoon character from hell, with a painted on grin and yellow eyes of pure evil behind a facade of childish mirth. He is good enough to lure a small child like Bill's little brother, Georgie, into the sewers (in a harrowing opening scene), but like the big bad wolf, the older kids see right through him. There is also a gang of punk bullies hanging around to also make our young heroes lives than much more miserable. I like the way the movie's setting is so vividly rendered, Derry is a town filled with dilapidated houses and apathetic adults who fail to notice the danger their children are in, an 80's community where it is most definitely not ""Morning in America Again.""My biggest complaint about the movie would be that it is too dark in many scenes; lighting seems to be an especial problem with movies made in the 2000's. Also, I do not find CGI effects particularly scary or frightening; it is just a matter of over saturation. I had no problem with moving the setting of the film forward to the late 1980's with Tim Burton's Batman on the theater marquee and New Kids on the Block playing on the Sony Walkman. I do commend the screenwriters for dropping one aspect of King's book, the ""problem scene"" in the sewers after the battle with Pennywise, when our young heroes become lost; if you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about.This version of IT is subtitled, Chapter One, with the intention being that we will see the adult versions of The Losers reunite 27 years after the events of this movie to take on Pennywise once again. That's all well and good, but if it does not happen, I won't be disappointed too much, as this film has more than done justice to the best part of Stephen King's epic novel.",It
306,PCT1970,It's The Best Adaptation Of Novel,7,5 May 2019,"Muschietti helms an exceptional horror mystery drama. Of all of King's canon of novels this ranks, in this viewer's opinion, as the fourth best adaptation behind Kubrick's ""The Shining"", Reiner's ""Misery"" and Reiner's ""Stand By Me"". This film has substantial direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, special effects, score and acting. All of the actors involved deliver appreciable performances. In particular Lillis and Skarsgard are superb. Skarsgard's portrayal of the daft, horrific and savage Pennywise is so convincing it was as if I was reading the novel again back in the late 80's. The plot is set in Derry, ME in the summer of 1989. A year earlier Bill Denbrough's younger brother George goes missing and Bill is grief stricken but continues to believe that George is alive. In 1988 George had been chasing a paper folded sailboat along a curb on a rainy day when the boat drops into a storm drain. That is when the devious and deranged Pennywise convinces Georgie to come close enough to retrieve his boat and come float with the others. Bill's friends are skeptical of George still being alive but appease Bill in his investigation. His friends all have struggles of their own and include Ben who is overweight and constantly bullied; Richie who uses foul language and a loud mouth to gain attention; Stanley who is the son of an oppressive rabbi and is haunted by a ghoulish women; Mike who is a lonely black kid living on the outskirts of Derry and cherishes having friends; Eddie who is always sick and constantly using his inhaler and Beverly who is the new tomboy in town who lives with an extremely abusive father. They are constantly being harassed and bullied by a psychopath Henry Bowers and his gang. Ben discovers in a library that Derry has been plagued for centuries by tragedies that occur every 27 years. Pennywise terrorizes each of the kids by capitalizing on their weaknesses. After they all realize they have all had encounters with the entity they give Pennywise the moniker It. They call themselves ""The Losers Club"" and determine It travels though the sewer lines undetected and resides in a well where all the lines connect. The well is under a well known abandoned haunted house. The seven confront Pennywise at the house and Beverly is able to fight the entity off forcing It to retreat. Beverly is kidnapped by Pennywise which forces the remaining six to venture down into the harrowing lair of It which has bodies of the missing children floating atop a mountainous pile of children's toys, clothing and circus props. There they encounter a now insane Bowers and must do battle with It. The plot is thrilling, intelligent, captivating, insightful, cathartic, spine-tingling and has an ambiguous ending. In this viewer's opinion the film examines the struggles of youth and the power of friendship. The main theme is that as one each character has their own struggles and weaknesses but as group they heal each other and become a powerful force that can accomplish their dreams in life. The film has many hair-raising scenes that deliver nightmarish chills. My favorite scene is when ""The Losers Club"" is viewing a slide projector that speeds up as if they were watching a video reel and Pennywise first appears on a screen before propelling forward out of it. There are also many sinister quotes. My favorite is when Pennywise is introducing himself to George so that they'll know each other and he says in a creepy and frightening voice, ""Well I'm Pennywise and you're Georgie"". The ambiguous ending was perfect as the story continues in the novel after the encounter with Pennywise at the well as ""The Losers Club"" reunites 27 years later. This film is now labeled as ""It"" Chapter One. Chapter Two is due this year. This is a film that delivers psychological and terrifying jolts. It is a significant film in ""It's"", pun intended, genre.",It
307,kenyae-cagle,Ehh...,5,9 September 2017,"Just finished ""IT"" (DO NOT READ THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS) and I have to say I am tired of ""scary"" movies with happy endings. This movie was predictable and cliché on certain parts as well. Don't get me wrong I jumped once or twice maybe even three times with this movie, but everything was way too predictable. The start of this movie made me feel it was going to be blood and gore and kids would die always. By the middle with the different experiences I was able to tell this movie is not going to end badly its gonna be the same happy ending. Of course the ending was the girl and the guy getting their kiss....what a shame. Corny ending. As far as anything else the black guy FINALLY survived the entire movie only problem was his acting in certain scenes specifically when he tells his fear origin story.",It
308,keelhaul-80856,"Good, but only scary to younger viewers.",7,20 September 2017,"This was a really well-made movie, and marketed very well prior to its release. It left room for a sequel, as well, though I found this a bit cheesy. The script, kids, setting, plot, and action are all done quite well. You won't be bored or feel cheated on excitement and funny, irreverent entertainment. However, like other reviewers have stated, it is more of a bizarre comedy horror for older teens and adults. The ""R"" rating is more for bad language from children and suggestive themes than for scary violence, sex, torture, etc. that one might have expected. The whole thing is really quite hilarious, minus a few jump scares and bloody dismemberment of a child's arm. A fun and well-designed film, ""It"" delivers on many levels, but I'm not sure if I would place it in the iconic realm of ""Exorcist"", ""Texas Chainsaw"", or ""Devil's Rejects"". It would terrify a 5 yr. old, scare a 13 yr. old on their first date, amuse older teens, and make adults laugh and analyze the deeper elements. Overall, a nice film.

310,achyutaghosh,light on scares,7,9 September 2017,"So I went and saw IT, and came back unimpressed. I mean it was a good movie, no doubt about that. A bunch of kids, outcasts in their own right, being terrorized by an ancient demon that plays upon the fears of its victims is pretty much the standard in Hollywood horror movie territory. All the kids are well cast, the script is funny and tight, and there are plenty of monster shots. The cinematography is great, the pace is even and the CGI is flawless. But is more funny than terrifying- it's R rating more a justification of teenage slang in the script, rather than for true scares. But that is what typically Stephen King is all about. His stories are studies on relationships rather than all out horror. In IT, King reversed Spielberg's E.T, and explored everyday monsters of childhood- abuse, violence and neglect. Juxtapose that with an eternal evil shape-shifting entity who wakes up every 27 years to prey, and you have a shawarma of a plot. The book is scary, the movie isn't. Probably so because today, we are used to Stranger Things. We are used to kids doing stupendous stuff these days- whether running billion dollar companies, or bringing back lost souls from other dimensions. It all seems very easy for today's generation to figure things out- most of IT establishes this narrative. A wonderful group of actors face off against Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and they all nail their parts. The movie takes place in a town where all the adults are essentially villains- so its not just the kids versus the clowns everyone else. But for sheer impact, IT never reaches the highs it achieves in its first sequence. It is a great example of how strong marketing can make mediocre movies look a billion bucks. Other reviewers are putting IT right up there with other Stephen King adaptions such as The Shining and The Thing. Oh please, that would be laying it too thick. Director Andy Muschietti's earlier take on the genre- Mama, is a far better contender.No good horror movie can get away by being light on scares, however good the characters and the script are. So look at IT as an extension of Goonies or Stranger Things, a PG-13 romp, not an iconic horror movie. 7/10",It
311,n-kefala,It is must to see!,8,1 October 2017,"This new adaptation of Stephen King's monumental novel is one of the best that has been done in recent years based on some of his books, providing very charming characters and frightening sequences and capturing the unique qualities of King's storytelling. ""It"" is a solid horror movie with great protagonists who achieve that perfect combination of vulnerability to evil and fascination for the unknown and is carefully directed by Andy Muschietti. Despite all the marketing focus on the homicidal circus freak, ""It"" was never about the clown.

312,apjc,OK if you haven't read the book or think clowns are scary in themselves.,5,21 November 2018,"Started so well I thought it was going to be a good re-telling of King's novel.

313,Breumaster,A new era of horror. Pennywise goes CGI.,9,8 October 2017,"Skarsgard is a mind-blowing new Pennywise. In Comparison with Tim Curry, he is much more subliminal. The old ""It"" sure is cult and has it's own charm, but the new one, which is made exactly 27 Years (hint!) after the TV-Movie, is well done about the parts the old movie-production could not portray/depict. But the new Pennywise Shows a freaking grimace, with blood-freezing effects. Creepy feelings predetermined by watching this clowny freak and his cabinet of freaky phenomens the Kids are facing in the movie.I like the thing, that the movie concentrates on the kids and does not such time-jumps like the TV-movie. So this is only the first part. an second part will follow, the producers announced. But we have to wait. They want to do this before the kids are to old, because the sequel allegedly will tell the story from grown-up point of few from the former kids and obviously tell the rest of the story in flashbacks.In the new ""It"", there are many things told better and more clear to view, but one thing is worse than in the old movie. ... I would rather have seen more quality in figurative characterization of the kids, like in the old movie. But that's the only point of critic for me.

315,spencergrande6,This film doesn't work because it doesn't add up to anything,5,1 October 2017,"This film doesn't work because it doesn't add up to anything. It's another in a long line of recent ""franchise-y"" films that are more about their existence than about anything resembling a coherent story or theme. This film, taken on its own terms, is about a boogeyman who's mostly a clown and a group of kids who find his house to bludgeon him to death. That's it, and even that's pushing it.Yes, Pennywise says that famous catchphrase about floating, and even better the movie interprets it literally, as if the quote exists outside a reality tied to story, character, or theme - in this film, kids actually float down in his sewer. Ohhh creepy, that's what it means.The whole thing is just a serious of intermingled ""scare"" scenes, one for each kid, wherein they are given the barest bones of character to make it work. Bill stutters, but only like once or twice and it never matters at all. Richie is a smartass, but he dresses cool and hip and is woke so modern audiences love him - his character doesn't grate at all making you wonder why he's such a ""loser"". Ben is fat, but in a fun superficial way and he's clearly not bothered by it. Mike's character might as well not exist at all (his entire raison d'etre is to have access to cattle guns). Eddie has his inhaler and uses it all of like once - he's more of a pill junkie. He seems rather charming and smart, and his mother is a bloated caricature that does nothing for his character either. Stan is a cipher.At least Beverly has a some development, but it's driven home in such a broadly obvious over-the-top way that again, it feels like a comment on people's prior conception of her character and not as a real character herself in this story. Her dad is a one-dimensional sexual predator, and her ability to overcome him and in turn Pennywise, rewards her with a damsel in distress storyline that ends in a literal kiss from Prince Charming to wake her - there doesn't seem to be any irony here either.The sequel to this almost can't exist based on how inept the storytelling in this one is - it will pretty much have to be it's own standalone film. I don't like to judge a film based on its source material, it should stand on its own, but this film fails miserably in both regards so it's a bit of moot point.The acting is uniformly good however. The kids are well cast, and do their parts well. Bill Skarsgard has potential, though it's wasted by lackluster use of him. There's some kind of shaky-cam run at the camera trick that's bafflingly inept and seems like a cop out by a story that has run out of tricks and doesn't trust an actor to do his job creating tension.A good example of this is the opening scene - little Georgie has this creepy encounter with Pennywise, and he's charming and owning the screen, when inexplicably the camera cuts to some old woman coming out of her house with a cat, then it cuts back to Pennywise and all the tension has started to dissipate. Then the movie has the ""cajones"" to literally show Georgie's arm getting torn off and Pennywise's mouth full of sharp teeth. Cut to the cat staring down at the street. That old trick - Alien first did it in 79. It's all so explicit way too early in the film and it kills all of the atmosphere and dread that could have permeated this.Why. was. there. so. little. Silver. Hi. Yoo. Silver. Away. There's a throwaway line lost at the peripherals about the bike but otherwise nada. Why?",It
316,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,Could be subtler,6,6 August 2019,"6.5*Though ultimately enjoyable, It seemingly steps into every horror film pitfall, and it is buffling why. The bad trend is obvious immediately: there is no need for gore in Georgie's disappearence at the very start of the film. But also throughout it, the cheap horror traits are abundant: ok, the scary creatures represent the children's fears, but do they all have to be zombie-like monsters? More importantly, Bill Skarsgård is, by all accounts, excellent in the role of Pennywise - so why does he need to spend half his already limited screentime rushing and screaming towards someone? Worse still, the film is full of cheap jump scares, but so predictably that none of them actually scare you.There is also something to be said about the (lack of) plot. The kids go from one scene to another without that much coherence, there is not much character depth, and the whole affair seems pretty weird when you think that a bunch of kids disappear and the only ones who seem to care are some other kids. Who are constanly bulllied, in almost every scene, by three stereotypical 80s bullies (complete with ANTHRAX t-shirts and longish hair). And - I don't know if this is the same in the book - it is pretty unbelievable just how dedicated these bullies are. Not only do they carve kids with knives just because they're really bad guys, the one who gets killed by Pennywise goes to search for a kid to bully in a sewer - you have to admire the commitment to his craft. All in all, every single family appears deeply dysfunctional in the film. A statistical improbability, but then again, this is a pretty horrid town to live in, so ok.For all that, It has a good cast, atmosphere, and a memorable Pennywise. If we get some more background in chapter 2 and a more nuanced horror, the end result will be good.Oh, and Pennywise is a pretty damn scary clown. Without having the Predator's jawline, without transforming into a monster, just the clown thing. All that other stuff makes him less scary. I know it's a monster in the book, but, sorry Stephen King, he shouldn't be.",It

I know, sometimes what is scary about a movie is the concept and how frighten it would be if that happens in real life. But you know you are never experiencing this in your life.The cast is full of junior kids and their all likeable. Every child possesses their personality very correctly defined and what frightens them is unique for all them. Their interactions with each other and as a team are what make this movie gold material in the dark comedy department. The jokes are always landed even when they don't seem to be intentional.The horror aspect is decent. The special effects are awesome, and they seem to really invest much work in making IT a great scary villain. The performance of Bill Skarsgård is awesome; he absolutely looks like a monster and he embraces it.It is a dark comedy that you should see because it's humorous. Not so scary but at least it tries to be a decent horror film.",It
320,AnishMisra,It 1 Review,8,12 February 2018,"It is a film directed by Andy Muschetti. I remember watching the trailer when it launched and I was scared to hell. So my expectations for this film were quite huge. After watching this film, I can say that this film is horror at its best. Plot; Bill and his friends decide to spend the summer investigating about Bill's missing brother, Georgie.Story and direction: From the first scene itself, the mood gets set. It signified that the ride is not for the faint hearted. Never for a moment I felt that there were jump scares. And when there was a scare I literally had goosebumps, The story also was quite good. I liked the approach to separate the film into 2 chapters: One of the children and other for the adult part. This allowed for the story to be streamlined and focused. The characters, especially the Losers' club, were interesting. Each one of them had a kind of backstory that could be related to. The way this film handles and highlights issues related to children was impressive. The production design for the town of Derry was spot on. The makeup and VFX was amazing. It was as if I was looking at a real creepy clown. But the film had some issues for me. I felt the supposed love angle between Ben-Beverly-Bill was forced into the screenplay. Also the kid that starts cursing every second was very irritatting. I know that this film is R rated, but seriously to have a kid of 12-13 cursing is little bit overboard.Performances: Bill Skarsgard nailed it as Pennywise. He looked crepy each and every second he appeared on screen. He emoted the character of the psychotic clown effortlesly. Jaeden Lieberher was great as Bill. Finn Wolfhard had already impressed me in Stranger Things, he continues to impress here too.Jeremy Taylor was quite cute looking to the eyes but he too delivered an earnest performance. Spohia Lillis was also impressive as Beverly. Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs and Jack Dylan Grazer all delivered awesome performanances. Favorite Scene: It woule be the one where the kids go to Bill's home to see the town plan of Derry on a projector. But then Eddie doesn't feel well and tells Bill to stop his presentation. And suddenly just out of nowhere the projector changes slides on its own and then Pennywise appears in the slieds and then leaps out of the slides. The mood, tension and scare factor was what made this scene stand out from the rest for me.Verdict: For those who think you will see a Stranger Things (which I love btw) on film, you are absolutely wrong. This film is way different both thematically and tonally from the famous series. I loved It and can't wait for the second part.I am going with a 8.5/10.",It
321,plargreg,if you like production value with no a confused narrative and contraditory lore this is for you,1,2 July 2018,"THIS MOVIE HAD A FEW cool looking scenes, but the overall story and narrative were silly and poorly plotted. The acting is NOT as good as everyone says, that little kid from stranger things is possibly the most annoying one of the bunch. One example of where they went wrong, in the original miniseries (which also was garbage to my eyes and ears) the sink scene had a balloon come out and pop blood which was one of the okay scenes but in THIS REMAKE it does a full on evil dead two geyser out of the sink, which addss nothing and actually takes away. ALSO then all the kids proceed to mop it up together to some wham! song or some b.s. like how is cleaning up demonic blood no adult can see a good time? Also at the end, to defeat an eldritch, lovecraftian entity/monster who one second ago can send a kid flying twenty feet with a swipe suddenly gets beaten by 7 little kids hitting it with sticks, WHEN I ENCOUNTER ANCIENT MONSTER GOD THINGS a few hits with a bat and wha lah problem solved. Go watch The Void instead",It
322,quinimdb,It,7,9 September 2017,"For the first 15 minutes of ""It"" (and frankly all of the time before that), I thought this film was going to be another pointless remake. Within the first scene, it already felt as if the director was trying way too hard to make things ""scary"". The classic scene where Georgie meets Pennywise the clown not only seemed to be unnecessarily stretched out, but there was a shadow over the top half of Pennywise's face, so all you could see were his glowing eyes. In the build up to this scene Georgie bumps his head into a construction barrier, providing what seemed like unintentional comedy before the scene started. And then there was Bill Skarsgard's performance in this scene, which also felt like he was straining. As the icing on the cake, the scene ends with a predictable jumpscare and an exaggerated amount of blood and gore. Overall, Tim Curry's performance in the original scene along with the quick and sudden end to the scene actually left a much larger impact, having you wonder what exactly happened to Georgie after getting a glimpse of Pennywise's terrifying face.Even though the next few scenes in the school also looked to be following a cliché and cheesy route, surprisingly I actually began to care about these characters and enjoy watching the dynamics between them. That doesn't mean the overall trajectory of the film isn't still pretty predictable, but the kids acted like real kids of their age, with surprisingly great child performances across the board. The kids curse, joke around, and, when things begin to go down, they are realistically terrified. When the film wasn't trying to be scary, it was often genuinely hilarious, and it made the rest of the film a whole lot more likable.While I still felt that much of the horror was exhausting every trope as an attempt to scare (way too many sharp teeth, missing limbs, and predictable jump scares) and Bill Skarsgard was straining with a one note performance, all of the horror in the film actually serves the story and characters, and it actually has a couple well executed scares and sequences. Also, it's surprisingly disturbing at points, not just showing the irrational fears children have, but real childhood trauma.They call the monster in the film ""It"" because it is actually just a representation of their fear, inflicted upon them by overprotective parents, abusive parents, traumatic events, and bullies. Of course, the film makes a point to show that the bullies aren't exempt from this controlling force of fear either, and it is often the reason they need to feed on fear to feel stronger.Of course, like ""The Goonies"", ""Stand by Me"", or the recent ""Stranger Things"", what gets them through their troubles is the care and understanding that they have for each other, and what really makes this rated-R film about a group of children actually relatable for an older audience is how much these kids remind you of yourself at that age.",It
323,destinylives52,Great Movie,9,11 September 2017,"Based on the novel by Stephen King, ""It"" is a story of seven children who are considered outcasts in school, their everyday fears overshadowed by a creature that has awakened, taking the form of a clown (played by Bill Skarsgard). Summer is supposed to be a time of fun for children. Not so for the seven outcasts — calling themselves the Losers — who have to fight a war on two fronts: the terrors that most children face; and the supernatural entity that threatens to kill them one at a time unless the Losers Club bands together and takes the fight to the creature.My most memorable, movie moment of ""It"" is the scene when the girl member of the Losers is attacked by her father who has been molesting her. This scene alone makes the movie unfit for young children, and disturbing for most people to watch.""It"" should bring back many childhood memories of those who watch it. The best of times (summer days of playing, hanging out with friends and teasing each other, first crush on a girl) and the troubling times (being a loner, feeling like a loser, the start of a girl's period, being bullied, the mental/verbal/sexual abuse that some parents inflict on their children) are vividly and sometimes graphically exposed in ""It."" Although most of the lead actors are children, ""It"" is meant for adults, and adults will have a great time watching this movie that is horrifying, funny, and very, very well made.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",It
324,torrascotia,Its not a horror film.,6,11 September 2017,"OK just lets get one thing out of the way. I have not seen the original TV series or any other production of this story. I also have not read the book so this is not one of those ""its not as good as the book or original moans"". Having just watched the movie I can say its definitely worth watching. Its a well enough made film with some great effects and acting. However I did find some of the kids dialogue inaudible and it seemed to be difficult to pick out what they were saying sometimes with too many voices at once. Another issue with the sound was the odd choice of music which did not seem to sit right with the actual scenes. There were a few comedic parts which did not really seem to hit the mark either. However what I will say is that the film just is not scary. There's no tension before any of the supposed frights, they are set up in a way that you see them coming a mile off and when they do you basically find yourself thinking, OK so the clowns here and its doing its cgi thing but no that was not a surprise and I did not get a fright. In the screening I was I did not see a single person react to any of the scares. That is the main problem with this movie. The posters and trailers sell the film as a scary horror, which it is not. Its like a mix of The Lost Boys and Stand By Me. I could see this movie having a PG rating if one or two scenes were removed, but these scenes do not involve the clown. If you are expecting a real horror film or something closer to the book you may be disappointed. But go in with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it. Its an adventure movie not a horror.",It
325,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,8,7 September 2017,"It's been 27 years since the TV movie ""IT"" sparked a cult following among Horror Fans (mainly thanks to Tim Curry's memorable performance of Pennywise) and gave us a new meaning why we should fear clowns. The TV movie wasn't really that good 9with the exception of Tim Curry, of course). I'm here to tell you that this movie really gives ""IT"" a brand new meaning and reason to hate clowns! The movie wastes no time in getting started within the first 5 mins we have the famous drain scene where Georgie talks to Pennywise. This one is so much more memorable and will never be forgotten anytime soon. What made this movie way better than the original is that the kid actors were really good, and their development and chemistry is really strong! You actually believe they are all friends and you believe the horrible times they are going through. One of the best stand out performers was Finn Wolfhard (who plays Richie)...he was really funny and provided so much laughs. Sophia Lillis (who plays Beverly) was also another strong performer. You can see through her eyes that she is going through so much pain that she felt at home in ""The Losers Club."" But let's talk about the main reason why you're probably reading this review...Bill Skarsgård who plays Pennywise. He did an amazing job and he was really scary. The only problem is that he wasn't givin' enough lines. When Pennywise speaks Bill does an amazing job at making each line so creepy. I hope he gets more lines in the second one. I guess the reason for this is because they wanted to keep him more scary and less funny (like Tim Curry's version).All in all...it's the best Stephen King Horror Movie to ever have hit the theaters. Can't wait for Chapter 2! Go and pay to see it...it's definitely worth your time! 4/5 stars.",It

The kid actors in this are so good and they are giving there all to this movie! The effects are so creepy and scary in the movie and this movie really makes your route for the underdog. Pennywise is amazing!! I hope they do great things in the sequel and I'm excited for IT chapter 2!",It

328,pokemon_trainer_lucas,"Not that scary, but very intriguing",7,21 June 2019,"I was hoping for this film to be a lot scarier, but despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I can't put it into words, but there was just something that worked very well. Perhaps it was that the characters were so immersive, or maybe that the plot was well executed, I just don't know. There were some good gory scenes, and whilst there was some suspense, most of the ""horror"" elements came from the idea that their worst fears came to life rather than jump scares and psychological effects on the viewer.",It
329,morganstephens512,Amazing,10,7 September 2017,"Back in March and April, if you tried to tell me that on September 7th, I would be spending my whole day hyped and amazed by Stephen King's IT, I would have thought you were lying. But as the months, I started to get more and more excited and hoping that this movie would deliver. Oh boy did it deliver. I read the book back in late April, which was what got me hyped at first and I wanted to see how it would compare to the book, and I will say that I will be looking at the sequel very excited when it comes. In the first ten or so minutes, when Georgie meets Pennywise I knew that this was going to follow the book very well and when I saw what happened just a couple of minutes later, I gasped since the makers of the movie was going to go full on. While I was a little disappointing they didn't put at least five or so minutes on Bill meeting Eddie, Stan and Richie, that was quickly removed with the great character interactions, jokes, and scares. The first forty or so minutes of this movie kept blowing away my expectations. The interactions and character development of all the members of the club really some of the best I have ever seen in a horror movie and even more so of a horror movie in the last decade or so. Not only that, but the house scene and the last forty or so minutes of the movie were absolutely amazing. Just when the movie started to slow down maybe a little bit, I got right back into it. Not only was it like the book, but it was even more. That scene with ""Georgie"" and Bill at the ending left the people next to me and myself absolutely speechless and the guy next to me had his hands at his mouth. The last forty minutes were completely serious and did not stop to make sure that you were ready. Because the situation of the kids was not like that. I also love how that movie explained everything and when there was a scary scene, they would stop and have a interaction scene or a comedy scene. The movie honestly got better and better because it was just a perfect combination of a character growth movie, a comedy, and a horror film. Pennywise and the kids truly were perfect. If you have not read the book, you will like it. If you have read the book, you will love it and because I have read the book, I ended up loving it and was so satisfied that they did not shy away from touchy subjects. The only scene they left out was the sex scene, but I can see that because they probably didn't want to have the director accused of being a gross pervert by people who know nothing about that book. Overall, this is a great movie and I have never been more satisfied with a movie in my life. After giving it some time and thought, I would honestly put this in my all time top ten movies, maybe even top five. There was not one minute, one scene, or one character that I left disappointed with. This movie deserves every point of the ten out of a ten I give it. If you are considering seeing this movie, just do it. Watch it as soon as you give the time to do so. I have only said this about one other product in my life (season 4 of Digimon if you have to know) but I would give this movie a 15 if I could.",It
330,danielharden,They All Float Down Here,8,25 September 2017,"Stephen King is no stranger to big screen adaptations of his work. The prolific author even directly wrote a handful of these films And I think he'd like to forget the time he directed one. Some of King's classic film adaptations include such titles as; The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Stand By Me, Carrie, The Shining, Misery and It. Now, adeptly made 27 years after the classic Tim Curry starring miniseries, Mama director Andy Muschietti brings Pennywise the dancing clown to the big screen with IT. The film tells the story of the losers club, a group of outcast kids suffering from varying degrees of domestic issues, as they encounter a sinister being that takes the form of a clown and feeds off children's fear No not like in Monsters Inc. IT both works as a horror film and a coming of age movie with Andy Muschetti proving himself to be an extremely competent horror/genre film director. IT is a heartfelt and truly creepy movie even if it does underwhelm slightly due to the hype surrounding it.This adaptation of part one of Stephen King's classic novel is brought to life with nightmare-inducing imagery rather than loud sound effect jump scares. For this reason, director Andy Muschietti has my respect, as I can clearly tell he wants to truly scare and disturb his audience rather than conforming and relying on the laziest horror trick in the book. The opening sequence, aka the paper boat scene, is so fantastically executed by Muschietti, the tension drives you to the edge of your seat, and the payoff is frankly one of the most shockingly brutal things I've ever seen on a cinema screen. IT is unflinchingly gory for a film centred around a group of adolescent teens on the verge of puberty. However, the brutality and shock factor have been hyped up so much in the many articles written on this film, that you can't help but feel underwhelmed by the end product. Muschietti and his actors have gone on record about the number of ""extremely disturbing"" scenes that were cut, that you can't help but wish they had left them in. The paper boat scene is perhaps the most hardcore scene in the entire film, thus establishing the film's tone with this, will only lead to disappointment. As good as Muschetti is at directing horror unconventionally, leading with the visual, not the sound, he does rely heavily on characters being lured into obviously dangerous situations. I understand that the protagonists are children and so are easily manipulated, but Muscetti literally builds to every scare with a character being overly curious and following a creepy sound/voice, or an ominous red balloon, a weird easter egg looking thing, or even their long-dead brother Although I'll allow the emotion transcending logic on that one as that is realistic, you get the idea, it's majorly overused and makes the film repetitive.This all being said, IT doesn't just work as a horror film, but also as a coming of age film. Perhaps Muschietti's most effective use of horror revolves around the horrors of domestic life, abuse and growing up. Bill, Mike and Beverly are so emphatically brought to life in the script with such horrific back stories that no child should ever have. I believe that Beverly is fleshed out the best of the entire losers club, the tension between her and her father is so subtly constructed yet so effective. Mr Marsh's dialogue motif is so unnerving as it implies something much more disturbing and dark than what we see, which in itself adds a whole new dynamic and layer to Beverly's character, one of immense empathy. As well as this, the bathroom scene is wonderfully constructed to represent the ugliness and loneliness of a girls menstruation. This all being said, I couldn't help but dislike the films ending for sending the wrong message surrounding Beverly's character. The characters in IT are developed in such an engaging and distressing way, that you wish there was more of it. The horrors of home are great and really add to both the horror and coming of age genres, yet I feel a greater focus on this was severely needed, but then again this is chapter 1 after all.Last but not least the acting is outstanding across the board. All the kids act better than most adults today, to the point that you forget you are watching a group of child actors. Bill Skarsgård makes Pennywise his own in this film, many would say Tim Curry is impossible to top, however, I do believe Skarsgård rose to the occasion and makes for a far scarier Pennywise in the few scenes that his makeup doesn't do all the talking for him. I wanted more of Skarsgård, just like how I feel about everything else in this film.Overall, IT is an impressively made horror/coming of age film, that works on a number of levels. All the departments, from production design to make up, are doing a phenomenal job of bringing Andy Muschietti's horrific vision to life. Shocking and gory yet still coming off as tame, IT is a film that should have remained tight- lipped, however, everything Muschetti offers is so intriguing and engaging you simply cannot get enough. I for one cannot wait to see what Chapter 2 has in store, but one thing for sure, chapter one certainly floats.",It

333,hjalsayegh,Creepy but boring,4,16 September 2017,"For those that don't know This is a re-make of the Stephen King classic (IT), the book was made into a mini-series in 1990 staring Tim Curry as Pennywise. Now credit where it's due, the kids in the movie are amazing! I was strongly reminded of the cast in (stranger things) they were so good all around.praise over now to the issues I had with it... The movie was a bit off for me, whenever a character was separated from a group he'd wonder around a dark empty place (as you do) and you are just waiting for Pennywise to show up. again and again they just repeated that cycle.I think there were only one or two jump scares in the whole movie and I appreciated that but over all it got predictable quick, oh look that one kid left the group and is wondering in the woods/sewer/haunted house/library all alone, gee I wonder what will happen...It didn't help that that Pennywise here was less of a character and more CGI effect, he was very off putting and the way he moved was just odd. Frankly I found George (the baby brother) creepier! I cringed every time he laughed.I have seen episodes of (Are you afraid of the dark) scarier then this. If you want to feel creepy but in an uncomfortable way then this is for you. Might want to take a rent it though, you'll need to take a few breaks to get through it to break the monotony.

334,justinwfirestone,Maudlin milquetoast,5,10 September 2017,"What is It? It is a monstrosity. It is a two-hour-and-fifteen-minute monstrosity. What is It not? That depends upon what your definition of: 1) ""is"" is; and 2) ""it"" is.It is not: 1) scary; 2) horrific; 3) suspenseful; 4) worth your time; 5) Tim Curry. In fact, the fact that It is not Tim Curry is not a problem, but if It is Tim Curry, that is also not a problem.The problem is that It is a coming-of-age movie about a bunch of pubescent, self-entitled ""losers"" we cannot root for, because they, like It, live shallow lives. It feeds on fear, and It can make you afraid, so that seems like a pretty tight feedback loop, making It, arguably, woke AF.Growing up is hard, parents suck, and what in the hell keeps eating a bunch of kids in Derry every 27 years? (Hint: It is not Tim Curry.) Is It a psychological mirror that doesn't exist unless you've grown up and realized nothing matters?

335,tinovalkki,Excellent adaptation from Stephen King novel.,10,11 September 2017,"Many Stephen King filming are pure rubbish. It is very hard to bring Kings twisted books to a good film adaptation. Books are often so massive and text so weird, that making them a proper movie is almost impossible. Only few of Stephen King filming are goo, most are bad. IT belongs to good ones. Director has been wise to split massive book to two movies. Original book meander between 50's and 80's. In this movie story has split to two stories. First one has moved from 50's to 80's and second movie will be placed to present day. Very clever, because 80's is so nostalgic these days. Everybody who has seen Stranger Things in Netflix knows, that 80's nostalgic is very popular right now. Somehow IT reminds much like a Stand by Me and Goonies, but at the same time those movies are like kids movies compared to IT.Many times children actors are embarrassing to watch, but somehow these young actors are brilliant. Characters are plausible and you will get fond of them enough, that the scary scenes are really scare. Compared to many present horror movies, IT won't have too much digital effects, that makes it feels even more scarier. Nostalgic imagery combined to old school horror works well. Music and sound effects are used wisely, but effective.If somebody still remember the old TV-series from same story and traumas it left, you won't be disappointed. IT update nostalgic horror wisely to present day. Even story has now divided to two parts, movie still works perfectly as a independent story. Massive 180 million box office at the first weekend although will guarantee, that we will see the second part very soon.",It
336,Noirdame79,Unnecessary Adaptation,3,10 September 2021,"This latest adaptation of Stephen King's novel does have good performances and nice cinematography, but it lacks in many other areas. The use of CGI is overkill (pardon the expression). When movies start relying on visual effects to carry it, you know there is a problem. Yes, special effects are important, especially in stories like these, but it shouldn't consume the film. This, coupled with jump scares and gore, takes away much of the suspense and dread.I have read the book and saw the miniseries as a kid and have re-watched it since. The latter had to be toned down as it was made for TV and some of the special effects are dated. The second half isn't as strong as the first. However, what really sells the 1990 TV production is the atmosphere, music, and the performances - especially Tim Curry and the child/teen actors. The performers are all very natural, their relationships, whether that of friends or antagonists - were believable.The changing of the timeline (1958 in the book, 1960 in the miniseries) was not a good idea, in my opinion. The innocence of the late 1950s/early 1960s was one of the story's strengths. 1989 just was not as innocent of a time, making the threat of Pennywise less influential. And contrary to what defenders of this movie will claim, the kids did NOT curse that much in the book.In terms of performance, most of the acting was good. However, I didn't feel for or connect with the characters as I did in the TV production and especially the book. The friendship doesn't seem as strong. Mike Hanlon, in particular, lacked even more character development than he did in the previous incarnation. His knowledge of the history of Derry - one of the key important parts of his character - was completely stripped away and given to Ben. Why? And why was Beverly the one who looked into IT's deadlights (and changed to a damsel in distress rather than the one who did the most in bringing IT down) and not Stan, when that was an important factor in his later suicide? Why was Stan so unlikeable? Why was Georgie's death not discovered immediately after it happened?The biggest gripe I have is with Pennywise (so much of it was CGI). It really has nothing to do with Bill Skarsgard's performance per se, but how Pennywise is presented. One of the strengths of Tim Curry's portrayal and presentation of the character is that at first glance, he seems like a typical clown, which is why he was able to draw children to him. Skarsgard's Pennywise is so obviously evil and creepy that you can't understand why kids wouldn't run away from him screaming.I was willing to give this movie a chance, but it was a disappointment.",It

338,TheMovieDoctorful,"My Favorite Film of 2017, The Best Hollywood Blockbuster in 8 Years",10,10 November 2018,"IT (2017) is a film much like Halloween (2018) where I went into it highly skeptical. The trailers and TV spots I had seen of the film made the film seem like a cheapened jump-scare fest. Stephen King's masterpiece has been my favorite book ever since I first read it back in Freshman year of High School and I've only began to love and appreciate it more and more since then. This film had almost impossible standards to reach. I went in, waiting to be disappointed, and somehow...I got home from the movie shaking and sobbing at how outstanding this film was. Unlike Halloween (2018), IT (2017) didn't suck. In fact, this was, in my opinion, the best mainstream Hollywood blockbuster in 7 years. I know that's both a grand statement to make, but...What else can I say?The acting is all outstanding. There's not a single bad or even ""just okay"" performance in the bunch and, much like the timeless and masterful book, it's impossible to find a character you can't relate or sympathize for. On top of that, the chemistry between The Losers Club couldn't be more natural and heartwarming, with a lot of their relationships being surprisingly complex. They were everything I wanted and more. The standouts for me would have to be Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben Hanscom and Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh. Growing up, Ben was always my favorite character in the book; the honorable and brave Knight in Shining Armor, risking life, limb and reputation for whom he loves and what he believes to be right. Jeremy Ray Taylor did a perfect job realizing the character's shining idealism and kindness, he was the moral center of a team full of already lovable and selfless people. Sophia Lillis gives one of the finest performances I have seen from a child actress in years as Beverly Marsh. She did a wonderful job capturing Beverly's strength, intelligence, charisma and, above all, her stubborn streak. Beverly in the novel is a natural rebel who's almost infamous for how non-compliant she is and Lillis did a wonderful job fully becoming this character. Jaeden Lieberher as Bill Denbrough and Nicholas Hamilton as Henry Bowers are close runners up in stealing the show. Lieberher is a wonderfully sympathetic and adorkable lead and Hamilton an intimidating and truly creepy side antagonist. Hamilton in particular really surprised me with how intimidating and chilling he was as a villain. Bonus praise should be given to Jackson Robert Scott as Bill's brother Georgie. This is pretty much the cutest child I've ever seen and his final confrontation with his brother Bill shows an incredible amount of emotional range and power for an actor so young. It's impossible for me to watch without crying.Of course, the real question is how is Bill Skarsgaard as Pennywise? All I can say is ""Tim Curry Who?"" Not only is Skarsgaard's Pennywise inginitely scarier than Curry, he's infinitely funnier too. Advertising made Skarsgaard's Pennywise appear as a Freddy Krueger-esque character, an outwardly grotesque demon who no sane child would approach. However, the film's Pennywise comes off far more light hearted at times. Even approachable and friendly, if eccentric, in his introductory scene with Georgie. Fans wanting a horrific, nightmarish Pennywise will be just as satisfied as those wanting a funny, deceptively humorous Pennywise.IT (2017) also uses its CGI wonderfully. While a lot of films use CGI as a crutch, IT (2017) uses it as an effective and inventive tool for a really chilling and twisted imagination. Pennywise is definitely no ordinary clown, and IT (2017) takes full advantage of just how otherworldly, inhuman and alien a monster he truly is. This is probably the most artistically impressive use of CGI I've seen in a film since the Star Wars prequels.Even if you're not looking to be scared, the film is still exceptional. There's a real emotional punch to the story and the arcs and relationship of the characters that, horror fan or not, is incredibly easy to get invested in. Above all, IT (2018) is a film about abuse and abandonment, and the importance in camaraderie and the compassion in our loved ones in helping us survive them. Pennywise isn't just a spooky clown that eviscerates children; he's a living, breathing manifestation of abuse and trauma, hence why he always strikes when these children are alone and hence why the adults of Derry (Complicit in the abuse against the town's children) cannot see him. The Losers Club have to fight this horrible abuse abuse together, directly at its source; not to destroy it, but to ward it off enough for it to not become a constantly violent and destructive presence in their lives. It is no coincidence that Pennywise re-appears to wreak havoc in their lives as adults, a metaphor for the lingering traumas that can exist from abuses that could be years or even decades into the past. It's telling that the scariest scenes in the film aren't the ones revolving around Pennywise (Nightmarish and Hellish, though they may be), but the more subtle, unnerving and intolerable scenes involving Beverly's manipulative and deeply predatory father. Pennywise himself is at his most frightening at the very end where, for a moment in his battle with The Losers Club, his head shifts into the demonic visage of Al Marsh, grinning in a position of power and control at a traumatized Beverly.I encourage everyone who's old enough to please see this movie, there really is something in it for everyone. It's hilarious to the point of laughing out loud, terrifying to the point of screaming and emotional to the point of crying. It's one of the best films of the decade and I can hardly wait for Part II. An outstanding masterpiece on every level, IT (2018) could very well be a defining classic for our decade, a title it most certainly deserves. It's an emotional, terrifying, hilarious howl of a ride.",It

This was the best King source material EVER, and the TV version was a joke. This first-part attempt at the source material is infinitely better, from the casting to the direction to the production design, etc. It's a little odd to take the childhood setting from the late 1950s to the late 1980s, but whatever. The screenplay also shortchanges the backstory of the Mike Hanlon character, but whatever. There are some other changes which don't hurt the narrative, but readers of the book will wonder WHY they were made (i.e. Neiboldt Street house, etc.). And yes, for the readers of the novel, THAT SCENE is not included, either. Whatever. The screenplay does a good job with the child characters, allowing the child actors to shine in their roles (again, with the exception of the short-changed Mike Hanlon character here -- racism?!). The film looks good, cinematography- wise, and again, the production design is awesome even with the time shift to the 1980s. At times, though, it feels like you're watching STAND BY ME or CARRIE even. Was that intentional? Whatever. You should enjoy this movie, although the Pennywise demise is a little strange at the end, hollow as it should be. Too bad we have to wait so long for the second act.",It

341,Svenstadt,add 'S.H.' and you have what this movie is,3,16 September 2017,"Where to begin. Every low-budget movie cliché is in this movie. It is just your typical, annoying, teenager slasher movie that I hated growing up. The best part (and scariest) was at the beginning when the kid gets his arm bitten off and dragged into the storm drain by Pennywise. (BTW no indication of who Pennywise is or where he comes from in the movie, only that he is a figment of the children's fears).These teenagers make liberal use of 'f' word about as much as the Big Lebowski does.Of course there is the typical every-child's-home-life is messed up cliché', and there's the town bully cliché', and the tomgirl cliché',and all that sappy Hallmark-style acting. There's the obsessive-compulsive Jewish friend cliché', the Magical Negro cliché',there's no end to it. The studious fat kid cliché'.This movie is basically summed up like this: autonomous kids with no parental supervision wander around town in the style of Goonies, but only with less purpose and drive, and with some jilted dialogue to explain what they're doing. Supposedly, this clown only appears in town every 27 years (according to research the group does with newspaper archives and microfilm). Again, the movie ends with no better explanation than in the beginning. Oh, it likes the town's storm drains for some reason......At the end, through a process I refer to as Digital Judaism, aka special effects, lol, they manage to kill this thing, and if you can figure out who put in the killing blows I will give you $500, because the camera work and/or screenplay is terrible. The only thing I look forward to is more movies with that tomgirl, because she was very charming and cute and I want to see what she looks like all grown up.",It
342,joshbarton15,Falters a little as a work of pure terror but truly soars as a coming-of-age film,9,10 September 2017,"Floating red balloons, a clown's face paint and high-pitched laugh are all rather innocent items in such a troublesome world. Throw them into an adaptation of Stephen King's It however, and they become much more sinister and unsettling than you could ever possibly imagine. It is the latest horror phenomenon to be unleashed upon the world and if you haven't heard of it, you must have been living under a rock. King's novel is regarded as one of the scariest of all time so would they be able to do a similar job with this film adaptation?When children start disappearing in the small town of Derry, a group of bullied kids, who refer to themselves as ""The Losers Club"", band together to take down the monster responsible, which has taken the form of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard).While it may not be as terrifying as the marketing would lead you to believe, there is no denying that It is certainly one of the most unsettling and sadistic films in recent years. The very sense of a monstrous clown praying on and devouring children is enough to make you shudder but when they decide to present it in such a graphic manner, it all becomes even more horrific.As we all know, there is much more to horror films than just jump scares and director Andy Muschietti fully understands this, his film offering an array of techniques that mean Pennywise will get under your skin by more than just making you jump. Muschietti utilises the musical work of Benjamin Wallfisch and Chung-hoon Chung's cinematography to great effect, particularly whenever Pennywise makes an appearance. There is a fair share of CGI used in It which, rather disappointingly, takes the edge off some of the film's major set-pieces however, It remains a well crafted horror film.Coming to the performances, It features a suitably unhinged turn from Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the Clown. The subtlety of some of his more sinister moments make the moments he lets loose much more impactful, certainly giving Tim Curry a run for his money as the best incarnation of the character.The real star of It though is the extremely talented group of child actors assembled for ""The Losers Club"". We spend pretty much the entire film with these kids so they had to make sure they casted actors with enough screen presence, even in their youthful years. The group share such a wonderful chemistry, both the moments of banter and care towards one another feeling so genuine that you can't help but root for them to take Pennywise down. They were all really good here but Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia ""Amy Adams Jr"" Lillis and Finn Wolfhard, who we all know from Stranger Things, were the true standouts for me.It falters a little as a work of pure terror, the disturbing nature of the film striking much more of a chord for me, but it soars as a coming-of-age film, thanks to the writing and performances of the main group of characters. Bring on the second chapter!",It
343,FilmBuff0409,If you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie,4,30 April 2019,"This movie is pretty much 2 hours of little kids running around screaming and yelling obscenities at each other. Not sure what the appeal of a group of young kids coming together to fight the bad guys. It's not at all realistic for one, and it's just kind of annoying. I know I'm the odd man out on this one but I just can't get myself to believe that a bunch of 12 year olds actually talk like that, or have the attention span to dig into the mystery of It and go after it. No kid would ever go into a scary looking house where they know a killer clown is hiding. It did have some jump scares, cheap but effective the first time.Now, that being said this is definitely one of the better Stephen King adaptations, but if you're a reader, the book is a lot scarier and slightly more believable. I'm looking forward to part 2, an adult cast should bring this story to life a bit more.",It

345,contactmaz,A truly awful film that must rank as one of the worst Stephen King films.... ever!,1,30 October 2017,"A really awful film with an awful story-line. The original film was miles better and I am shocked at the rating it has received on IMDb, really shocked. The acting was terrible and the children's acting was atrocious which leads me to suspect that they were either related to the director or a huge amount of nepotism occurred. The children had no clue how to act and the story line was boring, bland and empty, the effects were not there, there was nothing thrilling or exciting, nothing to do any of the things that should be expected from an overrated film like this. Really disappointed and absolutely recommend that this is a film ""NOT TO WATCH"". Give this a miss and watch the original or read the book. OMG - Just can't get over the crappy child-acting! My kids do better when they want something! I can't believe I actually watched this all the way through :(",It
346,barbagvido,"It is pretty good, but a bit too conventional",8,17 September 2017,"It is a new adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name about a mysterious entity that shows up every 27 years to feed on children. Sometimes in the form of something they are most afraid off and sometimes just in the form of the clown and then this group of kids tries to put an end to the whole thing.I had extremely high expectations that only increased when I heard about all the great reviews. And it's by no means a bad movie, but it certainly is a bit of a disappointment. The story isn't very faithful to the book, but it mostly keeps to the spirit of the novel and contains the essential elements. Adapting that book onto the screen is no easy job, so I'm gonna be a bit forgiving. One thing this movie nailed though is the characters. That's the best thing about this movie. The characters and the performances. Every member of The Losers Club has their own personality and everyone stands out. But still, not entirely (Mike was very underdeveloped). Still, everyone shines in their roles. And Bill Skarsgård is incredible as Pennywise. He's not always terrifying, but he did a fantastic job. I thought both him and Tim Curry in the 1990 TV miniseries were great in their own ways. And they both fit their versions perfectly. Since 1990 version is more of a fun Halloween movie, Curry is a lighter and sillier spin on the character. But this version is darker and creepier, and so is Skarsgård's Pennywise. The characters are a joy to watch, they absolutely nailed that aspect of adapting. And, as I said, it's not easy to adapt this book. But I think they were playing a bit too safe here.The cosmic horror aspect of the book was one of the most fascinating and terrifying to me, so I was really wondering how they would translate that to a movie. The problem is, they didn't even try. And that's why it feels a bit too ordinary and conventional. If that part was done right, it would have been amazing. Maybe they are saving that for the second part of the story, who knows? In case you didn't know this was only half of the story and the book has a part when they are kids and when they are all grown up, 27 years later. I hope they are saving more mature and creepy parts for the sequel. Also, I was very disappointed by the horror aspect as a whole. The opening scene was very disturbing and creepy, but the movie just doesn't retain that atmosphere. I wanted this movie to get under my skin and give me shivers, but you just don't really feel that sense of dread. You've got some fun scenes with jump-scares, but it's never really as terrifying as I expected it to be. And something the director doesn't realize (same mistake can also be seen in his previous film, Mama) is that the more you show the monster, less scary it becomes. And Pennywise is shown way too much. He's creepy at the beginning, but eventually becomes just fun to watch. And that's not really a good thing for a horror movie.But nevertheless, this is still a fun and enjoyable movie that I will definitely be coming back to. They got most of the characters, themes and story on point, but the scares are where this movie really disappoints. What was supposes to be a unique, refreshing and terrifying experience turns into a fun (at times laugh-out-loud funny), but too ordinary and conventional experience. Still, I had a good time and will be coming back to it. It just wasn't what I expected.",It
347,intrepidami,"Decent, although very flawed",4,22 September 2017,"None of the kids can act! As I watched this I was thinking how bland they all were and thinking how strikingly different they are from the superb cast of Stranger Things.The bad people are way, way over the top bad. Especially the bully gang and leader. This is small town America. I'm thinking where's the local police and then it turns out the kid's father is the local police and he's not tolerant of his sons behavior at all. So there's no way this kid and his fiends would be able to pull off what they're shown going around doing. The implication of course is his father being so strict made him into a raging psychopath. The characterization was all wrong. I grew up knowing the local cops kids. They might have been jerks and acted like they're crap doesn't smell, but they also were expected to toe the line by their parent! A phone call to dad, this all goes away. For good and beyond.It's a swimming marathon to get through. It's literally 40 minutes too long.But the most damning thing...it's just not that scary! So you need something else..and it doesn't have anything else! Also I'd like to point out while they kinda sort of figure out why Pennywise is there, there's no explanation how a supremely powerful demonic being is taken out by a bunch of kids? I can think of about a billion ways Pennywise could have killed them all with zero effort. So no them growing courage wasn't satisfying at all. YOU KNOW HE'S NOT DEAD, AND COMING BACK FOR ROUNDS 2-15 The only CONCRETE thing we do know is they plan a sequel! You can't just fight a supremely powerful supernatural being into submission.

What I didn't know was that ""IT"" is just an evil entity that can take multiple forms to scare kids. Think of a boggart from Harry Potter where it turns into what you fear the most, this is just way more evil.The movie reminded me of Stranger Things but had a much darker tone with more mature adult themes, such as a relationship between a father and daughter, the loss of parents, and the death of a younger brother. The young cast all do a fantastic job with a few funny one liners to break the tension.There were a few good scares and intense scenes which I enjoyed. One minor problem I had was some of the actions these kids take in certain moments. However, they are just kids as opposed to adults making ridiculous decisions in a horror movie.Even if you don't enjoy horror movies, I think you should give this a shot. It's a little on the bloody side but nothing over the top, aka ""Saw"". A good solid horror movie.",It
349,drpakmanrains,Victim Of Overkill,6,12 September 2017,"As a huge fan of ""Stand By Me"", I joined the crowd of first weekend viewers of this Stephen King story, at least the first half. I was somewhat disappointed, for a number of reasons. First, like too many movies today, there is too much noise and CGI. The fact that the technology has become so advanced, should not mean that it is used more than needed. There are so many jolts and excessive morphing scenes that would be totally impossible of any creature, that it becomes more like a ride in an amusement park dark house, with ugly images and creatures trying to grab you, along with loud noises. It's not scary, really. There is nothing psychologically disturbing. Second, while it may follow the book, having about a dozen kids make it hard to clearly differentiate their identities and characteristics. There was, admittedly, some humorous moments, and many were likable, but unlike ""Stand By Me"", you don't get to care much for more than one or two of them. Third, too many scenes were very dark, which may make scares easier, but hard for the viewer to see. And personally, Pennywise was too advanced mechanically to be believable, and hence really scary, at least for me. I really wanted to like this film, and I didn't hate it. It just suffers from what so many genre films suffer from today: Overdoing the effects at the cost of the story and depth of the characters.",It

These kids are the heart and soul of the film, and they make it what it is. Yes, Pennywise is f*cking terrifying, but it's the kids that take this movie to the next level. Something I wasn't expecting from this movie was just how funny it was going to be. And comedy like this in a horror movie could easily have detracted from the terror of what was happening, but director Andy Muschietti knew how to mesh the two drastically different tones together in order to get a product that ultimately works. Muschietti's direction is another strong aspect about this movie that cannot go unmentioned. It's because of Muschietti that It doesn't feel like a stereotypical horror movie. He crafts a great story that really elevates the movie towards being something more.

354,gerry_barnaby,One of the best Adaptation of IT,9,8 September 2017,"WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE, COME WITH ME AND YOUR FLOAT TOO! Wow when i first heard they we're doing a remake of Tim Curry original penny wise IT i was a little sceptical about it working, this was because of recent reboot and makes from other films haven't been that great. With this Reboot of the TV mini series IT that starred Tim curry as the terrifying clown i'm glad to say that this is very ""book accurate"" which the TV series wasn't; this will please IT fans across the world. What i will say is that this version of Pennywise's character play by the young brother of (Alex Skarsgård star of Tarzan ), Bill Skarsgård who's playing a very dark version which is brilliant has this heavy influence from nightmare on elm st films with a psychological nightmare feel that makes it very dark and creepy.This works well with the brilliant acting for the child stars who some have a story of their own to which gives them a reason to come together, this is great because it follow what the original had where together they are strong which work for the story.Another thing i did notice is that it doesn't quite follow what the original IT done which is brilliant for this film as it adds something different that doesn't seem like you're seeing the same film again, although it does have some element like the town bully which seem to be the original part from the film as the character have a different feel. With penny wise himself it's all down to attention to detail that make this version more dark that Tim Curry which i was impressed with as Bill Skarsgård bring a more sinister feel to the character, it this head slightly down and eye looking up just under the eye brows look with a sinister smile and grin that make this version better that Tim Curry version in my opinion.Yes i just said better as this version actually give this film this psychological creepy play with your mind theme that gives you shivers down your spine and give it an edge, special with the Japanese film cinematography with lighting and shadows it really give this film this great feel of Immersion that draws you in.As great as this film is there is one element that for me lets the film down just slightly but i think this is because I've seen the original film i know the story, but for someone that has never seen the original TV mini film i think this will be frightening for them.What also give this film a very hard core creepy psychological feel is It's lair, there was just something about this area of the film that gave this very dark child nightmare feel which just added to penny wise nature, this was a great addition to the film that the original didn't really step upon which give this film something new. So if you a fan of the original IT i highly recommend this film as it a great film adaptation that is close to the book. Dislikes : My only complaint for me in my opinion is the film isn't as Frightening as i hope it would be, but does have a psychological creepiness to it with does give it some frightening elements. I feel this film should've of had an 18 cert to go full on dark, maybe this could've of been truly frightening as i do feel the 15 cert held the film darkness back a little.",It
355,rabbitmoon,Starts well but gets boring fast once you realise there is no goal,6,8 September 2017,"The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty. The cinematography and acting is great. Its watchable in an afternoon Netflix kind of way. But there is no real gist, goal or drive to the story, it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene, goalless and drifty like the string-along nature of a Police Academy film.

Stephen King's fantastic novel comes to life in the grisly and traumatic hallucinations of unbridled terror, balanced perfectly with a child-like comic undertone which lures you into comfortable self-security before hurling you down a well of fear. Bill Skarsgard's incredible performance as the eponymous 'It' is as uncomfortable and hypnotic as the Dead Lights themselves, fully immersing himself into the character to draw the most genuine and reactionary terror from his co-stars, made up of some of the best young talent working today.

The boat flows into a gutter, and as Georgie tries to retrieve it, we get our first glimpse of It in the gutter. After a little playful banter, It grabs Georgie, rips off his arm, then drags him into the gutter. Fun stuff.Bill has a group of friends, guy from Stranger Things, Jewish guy, preppy guy. They're taunted by a group of bigger kids led by Keifer Sutherland (wait, that's Stand by me). It's the last day of summer, and they decide what better way to celebrate than to continue to search for Bill's missing little brother. Along the way, the befriend fat friendless guy, girl, and token black guy.This group all have something in common in that they've all had run ins with It. They decide, as kids do when someone is terrorizing them, to investigate and try to kill this supernatural monster. Along the way, scary stuff happens until such point that enough scary stuff happens to fill the ~2 hours and things have to end.Oh, and there's a chapter 2 (read: sequel) when they grow up. Yeah, apparently It feeds on kids for a year, then rests for 27 years. But, you know, otherwise the town's great!Really, it's not that bad. I'm just having a little fun. For what it is, it's actually entertaining. The kids have great chemistry, Bill Skarsgård is great as Pennywise, there are some nice scary scenes, but not so scary as to be a full on horror movie.I think my issue is that, for all the power Pennywise has, it just seems like he/it is just stringing them along until such time the movie makes its 2 hours, at such time the fun stops. Yeah, there's something about kids not being fearful and that's why they were able to fight back. There's also something about them banding together. So yeah, being together and not being afraid. But throughout the movie, Pennywise had ample time to divide and conquer, like the myriad kids before. But for some reason he decides not to do that for these kids. Why? Maybe I missed it? Maybe it's in the book? Maybe it's covered in Chapter 2? Maybe it's in the Tim Curry TV version? Dunno.I will watch It Chapter 2.

The first half, which this movie is concerned with, was always the stronger half and I think this version is probably just as good, if not better than the original TV movie. It's certainly more gruesome and scary.I'm not sure Tim Curry's Pennywise has been upstaged though. Bill Skarsgard has done a good job but I think Curry's is hard to beat.IT 2017 is refreshingly old-school, in that it focuses on character and story, unlike too many recent ""horror"" movies. It is beautifully shot and superbly acted but perhaps could move at a slightly better pace.IT will divide opinions due to story vs screenplay issues but it's definitely not a bad remake.",It
361,Endless_01,"Not so much a scary movie, but more of suspense and interesting scenes.",6,10 August 2019,"To clarify, I haven't read the book and I haven't seen the original movie from years ago. So I entered this movie with an open mind and ready to see what it was like.Starting with the positive points; it has good scenes, interesting and creative, with excellent dynamics among the actors who are able to present the natural qualities of children their age, some are funny, others are shy, others worry a lot, and others are just annoying. Which is good, giving an excellent touch of fluidity and tangibility to the characters. Cinematography does a good job of building the scene, showing each of the environments and creating fascinating locations for each shot that occurs and creating good tension for the viewer. As another review of the film said very well, It feels at times, like a collection of scenes rather than a complete horror movie. The movie entertains, although its construction is very, very slow. With two hours of duration, it's not until halfway through the movie that things get tense, and when they get tense, they don't get so tense.This is where I think the movie fails. It's not scary, really not. Despite having good actors and special effects, the film completely destroys the sense of fear by giving a strange combination of gore and comedy; presenting itself more like a grotesque play than a disturbing one. And oh god, it makes a lot of use of jumpscares, which is perfect for stressing, but not entertaining. In itself, the movie lacks a truly frightening atmosphere, and feels more like an adventure movie than a horror movie, failing quite a bit there.In short, it's an entertaining, decent movie, but I don't consider it a good horror movie. It's probably good for young people who want to be introduced to the genre, but after that, it's more of an adventure comedy.",It
362,Adam-09265,You don't get many horrors this good anymore,8,23 May 2019,"Most of the best horrors in history are mainly from decades ago, nowadays it's all about relying on jump scares without understanding uncanny valley or ambiguity when connecting with an audience. Uncanny vagueness is the key to an audiences weakness not sudden loud noises.Stephen King's IT was a gem to watch with Tim Curry portraying the familiar clown Pennywise and when i heard that they were doing it again, like an updated version i couldn't help but be sceptical. Then watching it i have to say i am impressed. The story was on a strong point with a few cliche jump scares yes but the thrill was still there. Bill Skarsgard's portray of Pennywise was brilliant, i'd say Oscar worthy.This version doesn't have as much cognitive dissonance as the 90s one did as it favours a more darker tone. Although that doesn't change it from being decent, not perfect but the best horror i've seen in a while.",It

364,andrewrye-06535,Lost in Translation,3,28 October 2017,"I had been anticipating this movie for a while. Although flawed, as most Steven King adaptations are, the first IT (1990) was headed in the right direction. I remember thinking, with a bit of work that could have been one of the great adaptions and when I heard they were re-doing it, I was very hopeful.Sadly, it really is worse, despite the age of the first one, it kind of worked in that time period. And that is the start of the problem I had. I had to keep reminding myself that it was set in the 1980s as there was no obvious tie in. Music, TV Ads, fashion etc. And when one of the lead characters cycles on an old Schwinn, that threw me a little. I did note this was probably a nod to Steven King who includes a Schwinn in just about every one of his early stories. And the sloppy production and continuity(yes I did notice late brand products at the chemist) didn't help.There were too many characters and at times I was probably watching the wrong one which meant I couldn't flow with the story. It seemed like, to get the right bunch of 'losers' together they tried to cover every eventuality - stutter, asthmatic, sick kid, nerd, black kid and a girl to finish it off. The Goonies spring to mind. The characters were mismatched and there age indeterminate. At times they seemed to act like prepubescent children on a summer adventure, and their reaction to various scenarios was difficult to relate to. When they all start yelling at each other that they need to get out, wouldn't you run? They didn't. More than once too. The girl was just wrong. Pretty, more mature than the rest and managed a great hair cut with scissors in a moment of anger. And far too wordy for kids of this age and era. Long speeches that were done at the most inappropriate times with language that instantly sounded unnatural. And where were their parents? The protagonist group were typical. Three men, one a sadistic leader with an abusive father and the other two were dumb red neck lackeys. It was off putting to go from what appeared to be a goonies adventure to the uncomfortable father daughter scene. Again, who was it aimed at? I won't go into plot holes, that's been adequately covered by reviewers elsewhere, and there are plenty of plot holes.On a good note, Pennywise was well played by Mr Skaarsguard. I didn't mind the over use of CGI, it was mostly handled well.It just felt like it was trying too hard. The novel is long and very very descriptive but not everything needs to be included. There's two ways they could have approached this which would have made it a lot better. Turned it into a 3 part Movie series and developed the characters, time line and mood better. Or, tighten it up with less characters (with less issues that aren't relevant), tighter production values, trimmed story line and not such a drawn out ending.I gave it a 3 ... pity really",It
365,cappiethadog,It hurts,7,24 April 2019,"A crouching little boy picks the wrong time to be rational. It's just a clown, he thinks, nothing unusual about that. There is no such thing as monsters, George Denbrough(Jackson Robert Scott) decides, not wanting to feel like the ""wuss"" his older brother(Jaeden Lieberter) called him, right before he fetched the paraffin from their cellar for a paper boat that needed waterproofing, now in the painted man's clutches. After all, there was no monster in the cellar. Horror movies conditioned George to be afraid of the dark, like all children since the advent of motion pictures. But his kid fears differ from kid fears past. What goes bump in the night changes with every proceeding generation. ""It"", set in 1989, not 1957, the original setting for the Stephen King novel, reveals the fallacy of the period piece that the story purported to be. Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddie Krueger are the monsters that George fears; plausible monsters, all the more terrifying because they are recognizably human, more so than their predecessors, literary ones, such as the werewolf, the vampire, the mummy, and Frankenstein. Those two glowing pinpricks of white in the cellar recesses could be the eyes of a serial killer. It turned out to be nothing; just paint cans, when George pointed his flashlight at the storage shelf.On a Derry theater marquee, ""Nightmare on Elm Street 5"" is playing, an eighties period touch that conveys how Pennywise(Bill Skaarsgard) has more in common with contemporary horror movie villains than his peers of yesteryear. The murderous clown could be John Wayne Gacy. The Denbrough brothers are part of the slasher film generation. As George walks tentatively down those cellar steps, there is a self-awareness; he is every screaming female or shouting male who didn't simply leave the house to avoid danger. George is living the trope. Bad things happen in the dark. In order to be safe, he needs to be outside where it's lighted. When Frankenstein's monster threw that little girl in the lake, play was his intent, not murder. Unlike George's counterpart from 1957, this updated character has seen his fair share of gore. He grew up with depiction after depiction, often grisly, of deliberate killings. Betty Ripson is missing. George knows that adults are the real monsters. They were hockey masks. They wear ugly long-sleeved sweaters. Monsters from vintage horror movies rarely, if ever, finished the job on children. The juxtaposition of Pennywise and Freddie Krueger(Robert Englund), in this new adaptation of ""It"", breaks down a fourth wall in King's 1986 novel that nobody had noticed. Frankenstein kills the girl, but her drowning wasn't premeditated. The clown, just like Freddie Krueger, and unlike a vampire circa 1957, has no limits to the satiation of his bloodlust. And there is intention. Pennywise lures George close enough with the recovered paper boat as bait and bites his hand clean off the arm. The boy crawls away in vain before Pennywise drags him into the sewer, leaving behind a mix of blood and rainwater on the street. ""It"", in retrospect, was always dressed in eighties clothing. Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" came out in 1984. And in 1985, ""The Goonies"", directed by Richard Donner, practically provides the template for Stephen King's tome about good and evil.Filmmaker and dad Steven Spielberg, in 2002, wanted to please moms, so for the twentieth anniversary of ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"", he digitally-erased the guns held by FBI men and replaced them with walkie-talkies throughout the penultimate sequence, in which Elliot(Henry Thomas) and the boys race towards their barricaded area on two-wheels. After all, it's a children's movie, Spielberg thought. When E.T. uses his heartlight to elevate their bicycles into the sky, what are the feds going to do: Shoot them down? To make ""The Goonies"" more kid-friendly, however, whitewashing all potentiality for violence is an impossibility, because like Andy Muschetti's adaptation of ""It"", this group of outcasts, too, face a monster, albeit a human one: Mama Fratelli(Anne Ramsey). Pennywise lived in the house on Neibolt Street. The Fratelli brothers, Jake(Robert Daivi) and Francis(Joe Pantaliano) and their mother, wanted by the law, take up temporary residence at a restaurant, shuttered-down for the summer. Arguably, the gang's matriarch nearly matches the clown's malevolence towards children. If necessary, she would kill. Under the flimsiest pretenses of being a restaurant, Mama, the waitress from hell, asks the boys for their order. Water is the near-consensus choice. Only Mouth(Corey Feldman), the clueless wiseacre, misses all the signals and goes into shtick mode, pretending to be an old world Sicilian accustomed to fine Italian cuisine. With one hand, the crotchety old lady silences the boy by making both cheeks meet, forcing his lips to purse, his eyes to pop, and his disposition to change, while she pulls out a switchblade. ""We only serve tongue here,"" Mama announces. This is no idle threat; we believe her. She put bullet holes into at least one of the two federal agents. She seems fully capable of leaving Mouth tongue-less. That's because the mother is a genuine sociopath, who constantly tests the parameters of a designated PG-rated film. This realism, the possibility of dying by felonious, not accidental means is what sets ""The Goonies"" apart from other children's movies, and closer to the filmic world of Derry, Maine. Noting their prepubescence, the old woman turns lewd, asking the boys if they ""like tongue"", a joke seemingly about cannibalism until Andy(Kerri Green) mistakenly kisses Mikey(Sean Astin) at the wishing well, turning the bon mot into a double entendre. Back home, before their adventure starts, Chunk(Jeff Cohen) drops Mrs. Walsh's David statue and his ""junk"" breaks off. ""It's mom's favorite part,"" Mikey complains. Chunk gets razzed for gluing it back on, but if you take a closer look, the reattachment perfectly mimics the state that Mike is in. During the kiss, it becomes Mikey's favorite part, too. The growing pains of a shy tween like Mike Walsh undergoes, ""The Goonies"", with ninja precision, encapsulates in that Michelangelo nude. Stephen King is not a ninja. The unfilmable rite of passage scene remains unfilmable. In ""It"", the soundtrack of reaching all the bases, and ""it"" itself, that runs wild through the young boys' imagination is old-school rap. Nobody is going to ""Bust a Move"" on Beverly Marsh(Sophia Lillis), who sunbathes, oblivious to her feminine wiles, after an afternoon swim in the reservoir, because they have no idea how to bust a move. That is the dissonance of the King novel. It's a fifties period-piece, in which the characters are not only too bloodied, but also too precocious, and too young to make Caligula blush.Sloth(John Matuszak) is not ""it"". The hideously disfigured son, the forgotten Martelli, secreted away in his private room, with only the television for company, could be one of Pennywise's waking nightmare manifestations. Surely, he would scare the bejesus out of Stan(Wyatt Oleff), since the ogre-like man is abstract, just like the woman in the painting. Outside the gilded frame, an artfully-rendered body is a deformed body that becomes the moving focal point of dislocation in the physical world. ""An it, a giant it; they got it chained to the wall,"" Mike exclaims to his older brother Bran(Josh Brolin), before they go back inside to resume the search for One-Eyed Willie's treasure. The proverbial ""it"" in the King novel is a gargantuan spider. The clown is a manifestation of that arachnoid, a she. Interestingly enough, when Mikey notifies Mama that he needs to use the bathroom, Chunk discourages the visit, explaining to the proprietor that ""they might have daddy long legs in them"". In the made-for-television 1990 adaptation of ""It"", the arachnoid could easily be mistaken for a he. The spider is androgynous. Mama Fratelli is androgynous, too. All the boys answer, ""Thank you mam,"" when she sets down four cups of brown water, except for Mikey, who mistakenly says, ""Thank you, sir."" At the pirate ship, later in the film, Mama points a gun at the children, who are busy enriching themselves with treasure. She would pull the trigger, or rather, it would pull the trigger. Mama Fratelli would bite George's hand off if he had a diamond in it. The transference act that King had performed gets negated by moving ""It"" to the late-eighties. ""The Goonies"" latency that was always there seems less like a dislocation of content, since violence committed against children in film and literature contemporaneous to the fifties is something of an anachronism. It's not now; both in art and life, unfortunately.The Chilean dictator in Pablo Larrain's ""Tony Manero"" goes to a bijou that only plays ""Saturday Night Fever"". He believes Tony Manero(John Travolta) is real. Pablo feels the authenticity in John Badham's film about the NYC disco scene. Travolta's next film ""Grease"", directed by Randal Kleiser, was a seventies film about the fifties. But the new songs written especially for the adapted Broadway show: ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" and ""You're the One I Want"", turns the period piece into a period piece in quotations. They're too contemporary. ""Grease"" is a 1978 film about the fifties that has a distinct seventies burnish. The dictator senses the dishonesty. He hates Danny Zuko. The greasers are not good enough. The film projectionist doesn't know that he's in for IT.",It
366,anupapu8,Its Good,8,16 September 2017,"IT - Anybody who is expecting a proper horror film without knowing about the source material (which i myself haven't read but have enough research on it) is going to get disappointed. Because its basically a 'Coming Of The Age' film with a very scary clown in it. But let me be very specific. Horror elements were only secondary in the film , Drama is the primary thing . And because i knew this before seeing it , i liked it a lot.Its a different kind of Horror film. Its a R rated film , with pretty much a lot of violence, with kids being in the lead and a Clown who is killing them. Director Andy Muschietti was not into the usual JUMP SCARE thing (Thankfully). There were no false dream sequence , no door shutting scares , no unnecessary loud sound design. Its actually very realistic . I mean as realistic as a horror movie with a scary clown can get. The characters in the movie doesn't do foolish things to get killed. I mean yes there were some foolish step taken by the characters but come on , they were just 13 year old kid, we have to give them that much freedom. You can understand how much i appreciate the things this movies doesn't do , because Horror Movies have become very stereotypical in last two decades , but thankfully Warner Bros has taken a different root. They are trying to be realistic and sensible about it. They were doing the same thing in the Conjuring series , and they did the same here. As much as the movie is about 7 kids tackling with a Clown with crocodile teeth , the movie has so many different themes. Every kid has his own demon in real life to tackle. Somebody is tackling with the trauma of Lost brother , somebody is tackling a father who sexually abuse her , somebody want to get rid of over protective mom , somebody want to tackle his father's high expectation. Someone tackles with racism And lastly the whole group is tackling the Bully seniors. Even after all these problems the kids have a great time hanging out with each other , if only for sometime. The Jokes came in regular intervals . And Andy Muschietti masterfully juggled the serious moments with comic ones , even mixing them and playing at the same time. The cast is exceptional , so much that you will feel bad about them being replaced by senior actors in the sequel . But dame i would be not honest if i don't say it , Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh was my favorite. Yes i know she was the only girl in the club , and it was very typical of me to select her as my favorite. But i cant help it. She was awesome. And also there has been many anticipations for who will be the actors to play these kids in the sequel , i just want two actors for now - JESSICA CHASTAIN as Beverly & CHADWICK BOSEMAN (black panther) as Mike Hanlon.There may be some complaint with the movie not having enough scary sequences. And that's true. Many people had the same problem with Conjuring 2 . For me IT is even less scarier. But that doesn't degrade the film. It just stop it from being a great film. And this reason shouldn't stop you from watching this film. The film has been set in the State of MAINE , USA a state we see very less in Hollywood , and also the state where Stephen King (writer of IT , the BOOK) . And the movies has a very different and fresh look. Its not too dark , cloudy or again stereotypical like usual horror film. Its like any other film set in Summer Holidays. For the END i would like to add , the movie totally earned its R rating in America and its A certificate in India. It had a lot of blood , curse words (the actual way of 13 year old boys talking) , and a little theme of sexual abuse. Hence the movie is not for kids. At least not at all for kids under 13. I am saying this because i had seen a lot of parents came to this movie with extremely small kids and i don't know at all how they are gonna explain those kids that why the clown is eating the hand of a boy.I am obviously looking forward to the sequel. Which i think will answer more questions which were raised in this part and haven't been answered. 8.1/10By ANuP APu KuMaR",It
367,BlueSkies765,A classic,10,5 May 2019,"The long awaited remake delivered. It 1990 was one of the first scary movies I've seen. It still remains one of my all time favorite horror movies.In this version the scary scenes are more fierce and in your face. You even see kids get hurt, something unheard of back in the day. The fate of the kids was left to your imagination.
Also I love It 1990 because nostalgia plays a huge part. When you're new to watching movies it has more of an impact than when you've seen similar stories. So I can see how younger viewers like this version over the 1990 one.With that being said the heart of the movie is the same. It's about overcoming your fear and about friendship. With Pennywise as the bogeyman he still has a menacing presence.The fear aspect was done brilliantly. It captured an atmosphere of terror where characters felt powerless but at the same time had a sense of urgency of figuring out a way to defeat Pennywise, because they knew they had to deal with it. The buildup from powerless to empowered was nicely directed.This movie also had some scary scenes that are better than It 1990. In some ways I found Pennywise more menacing and some scenarios were downright frightening. You can tell the director really wanted to give this movie its own identity.And the most important part is that the bond of the Losers Club feels genuine and you can relate to when you where a kid spending your summer with friends dealing with a new, scary topic as a kid that you don't have the answers to. A real story with a life lesson is told.Overall I really loved it. Both versions are great in their own way.",It
368,kitellis-98121,I really wanted to love it. But it was a disappointment.,5,12 July 2018,"Perhaps I'm just too old and cynical for this film, but it didn't grab me at all. My mind kept wandering throughout, which is almost unheard of for me, and I was continually distracted by my own internal monologue carping on about overuse of cat-scares, clichés, and unsubtle music. I just couldn't stop analysing it, rather than being sucked-in and captivated - as I was with the Tim Curry version.And there it is: the unavoidable comparison. I was totally 100% committed to enjoying this film on its own terms, and determined to avoid comparing. I loved the idea of a remake, and was ready to fully embrace any changes that they made. I just didn't expect it to be so blah. And as a result, against all my inclinations, I couldn't stop comparing. So here goes...Tim Curry was a better Pennywise, in my opinion, but not by much. I kind of loved what Bill Skarsgard did with the role, and I was very happy with his look. I just felt that Curry had more depth and variation, not to mention humour - which doesn't make him any less creepy.I really connected with the kids in the Curry version. They were far better drawn, had more distinct characters, and gave better and more natural performances. The kids in the remake were okay, and could have been much improved with more coaching and better direction. But they were poorly introduced as characters, and never really made their marks as individuals. so I didn't connect with them at all, with the slight exception of Beverly, who had far more depth and range as a young actress. They also had appalling diction - something that could have been easily fixed with coaching and stronger directing, but the words tumbled carelessly out of their mouths in superfast succession, making it hard to understand what they were saying. As a group they also seemed to lack the chemistry of the kids from the earlier version.Visually it was stunning. Far better in places than the earlier version. But by the end I was bored with the visual style, especially the endless Tim Burton-esq nightmare-gloom-chiq, and was grateful to return to sunlight.The music, as I mentioned before, was heavy-handed and unsubtle, as was the use of CGI, which became almost as annoying and distracting as the terrible stop-motion spider from the earlier version. Music and visual effects - especially in horror films - work best when used minimally and subconsciously. Psychological horror is far scarier when it's suggested, rather than waved in front of your face yelling ""BE SCARED!""But the main reason that this remake is inferior to the original TV miniseries is that it fails to present the two timelines. The original version gave us both timelines, at worst viewed 24 hours apart, although on video and DVD they played as a continuous film. This allowed the viewer to connect with the kids, go through the experience with them, and then reconnect with them as adults and experience a whole bundle of nostalgia and mixed emotions that added many layers of depth to the storytelling and tension to the viewing experience. It had fantastic unity, and made each of the two halves seem fuller because they were filmed and presented as a whole.With the remake and it's sequel/second half being separated by two or more years, all sense of continuity is lost. Even if viewed back-to-back on disc, they are still two entirely separate films, shot years apart, and possibly by different key crew members. If both chapters of the remake had been shot together, it would have been better (and I would have waited to view them as one single film) but the way they've done it just diminishes each of the two parts. Chapter one failed to grab me for many reasons, but mostly, I think, because it was only half of the story and as such was half as good and infinitely less engaging.",It

372,Brevin_Campbell,It just felt to much like Stranger Things,6,20 September 2017,"Im going to be honest you guys I didn't love this one. I went into this with some relative interest in the story. I thought it seemed interesting and the concept was good too. Plus I enjoyed the trailer and the overall way it felt. I knew going in it wasn't going to be a straight horror in fact I wanted it to not be that. I wanted it to be like Stranger Things, but it just never clicked for me. I will start with this the characters here are great. The kids are each very interesting and thought provoking characters in there own right and I really enjoyed that about the movie. I loved watching these kids interact with each other and I thought that was very well done. The entity known as IT was also great too. Bill Skarsgard did a excellent job in his portrayal of this entity. He always had a presence throughout the whole movie and always was scary when he came up. It gave this feeling of intensity throughout that I really loved quite a bit. All the acting was great. I thought everyone gave a exceptional performance in this movie. But despite all of that something just always felt off to me about this movie. There were times when the characters would make certain choices that just felt way to cliché and made no sense. I no that this is a horror movie but at the same time I expected something beyond a simple cliché horror flick. I wanted something a little deeper and this movie just didn't go deep enough. It felt unsatisfying at times and I didn't like that. The movie also feels like it has to hold back cause it trying to be true to the source material too. It like Andy Muschietti had this grand idea but had to pull back cause he needed to be true to the book and the series and so because of that and those factors he couldn't go as far as he wanted too. I wanna say that I do like this movie though. There a lot of cool ideas here and the portrayal of adults in this film was fascinating and I really enjoyed that aspect of the film. But even so the entire last act of this film feels like a strange derailing and was not nearly as interesting as what had built up to all of that. I also felt the ending was terrible too. I really didn't like the way it ended at all. Overall IT was a disappointment for me. A few cool ideas going on but overall not what I really wanted.",It
373,Michael Kenmore,"A decent reboot, but will never hold candle to the great Tim Curry",7,10 September 2017,"I've seen the new movie, IT Chapter One, one late Saturday night, in keeping with the tradition of seeing the horror or thriller movie only on the late night.The movie is obviously better than the broadcast television version in all aspects, due to high production value overall, but one thing is certain.While Bill Skarsgård did a good job portraying the villain, Tim Curry is much more nuanced and thus creepier and scarier. It comes down to characterization.Bill Skarsgård's character is way over the top in characterization, but maybe his portrayal is merely inspired by the novel. Tim Curry's characterization is perfect, which might well be one of the best portrayals of a horror-film villain in cinema history, that includes television. The new movie is fairly faithful to the novel, with plenty of profanity uttered by the young actors. That might shock some prudes, but I don't have a problem with it. I swore a lot when I was a child on the verge of adolescence, as well as similarly curious about sensuality. No child is too (to wit, perfectly) innocent in development. Of course, the new movie had to omit the more explicit scenes that involve sexuality as originated in the novel. Otherwise, there would be the ""moral panic"" protest over the ""tamely filmed and sensibly edited"" (implied) erotic scenes not unlike, say, The Last Temptation of Christ when that film came out in 1988, the same year this new movie takes place at the beginning.I am more into psychological horror with slow pacing, which is so rare as to be non-existent. The classic movies with psychological terror plus slow pacing would be Jaws, The Changeling, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining and Japanese horror Ringu, the latter that to this day I consider one of the scariest movie watching experiences I had (the other ""terrifying"" movie-going experience would be Irreversible and I Stand Alone, both by the French auteur and provocateur Gaspar Noe, and both equally disorienting in harsh content and insane cinematography & editing), because of its mystery that led to the shocking and unexpected twist that blew my mind with my jaw dropping sense of palpable horror. This said, I am very much a jaded moviegoer. This is why I was not even scared or phased when I saw the new movie, thanks to ""cheap"" jump scares with obvious CGI meshed with the makeup effects. Although a few ""lingering"" scenes, such as the bloody bathroom, impressed me in experiencing what it's like to go through the psychological terror.Perhaps if the new IT movie have the emphasis on practical makeup effects, albeit more expensive than CGI, then it would easily scare me as well as many similarly jaded moviegoers who know cheap jump scare scenes when they see it, that cannot even make them jump at the seat. Unfortunately, CGI is the standard visual effects, and that lessened the scare factor of this movie. The good or mediocre ""scariest"" movies with practical makeup effects were last made in the 90's, in particular Hellraiser series, notably Part III.With all this said, the young cast did a fine job, given the intense adapted screenplay with heavy language and other risqué content. I know that if my young nieces and nephews ask me to take them to see this movie, I might hesitate not because of its scary and nightmarish scenes and the villain but because of its language alone that would be a bad influence.I look forward to the second chapter, now that Chapter One is expected to be a big box office hit. It hit all the right notes, but it cannot hold the candle to Tim Curry. He should have returned to the role, instead of a relatively young actor who nearly hams it up portraying Pennywise the Demonic Clown. By the way, although I disagree with the novelist Stephen King's shrill politics lately (he gets a cut of the royalty from the success of the new IT franchise and merchandise), I had to see the new version of IT, because hype -- the first release of the movie teaser and trailer that saw tens of millions of view count -- justifies the commendable quality of this movie.

Tim Curry is an OK actor but he's not as good as Bill Skarsgard. Skarsgard is the best Pennywise ever. This movie is filled with frights and emotions too. It made me think of everything I ever have been afraid of. It also is based on everything the book had, unlike the dumb 1990 version. Georgie's arm being torn off, The clown, the leper, this painting figure, Georgie, Beverly's child molesting abusive dad, and the best final battle scene between the Losers Club and It.

375,scott-sw,Best King Horror Adaptation,9,15 September 2017,"What is It? Well, It is the best Stephen King horror adaptation since Kubrick's over-indulgent The Shining, and It surpasses The Shining on so many levels. We come to the town of Derry, Maine, a town that has six-times the national average of missing people and murders. That has a huge skewing once every 27 years when It stalks food for hibernation. That is according to Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Derry's newest pre-teen denizen. He shares this information with some other kids like Bill (Jaeden Lierbeher), Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), Mike (Chosen Jacobs), Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), and Beverly (Sophia Willis). They are, in fact, the Losers Club because of their age (middle school) and tics. Bill stutters, Eddie is smothered with a hypochondriac mother, and Mike who only has the sin of being black in a very white-bred town. They are all having visions of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard). He tricks them with illusions to create ghastly fear, and he operates from the sewers of the city to get his prey. In fact, one of his recent victims was Bill's little brother, Georgie. Of course, this motion picture only reflects the first half of King's classic novel. A sequel will reveal the second half in which the afore-mentioned come back together as adults to confront It again. If this one is any indication of the sequel, audiences will wait with heavy anticipation. It has a great screenplay penned by Chase Palmer, Careu Fkuanga, and Gary Dauberman that respects the source material and adapts it well to modern times. Even better is the direction offered by Andy Muschietti. I will add kudos to cinematography and editing of Choon-tuk Chung and Jason Pallantin, respectively. All these elements blend for a perfect recipe of horror and suspense. Jump scares are plenty without being triggered by the gotcha tropes of dogs, cats, and friends around the corner. The scares are for the monsters, visions, and disturbing images. The suspense is geared up with unpredictability. What will happen? How will these kids stop It? Even more troublesome is the evil perpetrated by real humans. The adult figures are often the absent, abusive, and overbearing parents, and the vicious bullies in town. What really makes this one work, though, are the believable, earnest performances of the young kids. We can identify with them as the ones being picked on for being fat, bookish and nerdy, or for stuttering. Even these children have differences between themselves. The 1990 TV mini-series has nothing on this one as it is raised to a level of reality without the camp or cheesy early 1990's special effects. Now to hope the sequel will live up to the success of the current installment and live up to expectations.",It

But whether or not you care about such things, the old It had a tangible soul and this one doesn't.You can criticize the old It for not being scary enough, for not having good enough special effects, or a good enough cast, or whatever other reason you can come up with: the two things it lacked were fashionable edginess (no swearing or sex or violence of a level pleasing to today's audiences would have been allowed on broadcast television back then) and teenagers. The characters in old It were shown as children and middle-aged adults, which was fine for a time when television made book on appealing to as many demographics as possible, whereas new It is aimed at the prime demographic for theatrical horror films, which is kids who aren't technically old enough to see R or even PG-13 movies but are watching them anyway. That's why the main protagonists were changed from pubescent children to near-adults.Old It is about childhood trauma and abuse and its lasting effects, and how friendship and love can help us cope with it. This It is about, well, teenagers in a horror movie. There's no psychological realism in it whatsoever. A kid who's sadistic to other kids is revealed to have a sadistic father: sadistic kid kills sadistic father: that's a horror movie's idea of a satisfying resolution. A girl whose father is being creepily sexual with her is creepily sexual with the man at the drug store so her friends can rob the place: that's a teen movie's concept of morality. Meanwhile the serial-killing CGI bundle only succeeds in putting our heroine into a state of suspended animation, for no other reason than she has to be kept alive for the sequel and nobody cares about those other dead kids. Violating the rules of your own fictional universe for purposes of moving your plot in the direction you want it to go in is never a good precedent, especially when you've still got half the story left to tell.I've never liked the design of this Pennywise. He doesn't look like any clown that any small town American child would have encountered, and unless you find Germanic people innately creepy I don't understand why Bill Skarsgaard was even cast in the role. I understand why they cast Tim Curry--Frankenfurter, like Pennywise, is both a clown and a stony-hearted alien, and as in ""Rocky Horror"" Tim delivered. And the character design of the old Pennywise is genius. He looks like a standard issue American clown, but if you look at him just the right way, you can see the skull in his face.I think the proof of the pudding is you can dub Ugandan Knuckles or Gangnam Style into sequences featuring new Pennywise and his menace evaporates. But nothing will strip old Pennywise of his ability to haunt us.",It
378,Amthermandes,"Disturbing, dark, depressing even, and downright delightful",10,8 September 2017,"""It."" A story about kids in Derry who must band together to fight an other-worldly terror that preys on children and others in the small town of Maine. A haunting thrill throughout, with scares and laughter and even traumatic moments, this film is evidence horror is still very much alive today, and that the idea of sequels and remakes must not be dismissed. Overall, the film is a knockout. The makers of ""It"" evidently put thought and heart into the remake of the 90's classic made-for-TV hit and a great mix of what is in the original book by Stephen King and what the filmmakers decided would be original ideas to bring the story effectively to the big screen. There is so much that makes the movie worth it. It captures the essence of King's novel by bringing back some memorable elements, such as lines, characters, atmosphere, and the very fear that the children experience. And like the novel, there is humor throughout, to remind the audience that despite what the children go through, and despite the mature decisions they must make, they are still just children, alone in their conflicts from the adult world. It follows the book just enough to satisfy any fan of Stephen King (unlike some films *coughcoughDARKTOWERcough*), and even impress the man himself. Aside from similarities to the book and maybe even the 90's film, the film stands on its own, so people unfamiliar with King's work and the original film can easily understand and enjoy it, while a King fan will be delighted to see Pennywise in a new light, and enjoy classic moments (beep beep Richie!!). There are some elements that are disagreeable, but not many and they still can't bring my perfect score down. First of all, too much CGI. It seems to be used as a cop-out in films these days, a crutch. However, for the most part it is well used and effective. There are jumps scenes, something that many feel is a cheap scare. Chances are fairly good those people would still be caught off guard by some of them in this movie. Some may find parts cheesy, some may find the whole thing cheesy, so while the CGI and scares may be a problem for some, many will find them quite enjoyable. The scares truly are different, and terrifying.There also doesn't seem to be near enough character development, and it feels like you don't get to know each of the children enough, save maybe Bill and Bev only. But this is evidence of filmmakers pandering to the needs of the ever-changing audience, as modern general viewers sometimes get bored of the legendary Hitchcock-ian pace. The film moves very rapidly from the start and keeps the flow going throughout the film. Sometimes it feels like the characters don't even get much of a break in the last half of the film, but that's what happens when you try to fit a cinderblock-thick novel into two movies. You do however get to know the kids enough to get by, and it doesn't impede the progress of the plot.The acting even is favorable. Sometimes wooden, most of the time genuine. There are times when you truly feel what the children are feeling, and occasionally cause a stir of emotions. And let's not leave out Pennywise. We all know how difficult it would be to fill Tim Curry's clown shoes. But fear not, this new dancing clown is no circus. Demented and frightening, he will toy with the children's minds, and leave symbolic bite marks on viewers' souls. I have a personal beef with those reviewers who say it's nothing like the book and nothing like the works of Stephen King. These people are posers and have obviously never read ""It"" or any of King's novels, so take their reviews with a grain of salt. This story is an adult horror from a child's perspective. Fears from our childhood was a major influence on King's work, and ""It"" was its epitome. A must-see, but not for everybody, especially the feint of heart. It is a dark, evil, twisted fall down the rabbit's hole, and this rabbit has teeth. LOTS of teeth.",It

Bill Skarsgård does a great job creating the iconic character. Wonderful movie.",It
382,tstudstrup,Don't believe the hype...,1,16 September 2017,"This movie is not nearly as good as the original mini-series. It doesn't even come close to ""Stand by me"" or ""Stranger things"". A movie and a series this crap has been compared to. Which is an insult to to the movie and the series. As this is not even in the same ballpark. This version of IT is not scary at all. And the movie is filled with so many plot holes it will give you a headache, just thinking about them. SPOIILERS AHEAD!! First of all, the original first episode of ""It"" was far superior on every level. Tim Curry was far more scary as Pennywise than Bill Skarsgård. Skarsgård does his best but his performance is ruined by over the top CGI effects every time he appears. Maybe he simply wasn't scary enough and they thought they could improve it with special effects. The glowing eyes for one, was just dumb and infuriated me. This Pennywise is apparently much more a shapeshifter here than he was in the original. Because each kid is afraid of something different and instead of letting Pennywise scare them, he looks like the things that scare the kids. And that don't work. As for the kids themselves, they're not bad, but not very good either. Me and my friend were bored at the cinema, and made fun of the kids during several scenes where we were suppose to feel bad for them. They just seem like kid actors playing their parts. Unlike the kids in Stand by me or Stranger things, that ARE their characters, the kids here are just kids acting, nothing more. The same goes for the bullies that are way over the top as far as bullies go. As far as the horror goes, it's predictable and have way too much gore just for the sake of gore. I don't mind blood at all, but when it comes to a Stephen King movie, I expect psychological horror, mixed with a little gore. What we get here, however, is cheap jumpscares mixed with gore while showing each kids fear, one at a time and it gets boring after awhile. Cheap jumpscares is what I would expect in crap like The Comnjuring movies. Not in a so called horror movie based on a Stephen King book. In another gory and boring, but suppose to be scary scene, the ginger girls bathroom is flooded with blood coming from the drain in the sink. Her father (get to him later) comes in, because of her screams. He cant see the blood, which means its not there, but made by Penywise to scare her. Yet later on all the kids see their shared imagination of the blood soaked bathroom and starts to clean it. If the blood is not really there, then why clean the bathroom?? And if each kid has a different fear and blood is only the ginger girls fear, then the other kids shouldn't be able to see the blood. This makes no sense what so ever. The fat kid writes a poem for the ginger girl, but knowing he wrote it and saves her life, by kissing her, after the final battle with Pennywise, she still chooses another boy as her boyfriend, which makes no sense and makes her an ungrateful little bitch.*MORE SPOILERS AHEAD*But Pennywise is nt the only monster here. Evidently some of the parents are monsters too. As in evil. And get this: two of the kids kill their dads, one, the main bully, who is later on killed by one of the kids were suppose to care about and the other one, the ginger girl (who is way too sexualized to make her character believable) goes to live with her aunt in another state. She killed her own father and doesn't end up in an institution or in prison. Yeah right!! Even though her father was a scumbag that molested her, this doesn't justify murder. And with no witnesses to the father molesting her, there is no proof, so she should be in jail. And of course they're lining up a sequel as this movie is called chapter one. I for one will not see the sequel. Nor will I see this movie again. Everything here just made miss the first episode of the mini-series where the kids were great and believable and Tim Curry was truly scary as Pennywise. If you enjoy a good Stephen King movie adaptation, this is not for you.If you want something scary with really good acting from everybody, watch Stranger Things. It is amazing and everything, this movie isn't.",It
383,tstudstrup,IT SUCKS!!,1,29 July 2018,"Dont believe the hype.This movie is not good. BillSkarsgård pales to Tim Curry as Pennywise. 
Instead of psychological horror this movie does what all modern ""horrormovies"" does. It relies on jumpscares and way too much cgi. 
Skarsgårds performance is ruined by cgi that allows the character to move around in physically impossible ways. Every time he appears its very predictable. And whenever Pennywise preys on the kids fears appearing as something else, its ""scarier"" than Pennywise himself. And that is not a good thing. Pennywise himself is suppose to be terrifying without cgi and without appearing as some other monster. The one monster that does work is the woman with the flute in the painting. That is good and clever horror. A movie with the flutelady as the main monster might have worked.
The kids are decent although forgettable. The kids in thetv mini series were much, much better. Several of the kids annoyed me. Lkethe older brother to the kid was eaten by Pennywiseand the redhaired girl. The only good kid was the main bully. But he was so over the top mean, that it became cliche. 
Also this movie is a ripoff of Stranger Things, the Netflix series that is much more scary with better acting. It even has Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things in it. Some might enjoy this movie for being R rated, which means lots of f-bombs and lots of blood. I usually enjoy that too. But if the story and the acting just dont work, then the rating is not important. The mini series were of course cencored for tv, but it was still psychologically scary. Now if you can make something scary with a small budget and cencorship, then youre good. Tommy Lee Wallace, director of the mini series was that good. Andy Muschietti has all the money and all the toys but not the skills to bring the horror to the big screen.

For creeps, see the Japanese psychological thriller ""Creepy"" or the Dutch film ""Borgman."" The film has too many clichés. What's with the scary teeth? For me, scary teeth became a cliché after watching Alien. Couldn't we have strangling ears or a deadly projectile shooting nose instead? And why the damsel in distress? That trope is so tired, even Disney has dropped it in their latest animated films. Other than the one girl, there was the chubby kid, the Jewish kid, the total nerd, the asthmatic and the normal kid, who was cute, but had one defect of sorts.

They all seemed to be perfectly cast for their roles and they knocked it out of the park. I wouldn't necessarily call this movie scary, but it is chilling at times. Also, can be touching to see what some of the children are dealing with at school or home, besides a homicidal clown.

389,theemuhammede,"Here, Take IT",6,17 September 2017,"Going into this movie I was extremely terrified. I never did like IT. I had a horrific experience watching the 1990 original. I was about four years old. I was watching it around Halloween time. There was a brutal thunderstorm outside as the movie was playing. The movie was approaching a part where another child was about to get destroyed by IT, and I knew it was about to happen. But just before it happened, the thunderstorm caused us to lose power. I thought that it was IT coming after me. I flipped over my chair and ran screaming into a wall. Man did I hate IT.One can imagine how scared I may be to see this one. But I did not find the movie to be all that scary. The opening scene was the scariest overall. It set for a scary roller coaster for the following two hours remaining in the movie. I thought I was screwed. But after that, the scare tactics were weak. The first half of the movie was setting up each child individually encountering IT. Scary? Somewhat. But not anything that made me jump. About halfway through the movie, the kids all came together and said that each of them had seen IT in some sort of way. The kids decide to stick together in what they called the ""Loser Club"". Now the movie is getting good, at least I thought it was. Now the movie should be absolutely terrifying. Once all the kids came together. The scare tactics in the movie became ridiculous. I truly think it became less and less scary.Besides the scare tactics, the story had a great flow. There was a good sense of character build for each of the kids. There were hints at the adults knowing what was happening. This brings me to my theory. The bathroom scene with Beverly was crazy. Blood everywhere. But when her father came in the bathroom, he claimed that he could not see anything' however, the audience never got to see how the father saw the bathroom. The entire scene showed the bathroom was completely covered with blood. The father denied anything that just happened to his daughter and he walks away. I thought this was weird and I believe that all the people in the town know about IT. I believe they do not do anything about IT because IT does not go for adults. IT like the young prey: children and teens. This could be a way of the adults staying alive. If the adults do not mess with IT, then IT will not go out of his way to kill them and IT will instead go for his preferred younger prey. Just a theory.If you come with me, you'll float too.",It
390,WooderIce64,Good Stephen King,8,24 October 2019,"It, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name, will likely go down as one of the defining horror movies of the 2010s. It broke box office records for Fall movies and horror movies, and got a better reception than expected. Plus, it's always noteworthy when a movie causes mass hysteria in the real world. Remember the creepy clown craze when this came out? Anyway, it's a story about a group of kids who have to fight off a demonic entity in the form of a clown that feeds on people and their fears. The film is filled with scares and creepy moments, both in your face jumpscares, and some slow, creepy stuff. The setting is great, between the normalcy of the small town of Derry, Maine, and the creepy locations of the house and the sewers.The film is centered around a group of middle school kids known as the Loser's Club. There's Bill, who's brother Georgie was killed by Pennywise in this film's iconic opening scene, Beverly, who is implied to be sexually abused by her father (while the film is rated R, they still can't exactly show that), Eddie, who has Munchausen by Proxy, Mike, who's parents died in a fire, Stanley, who is under the pressure of his Rabbi father, Ben, who tries to fit in at his new school, and Richie, the big mouth of the group. These characters are the best part about the movie. Each one is developed well enough, and the kids all give good performances. The bond they share and the relationship between them adds to the effect. Oddly enough, there's also a lot of heart to this movie. Most of scenes involving Bill and Georgie are legitimately sad moments that get an emotional response out of the audience. Not only that, it has its funny moments as well. Mostly intentional ones, but a few unintentional as well.Speaking of performances, there is the creepy clown himself, Pennywise, played by Bill Skarsgard. He's fantastic. People will try and compare him to Tim Curry, but it really isn't worth it. They're two completely different interpretations of the character. What makes Pennywise such a great villain is not only the performance, but also how he manifests in the form of other things. The scene near the end where he appears as the painting is a good example. Perhaps better is the fight between him and the Losers, where he's constantly transforming.The film's not perfect, and there is some stuff to nitpick. The scares got predictable after a while. The first few are effective, but most of the later ones are pretty easy to guess. Richie was kind of annoying. But these are minor things. This is still a great horror movie, and one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date. It's also quite an improvement over the 1990 TV adaptation, which is decent in its own right, but not on the same level as this.",It

A group of kids calling themselves the ""losers"" decide to take a stand and attempt to search for said clown.The movie's central theme appears to revolve around fear, particularly fears of children. As the movie progresses, we learn about the characters' fears from how they act, interact with one another and how it affects their daily lives. Pennywise, the clown, plays around with and uses their fears to lure out the children and the way it is executed is very well done. I found the execution so well done that it even frightened me. It does play around with jumpscares, which some may see as an issue, but for me, I didn't mind the occasional ones because there was more of a theme to the movie than just a random scene here and there. Like I said, it's more about the fears that each child has and how they're exploited.The movie also establishes a lighter tone through various parts which is used to help the characters grow and develop. These moments help bring out some good humor that had me and the audience in my theater laughing.The movie also had some great casting choices. The actors for the kids did a very good job at just being normal kids. They didn't fall into that trope of the kids being absolutely nutty considering that they were older. Each of the actors was spot-on, I couldn't think of a bad performance in this entire film. I especially loved Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. He was menacing and absolutely terrifying and it couldn't have been that way if it wasn't for his acting. Skarsgard does a fantastic job portraying Pennywise in an intimidating fashion.Overall, It is a terrifying flick with an engaging story, memorable characters and fantastic acting and it is one of my favorite films of the year.10/10",It

What is with all this bullying BS. I went to high-school in the late '70s in a New England town not much bigger than this Derry seems to be. I moved there sophomore year. I was valedictorian. So, I was both ""the new kid"" & sort of a nerd. I witnessed & experienced roughly zero ""bullying"" in high-school & absolutely nothing like in IT. Being the valedictorian, I also knew well the nerdiest kids in my class. We were well-adjusted, non-bullied people. WTF planet is S King from?
Another problem: there really is no plot here. It is as if someone took The Goonies and forced them to go into the Haunted House at the amusement park. That is it. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!
Another problem: as in Stranger Things, which I gave up on early in Season 2, it is as if the parents don't exist & the kids have (as the french say) un IQ d'huitre.
Speaking of un IQ d'huitre, shame on me for redboxxing this. ""Horror"" films, at least modern ""horror"" films, are generally meant for people with un IQ d'huitre. I saw rave reviews & decided to give this a shot. FOOLED AGAIN! Another ""horror"" film meant for people with un IQ d'huitre.",It
399,movieman89-2,10- 12 years worth the wait,10,9 September 2017,"I still remember this day reading the book when I was 15 or 16. I simply could not put the book down. I felt and still feel that way with all of King's novels, I'm a huge fan. After finishing IT, I was desperate to watch the original film. When I watched it, I was very disappointed. For me, it didn't live up to the book whatsoever. Now, at the age of 27, I re watched parts of the original and it still has the same effect on me. I felt the acting was awful and the screenplay was poorly written and cheesy. IT is not a cheesy story.Last year, I heard that it was being remade into a two part feature film. Usually when I hear about a new remake to a classic my instant reaction is ""What? Why? Its awesome, it doesn't need remaking"". But with this remake, I thought ""Oh good, I hope this one is an improvement"". With IT being remade in two parts, I loved the idea because I felt that it would give writers a chance to keep as close to the book as possible. I've been keeping up to date with the news about it and the hype and to be honest I joined in the hype, I was so excited for it. I went to see it last night, and let me just say to begin with,if there was an opportunity to stand up and cheer at the end credits,I would of done that.I was instantly hooked to the film as soon as it started, the beginning scene is near enough identical to the book. The rest of the story kept extremely close to the book but there were a lot of new additions to it. The new additions were superb. When I was watching it I thought ""Ah that didn't happen like in the book, but wow this new part is awesome!!"" For the scares, they were simply spine tingling. Every single scare was meaningful, none of them felt obnoxious, repetitive or unnecessary. Even the added CGI felt right and actually looked stunning.The characters kept very strong like they did in the book. You felt for every single one of them. Like King does, he makes you love the ones you're supposed to love and despise the ones you were supposed to hate. It had a huge Stand by Me feel which was fantastic. The actors of The Loosers Club were absolutely amazing. Especially Jaeden Lieberher and Sophia Lillis. I really hope they will keep their acting careers going.Now for Bill Skarsgård as the evil, twisted Pennywise the Dancing Clown. He was astonishing. Every time he came on screen, I felt a shiver. He was exactly as I imagined the book. There was no cheesiness to him, there was just simply dread and terror. And for Nicholas Hamilton as the insane bully Henry Bowers, he was fantastic. He acted so well as an insane wild animal. He cohorts Belch and Chris were also great. I'm also so happy the character Patrick Hockstetter was put into the film, even though his screen time was quite short it was still good that he was put in.Like the book, the screenplay was written beautifully with perfect pace for the story and a lot of very funny lines included to lighten the mood at appropriate times. The only little complaint I would add is that I thought the character Mike Hanlon deserved a little bit more screen time but it didn't ruin the film for me.The cinematography, lighting and set design were stunning. The attention to detail in every part of the frame was excellent. And of course a big round of applause to Andy Muschietti for brilliant directing.This film has become one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I've waited for 10 or 12 years for a decent adaptation of IT and it was worth the wait. Absolutely incredible!! I'm so exited for the next chapter and I heard that Muschietti is directing it which is an amazing step forward.",It
400,Martinito_08183,Even with all of the problems that the movie has - it's still one of the best Stephen King adaptations out there.,6,3 December 2019,"Everybody thinks that kids are immortal and in every story that involves children very rarely something disturbing and horrifying things happens to them and yet Stephen King wanted to do something new and interesting by breaking (or subverting) the tradition, while writing the book ""It"" and chose to start the story with the death of a kid and using that to introduce the most scariest antagonist in all fiction, so seeing that moment confirms and reinforces our anxiety moving forward and also breaking the illusion that the main characters are safe.I have not read the book ""It"", so i don't know how accurate the 2017 movie ""It"" is, but after seeing the movie adaptation - i immediately want to get my hands on the books. It's a awesome coming-of-age story about kinds trying to overcome their fears and a unstoppable threat without the help of adults and also without knowledge of defending themselves.To be honest - originally i didn't know what to expect from the movie. Some of Stephen King's adaptations are great, but there are also some that are far from great. ""It"" did receive positive reviews, but there were also some that didn't liked it all that much. It didn't got my attention at first, when it was showing at the cinema, since there were also other movies that i was more interested in and watching a horror movie with my mother is never a good idea. I saw the movie on digital in the beginning of 2018 and after seeing it for the first time: i thought it was great, but after seeing it again - i did notice flaws that i missed in my first viewing or didn't got my attention at that time and others that i do remember, but that doesn't mean that i didn't enjoy the experience.There are many things that everyone can appreciate and relate to the movie and there are also things that it's hard to take very seriously. The story is the strongest aspect and seeing how the events play out is interesting. The first scene really does capture your attention and it does this successfully. The characters are very relatable, the dialogue is good (sometimes it can be bad, but i'll mention it later); the cinematography is great, the sound was very good, the acting is shockingly good (which is surprising, since nowadays we only see bad child performances, but there are two performances that i didn't like and i'll mention it later) with Bill Skarsgård being the one that stands out the most, who was fantastic and he was definitely the best part of the movie, but sadly this is where the praising ends and there are many flaws that keeps it from being a great movie.Even though i praised the story - the first act of the movie is very weak. The way it starts (when they introduce Billy and Georgie) is great, but after that it does get uninteresting and when the second act starts - it gets you hooked to the events that play out and continues strongly to the end of the third act. The first act is the introduction of the characters and this is where i have problems. Many of them are introduced in a cliché way and i'm like ""Okay. I've seen this before."", so there's nothing new here for me. I don't know how it is in the book, but it's probably way better. I understand that it's important to do it like that, since the group that they created is called ""The Losers"" and they have to show that they are outsiders and they are bullied by Henry Bowers, but i still wanted to point that out.Like i mentioned - the characters are relatable, but some of them are not. The movie focuses on some of the group and have way more development, unlike the other part of the group that are average at best. The characters that i mean are Richie Tozier, Stanley Uris and Mike Hanlon. I'm not saying that are badly written, but they could have been way better presented or they could have develop them more.The movie does have strong dialogue, but it also had some weak dialogue as well and it wasn't all that convincing, especially Finn Wolfhard' dialogue (who plays Richie Tozier). Most of his lines of dialogue is just cursing and because of that Richie feels more like a kid that is from 2017 (or should i say the 2010s), instead of a kid that is from the 1980s. I think they did that on purpose, so that they can make the movie more edgy (or something, so i don't know) and they didn't even thought of just writing good and normal dialogue.The visual effects were very fake and they do look very poor at times. There are some instances of good effects, but most of them are very average. The production value is here and you can tell - it's just the effects didn't show all that much of it.The music is the aspect that i thought it was awful and I couldn't find any positive things that I can mention. It's very forgettable and just like all bad horror movies that we have today - the filmmakers were trying so hard to make it more horror, so what they did was they added jump scare sound or loud noise, because they thought it would make it more scary (aka jump scares) like the scene with Georgie and the introduction of ""It"" (aka Pennywise) in the sewer. That is a visually fantastic scene, but they ruined it with the loud noise that they put. When will Hollywood learn to stop using that trick? There are many scenes in the movie that could have been scary and worked on their own without the loud noise, but they add them and now they are not scary at all and makes the scares very predictable.Overall i liked it. There are hints of a great horror movie and ideas that can make ""It"" very distinct from all horror movies that came before and the ones that we have today and can be also very unique, but sadly it missed the mark in some areas in some aspects. It does have huge potential where the rules of logic don't necessarily apply, when the main antagonist operates from a fantasy nightmare approach, so there are many possibilities of that concept and that's why A Nightmare on Elm Street works so well and ""It"" does have those ideas, but not fully embracing its potential. With all that said - i'm glad that the audience love the movie and giving it high scores, so like everyone else - i highly recommend it and i'll definitely see it again. For all of the positives and negatives that i listed - i'm giving ""It"" (2017) a 6.4/10.",It
401,rowanmaillot,It just works..,10,22 June 2020,"Bill Skarsgard absolutely killed it as Penny-wise, the children cast was very entertaining, (especially Finn Wolfhard) the comedy is hilarious and I was actually scared of Penny-wise. Whereas with the 1990 TV movie, Penny-wise was portrayed as more of a comedic clown, but Bill still scares the living crap out of me every-time that I watch this movie. It's one of the greatest films of 2017 and possibly the greatest film of the 21st century (excluding Saw and Conjuring 1 & 2).I have read the book two times, it normally takes me around 1-2 days to finish the entire book, because it's 1,068 pages long and although It's my favourite horror book I struggle reading it at times because I remember I've got another 700-900 pages to go. It Chapter Two was a hell of a disappointment and my review for that will be up in a few weeks or so.

403,TheMysteriousReviewer,It's My Turn To Float and Praise,9,26 October 2021,"It is not only one of the scariest Warner Bros horror movies of the 2010 decade, but also has a big upgrade of the miniseries it was based on. It had a lot of moments that makes it both creepy and heartfelt. And when I say heartfelt, I'm talking about the connection to the losers club. Not only that, but it has adapted the Stephen King book by explaining how Pennywise has killed the missing children. And speaking of which, he was absolutely terrifying. Every moment when we get those out of him, the movie becomes engaging as a horror film. The characters may be losers, but even they can still show how we care for them. And the visuals make the movie scary. If you thought the miniseries wasn't all that great, this movie will not disappoint you. This is definitely a great option for horror movie fans. I'm not gonna lie, this is one that feels like a comeback to the 80s horror movies. And since a lot of people have praises to this film, it's my turn to float and do the same.",It
404,nlytnd_1,Wastes of lot of time on unnecessary/repetitive dialogue. Most of the humor falls sooooo flat!,6,2 February 2018,"There were some things I liked about the movie, but I will just make mention of a couple things that sucked! 
Alright! We get it! Eddie is a hypochondriac! I don't understand why the movie dedicates 1/4 of it's total run time on dialogue and scenes related to Eddie being a hypochondriac.So, we already get a full dose of it while we're at Eddie's house. Now it cuts to them talking before coming up to the sewer/tunnel and the conversation is something along the lines of Eddie thinking every plant is poison ivy. The hypochondriac talk continues the entire time while they stand in the entrance and while some of the kids proceed a little ways into the tunnel (several minutes). I can't believe that they didn't catch this in the cutting room floor. Not only did they not catch it, the very next scene after they leave the tunnel cuts to them ridding their bikes and they have the balls to dub in more dialogue of Eddie being a hypocondriac. AT this point it's already soooo insanely old, but that's only the tip of the iceburgh. 
What were they thinking? Did they think this was humorous? Is performing a rendition of the same joke several dozen times funny? Which takes me to how unfunny this director must be. The movie utilizes Richie for most of the movies so called jokes. Early on Richie has a couple chuckle worthy one liners, but after that the jokes fall so insanely flat... they bomb so hard that they're cringe worthy. It's so bad that you would think that this movie was directed by a foreigner. If you're not familiar, humor almost always does not convert well when people learn a new language, then write jokes in that language regardless of how well they know that 2nd language. That's how most of the humor plays out in this movie.",It

407,pazu7,Much love to the cast and filmmakers.,10,3 October 2017,"I read IT on first release. I even remember where I was; away from home on business, staying in a small motel for a week. I'd gone to pick up some reading material and was pleased to find a new Stephen King novel. For three days all I did was work and come to my little room to be fascinated and freaked out by the master of fascinating freaky sh*t. The tension was enhanced by being in an unfamiliar environment. Only reading The Shining had been a more tense experience. All that to say I love this book! The only novel I've reread more is Tolkien's LOTR. And that's an appropriate association because I have always seen IT as more of fantasy than a horror. Sort of a fantasy/horror/adventure. So when I read the announcement, years ago, that it was being adapted to screen, I was ecstatic. I had been eagerly anticipating seeing it done correctly ever since that fiasco of a miniseries. Let's be honest. Curry was great but as for the rest of it...? Nuff sed. This new work is a wonderful adaptation done by people who obviously loved the book. Considering the breadth of King's labyrinthine novel, it's amazing Fukunaga and Mascetti managed to construct a smooth through story. Great writing. Excellent cinematography. As good as Curry was, Skarsgard creates a Pennywise much closer to the source material. He is truly frightening and unpredictable. And the kids. They close the deal. I love those brats. Even Henry Bowers. Their acting and comic timing brought the Losers Club to life. They were so good that I just forgot about all the stuff from the novel I had wanted to see but was left out. I even forgave the revision of giving Mike Hanlon's role to Ben, and all the shaky CG moments and other little complaints. These kids were not the same Losers that I read about in the book, but they claimed the roles so much that when I was watching I kept thinking, ""ah, so this is what they're like in real life""... haha. Much love to the cast and filmmakers. Can't wait for the directors cut DVD. This is a winner.",It
408,DVR_Brale,Refreshing movie released just in the right time,7,24 September 2017,"I believe many people are going to agree with me if I assert that It Follows, The Babadook and 'It' are maybe the best horror movies in the past several years. First two were dealing with pretty difficult subjects and were shot in low contrast setting. 'It' comes as refreshing. This movie can best be described as one long child nightmare filled with fantasy. It's very colorful, often funny and radiant on your imagination. Children are main protagonists but unlike in It Follows they appear much more playful and childish. If you're already familiar with S. Kings' work, settings and location will ring a bell. Everything looks as I have imagined it to be while reading his books. Small town with shady past is as authentically portrayed as it can be. When it comes to fantasy and horror, 'It' completely goes in S. Kings' fashion. He almost never gives an explanation for weird and supernatural occurrences. Things just start to happen. Exactly the same route has been taken in The Mist (2007) were monsters start to appear and a reason why is never given. Some may find this approach too simplistic but that is the main reason why his books and movies are so good. The entire focus is placed on imagination and the main goal is to make you a part of a nightmare; and you don't get an explanation for them, do ya?Everybody who found Kings' movies and books fun is surely going to enjoy this movie. I'd also recommend 'It' to those who like horror genre, especially if you're tired of heavy topics and over the top violence.",It

410,d_art,A solid horror film with bite,9,11 September 2017,"This past weekend, I saw the movie ""It"" (2017), directed by Andy Muschietti (""Mama""), based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. First off, let me say that I enjoyed this movie quite a bit-- it was a highly entertaining monster flick with jump scares that surprisingly worked (which usually doesn't in many films). The movie stars various (mostly unknown) child actors and Bill Skarsgård as an evil entity called Pennywise the Dancing Clown, which terrorizes the town of Derry every 27 years. The main protagonist of this film is the stuttering Bill (Jaesen Lieberher), who wants to avenge his little brother who was killed by Pennywise. The film focuses mostly on the kids and their relationships, their school bullies, dysfunctional adults, and the sharp-toothed killer clown that moves around in the sewers.I have the novel in my house, which I never got around to reading. I did, however, see the miniseries on TV, also called ""It"" (1990), starring Tim Curry as the titular killer clown. There were two parts to the miniseries--first half took place in 1960, and the second part in 1990. The first half mainly starred children, while the second half starred adults (the same children now grown up). The TV show was fairly creepy for TV (particularly the first half), while the second half was on the cheesier side, with monster effects that were not quite on par with theatrical films of that time. Tim Curry (""Clue"") was an effectively creepy clown, given that he often just popped out of nowhere to harass the kids. The second half wasn't helped by the fact that it starred mostly comedians such as Harry Anderson (""Night Court""), John Masur (""License to Drive"") and John Ritter (""Three's Company)--a baffling decision by the producers. Just imagine seeing a horror film starring Jerry Seinfeld, Adam Sandler, and Larry the Cable Guy, and you get the idea. So, this 2017 film fixes a lot of the problems that the miniseries had. This film only tells the first half of the story (which still works as a standalone story), with only the children as the protagonists. It also takes place in 1989, taking cues from the nostalgic, retro look and style of Netflix's popular ""Stranger Things."" (To note, one of the kids from the show is in this movie). Unlike the miniseries, the creature effects in this film is impressively creepy and artistically done. And, this movie is rated R (also quite unusual for horror movies of this ilk), which pretty much tells you that they aren't messing around.Bill Skarsgård is excellent as Pennywise. He is going full-on creepy-monster-mode here. This is to Tim Curry's Pennywise what Heath Ledger's Joker was to Jack Nicholson's. This Pennywise isn't interested in dishing out any humor or making puns--he is meant to be terrible and scary. With that said, Skarsgård's acting has just enough subtlety and the inflections of his voice to be original and interesting. The kids' acting are pretty top-notch. They feel like real kids, and their situation is often quite terrible. Adults are unlikable here for the most part, and are often one-dimensional. Maybe it's me, but I feel this quite often in Stephen King films (eg. ""Carrie"") where teens or kids are protagonists--all adults seem like terrible people. The plot isn't particularly complex--much of the story is about the characters and the horror they face. Where it lacks in story, it has enough details about the characters that you care about their well-being (something many horror films fail at). There is plenty of humor in this film which thankfully offsets some of the gloominess of the situation. Much of this humor comes from the 80's references to films and music, and kids' sarcastic, bad-mouthed dialogue. Having been a child of the 80's myself, I found much to relate here. As for the horror, as I mentioned, there is, yes, plenty of jump scares. However, this film isn't focused on the ""JUMP"" part of the ""jump scare"" but focuses on the ""SCARE"" part of the jump scare. Allow me to explain. Usually, in horror films, right when a ""jump scare"" comes, it's very quiet at first, then there's a loud noise (which is usually the part that scares you the most) and something ""horrific"" (or at least not quite as horrific as the loud noise) happens, then ends (usually quickly). In this movie, the horrific part lingers--you get a good look at what is supposed to scare you. The result feels earned, and not cheap. Remember back in the day when seeing a cool, creepy creature was the big payoff? It was the type of thing that many categorized as a well-done popcorn horror flick. The special effects are also quite good here, many of them practical. As the miniseries failed with its lackluster special effects, this film succeeds. Without giving away details, they did well with the budget. Director Andy Muschietti has made a solid horror film.If there are any complaints, I kind of feel that it has more to do with Stephen King's original story. The illusory part of how Pennywise operates in the world never seemed quite clear to me. This was also how I felt when I saw the miniseries. Maybe it's better explained in the book--the film is a bit vague on it. And, the adults, as mentioned, are mostly stereotypes--I'm not saying that's not allowed, but such things can make the world feel less real. This is an entertaining horror film. The female audiences at my theater jumped and screamed in horror more than a few times, while laughing afterwards. If they weren't entertained, at least I was entertained by their reaction. Many also chuckled at the ""New Kids on the Block"" jokes--yep, we get it, sirs. Well played, dear fellows.

411,cyifly-2,IT Is Very Likely An Instant Horror Classic,9,15 September 2017,"Horror movies have been having a hard time pleasing a lot of horror fans lately. There just has not been any kind of quality product in quite some time. ""It"" very much changes that. It's been so long since we have had a good horror movie -- With great writing and acting, interesting characters and good direction all in the same film -- that this will likely be an instant horror classic.It's very well done. The clown is creepy, menacing, intimidating and scary as hell. Hats off to a job well done with that character. The kids and characters are all great. The story is well done and it keeps you interested, but there are several holes in it. Spoiler alert -- There is a clown in this movie and some people die. If you didn't know that, you are probably at the wrong movie. I'm going to mention it hereThere are a few things that left you scratching your head -- Like why nobody was asking questions about missing people or how certain characters got away with the very illegal actions. For example, one person kills another and no one explains how they plan to get away with it or why police are not involved. You can't just kill someone, leave them where they are, walk away and act like that was a normal thing that just happened and no one is going to care.My other problem was a hole in the story adaptation. I know from the book and from the 1990 version of IT, that the clown fed off of fear. Fear drives him, and nobody really explains it well like they should. It adds a depth to the story you can't just figure out on your own.But -- If those are the only two things I could find wrong, then I say they got IT right. Well done.",It
412,makleen2,Classic Horror Reborn,9,2 October 2017,"Seven pre-teen outcasts overcome their fears to confront a shape-shifting creature that takes the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown and awakens every 27 years to feed on children in It (2017), the latest film adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel of the same name.Written by Chase Palmer and Cary Fukunaga and directed by Andy Muschietti, It was filmed on a budget of $35 million and grossed over $117 million in its opening weekend. It revives classic American horror by delivering more than just jump scares. It was genuinely scary, but also at times heartfelt, funny, and sincere.It's success is even more surprising given its director's lack of experience. Andy Muschietti, an Argentine screenwriter, has only directed one other full-length feature. To entrust the long-anticipated reboot of one of Stephen King's most iconic horror tales to an inexperienced director is, well, incredible. That he actually pulled off making It into a blockbuster will ensure a long career. It's opening box office earnings completely eclipse The Sixth Sense's and that film made director M. Night Shyamalan a household name.I'm not a Stephen King fan and I don't get the fascination with clowns. I never read the novel or saw the 1990 TV mini series staring Tim Curry, so I came to the theater without any preconceptions aside from bits and pieces of things I've heard about It over the years. Like most Stephen King novels, the horror element is a vehicle for exploring other issues, issues related to family, coming of age, bullying, confronting mortality, etc., all of which appear in this story.It's those other elements that make this film so good. A great horror film doesn't just scare the audience. If you take the scary clown out of It, it's still a compelling movie. The characters learn to deal with fears, bullies, rejection, first love, flawed adults, and most importantly learn to rely on each other to confront the ugly side of life. Pennywise the Clown is just a personification of adolescent anxieties. So many contemporary horror film makers forget this.Unlike the book and miniseries (which open in 1957 and 1960), this film was set in 1989, so it does capitalize on '80s nostalgia, but It doesn't bash you over the head with it. The 1980s references are purposeful. In one scene, there are posters advertising A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, which came out in 1989. I thought it was fitting to make reference to that franchise because many of the effects in It are reminiscent of A Nightmare on Elm Street, especially when the hair comes out of the sink and pulls Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) toward the drain.It stumbles by introducing too many protagonists. I realize the film is just copying the number of characters in the book, but it's difficult to become attached to the characters when there are so many. There is William ""Bill"" Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher), Benjamin ""Ben"" Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly ""Bev"" Marsh, Richard ""Richie"" Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Stanley ""Stan"" Uris (Wyatt Oleff), Michael ""Mike"" Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs), and Edward ""Eddie"" Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer). Together, they form the ""Losers' Club,"" who are terrorized by both Pennywise and the Bowers Gang.All the child actors in this movie are great. In a film that pits children against adults, the children are funny, relatable, and courageous, while the adults are creepy, sadistic, and often indifferent. But I can't help wondering if the movie would have been improved by condensing the group into three or four memorable characters. Are all seven really essential to the plot? Not really. Eddie, Stan, and Richie are basically the same person and play interchangeable roles.Thankfully, the film makers cut some of the more graphic scenes involving the preteen characters. Stephen King, who is truly a sick individual, included an orgy among the protagonists in his original book. I'm all for horror films shocking audiences and pushing the envelope, but this was intended to be a mainstream movie, not some back alley grindhouse flick. Audiences would have rightfully walked out of the theater in disgust.Overall, It (part one) is a great horror movie and a decent movie in general. After years of terrible American horror films, I hope the success of It inspires a more creative, intelligent approach to the genre.",It
413,jay-techie2007,This one just doesn't seem to go beyond the rudimentary horror and tried-n-tested botched up faces.,7,10 September 2017,"There is a thin line between horror and creepy and IT seems to be on the creepier side. With such a powerful character like clown and prop of balloon, they could have made it a class but this one just doesn't seem to go beyond the rudimentary horror and tried-n-tested botched up faces. Powerful acting by the kids is probably the only saving grace of the movie. For someone, who has just witnessed the subtle but powerful horror of Annabelle, IT just stoops down to the greater level than the one shown in the movie (literally). Story (8/10): A peaceful town of Darry, in Maine, is terrorized by Pennywise (called IT by the kids) - a clown that has resulted in tens of children missing. A group of bullied kids come together to fight the clown and close the chapter once for all. They all have experienced IT at one point of time. Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Leiberher) lost his brother to IT and is, perhaps, the most desperate to get to IT than anyone else. As they slowly unfold the mystery behind Pennywise and the tragedies that hit Darry years ago, with the help of research done by Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), they come face to face with some disturbing facts that gives them an idea of what they may be facing ahead. However, that doesn't deter them fighting IT as they must destroy IT to bring peace to the lives of citizens, protect other children and also, if possible, bring back the kids already gone. The story has a central message on fighting your fears as IT has a tendency to prey on fearful kids and the bullied kids are exactly doing that throughout the movie. Acting (9/10): This is probably one of the most intense movies with significant burden on kids to act it out.However, acting was the department where the movie ended up strongest. With some of the most intense scenes and a good screen time, they had the opportunity as well as the responsibility. Jaeden Lieberher and Sophia Lillis were outstanding, leading the movie pretty much with their amazing chemistry. Jeremy Ray Taylor played a key character of Ben, who is the intelligence of the group. His library scene is something to watch out for. Chosen Jacobs was impressive with his sublime performance. The only lead adult - Bill Skarsgard, playing Pennywise, was good with amazing transitions of facial expressions - he was brilliant. Direction (5/10): This is where, perhaps, the movie suffers a lot. With horror movies bar raised quite high, the director Andy Muschietti, played quite safe when it came to creating horror on the screen. In the era where you can do a lot more with sound effects and special effects, the movie stayed old school - creepy faces and tried-n-tested horror sequences, that ends up making scenes so predictable. Yes, there are 1-2 scenes that gives you goosebumps but that is pretty much it. The opening scene is very well shot, except that it gave away the entire substance (of what exactly Pennywise does with kids). For a compact story, the length of the movie is quite long, thanks to the double- climax which makes the movie a drag. Overall (7/10): One can give it a skip. I haven't read the novel, so there is no reference point for me. However, if the novel was the best seller, the movie surely doesn't do any justice to it. Even for 2 hours, it is a drag.",It
414,trevor-82944,These Dang Kids Need to Stop Clowning Around!,4,8 September 2017,"Clowns look pretty freaky, right? I remember feeling quite unnerved by them in my younger days, yet as I got older, clowns intimidated me less. To be frank, clowns land more along the lines of ""creepy"" rather than scary, unlike real unmasked people who could hurt you.It's familiar opening scene captures that true scariness: an unsupervised small boy takes a paper boat out on a rainy day, which falls down the sewer drain. A clown peers his head up from below the darkness, his appearance throwing the boy off guard. He displays unusual kindness to the boy, returning to him the lost paper boat. Then suddenly, the predator chews the boy's arm off, and a God's eye view looks down on his poor defenseless body flowing into the drain, a truly disturbing sight in this otherwise misguided adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel.Now, I understand the movie's current rave, as It now stands at 90% on RottenTomatoes, and YouTube celebrity Chris Stuckmann gave It an A-, but I for one differ from the public opinion.Although the critical praise does speak some truth; each preteen we meet goes through change in some way. The sewer-bound kid's stuttering brother, Bill, is shunned by everybody, and his friends each face their personal growing pains too. Eddie is forced against his will to keep taking meds, Richie resents whatever his friends tell him to do, and Stanley refuses to pursue his family's Jewish beliefs. Other friends they make include a Black farmer boy, Mike, who must kill sheep for his heartless father, Ben, an overweight new kid who needs friends outside of the books, and Beverly, a gorgeous flame-haired drug addict. Her father creates by far the creepiest moments, as he sniffs her hair like some sex offender. The horror should stem from places like here, the common fears every teenager shares.Instead, the inexperienced director, Andy Muschietti, abused Dutch angles and motion sickness while filming the ""scary"" moments. He followed the common misconception that low lighting adds to the fright, which in actuality hurt the thrill here since you now cannot tell what is supposed to scare you. Think about some of the most iconic shots in horror: The shower scene in Psycho, the twins in The Shining, Jack Nicholson in the same movie shouting ""Here's Johnny!"", or even in the original It when Pennywise pops out from beneath the pale-tinted shower. Notice a theme? These images are each evenly lit, anything hidden in the shadows contrasting against something else to fear. Truly effective horror fills in the unknown blanks based on what you think you already see. Maybe if Muschietti utilized real fears, such as a community's religious state, other than clichés, and knew how to stage them, then these scares could leave a longer impression to the extent of The Exorcist.The scares particularly fail more due to the atrocious casting of the child actors. Whenever the kids were supposed to act afraid, they just stared blankly and walked stiltly. Even outside the scary scenes, the kids either talked too fast or too slow while screaming their lines when supposed to act angry. Based on speculation, these annoying kids obviously achieved their chemistry by following tape marks and cue cards with the direction, ""Just say your lines and go home."" These kids' stories also lack any structural balance. The brother-to- brother bond initiated right at the start gets forgotten across a large portion, especially at the very last scene; and Stanley's Jewish struggles loses any footing with little to do compared to the stronger treatment of his friends. As for the bullies, their interesting backstories receive an undeservingly low amount of screen time, instead existing more for lazy predictable scenarios we've seen countless times.Very little fear strikes your nerve in these moments, as you can never empathize with these kids' foul-mouthed tendencies. Rather than showing the hard reality of growing up, the kids celebrate their hatred against the oppressors. It even attempts to beautify the one female preteen, Beverly, as much as possible, as she jumps into a lake wearing only her underwear, then lets her new boyfriends gawk at her body as she naps in their eyesight. Then in another dialogue played only for laughs, a pharmacist, who she says looks like Clark Kent, comments her back, saying she looks like Lois Lane! Honestly, the whole beautification of her character made me feel pedophilic myself.I read several reports that the clowning industry has suffered because of It, promoting coulrophobia, I find this hard to believe. It does not feed off coulrophobia, but rather anthropophobia, particularly predatorial parents. No wonder the Alamo Drafthouse theaters in Austin and Brooklyn hosted all-clown screenings, since clearly, we might as well root for the demonic circus act to win!",It

416,persian-belle,Metaphor for your FEARS,6,25 August 2019,"When I was younger and watched the original IT I didn't like it at all. I found it quite boring. I watched it again later as an adult and then I had a very different perspective. I started to understand the deeper meaning behind the story.I watched this new remake and I have to say as as horror fan, this Pennywise scares me much more.If you want pure horror (which I'm also a big fan of), then this may not be your cup of tea.
This is a film with a deep story and good character development where you feel the pain of each of these outsider kids. It's about being bullied, being the new kid, being the tomboy, being the kid with the stutter, being the chubby kid, being a redhead, being the immigrant kid, being the kid with a dead sibling, or simply being different.
Pennywise the evil clown sums up and symbolizes the internal pain and struggles of eacg of these kids and their friendship is the best means to destroy the pain, the fear, which is the demon within.I always thought I didn't get Stephen King and his films never made sense to me. Maybe this was because 1. I was too young to appreciate the hidden meaning and 2. I only looked for a film that would scare me, regardless of the depth of the film.The Incest Issue:
I'm giving it 6/10 because of scenes where a father seems to express incestuous feelings toward his own daughter. I'm aware that this is unfortunately a very painful issue that has happened to some. I would just be very uncomfortable if I had to watcg it with my father or if my daughter ever saw it. I guess since this (fortunately) doesn't happen in most households, even bringing up the possibility of such feelings may not be appropriate (even in the context of criticism).",It

When the clown's terrifying, and the kid's talking to him anyway -- in a sewer, no less -- what do you think's going to happen? Oddly, there's no tension, and with the unconvincing CGI effects (the kid's arm torn off and the rain pouring down) it's like you're supposed to sit there passively and watch a summary of the story go by. Is the kid stupid? Is he scared ... even a little? It all seems so predetermined, like they're so intimidated by King's novel they just gave up and run you through a ""best of"" summary of scenes, and hope it'll stick.I read the book when I was 14, the first hardcover I ever got (as a Christmas present) and it took me all of Christmas break to read before I went back to school (which is how I knew I could get through ""War and Peace"" in a week's time when I was in college -- that experience came in handy!). Someone calling it ""the Moby-Dick of horror novels"" on the new tie-in edition is apt, I think. It really goes go all over the place, and takes that long, and takes that much, to put across the story. One of the things I always resented about the TV mini-series version (which I didn't bother checking out) is that the ""IT"" thing is unnameable, and only takes a clown form as a convenience -- it's fully explicated, and crucial.

Though it's not really my kind of taste in a great horror movie to have such a beautiful and a happy- ending conclusion, I can't really wait with what kind of chaos pennywise will bring into the future or how that monster originates or what kind of atrocities the clown caused in the past on the next installments of the movie (I mean sequels, they literally added 'Chapter One' with the movie title right before the end credits). So if you really wanna have much good scary scenes with some addition of laughters (both from you and pennywise) with your friends or families alike by the weekend (or weekdays if you are too lazy to go to work or school), 'IT' is a fine choice to start your fun with.....",It
421,Ansango,Sadly it is not very effective,6,8 November 2017,"IT is an adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 horror novel of the same name. It is a story of a group of friends in a small town who are terrorized by the eponymous entity who is in the form of a clown and the subsequent attempt of the group to fight that being and uncover a mystery. Being a horror movie it has some good terrifying scenes and twist and turns but at the core it is a movie about friendship. While it is not exactly a Magnum Opus, it's not a bad movie either. The main theme of the story is Friendship and what it means to have a good friend. From the very beginning of the movie, every character is shown as different and meek and hence is constant source of bullying. They find solace with each other and form a gang called loser's club and enjoy each other's company.The subsequent growth of the character and defeating their deepest fear is depicted nicely.The another main theme of the movie is quashing your fear. It is clearly shown that the entity feeds on the fear of an individual. Hence to defend themselves or to defeat him they need to vanquish their fears. While watching movie, it was clearly evident that the movie is less of a horror and is more of a coming-of-age tale where characters by various means conquer their fears and learn more about their identity via a series of misadventures and learn about meaning of life, friendship, love, sexuality, loss and fear. So lets talk about pros. and cons. of the movie and what is my personal opinion after watching this movie.PROS.Performance of the cast - I really loved the performance of the cast. Everyone was suitable and acted well in their roles but the cast member which stood out for me is Sophia Lillis. I really liked her performance. The way in which she essayed the role of a sexually abused teen is seriously commendable. Other cast member like Jack Dylan Grazer, Jaeden Lieberher and Jeremy Ray Taylor were excellent in their respective roles.Their chemistry was endearing and organic. Another stand out role for me was that of Nicholas Hamilton. He really performed well in the role of a mentally troubled young sociopath.Musical score - Music of the film was quite good and matched consummately with the theme of the movie. The background score was also quite good which helped in intensifying the fear at some critical moments during the film.Well developed characters - The characters in the film are well written and developed which is a rare feat for a horror movie. The reason of every character's inherent fear is explained well. That's why characters feel so authentic while watching movie.Screenplay - IT is a rare horror film where so much effort has been put in writing. Screenplay is commendable.Cinematography - Cinematography of the film completely reflects the mood of the film be it the happy time with friends or be it the haunting wall of the entity. The camera accurately captures the tone of film and which in turn makes the movie more terror-stricken.CONS.Over reliance on Jump Scares - While the source material provides excellent opportunity to delve into the psychology of characters, the makers seemed to ignore it. While it could have been an excellent psychological horror film but due to excess reliance on jump scares it turns into an another run-of-the-mill horror film. This movie can be sighted as a prime example of why jump scare sucks? I was really disappointed due to the lack of genuinely frightening scenes in place of sleazy jump scares.Muddled storytelling - Storytelling could have been far more better. Some scene jumps from one to another without any proper motive or meaning. Also the film takes too long to build.Runtime - The film really test the patience of viewers too much during the film. The film could easily have been shortened by up to 15-20 minutes. 2nd half drags too much especially during overly long climax.Performance of Bill Skarsgard - This might be a controversial opinion but i really didn't like performance of eponymous character. While Bill tried his level best, it was evident that during some scenes he was trying a bit too much which was really unaffecting for me. The more he came to screen, the less menacing he became.Average direction - While the direction was not bad, it was not good either. Considering the fact that you have a great source material and a well written screenplay, you need to add some extra score points to the movie by using your direction. Instead of focusing on psychological aspects of the story, he focuses more on terrifying audiences with music and the clown, but after a certain point it all starts to fall flat. I am not exactly condemning direction but i am not impressed either by the endeavors of Andy Muschietti.So, in the end its another run-of-the-mill horror film despite having a great story.",It
422,azeemnavarro,"Another clown, another failure",4,8 September 2019,"Let's get this clear, both this new adaptation and the 90's miniseries suck, sorry but that the truth.
Now, why this movie didn't live up to my not-even-high expectations? Well...
First of all, the casting. We all love Tim Curry, his portray of It is amazing, truly memorable and funny. While he's obviously not scary, it's a blast everytime he appeared on screen in that old movie. Here, Bill Skarsgård tries to fill the shoes of Curry, in a not so successful way. Why's that? Because he makes you laugh. This is not like the miniseries, so why go for another not-threatining clown? Don't get me wrong, I love Skarsgård as Pennywise, but his performance doesn't fit with the tone of the movie at all. But the biggest letdown were the kids. Only the girl does a great job, everyone else are just whatever (except the stranger things kid, he's really bad here). No one but Bev has any development, they're just token characters: the fatty one, the black one, the jewish one...they had time to do 1000 jumpscares but no time for writing actual characters.
Every modern Hollywood ""horror movie"" has to rely on jumpscares for scaring the audiences, but in It they took it to a new level. Like the Conjuring movies, every scene starts and ends the same way: a character walks in some place, we get some ""silence"", the cue for the scare comes, and then the monster appears doing a loud scream. That's every attemp to scare you, i'm not joking.
While I get that the movie has a ""low budget"" of 35 million, I can't understand why every creature looks like s*it. Remember how goofy the giant spider at the end of the miniseries looked? Here is the same, but for every monster except the clown. Instead of being bored, I was having a blast everytime they appeared, no joking even a claymation youtube video has better effects than this crap. Loved the desing for Pennywise anyways, no hate for that one.
And my biggest complaint is the music. Both the OST and the soundtrack suck af. I can't believe the music irritated me even more than the jumpscares. There's not a single second of actual silence, or you're listening a trashy generic horror score, or you're listening cheesy 80's pop songs. Seriously that's the laziest aspect of this mess.

There are bits of humor and suspense, but not enough to keep me interested for too long. The terrible CGI is what made it so painful to watch and had me wondering if they did it on purpose or if they really have no idea how to make anything remotely realistic.After watching it several more times, I did change my opinion from down right stupid to somewhat entertaining once I started to appreciate the attempt at an old 80's horror film and the bits of humor.

428,Wirxaw,That's.... it?,6,29 November 2017,"What an eye-roller.... I'll be honest, the cinematography was solid. Effective... special effects, imaginative... CGI, compared to many modern horrors - this isn't a wasted effort. But the writing... I admit, I have no idea of the original, I can't compare it either to the novel or the series. But the characters are so unclear that you just roll your eyes every other scene.The elephant in the room: Why even include the fat kid in the first place? Okay, there are a few secondaries with little personality, that asthma kid, the jew, the black one - they are filler, I am surprised none of them died.And the fat kid? The movie begins by suggesting an... out of nowhere romance, literally. Right, as if a gorgeous girl, even if she is trashed, would just approach and be so nice. Golfclap. What do we see next of this kid? He takes pretty much the worst treatment of all the guys(and one of them gets his arm broken). Yet what does he do? He fights back, he shows no fear. He actually looks like a diamond in the rough, a hidden protagonist. He studies the town, he plays an important role for the plot. He even saves that token girl in the most fairy-tale way imaginable in the end.But somewhere in the middle of the plot - suddenly this... this... Harry Potter, for the lack of a better description, rises. Maddeningly driven to find his god-forsaken brother, devoid of all fear, a pure knight in shining armor. White, handsome, slender and brave. It really can't get any dumber. And when everything looks bad, who are the only people to be ""brave""? Of course, he. No zit. And the girl, because.... reasons. She is apparently also super hot, super kind, super open-minded and super brave. Just an ideal persona. Yet... the fat kid is swept under the rug. Along with all the other fillers.As far as we are concerned, the boys are grounded and hate each other. The four-eyed comedian hates both Harry Potter and his girl, yet when the damsel gets in distress, as per the norm - he immediately goes to the rescue. And so does the jew and the black guy. No questions asked, they've got nothing better to do. Even the asthma kid, who clearly got screwed by that girl, who told him that the meds are fake - blows it out on his mother and joins the rest. Just like that.Throw in a couple of ""Full Metal Jacket"" scenes and we are approaching the finale. During which - the Harry Potter promises to the jew that ""if they stick together, they will be alright"". One really eye-rolling scene later, we see the jew get lost. Just like that. And, when his face is clearly getting eaten, instead of some proper gore(and, for what it's worth, by that point that movie has shown patricide twice, so it can't get any worse), he is left out with mere bites. Guess jews really aren't tasty.In the end, the Harry Potter clearly skips the girl for his bloody brother, while, as I said, the fat kid saves her. But... after a few really stupid exchanges, Harry Potter takes the lead again and... yeah, everyone leaves and he pretty much shares the final solid kiss with his future squeeze.It feels like the movie TRIED to establish the characters, to develop something non-linear. But it utterly failed and turned out as every generic flick ever. And here I thought Frozen had a ridiculous turnabout...The most unnecessary character was the black kid. Why... was he there? Token Black from South Park? Or he was in the originals too? I'm not talking about color here, I'm saying that he both had the color and the lack of any development whatsoever. And pretty much so was the jew. Well, he ""had"" some extra scenes here and there, but he seemed like an annoying donkey of the bunch. The asthma kid and the four-eye? A couple of sidekicks, who can't decide which ball to rub. On one hand, they are actual sidekicks, on the other - they are just as useless. And, of course, the aforementioned fat kid, who got written off, but at least had plenty of character development. Come to think of it, the main duo had less character than even the fat kid.So it should be pretty clear why this plot feels so... weird. Eye-rolling.If they wanted to build a relationship - they should build it. If they want Harry Potter to find his brother - focus on that. Remove one or two unnecessary characters and invest more in the others, there are plenty to go. Explore more about the girl, more about Pennywise. I've almost thought it would be revealed that he is ""some freddy krueger, who got killed by the town and now he hunts it"", but no. He just goes Sadako back into the well. Haven't seen that one before...I can't say that this is a bad film... all in all, it COULD get worse and stupider. But it really can't deserve any more than 6/10. Not with that plot. And it's sad, if it was well-written, it could easily be a modern horror benchmark at 8-9/10.",It

It is a perfectly paced and beautifully shot movie that captures some of the love for 80's horror movies.But 'IT' is actually much more than just a rehash of a plain-old horror movie: The characters are all interesting and the kids' acting skills are surprisingly convincing and moving. You really do feel for them and you want them to succeed, which is really what makes a horror movie be a hit or a flop. The emotional subplots are not too shallow as well—the love story does not feel haphazardly attached onto everything else; the interactions between the characters feel meaningful and real.The new clown is also quite well done with some very creepy acting and a compelling voice. What's more: I didn't even mind the CGI of the horror effects. Usually CGI puts me off, but here, everything was done rather well with some really suspenseful moments.In the end, what really got me to love the new 'IT' is that this is a movie for people who love movies.

It's over 1,100 pages, and mine was a paperback - meaning, the binding fell apart like 3-4 times, which was OK, it was so hard to hold a paperback that thick!I took me roughly 9 months to read, I was working the graveyard shift and either we were busy, or bored out of our minds. I don't even know who left the book there, but I saw it, picked it up and started readying during the down times. Honestly, it took me so long to read, and it was detailed beyond what was required.. I can't remember maybe 20% of what I read. I just know this movie is good. Although it's a remake from a movie in the 80s - for once, the remake didn't destroy the original. I think both films are good.If I had to compare to any other type movie, it's similar to Freddy Kruger, a little gore and violence, mostly just scary situations - but at the same time, managed to add some lighthearted humor to the film.RECOMMEND: If you only see 1 horror movie this year... this is the one. Maybe just because I'm older and these movies hold some nostalgia for me??",It
431,resireg,Worst remake ever! Stick to the 1990 version.,1,4 September 2019,"I did not have fun watching ""IT"" at all. First of all, I could not sympathyze with any of the characters/protagonists. Second, there is no horror at all. The movie does not make you scared of Pennywise. Third, the situations are very unreal, like people killing theirnown parents and nothing happening afterwards. And last, the movie is just too long. In the end, they even gives us spoilers teloingnis that there will be a sequel.Those teenagers were all risking their lives in supposedly dangerous situations and suddenly someone would say "" it is summer, wer re kids and we are supposed to be outside!"". Who cares about that when there is a crazy monster chasing you?I hated it",It
432,dhainline1,No Wonder Stephen King Liked This Treatment of his Classic Story!,10,10 September 2017,"The setting is Derry, Maine in Oct. 1988 to Sept. 1989 instead of Oct. 1957-1958 and I think it suits the production! George Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott)is a normal, run-the-mill 6-year-old boy with a older stuttering brother whom he idolizes named Bill (Jaeden Lieberher). Bill makes Georgie a boat out of a piece of paper and he sealed it with wax for George. Bill can't go out in the rain because he's ill. Georgie gives him a hug for the boat and runs out in the rain. The boat ends up sailing into the sewer and Georgie meets a creature one doesn't expect to see in a sewer. The creature is a clown who has Georgie's boat in his hands. Bill Skarsgard plays the clown Pennywise who introduces himself to Georgie and they have small talk. When the boy reaches for his boat, the clown turns monstrous and rips the poor kid's arm off! He drags Georgie down into the sewer while an old lady watches from her house along with her cat. After Georgie's disappearance, the Denbrough family is basically destroyed. Bill and Georgie's parents ignore their remaining son and the grief gets too much for them! Bill isn't the only one with problems in his life. He and six other kids have to deal with less than stellar parents and horrible school bullies in their lives. The group really can't be called a band which is what a group of boys is called because of the lone girl of the group named Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis). Beverly is tormented by a group of snobby girls led by Gretta (Megan Charpentier). They all think Beverly is a slut and is trash. Everyone thinks poor Beverly is those things, too! They throw water on her and torment her. The five other boys are overweight, bookish, Derry history buff Ben Hanscom (Jeremey Ray Taylor), aspiring comedian Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) an orphaned home-schooled African-American boy who lost his parents in a fire. He is the only black boy in town and is a target of racism. Eddie Kasprak (Jack Dylan Grazer) is a frail boy with psychosomatic asthma and other health problems his smothering mother aka smother has made worse in her only child. Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) is the only non-Christian of the group who is studying like mad for his upcoming Bar Mitzvah but it's not good enough for his rabbi father! The six boys and one girl have to deal with Pennywise the Dancing Clown who uses their fears against them and a group of bullies led by the son of the police chief. Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) is the mean, evil bully who torments the group he calls the Losers Club with Belch Huggins (Jake Sim), Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague) and Victor Criss (Logan Thompson) as his lackeys. Pennywise is on the loose though and the clown goes after the Losers and the Bowers' Gang as well. Patrick is eaten by the dead, floating kids. Pennywise knows what kids fear and he uses these phobias against them! Bill is tormented by Georgie, a diseased leper comes after Eddie, Beverly is scared of her leach of a father, Stan is terrified of a picture of an ugly woman in his dad's office, Mike is scared of the fire that killed his parents, and Richie hates clowns. Bill Skarsgard makes this Pennywise his own and the results are terrifying! Tim Curry in the 1990 TV movie ""IT"" also scared the hell out of viewers and both actors are artists in their own right! All the kids are awesome and you emphasize with the Losers and hate the bullies! I do hope Chapter 2 lives up to Chapter 1 and the grown-up versions of the Losers are great too! I think Sophia Lillis is right about Jessica Chastain playing older Beverly because they do look like each other. I do have hopes for Bill Hader as older Richie because Richie grows up to be a comedian and they look like each other! Maybe Tim Curry can make an appearance in Chapter 2 or the actors who were in the 90's version can have cameos too! Sad to say Jonathan Brandis who was young Bill in the TV version and John Ritter who was older Ben won't be in Chapter 2 because both have died. Last of all: I recommend this version of IT highly and hopefully Chapter 2 lives up to my recommendation as well! I am glad Bill Skarsgard is coming back as Pennywise! I did see pictures of the Skarsgard clan and all are very attractive. I think if the remade ""Clueless,"" Cher would say a guy is a Skarsgard if he's very good- looking instead of a Baldwin. I do hope Bill wins an Academy Award next year and I wait with baited breath for Chapter 2!",It

434,tranat71,Surprisingly good,9,3 November 2017,"I have not read this Stephen King novel.I have seen the older ""It"" TV miniseries when I was a kid.Overall, I would say that this new ""It"" is a pretty good movie when compared to all movies.Compared to other horror movies, I think ""It"" is better than most of them. Of course, ""It"" is nowhere near as good as ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Green Mile"" as a movie in general. Shawshank was meant to win the Oscars. Shawshank is in a class all by itself. Green Mile was also meant to be included with Oscar talks, although not in the same league as Shawshank. ""It"" is just meant to be entertaining as a horror movie. Nothing more. I still like ""The Dark Tower"" movie better than ""It"".So this year, I saw 4 Stephen King movies: ""It"", ""The Dark Tower"", ""Gerald's Game"", and ""1922"".I like all 4 movies, and I would rank ""The Dark Tower"" #1, ""It"" #2, ""Gerald's Game"" #3, and ""1922"" #4.",It
435,nathanjamesemerson,Pennywise Lives Again,10,23 September 2018,"It took 31 years, but it finally happened. A theatrical adaption of Stephen King's brilliant novel IT.To correct a LOT of people from around the web, this is NOT a remake. People tend to get confused between the 1990 miniseries and this film. A miniseries and a movie are two separate entities. The only thing both have in common is that they are both based on the same novel. That is it. End of story.As a massive IT fan and collector I was anticipating this movie for many many years. Was I disappointed in the film? Hell no. I loved it. Everything about it. The cast were absolutely amazing. They are a very talented group of kids, and I can see a very bright future for all of them. Bill Skarsgard played a perfect Pennywise. And as a child of the 80's myself, I loved the changes to have included it as the setting for the movie and it brought back memories.I think Andy Muschietti is a very very talented director. I loved his MAMA short film and then his full length movie adaption of it. I look forward to everything else he does in the future. Everyone else involved in the film did an amazing job. I love the score to the film. The cinematography was amazing. I cant stress enough just what an amazing job everyone did on the film.The only criticism I have for the movie, is that it should have been more terrifying. The book scared the living shit out of me when I read it back in 1990, and still sends a shiver down my spine when I reread it every 2 years. Don't get me wrong, the movie had several creepy scenes and some jump scares. I only wish it was amped up a bit more. Regardless, I still give this film a 10/10",It
436,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,A potentially great film that is just good.,7,8 September 2017,"In regard to the book and the TV series I will only say that no comparison will be made. The source material is legendary and is considered a trademark novel in American literary history, so the movie had a more that potent source to draw inspiration from.The movie is a very well crafted, nicely shoot and well made with more than a few scares that really rattle the cages of the viewers. Still, a bitter taste was felt after the end of the movie, simply because more was expected.There main reasons why this movie is not a great movie are as follow:1) The length. Running for about 135 minutes, I was under the impression that all of the main plot lines and character backstories were going to be depicted in the movie. They are not. What we were presented with was a too long and dragged intro of about 40 minutes that is solely comprised of jump scares that should have introduced us to the characters. At one point this type of storytelling becomes dull and one starts to wonder if there is more to the movie. But, thankfully, the story picks up the pace and something starts to happen. When the ending finally appears, one is not only relieved but delighted to actually see something dynamic and entertaining, despite the fact of it being scary as hell.2) The story. Even though it stayed very much true to the novel, the story itself drags on for far too long until something worth while starts to happen. As mentioned above, the intro to the characters is far too long, leaving the viewer to simply lose interest in the movie. The end of the 3/4 of the movie, when the kids actually meet It, presents a culmination of fear effect, jump scares, light work and dark comedy. Simply put, the house confrontation is one of the best segments and an essential part of the movie. But, because of it's ties to the book, it was decided that after this magnificent scene, the movie drags on for another half an hour before the final confrontation actually takes place. And this is where the movie showed it's true downfall. It simply became boring and introduced another plot line that was completely unnecessary and just harmed the movie in total. Thankfully, the final battle and the setting, the atmosphere, the dark music and tone, and a stellar performance by Bill Skarsgård really lift the movie to spectacular heights.3) No leading man. During the intro credits I couldn't help but notice that no big names were attached to the movie. It was a risk that usually pays of, but this time a problem occurred. A movie of this length needs a star that can pull and carry the movie all the way, or at least for a few scenes, giving it the necessary push for the kids to take over another scene. This is one of the two greatest problems - the kids were great (especially Sophia Lillis), but they lack the necessary skill set and acting abilities necessary for carrying a movie of this length and psychological difficulty.Despite all of the above mentioned, It really is not a bad movie. The atmosphere is great - spooky and dark, the music on spot, the acting above expectations (but not as good as a movie of this type needs), the effects marvelous, and the scares heart stopping at times.So, all in all, a good ride, but in all fairness, not worth another viewing. Simply too long, with two spectacular climaxes that in the end, do not save the overly long story and dragging progression.",It
437,alexklatt-28518,Spooky clown,5,10 September 2019,"This is a decent movie. It's not terribly scary or original, but it has some good moments.

438,JoshuaDysart,All the quality of a made for Netflix movie,5,11 September 2017,"Personally, I thought all the CGI buried Skarsgard's performance, I have no idea if he is interesting in this role or not. The film is rife with overplayed, standard horror imagery right out of the modern playbook (if I see the stutter cut monster run one more time...) and it's all very, very tired. There is very little imagination in scares, they have no weight or meaning. The whole thing feels like a YA horror story made for Netflix. Sophia Lillis and Jeremy Ray Taylor are breakout stars though, they're fun to watch, but in a standout year for horror, IT wasn't it. Hopefully, you enjoy it more than I did. I certainly seem to be in the minority here.",It

While there is atmosphere, I didn't find anything scary - maybe mildly creepy. That's it.There really wasn't much going on the first hour, and I really struggled to keep awake. Soon afterwards I asked myself ""why am I watching this when there are so many better movies to watch?"" (something that I rarely, if ever, have asked myself) so I turned it off.If other people find this scary, then that's great. I found Pennywise more interesting than scary, and the film just had a bunch of cheap 'boo' shots and CGI monsters.Maybe something happens during the 2nd half?

Needless to say, it never happened. Very disappointed. I prefer the original two-part movie which was a story of kids traumatized by evil seeping around town and trying to figure out what was going on. Years later they reunite as adults to face their fears and avenge their lost friend by finally taking IT on. It made an impression on me, as many of us as kids growing up sense that there is something not right about our town and return to it later in life to figure out what was going on.

Most of which work, few don't.It follows the story of young Georgie, his brother Bill makes him a paper boat to play with in a very stormy street. Unfortunately for him, the boat falls into a gutter where he encounters a clown. The rest of the story follows Georgie's brother and his friends, their own encounters with the clown and other horrifying events. Like I said, some of the new ideas work, some don't and aren't explored enough.A solid cast, plenty of jump scares, plenty of laughs and the right amount of tension, if a slightly schmaltzy end, lead to a pretty solid horror film, possibly the best of the year.",It
450,sanjidparvez,One of the most entertaining horror films of recent years.,8,23 September 2017,"As an adaptation of Stephen King's IT – CHAPTER ONEthis turned out quite satisfactory; Andy Muschietti & his team did a pretty good job overall. The great bunch of young actors nicely shines in their respective roles but yesdidn't't get why they switched & changed few original ideas or things about characters like Mike, Ben & Bev...what's the point of making Ben as the history nerd instead of Mike without revealing anything about his family or background, particularly just moving into a new town & staying over at an Aunt's house, where he's having kind of difficult time to adjust because of an annoying cousin & aunt. Personally I loved that aspect in the miniseries which I found quite relevant for many kinds around that age passing through the similar sort of problem. And the other things that kinda bugged me were Bev's missing slingshot skills and the way they gave away the little mystery around 'the Secret admirer' thing to her so early in this phase of the story. But manthat stunning young actress (Sophia Lillis) turned out quite a catch for this movie, I'm sure she'll have some damn busy days with great prospects in coming years of her career. Pleasantly surprised by Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise! Mostly because of my early impression about this portrayal of Pennywise wasn't much positive or hopeful from what I've seen in the first teaser/trailer. Thought it was going to be somewhat cheesy but glad it turned out I was wrong. Enjoyed his every encounter with the kidsparticularly the major selling point was his very first appearance & interaction with Georgie and he nailed that segment with his own charisma of portraying the fabulously creepy 'dancing clown' of Derry (btw, shocked to see that ended in gruesome fashion! I wasn't expecting at all to see such explicit & gory death scene of such a young victim!). Anyway, coming out from the reels (inside the garage) & the freezer (in Neibolt house) were another favorite parts and also that 3-scary doors part was a clever touch by Muschietti. But I wouldn't call them jump scares as I was expecting something like that to happen at those parts of the movie. Those were deliberate scares for menicely done, entertaining & loved them all. The whole kid's viewpoint treatment worked so well for a change considering how most other major modern horror films came out in recent years. I think they can still add few more short scenes regarding how adult community was dealing with those child missing cases more elaborately while grown-up characters recalling about the old Derry in next chapter(s). As a whole, I'd say Andy Muschietti's IT is the most entertaining horror film of 2017 so far. Excited to see who they eventually cast in the all grown-up roles for these characters.",It

452,moviesmaniax,A near-perfect reboot horror! // Instagram: moviesmaniax,10,8 September 2017,"Okay, since I'm now swifting It Comes At Night to my best thriller of the year category, this near-perfect reboot of Stephen King's IT is now THE best horror film this year (so far) and is easily one of the best clown horror films ever made. IT packs plenty of genuine scares as well as jumpy ones, all of which are presented way more frequent than most big studio horror films and making its pacing flow well with constant scares and thrills to keep the audience entertained and spooked throughout the film. The use of practical effects here are also deliciously creepy and gleefully disturbing to look at along with the freaky performance from Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise just even increases the insanity and horrifying level of this re-imagining version of the character without entirely replicating what has already been done (still, this version of Pennywise somehow reminds me of Johnny Depp's Mad Hater on cocaine at some point). Not only does this film have all the horrors to offer but other elements in the film here are also crafted so well like The Losers' Club. The Losers' Club here are perfectly cast, acted, and developed, making us care about their fates and relationships and therefore, be able to hook us to the screen from start to finish with their funny, energetic, and heartbreaking performances. Overall, besides its genuinely frequent scares, applaudingly creepy practical effects, and performances, IT not only proves to be a near-perfect remake but also strongly adapts what already has been done and creates a whole new insanity level of horror on top of that, as well as keeping the same heartbreaking drama core of the original through its exceptional cast into finally becoming this year's best horror film.(A)",It

454,influxtwo,Finally get to see a lot of what has only ever been implied an it's worth it,9,9 September 2017,"Easily one of the more decent & developed horror films to come out of recent times.At most, a fresh and faithful adaptation of the source material. Not so much being ""just"" a remake either, as the 1990 miniseries left a lot out of the book. The novel featured many themes and visuals that were deemed too complex or graphic for television audiences at the time of the early 90s. Since technology has come a long way since then they were able to depict now some of the more creative and outrageous visuals required to bring the story from the book to life. A solid 'R' rating promises more mature content also along the way.At first I was skeptical but Bill Skarsgård shot it out of the park playing the iconic character of Pennywise. His mannerisms echo Tim Curry at times, but also expand things much further. This guy was really owning the role and the special effects aided in his portrayal. Finally we are able to see a lot of what until now has only ever been implied - and there lies the real treat of the film from a horror perspective.Tim Curry's portrayal in the mini-series was also great, totally iconic and classic. However I think Bill Skarsgård was a respectable update to coincide with it. Finally a remake that doesn't feel like just a cheap cash grab but one that truly respects the source material of the novel.The child actors all do for the most part a fantastic job. Their reactions at times were appropriately hysterical, while other times they get over a rather traumatizing experience a bit too quick. Not a terrible fault to the production but still a mildly noticeable one. The rest of the supporting cast was very good as well though.Stephen King gave the film his blessing upon an early screening, and I think I'd have to agree with him. Not in a long time have I seen a horror film be this developed and emotionally captivating. I was skeptical during the first half of the film, but the whole second act was like buckling in for a roller coaster ride. I was clutching at my chest during some of the more suspenseful scenes. Would I say it was overly frightening? No not really. But I would say that they get you invested enough in to the characters to be able to feel the frights along with them. The suspense was entertaining and the film's dream-like quality meant anything could happen.With out any spoiler there was one interaction featured towards the end that really showcased just how incredibly creative and breathtaking the visuals of this film really are. Again, we are able to see a lot of what has only ever been implied. and it's worth it.A theater experience that I think takes creative visceral horror to the next level. I am really looking forward to the second chapter to see what they do with it next.9/10",It
455,darksyde-63508,One Of the better horror remakes,8,29 November 2017,"I guess one of the most important things to think about when seeing this movie, and if you haven't yet, wtf, is to forget all you know about the original Tim Curry version, and about 70% of the book. When I first heard they were remaking this, I was excited and cautious, coz I mean, I grew up with Tim Curry being Pennywise,and didn't think Bill Skarsgaard could fill his (clown) shoes. And while many prefer skarsgaards cock eyed Pennywise, I still prefer Curry's version. There are quite a few changes in this remake. To make the story more modern, it now takes place in the late 80's, instead of the 50's like the book and original version did. There are also a lot of parts that were in the book that are in this version, where they were left put in the time curry version. But all in all, this is a high mark in horror movie remakes. It is also the highest grossing horror movie in recent times. My only gripe about it, is that they placed a lot of humor in this, especially between Eddie and Stan, and this often distracts from the horror of everything that's going on.",It
456,Ingrouille181,"Overall, another great remake, and a new, soon to be horror classic",7,8 September 2017,"A very creepy and well put together remake; something I never say about any remake, ever, especially one for a horror flick. The It novel by Stephen King has been with us since the 80's, and I never knew why with all the pointless remakes like The Nightmare on Elm Street or The Wickerman (god help us), no studio decided to give the It novel a full on feature film. There's so much to use from that book; it literally demands a feature. The craze of remaking EVERY.SINGLE.HORROR.MOVIE isn't done yet, it's slowly fading, but out of every ten we get there's always one that makes sense. I haven't seen the original 1990 miseries for years now, and all I remember are the iconic scenes, like Pennywise's reveal in the sewer, and I'll get to that in a second. I see this movie in a packed theater; there was cheering, screaming, laughing and applause. Haven't seen that since The Avengers.The story follows the lives of seven individuals, kids who, after the disappearance of the lead characters little brother, all begin to experience nightmare visions, all coming from one ancient evil source, a creature in the form of a clown named Pennywise. Along the way, they deal with neighborhood bullies, abusive parents and their own personal fears. This leads them to track down the evil presence, before they themselves become the victims of the clown.But like all movies, there are pros and cons, so I'll start with the pros. Other than the actors in the film, who do a great job, especially the child actors, I like how all of them fit seemingly into the 80's era. Most of the characters work, and I'll also get to that in a bit. As for Bill Skarsgård, I think he fits the role of Pennywise very well; would definitely make Tim Curry proud. But if there's still one thing Curry tops him in is part of what makes clowns truly creepy, the trust factor. Whereas Skarsgård's Pennywise is a full on 'demon from the pits of hell', Curry's Pennywise spoke with a whimsical voice, a cheerful glee. Maybe that'd be too cheesy for a 2017 horror film, but I just don't see any kid speaking to the new Pennywise and not straight away yelling ""stranger danger"". Curry's Pennywise spoke with a level of trust that took him slightly more away from the ""Uncanny Valley""I also liked that the movie moved away from showing the origin of Pennywise. As it is I think the origin they gave Pennywise it tacky as all hell (seriously look it up), but that extra layer of mystery is what makes characters like these even more terrifying. Same reason the Joker is so fascinating (or at least, until his own movie comes out, thanks DC).As for the first con, I'd say it some of the dumb decisions. I can understand that the main character wants to find Pennywise to kill him for killing his brother, but why does he separate from the group, when he himself wanted to keep the group together? Also some of the characters were dumb or just not fleshed out enough to make them make sense. There's one character who needs an inhaler, and his mom is one of those overbearing protective mother types, like Kathy Bates in Waterboy, but to an absurd degree. But why? the first time we see her in the movie she seems like an ordinary mom, and then later on she's like this, for some reason. It's like the scriptwriters were desperate to give the inhaler kid some personal issue to deal with. I heard that's in the book but if you don't have enough time to flesh that out why put it in there at all? Also some of the jokes hit at the worst times, when we should be feeling scared. Reminded me of the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 2 when Peter makes that ""walkman"" joke. Also, the jump scares remind me of a Paranormal Activity movie, or any found footage movie really. They're cheap, and the film does nothing new with them which made me roll my eyes every time they kept on using them.I haven't read the book, but from what I've heard on line from those who have read it, it remains very accurate, and doesn't shy away from showing gore or violence, like the scene at the beginning. There's more I've probably forgotten to add, but that's it from the top of my head. Overall, a very enjoyable remake, and I definitely see this movie becoming a horror classic ten years down the line; but maybe not ""The Shining"" level, more like ""Cloverfield"" level. Hopefully Andy Muschietti directs It:Chapter Two, and ends the story with a bang.",It
457,Msbnitski,Another let down of a Stephen King novel to a movie.,1,5 July 2021,"I try to watch these movies regarding a wonderful scare the crap out of me story by Stephen King brought to the big screen. I have tried a few times and they always let me down. IT was my absolute favorite book from Stephen King. It's the 1 book that got me hooked on this wonderful author.I fell for it one more time. I saw the ratings numbers and decided to watch. I'm only a half hour or so into this trash and I just can't watch anymore. Once again, take a horrifically wonderful story by Stephen King and turn it into total crap on the big screen. Maybe, if I were 12 it might be okay.",It
458,ironcraftleague,A great reboot.,8,24 January 2019,"This was a great movie to watch because it kept me invested with mainly two elements: The kids and Pennywise. The kids do a great job and its clear how its set in the 80s and I really like that. It gives us a chance to go back into a time period a lot of people enjoy. Pennywise is incredibly scary at times and can be a little unintentionally funny at times. He's a great villain. However, what's stopping this reboot to be a masterpiece is one glaring issue: Tone. This movie is trying to be so much at once and it doesn't exactly work. Other desicions storywise were really weird and it didn't blend well/didn't make sense. Aside from that, its a good film. I enjoy it a solid chunk of the time and I found myself rooting a lot for the kids and the sewer scene made me laugh and cheer the kids on. 8/10.",It
459,FabledGentleman,"Not that scary, and at times pretty boring",6,16 September 2017,"Well. I'm not sure why some reviewers praise this film like a masterpiece, because it clearly isn't. Horror films i consider to be great or masterpieces are Alien, The Exorcist, The Orphanage, The Shining, The Thing and so on. There are many great horror films, this is not one of them.To begin with, the movie isn't that scary. It relies on jump scare tactics from start to finish. Squeaking doors, strobe lights, music goes silent right before the scare, camera pans around to reveal something out of frame and so on. It uses all the tricks in the book, but so did movies like Alien. What sets good horror films from the others, is the story.I have not read the book, but since it has sold over a hundred million, I'm guessing it was pretty scary, and had a very good story. So where did this film go wrong? And what did it do right? To begin with, i would like to state that i did see the IT mini series in the early 90's, but i could not remember much of it. So i did not remember exactly what Pennywise was, and what exactly he could do. All i knew is that he is a clown that takes on the form of the victims deepest fears, to break them down, so he can eat them. That's about it. And that he prefers to eat children.So pretty damn nasty and scary stuff there. That is why it surprises me how unscary this film was. The movie starts off pretty good, the first 10-20 minutes or so looks very promising, but after that, the movie starts to get boring. The horrible stuff happening feels trivial, and does not hit the nerve it's intended to. This can be caused by many things, and it's probably a combination of mediocre acting, directing, editing, screenplay or a combination of all of those.After the movie was done i was left really unsatisfied and curious. So i read about pennywise when i got home, i read what the novel says about him, what he is, where he comes from, how he can do what he does. You see, the movie completely fails at this, it does not tell anything about pennywise. And that seem to have been a huge mistake.In Alien, at least they show us the life cycle of the alien. We see where it was found, how it was inserted into the person, how it looked like when it burst out, and how fast it grew to full size, and then how incredibly dangerous it was. Then we were trapped inside a space ship with it, knowing what he was capable of, and that the crew basically were screwed. With the original script, the good acting, the awesome direction and the brilliant set pieces, Alien became a masterpiece.You don't always need to know a characters back story, many horror films works because the lesser you know, the more scary it is. But this does not seem to be the case with IT.In this movie i always had this feeling the kids never were in any real danger from Pennywise. So the last hour of the film or so was really boring at times. It is one scene after the other with the clown and the kids, and it never had any suspense. What created suspense was characters like Beverly's father, those scenes and some others actually saves this film from becoming a total drag.The movie is indeed beautifully shot, and it has some great sound effects, and Bill Skarsgård is pretty good as Pennywise, just not that scary. I'm not sure if it's his fault, or the direction or the script. but I'm leaning on the director and the script, because Bill could have been really scary, if only i wasn't so damn sure those kids were always gonna be safe.This was the reason Hitchcock bought every single book of Psycho before he made the film. He didn't want the audience to know the plot or the ending, because if they knew, the film would have had absolutely no suspense. This might be it, it can be that simple.But in that case, if this movie has no suspense for anyone who have seen the TV series or read the book, well then it is a fail. It should have delivered something that was shocking and surprising, something unexpected and also more original, spent less time on jump scare tactics, and come up with a more effective way of telling the story. I can not put my finger on exactly what this movie was lacking, but it sure wasn't that scary.It's a 2 hour buildup to a boss fight that ends exactly how you expect.6/10 - Fair",It
460,emojihundred,The opening was very good.,6,10 May 2021,The opening of the movie was very good and i thought there will be frightning scenes but there were no really scary scenes.

I am reviewing this movie late but this is all i remember about this movie..,It
461,prolelol,An excellent film!,9,8 September 2017,"The new IT movie is very entertaining movie and some scenes were brutal. The 'bleeding in the sink' scene was the best scene from it, it was hell bloody. It has really beautiful cinematography! The kids were really good. Great performances all round. Sophia Lillis's character Beverly, the only girl in a group, is by far more interesting and better than the original Beverly. She gave really amazing performance, and was probably the best thing about the movie. The worst thing about this movie is Pennywise's teeth. His smile is annoying and horrible (also when his eyes moves is really annoying), but I liked when he tried to scare children. But again, he's just like 'annoyingly scary' clown. His costume is also bad. The original Pennywise is much, much better and always will be. But overall, it's not very scary, but I enjoyed it very much because it's well done, but it could have been a little better if Pennywise was good in it.",It

463,hacks-56635,Holds much of the heart of the book,7,5 September 2019,"Right from the start, the scene of the little one feeding the hungry one sets a great tone. I thought that one more than anything else was a huge success. What a meal he must have made...I can see an absurd positive and absurd negative trend going on in the ratings. This is not a 10 lol at least, not in relation to its source material, however, in no way does it deserve a 1 or a 2...The thing is, having suffered The Dark Tower movie, a truly atrocious experience to any fan, I felt that while ""It"" similarly only shares the title and the characters names with the source material, at least, with the background of the novel, you could relate and understand the personality quirks of the characters that is lacking any real context or explanation within the movie itself. At least they tried to be themselves, to stay true to the characters.The location and actors are all amazing, and did all that could be expected of them.See, for me, the reason the movie is a success is because it managed to portray (at least to me) the bond among the children, and the human/emotional aspect that made this and other SK titles like ""The Body A.K.A Stand by Me"" such a treat.The only real letdown to me is the era. Setting it so much later has an odd twist on the tone. It's hard to explain, but these are people out of time... There's no need for that, except maybe cheaper sets?...Anyways, while not the true adaptation to the novel a die hard fan might like, I think it still retains much of its flavor and appeal.

469,bigbadbassface,Doesn't hold up to the book,1,8 September 2017,"I went to an advanced screening after spending the last two weeks pummeling through the book. Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, this is not at all close to the book (but that really isn't my main reason for not being crazy about it). I realize there were some time constraints but this felt like there was basically nothing explained about the main character's backgrounds, relationships, nor their motivations (specifically Henry Bowers as the bully for hating them SO much is just assumed to be ""because he's a bully""?). At times I was confusing Eddie, Richie, and Stan because there was little definable about them besides Stan wearing a yarmulke to identify him as Jewish, and Richie wearing glasses - it felt like these physical attributes were necessary because nothing distinguished their personalities. Pennywise was cast very well and I loved his voice and overall creepiness, but it couldn't make up for the fact that every time he and the main character's met it felt like a ""Tom and Jerry"" routine. They encounter him, he bumbles it or they do something random, and he runs off. Overall I just left feeling like there was so much that could have been expanded (both story and character-wise) given the 135 minute running time. I wasn't a huge fan of the 1990 TV miniseries (probably since it was 20 years after it came out that I first saw it) but it was more accurate and explained the relationships more than this movie. I just feel like I would have liked this more if it was maybe called something else. As it is, this is not a movie version of the book 'It', but a totally different story using the same character's names.",It

The movie simply played typical horror movie music and then had the loud jump sound as Pennywise jumped out which happened over and over. There really was way too much of Pennywise in the movie.

472,lumieretrain,It Chapter One by Andy Muschietti,8,30 August 2019,"The novel It is one of the longest and one of the most important works, which the writer Stephen King has ever written. The novel is notable to explore themes about friendship, love, loss, the change from the childhood to the manhood, the battle with the biggest fear, the power of the memories and so on. The novel talks with specific details about the town Derry, which is an important element of the story, to see how the horrors happened in Derry for centuries are all connected with the evil entity It. The novel jumps the time between 1958 and 1985 to see how the main characters as adults, would feel about getting back all of their memories when they were children. It balances the atmospheres between, the horror by scaring the audience in the most unexpected ways, the drama to create emotional chapters by making the audience cry and finally the humor by making the audience laugh. As the miniseries It by Tommy Lee Wallace is still one of the most important Stephen King adaptions, Warner Bros. was interested to produce and distribute a cinematic adaption of the novel It. There have been difficulties to work on the adaption of It as different filmmakers, including Cary Joji Fukunaga, who were initially involved to direct the movie, by then leaving the project like there were no possibilities to release the movie. Until the filmmaker Andy Muschietti came aboard to direct the project, by giving some changes for his vision of the story. But in the same way to be as faithful as possible, with the main themes of the novel. After a long time of work, in 2017 came out It Chapter One by Andy Muschietti with Jaedan Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer and Bill Skarsgård. The movie's plot: In the summer of 1989, seven children Bill Denbrough (Jaedan Lieberher), Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff), Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) and Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), are in the holidays to have all together fun as they all take part of the Losers Club. They get close with each other to help each other, as they have different issues especially the main one is getting bullied by the sociopath Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) and his gang. At the same time the Losers Club help each other, they all have the same scary encounter with an evil entity called It, which most of the time disguises itself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård). It Chapter One from the beginning to the end captures the audience attention to see, who are the main characters and how they would find out the mysteries of Derry. The movie gets interesting by narrating only the first part of the story, when the main characters were children, rather than using the flashbacks like in the novel. The main characters are one of the most important elements of the movie, as they would confront all together the issues without dividing each other. Jaedan Lieberher was excellent as Bill Denbrough, a stutter boy who is the one to convince the Losers Club to do something against the entity It, to even find out what happened to his little brother Georgie. Jeremy Ray Taylor was really good as Ben Hanscom, an overweight boy who is the one to do some researchers by understanding, how all the horrors committed in Derry are connected with It. Sophia Lillis did a well done performance as Beverly Marsh, a strong abused girl who initially has no confidence with anybody, until she meets the Losers Club to be happier than before. Finn Wolfhard was really good as Richie Tozier, a boy with a loud mouth which gets him in trouble, as he cannot resist to use the humor in any kind of situations. Wyatt Oleff was excellent as Stanley Uris, a boy who is the son of a rabbi as he has to practice the bar mitzvah, while he stays with happiness among the Losers Club. Chosen Jacobs did a well done performance as Mike Hanlon, a boy who lives with his grandfather that owns a farm and helps him in the job, he initially has no friends until he meets the Losers Club. Jack Dylan Grazer was really good as Eddie Kaspbrak, a hypochondriac boy who has pressure from his protective mother to feel suffocated, until he is with the Losers Club to feel better. Finally Bill Skarsgård was extraordinary as Pennywise an evil clown, who takes actions without being predictable in what he is going to do. Especially through Pennywise's facial expressions, his body language and his scary monologues. It Chapter One uses the horror by scaring the audience, in the most unexpected ways. Through the shadows and the lightenings, by making every single angle shots unforgettable. The movie uses as well as the drama by making the story emotional, especially when there is a strong bond between the Losers Club. Their friendship becomes unique for how they interact with each other, to even see how they would defeat It as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. The editing works without ruining the narration's rhythm, by being unpredictable in what is going to happen in the story. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch was elaborated by creating musical notes, which describes the emotions of the main characters. As well as by giving tension in the scariest ways, in the most thrilling and unexpected moments. It Chapter One is one of the best horror movies, as well as one of the best Stephen King adaptions.",It
473,scottingram,IT (2017) Film Review,8,14 September 2017,"The new horror film IT which is the remake of the IT film from 1990 which starred Tim Curry as Pennywise The Clown with Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise The Clown in the remake film based on a Stephen King book.New Line Cinema's horror thriller IT, directed by Andrés Muschietti (Mama), is based on the hugely popular Stephen King novel of the same name, which has been terrifying readers for decades. When children begin to disappear in the town of Derry, Maine, USA, a group of young kids are faced with their biggest fears when they square off against an evil clown named Pennywise (Swedish actor Bill Skarsgård - Allegiant, Atomic Blonde and is the son of Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård and the younger brother of Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård), whose history of murder and violence dates back for centuries.The cast in IT includes American actor Jaeden Lieberher (Midnight Special, St. Vincent) as Bill Denbrough who has a bit of a stammer, Jeremy Ray Taylor as Bill Hanscom, Sophia Lillis (A Midsummer Night's Dream, 37) as Beverly Marsh, Canadian actor Finn Wolfhard (US TV Series Stranger Things) as Richie Tozier, Chosen Jacobs (US TV Series Hawaii Five-0) as Mike Hanlon, American actor Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie Kaspbrak, Wyatt Oleff (Guardians Of The Galaxy films, Someone Marry Barry) as Stanley Uris, Australian actor Nicholas Hamilton (The Dark Tower, Captain Fantastic) as Henry Bowers, Jake Sim (TV Series Raising Expectations) as Belch Huggins, Logan Thompson as Victor Criss, Owen Teague (US TV Series Bloodline, Cell) as Patrick Hockstetter, Jackson Robert Scott as Georgie Denbrough Bill's younger brother, Stephen Bogaert (X-Men: Apocalypse, American Psycho 2000) as Mr. Marsh Beverly's dad, Stuart Hughes (This Beautiful City, Troubled Waters) as Officer Bowers, Geoffrey Pounsett (Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Falling Fire) as Zach Denbrough Bill and Georgie's dad, Pip Dwyer as Sharon Denbrough Bill and Georgie's mum and Zach's wife, Molly Atkinson as Sonia Kasprak, American actor Steven Williams (Corrina, Corrina, The Trust) as Leroy Hanlon, Canadian actress Elizabeth Saunders (Amelia) as Mrs. Starret, Megan Charpentier (Mama, Red Riding Hood) as Gretta, Joe Bostick (Lars And The Real Girl) as Mr. Keene, Canadian actor Ari Cohen (Maps To The Stars, The Tracey Fragments) as Rabbi Uris, Canadian actor Anthony Ulc (The Entitled, Breakout) as Joe the Butcher, Spanish actor Javier Botet (Crimson Peak, Mama) as Hobo, Katie Lunman as Betty Ripsom, Canadian actress Tatum Lee as Judith, Canadian actor Neil Crone (Pushing Tin, Hollywoodland) as Chief Borton and Sonia Gascón as Mrs. Ripsom.Filming locations in IT includes cities, places like Bangor, Maine, USA, Toronto, Hamilton, Oshawa, Pickering, Port Hope, West Montrose, Ontario, Canada.Overall IT is a good good scary horror film filled with scary horror moments, gory violence, on the edge of your seat stuff, things that will scare you and make you go oh my god or wow or woah, kids, teenagers, adults, trouble makers, dark dirty sewers, nice scenery, family, love, friendship, team work, togetherness, loyalty, some bizarre moments, flashbacks, bad dreams, psychological warfare, mind games, school bullies, outstanding performances from the actors and actresses who played the kids along with Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise The Clown who is my opinion nails it as Pennywise The Clown who is more scary and creepier than the Pennywise The Clown that Tim Curry played in the IT film from 1990 which I have seen once and many other things throughout the film.So I will give IT an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and IT is worth seeing if you like the IT film from 1990 and other horror films along the same lines as this.So if you get the chance to see IT in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later and in my opinion the new remake IT is better than the original IT from 1990 but that's just my opinion but you should go and see the new IT and then you can make up your own mind on which IT is better the original film from 1990 or the remake film from 2017.",It
474,cliff_bd,"Good movie, especially when compared to the 1990 version",7,16 September 2017,"***May Contain Spoilers*** I liked IT. I read the book in the late 1980s and compared to some other inferior Stephen King book to film interpretations it was surprisingly good. For example, The Tommyknockers, was a truly poor movie, there are many other to discuss, but for for me this one was the worst. Obviously there are a few memorable movies such as the Shawshank Redemption, which for me was the best.So why do the Stephen King book to film interpretations hit so issues and cause so many negative comments in the IMDb reviews? It is because the Stephen King books are very complex both in story and in character development - Hollywood are in ""most"" cases extremely poor when translating such stories and characters; preferring to keep things very simple (and predictable for the audience) and is so doing, heavily watering down the content until there is little or none of the original rich tapestry of the story and characters remaining.I was surprised that a remake of ""IT"" was made considering how bad the original TV movie version was in 1990. It was a poor movie due to the reasons I have listed above.But being an eternal optimist I went to see the movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. Was it perfect? Absolutely NOT - and parts of the story was omitted again due to the reasons listed above. Having said that the movie tried to remain faithful to the book, it least as much Hollywood would allow the film makers.I am looking forward to 2nd part with some concern: The 1990 version completely destroyed the cross over between the teenage characters and the adult characters and I had to push myself to continue to watch through to the end. The end of the movie was just a total let down.In the book, it revealed the true nature of IT and explained that what the adults saw, was only what the human mind could accept seeing I.E what IT actually was, was something truly terrible and beyond human comprehensionTherefore I am hoping that Part 2 of IT 2017, will be true to the book (well.....as much as Hollywood will allow).",It
475,achmoye,Just read the book,6,21 December 2017,"First of all, I read the book and I saw the first IT movie. This movie is not so bad, has a decent cinematography, even if some CGI scenes feels weird and questionable.
However, we see a vertical bokeh (artistic blur) on the background, which is really bad and deforms perspective, we usually see a round bokeh which makes soft bubbles of color, so it was a weird use of camera. 
There is a clear overuse of wide lenses, which is a naive approach to horror atmosphere. Then even used it on a cliff (when they jump in the water), we the the cliff completely deformed by the wide angle and it's just an amateur mistake. Characters do have different personas, but it's really cliché and instead of adding some backstories to them, the movie focuses on showing the Pennywise's trauma inflicted to each of them. This process is a huge issue in the movie because it takes way too much time, and it's systematic so very predictable. Other big structure issue : this movie is focused on the past (from book's point of view), when they were children, so we lose all the confrontation between past and present, and this was actually an important aspect of the story. Maybe they tried to do it differently than the first movie, but I think it's more a commercial choice (like CGI use), so the first movie actually did better in this particular aspect. IT is kind of scary, but it doesn' t add much to the story, there's a lot of random scenes where IT appears and disappears, it even disrupts the timeline.I don't recommend, I just recommend you to read the book, and maybe watch the first movie.

Run out into the freezing night half naked?Clowns are a joke. I can understand why a little kid might be afraid of some clowns, but come on--teenagers--are you seriously afraid of clowns? This particular plot is so full of holes it was too funny. First it's a ship going down a sewer drain. Then there's red balloons. And we all float down here. And then the spooky house. Blood coming out of a sink. None of it tied together. It's a hodgepodge of imagery and nonsense. It's like seeing a little kid's imagination for over two hours. I just had to laugh.Cinematically it was well done. The actors were all good. As usual with a teen story, they had to exploit the little girl. They had to oggle her training bra. Of course all the pervs needed to see that scene for just a few more seconds. The clown himself--Pennywise the Dancing Clown that never danced--was iconic and the makeup was a great choice. The movie was well done, and I don't blame the genre, so I give it 7 stars because it's pretty good, but come on...this is NOT a ""Great"" movie!",It
481,thirtyfivestories,Tears are More Deafening than Screams,5,22 September 2017,"The aqueducts of Derry fester with ugly history. A community oblivious to correlated vanishings and newspaper horrors. The new kid in town, Ben, braves the bowels of the library with fresh eyes. The first day of summer is spent perplexing the nosy librarian, and encountering the settlement's fiend. Ben's fascination with the historical march of carnage provides an in with the Losers.The Losers are self-titled, and thus self-defaming. The adhesive to their club is fear. Fear of bullies, germs, Torah readings, and the harsh reality of death. Their stature laughable and their eloquence shaky, the Losers operate with an awareness of their limitations. This collective are the blood-bonded guardians of Derry's youth, because they see the wadding evil in the highest clarity. Their fragility paints crimson crosses upon their foreheads, and the enemy locks in on the prey. No one has trekked this close to pure demonic fervor, and now some teenage bandits must attempt to defeat their inner demons before facing the flamboyant one lurking below. Evil feasts on insecurity. Disbelief in one's self is a death sentence when in the vicinity of evil. Personal confidence and communal affirmation are the tactical counter weapons deployed in the war of introspective terrorism. The Losers are poorly equipped for this combat. Pickering is their go-to defense mechanism; mom insults their greatest pastime. Luckily for them, the addition of a girl to the gang might expand their sensibilities. Beverly is the catalyst for empathy among the boys. She challenges the Losers by shattering preconceptions. The risks she submits to by teaching these stubborn fellas are unfathomable, so she never speaks of the terrors covering her body. Defiance cascades over her scalp. Her mother sheds hearty tears from afar.The creature plaguing the town is a mere manifestation. It is brittle and easily compromised, but only for those impervious to sorrow. Unfortunately, sorrow is a super-cell that devastates all indiscriminately. Sorrow feels like swallowing yourself from inside; an overactive gag reflex purging all traces contentment. The creature sells discomfort, but you must be prepared to make your bed in the sewers.",It
482,joshfedderson,"I Like the old one, but this one breaks that wall now",10,9 September 2017,"""It"" (2017) is my new favorite I just so it tonight and I had to right a review on it. I like this new version because it goes along well with the book. I like how each individual kid goes through a scary experience, and meets Pennywise individually. The story was really good and I liked how it started with Georgie going missing, it made things that more tense. The story follows the losers club and their personal experiences with ""It"" and bullies. They band together to create the losers club and form a friendship that is very close. I like how in this version they focus more on Bill, Beverly, and Ben's relationship and how their early childhood love blooms. I felt they went more in depth in this version then in the previous version explaining a lot more. What I really liked is the ending though, the ending was really great. When they all team up on Pennywise and beat the living hell out of him. Then they all make a promise in blood to return to Derry if ""It"" returns which is a major bonus that shows there will be a second part. The only downside is I was hoping they would show a cut scene at the end of the credits, but all we got is Pennywise's evil laugh. Another thing that confirms a second part is that it says part 1 at the end.This new ""It"" was a good remake. And I'm glad I went and enjoyed it the theater was packed so I knew somehow it was popular. And it was funny how people in the room jumped and screamed, I did a few times. This woman next to me literally grabbed me a few times when she got scared. I didn't mind it,and she apologized to me afterwards and I was cool with it. Her girlfriends thought it was funny. I thought it was cool. ""It"" is a good horror movie and it was better then the previous one. I still like the old one though. Can't wait till part 2! and see the kids grown up as adults. 10/10 for 2017's ""It""",It

485,Behnam-A,Overrated,1,19 December 2017,"This is probably the most overrated film ever. There was too much advertisements high ratings both among the critics and also on IMDB and other rating websites. However, that is the only thing that keeps you stay to the end after you start watching it. It is not scary at all, it is not a good comedy too, and the drama is also lame and you will be bored as hell. Then you think maybe it is been made only for kids, and then you think again even kids don't give a F to this clown. And you know what is weird the most? It is the final scene when they are preparing the audience for something like It (2) ! and then you leave the movie saying: Really?Oh, one more thing: It may amplify your disappointment in 2017 movies if you are not among the few lucky people who have only seen a few good ones or still haven't seen any of them.",It
486,LongTimeMovieLover,Better for Younger,7,16 September 2017,"For a younger audience, unjaded by so many horror and suspense flicks, this movie will probably be creepier. This version of the story is somewhat a victim of itself. So many derivatives have occurred over the years, many from King novels, including this one, that this remake suffers as somewhat less of the same. At my 55 years of age, it just never hit a fear climax. Sure, some great scenes, just not enough impact. For the younger audience, I expect it would be great. Also, perhaps by the edit- down for the screen play, the story seemed to leave a lot of plot holes uncompleted, and seemed to violate its own plane of existence. Appropriate for Netflix, or a young couple on a date.",It

488,jchano123,Painfully boring and cheesy,5,21 December 2017,"Well this was extremely disappointing. It takes so long for anything circumstantial to happen and gets boring really fast. Nothing about this was remotely scary to me, but was rather obnoxiously cheesy and unintentionally funny. There were so many jump scares in this and none of them worked; they just added to the cheese. The acting was either really bad or just OK. No one stood out. If the characters are children, why not get actually good child actors? One of the first things I noticed is that they completely ripped off the high school long shot sequence from Donnie Darko, which just goes to show how unoriginal this was. It didn't even try. The only redeeming aspect of this, if any, was that I found some of the visuals to be pretty nice, but much of it is obvious CGI.
Maybe since the characters will be older in the next one, the acting will be better. I can only hope.",It

Second, he sees a clown in the sewer and doesn't run away? Seriously?!? Give me a break. I just really thought this would be much better, what a disappointment.",It
490,littleging12,It Sequel in Trouble!,4,21 September 2017,"Stephen King's It is regarded by some to be one of the most terrifying books to date. The 2017 remake of the 1990 miniseries doesn't come remotely close to that level. It delivered mainstream goods with disturbing mutilations, solid performances, a plethora of jump scares, and plenty of comedic lines delivered gleefully by profane-centric kids. Once you look past the surface of It you realize it's not scary, it's got no tension, and is really nothing but a clown trying to jump scare you to death!The 1990 miniseries worked better due to its appropriate handling of transitioning between the characters' adolescence into their adulthood. As kids, they won a crucial battle against It, yet they were still deeply scarred by the terror of It. In this movie, they defeat It by overcoming their fear which is how It kills you, through fear. So how the hell is the sequel supposed to be worth anything if Pennywise comes back and the adult versions of the kids aren't afraid of him. He is no threat and It 2 won't do anything new but try and jump scare the audience every five seconds. The filmmakers don't seem to get that good horror is not all about jump scare after jump scare. You don't build tension with jump scares, you release tension with a jump scare. The horror of It proved to be utterly ineffective and too try-hard. The lack of character depth left the film feeling soulless and empty. The humor was more shocking then refreshing. The sequel is in serious trouble and is almost a mission impossible to make it good if the filmmakers are just going to do the same thing. In the filmmakers eyes, the financial success of this film justifies every decision they made and why not imitate themselves for Part 2. Their funeral.",It
491,ToxicJug,Skarsgard is Pennywise!,8,24 December 2020,"As someone who didn't grow up watching the IT TV miniseries I've never been overcome with nostalgia towards Tim Curry as Pennywise. With that being said Bill Skarsgard is and more than likely forever will be the best portrayal of the iconic clown. While Skarsgard makes this movie for me personally, the cast members that make up the Losers Club are just as great. Finn Wolfhard (Richie Tozier), Jaeden Martell (Bill Denbrough), Sophia Lillis (Beverly Marsh), Jack Dylan Grazer (Eddie Kaspbrak), Wyatt Olef (Stanley Uris), Jeremy Ray Taylor (Ben Hanscom), and Chosen Jacobs (Mike Hanlon) all share incredible chemistry throughout this film as the Losers Club. Between the incredible character portrayals, great storytelling, and an incredible final act that left me on the edge of my seat made for one of the greatest horror films of recent memory.

493,cschultz-2,Faithful to the Novel,8,11 September 2017,"While not the best picture based on a novel by perennial bestselling author Stephen King—that distinction would probably be held by 1994's ""The Shawshank Redemption""—""It"" is probably the most comprehensive.At a whopping 1138 pages, Stephen King's novel ""It"" reads like an encyclopedia of not only horror, but also horror movies and rock 'n roll music. Iconic movie monsters from Frankenstein to the Creature from the Black Lagoon make brief guest appearances in the book, and a bibliography of musical selections quoted in the novel takes up two full pages at the end, as sort of required listening.While the new motion picture version is not quite as detailed as the book—to accomplish that, ""It"" would need to have a running time numbering in days instead of hours—the picture does certainly have an epic feel, with the movie's seven or eight major set-pieces based solidly, accurately, and even lovingly upon the events described by King in his novel...although mercifully the metaphysical aspects of the tale are eliminated. Although the filmmakers nominally set the film in the late 1980s instead of the late 1950s era specified in the novel, in essence the movie exists in sort of a generic time-frame which might almost be any era from the 1930s forward, to the present day. The only actual visible milestone in the picture is the advertising of ""Batman"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" at the local Bijou—presumably as a sort of in-joke, since both pictures were also Warner Bros. releases.Briefly, in ""It"" a group of seven children identify in an otherworldly, malignant, psychotic clown the living source of all worldly evil, and seek to destroy itparticularly after the younger sibling of one of the children becomes one of its victims, and the children deduce that the monstrous clown feeds not only on fear, but also on actual human lives, especially those of the young.The scares keep coming in ""It"" at such a pace that the audience has little chance to catch its breath, let alone collect its thoughts. Although the picture does not contain as many sucker punches or low blows as, say, 1973's ""The Exorcist""—another Warner Bros. release, by the way, based on a bestselling novel—""It"" plays not only on the audience's fear but also on certain paranoias and even a handful of phobias. The images depicted in the movie run the gamut from the mildly disturbing to the genuinely shocking to the jaw-droppingly horrific. This might be the rare movie which is rated R for its fright ratio, although the violence and bloodshed are present in abundance—in one scene a geyser of blood erupts from a bathroom drain.Adapted from King's novel by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman, and directed by Andy Muschietti, the movie benefits enormously from the casting of the children. The seven young actors appearing as the group of friends in the movie are a remarkably talented and persuasive group of children, with young Jeremy Ray Taylor and Sophia Lillis contributing particularly vivid characterizations as an overweight outcast and the supposedly ""loose"" girl from the wrong side of the town's tracks, respectively. Also an asset to ""It"" is the casting of young Finn Wolfhard as the most sarcastic and irreverent member of the seven. Already familiar to many viewers from his role on television's ""Stranger Things,"" Wolfhard with his constant flow of cynical wisecracks provides a nice counterpoint—possibly even an emotionally-necessary one—to the movie's seemingly inexhaustible supply of horrific images and scenarios. Actor Bill Murray performed much the same function in 1984's ""Ghostbusters.""Although self-contained as a stand-alone feature, a title superimposed on screen at the very end of the picture designates ""It"" as chapter one of a larger story. Readers of the novel are already aware that the group of children must reunite as grownups to again battle the clown monster—indeed, even in this picture the children recognize that the evil returns to their town in twenty-seven-year cycles. Still apparently undecided is the number of sequels which will be necessary to complete the story, but educated guesswork suggests more than one—""It"" has earned gross receipts exceeding $179 million in the first four days of international release, and at the present time exhibits no trend toward slowing its rate of commerce. Hollywood rarely turns its back on a moneymaker prior to exhausting the supply of financial resources. There's already talk of a continuing television franchise.Needless to say, ""It"" is not for very young children, or even sensitive adults. And for viewers troubled with coulrophobia—the irrational, paralyzing fear of clowns—""It"" additionally presents an enormously satisfying opportunity to whisper to the world, ""I told you so.""",It

495,jacobnunnally,Meh: Neither Here Nor There,5,16 November 2017,"Saw the new ""It"" last night and was completely underwhelmed. Neither here nor there. A superfluous re-make. Unnecessary.Whereas the original It was subtle, the remake was heavy-handed. While the original used suspense, the remake showed gore. If the original was ""smart"", the remake wasn't very clever.A huge beef I have is that Pennywise has far, far too many lines in the remake. In the opening scene, he speaks with Georgie for several minutes. Jesus - enough already! We get it. Clown, teeth, scary. We know already. Why keep talking in that annoying voice? Another complaint: Pennywise overacts. He tries too hard in the human acting and the CGI tries too hard in the contortion/weirdness. It's not ""natural"", and I think the overacting is a natural result of being given way too many lines.I was substantially disappointed with this effort. I felt it was a bit lazy...like the 3 screenwriters just threw their ideas together in an afternoon and that was that. Listen...when you remake a classic film, it has to be all guns blazing. It has to be perfect. This was far from the case. It was a trite affair, entirely superfluous. One final thing: the film relies on clichés - ""don't go into the basement"", scary abandoned house, the bullies/the bullied. We've seen these clichés 10 million times...they write themselves...is there no room for something fresh or original here? Come on. Again, it's lazy. Clichés are easy, originality is hard.",It
496,LiamCullen6,The perfect blend of comedy and horror,9,8 September 2017,"Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening. Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate description!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark, yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works. My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not for the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as if this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror.

499,MichaelNontonMulu,"Excellent, Awesomely Crafted Horror Movie",9,7 September 2017,"Phew this movie was absolutely amazing! It was having quite a lot of scary images and shocking disturbing scenes. What I love most about this movie was the great sound effects. They were really exceptional and I think a lot of us in the audience (especially my wife and including myself) were given the scare due to the sound effects. If you have seen the trailer and you already thought it was amazing, well you ain't seen nothing yet, coz the movie was way better. This was not a movie where all the good things have been shown in the trailer and there were no more surprises. I also loved the way the movie's tone was constantly interesting. Whenever the scene was not creepy or scary, the behavior of the kids were always fun to see. It had an aura of ""coming to age"" in this movie with so many natural things that boys their age would do/face (you will get loads of laughs during the swimming part, or Ben's crush on Beverly and many more). They would definitely grow on you. The characterization of the clown by Bill Skarsgård was spot on and he was indeed quite scary. The kids gave wonderful performances as well. We could actually picture them as kids in real life.Another good part was the setting (like the bikes, the houses, the costumes) that really gave the feel of 1980s. Including the popular boy band then, i.e. New Kids on the Block and the iconic walkman. As a horror movie, I think this one successfully gave us a scare, but apart from those scary moments, I think the best part was the ability of the director (Andrés Muschietti who directed another horror movie Mama in 2013) to direct a bunch of young actors and actress and create a great movie. I think this one was worthy of all the buzz and I can understand why it was loved by those movie critics. Overall, this movie was awesome entirely. I had a most interesting experience watching this movie in the theater with my wife. Not even the loud voices of people next to me could disturb my enjoyment. So please for those of you horror lovers, you should watch this one at the theaters near you asap. It is definitely worth to see either with your loved ones or with your friends, but this one not suitable for kids, even if the majority of the casts are children. I think those who loved the novel IT written by Stephen King would enjoy this one as well. I understand it was a very good adaptation of the novel, much better than The Dark Tower. And better not miss this one out coz the ending of the movie gave the hint of a possible sequel (fingers crossed). Oh ya, there was no post end credit scene that you probably expect from this kind of movie, though there was some interesting thing just before the end in case you want to wait for it.for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",It

It only highlights its technical invoice but that's the least I could offer, I believe, considering your budget.The scene of Giorgi in the good version was terrifying and traumatizing, here you just think, you eat it already or not?It simply fails to create fear or even interest, and if that fails, everything else fails.In addition, the footage is excessive, so long for the end do not tell or clarify anything?

504,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,Best horror of 2017,8,9 September 2017,"As someone who has not seen the original 1990 miniseries nor has read the Stephen King book, I went into the theatre seeing the new version of IT without any basis of what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. It is easily my favourite horror movie of 2017.Set during 1989, a year after after Bill Denbrough's little brother Georgie went missing, he believes that his brother could still be alive since his body was not found. Despite his parents wanting him to just accept Georgie is gone for good, Bill becomes determined to find answers when other kids go missing. There he and six other social outcasts like him join forces to confront the source of the disappearances: The shape-shifting clown called Pennywise otherwise known simply as IT. While what drew me to this movie was the premise of a creepy, evil clown, the kid actors that played the Losers were my favourite part. Each member of the Losers is well defined as these complex characters. They each confront their own fears in unique ways from Bill dealing with his brother's absence, Beverly's maturity into womanhood to Eddie's germophobia. The standouts of these were Sophia Lyllis as Beverly, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie and especially Finn Wolfhard as Richie (who was scene-stealer and a departure from Mike Wheeler in Stranger Things). I did feel that Wyatt Oleff as Stanley and Chosen Jacobs as Mike could of been explored more as characters. It is especially with Mike whom had the most interesting backstory but could of used more screen time.Skarsgard gives such a great and disturbing performance as Pennywise with an otherworldly but yet childish personality. He is more then just a generic monster and slasher but is a truly dark and twisted villain who lives off of the worst aspects of humanity. He is a trickster who will mess with your head to either feed off of your fear or manipulate you to fulfill other dark intentions. But he also is presented as this creature of mysterious origin that will turn violent and feral once it is done playing around and goes in for the kill. He is essentially a predatory animal that is driven by the survival need to feed but enjoys the thrill of the hunt.Director Muschietti and the creator of the source material, Stephen King, show how dark and horrifying the world is from looking at it through the kids's perspective. The adults are never presented as being relatable because either they choose to be ignorant to move on with their normal lives or are monsters themselves who exists perfectly in the same world as Pennywise. Without the reliance of a kind adult figure for protection and guidance, you feel the tension and isolated fear when each of the Losers is on their own. When the characters are together, however, the story shows how unity can truly overpower fear when they have safety in numbers. A lot of the fun and comedy comes from the moments when the Losers hang out and get to be kids without having to worry about the outside world. With the horror aspect, Muschietti knows how to make this movie feel scary without trying too hard with jump scares and gore. He finds unique ways of making Pennywise's presence feel scary even without him being on screen from the hints of bright red that pop into the screen to the creepy to the unexpected forms that the clown takes that have a psychological impact on the characters. And when Pennywise does pop up it is in probably some of the most creative and freaky ways.If there is anything that IT has left me worried about is that the bar for Chapter 2 has been set so high. Who will Muschietti cast as the adult versions of the Losers and can he still retain that fun, dark tone in a modern setting? But this doesn't stop me from getting excited to see the story of these characters come to its conclusion in the next few years.",It

I felt sympathy for all of them, and the bullies were terrifying. Not just the stereotypical bullies shown in most films and Georgie was just adorable.Most of the cinematography is pretty and scary, cramming spooky details into the background.

The movie is not that scary though highly satisfying, with a great message about being brave, having no fear, and standing up for yourself.

Most importantly the child actors were perfect, each with their own personality and unique sense of humor. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat and craving for more!""When you're a kid, you think that you'll always be... protected, and cared for. Then, one day, you realize that's not true.

507,ReelLifeReviews,King done right,9,14 September 2017,"I was having a difficult time tempering my hype level for this one. I was so looking forward to Ghost in the Shell and Valerian earlier this year, but I couldn't have been more disappointed with what I was given with those. With my luck so far, I thought I was in for strike three. It turns out I had nothing to be afraid of. Except for Pennywise, of course.From the opening scene, the director makes it clear that the boundaries have been pushed all the way back, setting the tone that anything can happen from here on out. It goes beyond your typical jump scares. It's uncomfortable, creepy, and twisted.Between those elements, however, is a surprising amount of humor. In the other versions, the character of Richie Tozier was annoying to the point of him almost ruining the scenes he was in. In this version he's played by Finn Wolfhard (probably the best name in Hollywood) and he's actually my favorite character. I don't think I've genuinely laughed out loud that many times in the theater this year. While other horror movies will have a tension-cutting quip or two, this movie has successfully comedic writing throughout.While Richie was my favorite, all the kids are truly incredible. It's difficult enough to get an impressive performance out of one child actor, let alone seven, but director Andy Muschietti seemingly does the impossible. Not long into the film I strangely stopped seeing them as kids and just saw them as the people they were portraying.There's no denying that there are the nostalgia factors of the book and the campy miniseries, but so much of what makes this movie great is what it does to set itself apart from all that. I never found myself thinking ""Hey, that wasn't in the book!"", but rather ""Oh crap, I don't know what's about to happen here."" I didn't expect to be kept on my toes with so much original content, and I certainly didn't expect that I'd be OK with that.I was hoping for a lot out of this movie and it absolutely delivered. IT somehow manages to be the scariest and funniest movie I've seen this year. A contradiction I couldn't be more pleased about. 8.5/10",It
508,DJKwa,A worthy adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel,7,14 September 2017,"If the recent spate of clown sightings are any indication, scary clowns are back in vogue. It's unsurprising then, and probably largely to blame, that a new adaptation of Stephen King's iconic 1986 horror novel, IT, has arrived. Ever since King introduced the world to his maniacally devious creation, Pennywise the Dancing Clown, party clowns have had it tough maintaining an innocuous image and the new film does little to help their cause.Stepping into the oversized shoes, Bill Skarsgård casts an intimidating figure as Pennywise. With his towering height and creepy grin, and aided by a thick coat of makeup and prosthetics, his Pennywise is effectively creepy and unsettling. Unfortunately the film's over reliance on jump scares and telegraphed gotcha moments means that he, and the film itself, never really rises above that level to become truly terrifying. Despite this, the horror serves a greater purpose than just to scare you and it's the allegorical nature of the story that makes IT a stronger coming of age fable than horror film.King, who is no stranger to great coming of age stories having written the novella behind the 1986 film Stand By Me, adeptly captured youthful woe and the tight bond of adolescent friendship under the guise of a horror in his novel. It's a focus that director Andy Muschietti rightfully doesn't stray from in his adaptation. Featuring a strong young cast, the film takes its time to explore the characters as they deal with their repressed emotions, burgeoning libidinal drives and tempestuous relationships with their parents or parental figures. It's these coming of age elements that elevate IT from just a decent horror film to a great film period. And as the end titles reveal, this is only Part 1, with an imminent return to these characters and their world an exciting prospect.",It
509,vesil_vesalier,"The rules have been broken, on the first remake I actually think is better than the original",9,31 March 2018,"You never can count your chickens before they hatch. But sometimes, probably relating to the optimist that hides inside all of us, sometimes we catch ourselves doing it anyway.Maybe because we buy into that crap about positive thinking. Maybe because we just finished watching THE SECRET (no, I haven't watched it all the way through yet). Or maybe it's just laziness.I went into IT expecting to be disappointed. I left IT thinking about it so much that I wanted to go back and watch it again, although I never did get the chance.Stephen King's IT, as I have been told, is a novel that spreads across 1,000 pages. I've never had the pleasure of reading it, and I made a rule years ago that I wouldn't read a novel if I'd seen the movie, and vice versa, because one form of artistic expression inevitably detracts from the other. I suppose, on some level, that may be a bad rule, in some way, but so far, I've kept to it.So I've never read Stephen's novel. I've heard about it, watched many videos explaining in somewhat interesting (though ultimately frustrating) detail about how Andy Muchietti (who directed MAMA, another movie I've yet to see) failed to capture all the elements of the book into his movie.It's an argument I've heard so many times, that it led to, and supports, my policy of not reading novels once I've seen the movie, and vice versa. A two to one thousand page book didn't manage to convert to screen exactly as you thought it would? WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED?But I'm getting sidetracked.I saw the mini-series, when I was a kid. The first half, the part with the kids, was terrifying. Tim Curry played the nightmarish It in a memorable, unforgettable way, and I think this is due to the abilities of Tommy Lee Wallace, the first part's director, to really bring out the chill in what would otherwise be the absurd. He created an atmosphere of disturbia that managed to keep me entranced, but at the same time weary, of a monster that seemed unstoppable, covered by his amazing ability to transform into the Loser's Club's worst fears. I really enjoyed it.But it's nothing compared to this. Andy Muschietti went all out in creating a monster, a monster that shook me up the entire time I watched the film. There's no way on Earth I could claim the movie didn't have problems--it did, specifically for me in relating to the third, overly drawn-out act, but I don't care. I forgive him for this movie's misses, when it had sooo many hits.First off, the chills were fantastic. Not only did Mr. Muschietti capture the menace of It, but he also managed to capture the menace of Derry, this strange New England town that seemed to be the backdrop for Its evil. The concept that the town was part of the problem was hinted to in the original, delivered to us through exposition, but as for the FEEL of terror all around these poor kids, it wasn't there before.It's there now.Derry itself is a terrifying, horrifying hellhole in Mushietti's version. I've been told that It, according to the novel, is less a clown and more a collection of lights that changes into whatever evil it needs to, as it feeds on the terror of Derry. Without knowing that, and without reading the novel, I was able to gather that, thanks to Muschietti's masterful direction.The second part of the original mini-series is why and where it all falls apart. I'm afraid to see Part 2 of this film, because I know what happened the first time. Tim Curry's clown, in the second half, seemed less menacing and more desperate. Instead of being a clown who was the master of fear, it seemed he didn't know what to do with grown-up versions of his victims, and as a result, instead of being intimidated by him, we were crossed between amusement and sadness. After all, it IS sad to see your villain lose his teeth, and wither away into nothing.Before I wrap this up, I have to mention the kids. While not perfect, their performances were solid, with Sophia Lillis as Beverly stealing every scene she was in. Don't get me wrong, there are no losers in the Loser's Club, from an acting standpoint. I think the kids, overall as a unit, are one of the strongest parts of this film. But Sophia takes the cake. She's haunting. She's clever. She's funny.She's vulnerable.For the first time, since this classifies as a remake, I have to say that it actually is better than the original. I never thought I'd hear myself saying it, but it's true.I will watch this movie again. And I will add it to my collection.",It

IntroLast weeks horror review was It comes at night. I rated this 2017 American horror film 8/10. Today we review ""IT"", a pretty shocking 2017 horror movie.StorylineThe storyline is actually very stimulating. There are plenty of mysterious twists and turns until everything is neatly sewn up at the end. On the whole, IT is difficult to fault (pun intended).The ending could have flown a little quicker, and settings could have been mixed up more for greater variety. Scenes were consistently entertaining though, courtesy of both a well-formulated storyline, great acting, and good visual effects. This made the film a good watch for those eager for mystery and thought while viewing.Storyline was split between characters lives and evil events unfolding, which prevented a theme of just one thread. This meant dull moments were dormant throughout. Unlike evil. Mwah ha ha.GenreHorror is the billed genre, and is certainly the correct classification for this movie. ""IT"" wouldn't fit anything else (pun intended), and that is part of it's elegance.CharactersThe film is both poetic and artistic, with costume, colours, and blood patterns, all appearing maximally macabre. Character count is high and group's of individuals all retain individuality throughout. This is despite unity of beliefs, at times, which shows effective script writing and casting.
Relationships are used well, with both testing and loving themes at times. Both strategically employed. Evil is depicted in a variety of ways, preventing boredom during tension building.MusicSound effects and music are used fittingly throughout. Eerie and happy music blends into the captivating watch, that is this entire film. More could have been done near the ending to retain interest though. Light effects complemented the music well.SummaryIneffably macabre, ending a little mediocre.Follow us: Reasea dot org",It
514,blownwideopen,"Nowhere near as good as the 1990 TV movie & it wasn't great, just ok!",3,19 January 2018,"Bad script, poor character development, terrible editing, completely miscast & totally not scary. My rating of 3 is probably too generous. But, if I post a lower rating then IMDb will just counteract it with a fake 10 star rating. It's so sad that Hollywood can no longer make a decent movie & even more disturbing that they've obviously bought out or paid off every critic and movie review site!",It
515,i_ianchev,IT is simply the truth,8,10 September 2017,"The new ""IT"" screening gets pretty much everything right...From the shocking rip off of child's arm to the true realization of what it means to grow up, the 2017 movie is true to the King's novel and closer to the viewers' hearts. I'm not a big fan of horror movies and of King's books, but went to see this film knowing that it will most probably scare me. And it did spectacularly. First I will mention the only two problems which I have with this movie and why I rate it 8/10.  - too many jump scares. Too often frightening scenes follow one after another and this takes out a bit of the positive impression which those moments should create; - horror movies are rarely perfect examples of cinematography. Of course there are some non-believable moments in the movie where some characters take some ""stupid"" decisions which are not logical. Also the bullying in the film goes way ahead of itself. But sometimes in reality children tormenting other children indeed is brutal. Now to the more interesting themes of the movie and its execution. First I'd like to mention that this film is shot beautifully creepy. I can't think of any technical error or edgy 3D episode in it. Also, the music score is subtle and supporting, at times it takes the lead, but without leading the viewer too much above the actual feeling being presented on the screen. The cast is great - from Bill Skarsgard to Sophia Lillis - all actors are great. The supporting characters, representing the children's respective parents are also true embodiments of the certain problematic topics which usually ruin the psychology of a child. The screenplay by Chase Palmer and Cary Fukunaga (True Detective anyone?) is respectfully following the book with only some scenes from the book missing (sewer scene between the teens!). So overall everything which compiles a good film is obviously here. And most importantly - the film directly transmits to the viewers the deep message of fear overpowering, proper upbringing importance and teenage character development.  We see the exact moments when most of the main characters challenge their deep fears and fight them off. And step by step, as in real life, Bill, Ben, Beverly and the others become their own role models. Such growth is very harsh to the character of a minor, but it impacts influences his/her life more deeply and complete. Because once a person repeats the act and defiance against a deepest fear, the result is no longer what is desired, but also transforms into ambition, integrity and pure devotion. All virtues of a truly realized man or a woman. And perhaps this is why Stephen King's books are so popular - you can't fake life, you can only represent it the best way you can. After all - human's imagination is only a result of the perception of reality.",It
516,adam-may-bower,Amazing,8,2 June 2018,"'It' is a surprisingly heartfelt coming-of-age film led by a brilliant cast, and is no doubt creepy, and at some points, terrifying. Being one of the most anticipated horror films of 2017, I was eager to see this as soon as possible. I had high expectations, particularly for Bill Skarsgård's portrayal of Pennywise the Dancing Clown, as he had big shoes to fill, and he did not disappoint! He played the role so well, and was the perfect combination of creepy and hilarious (like most clowns are)! However, the potential for this film to be truly horrifying was lost in the overload of CGI and visual effects. Many of the scares were drenched in over-the-top visual effects that took away the feeling of reality. Even Skarsgård's performance got lost in the midst of CGI at some points which I found rather disappointing as it wasted the potential! Horror movies are far more effective with fewer effects! Thankfully, this did not stop the film from being fantastic in all other aspects. The casting was amazing, particularly with all the child actors who played their roles so well and were quite entertaining at some points! I laughed in this movie more than I screamed. The definite highlights in the acting were Finn Wolfhard and Sophia Lillis. There's a great chemistry between all of the main actors which effectively highlights the theme of friendship, which is one of the films biggest themes. Andy Muschietti adapted Stephen King's novel very strongly, and his direction is very well done. When combined with the fantastic cinematography by Chung-hoon Chung and chilling soundtrack by Benjamin Wallfisch, you get all the right emotions of suspense and terror, resulting in a great horror film, that surprisingly has a lot of complexity and heart.",It
517,suicidea,A disappointment,6,10 October 2020,"I loathe remakes, but this was one of the handful of remakes that I was actually hoping would be made someday. The source novel is as scary as it gets, but the original film, while it was a commendable effort, failed to deliver on most aspects.This adaptation delivers as far as the visual effects and technology goes, but fails otherwise. (Actually this sentence applies to 99 percent of the stuff made in the last 15 years). They were apparently so intent on how to show this scary face, of how to light that pit scene, that they forgot to care about the overall result.Don't get me wrong, the movie looks terrific, beyond terrific in fact, that's undeniable. The visuals are stunning even for today's audience, who are very hard to stun. The It looks much better than Tim Curry's version (although not as scary as him) and the acting is better than you'd expect. But after a nice start, the movie quickly becomes a ""when's the next jump scare coming"" fest. It's almost not like a movie, but simply a series of well-made scenes, brought together.It's not a bad movie, but it's average and for a King adaptation, that means disappointment, considering what it could have been. It could have been a classic that has a place among everyone's top horror lists. Instead, it's an average horror movie with effects that are among everyone's top horror lists.",It

519,ronnievanrijswijk,Way to overhyped,7,30 August 2019,"I wasn't that enthousiastic when i heard about the IT reboot in the first place, untill they started to hype it up with the teasers. No matter how much i dislike remakes and unnecesarry reboots (or reimaginings) i just wanted to have a look at it myself, first of all i grew up with the original IT starring the great Tim Curry as Pennywise. That movie chilled me to the bone and still horrifies me after all these years, so my first reaction to Bill Skarsgard's version of good old Pennywise was... Is this suposed to be frightening, they did a good job making the whole outfit look like it's vintage. But what's with the large forhead, he almost looks child like, i must say that Skarsgard did a good job on his performance, he has a few good moments. But to say that he outclassed Curry's performance, no way. Second of all they could've done it without the CGI, they should've used more practical effects. The IT reboot fails when it comes to character development, the kids are alright but they are no match for the original child actors who actualy expressed fear and dread while witnessing the horrors Penny had in store for them. There's also a great lack of the authentic tension i felt watching the Original, i could go on and on about it but you just have to figure it out yourself.",It
520,Parks,Stephen King finally captured on screen,8,28 September 2017,"IT is not my favourite adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Obviously, that would be ""Shawshank"". But there's something about IT that feels more authentically Stephen King than any of the other adaptations I've seen (and I've seen a LOT - I've even seen ""Firestarter"" and King's performance as Jordy Verrill).This is not to say that it is wholly faithful to the novel. It is not, and with good reason. There are some parts of IT-novel that would never work on screen. Let's just say that the turtle only gets a cameo role as a piece of Lego in this film and quite right too.But where the film seems to capture the strengths of King is in warping reality, just a little. Venturing into the basement and seeing something that might be eyes, glowing in the dark. Passing by a creepy picture every day and trying to NOT look at it... just in case...These are the experiences we've all had - but in King's world the thing you know that CAN'T happen sometimes does. And sometimes those eyes in the dark look right back at you.Director Muschietti captures this spot-on. Also King's ability to take more prosaic horrors like school bullies or overly-affectionate fathers and add them to the palette. I could hear the audience around me tense up whenever Mr. Marsh was on screen.The reason it works so well is that the film takes the time to develop (most) of the child characters well. Unfortunately, a film's running time is a tyrannical thing so Stanley and Mike lose out. In Stanley's case, I think this might be a problem for chapter 2. In Mike's case, I didn't mind so much - the acting in this film is uniformly good except in the case of the actor who plays that part. I'm sorry, but he was wooden in comparison to the rest of the Losers.So this is not by any means a perfect film, but I can see why it has been so spectacularly successful. It's a terrific ghost-train ride. If you go in with the right frame of mind it will make laugh, jump and be enthralled.IT is definitely NOT the scariest film ever made though. Go in with that expectation and you will be disappointed. This is a film that wants to entertain as much as scare - it's often as funny as it is spooky.But IT does have one ace up its sleeve - the nightmarish creation that is Pennywise. We all have a built-in suspicion of the creature who smiles too wide, whose friendly grin so easily becomes a snarl, a rictus of bared teeth. King didn't create our shared fear of clowns, he just built on it. His Pennywise is a creature that will be hard to forget, and I even though I didn't feel that scared during the film, I felt my mind going back to him for a few days after I saw it. Bill Skarsgard gives an amazing performance as a being not quite in its own skin, and the subtle special effects merely emphasise his strangeness.I'm looking forward to IT Chapter 2 much more than I ever expected. This is a far better film than I thought it would be. But I'm also hoping that Chapter 2 will really take the gloves off and try to terrify in a way that Chapter 1 shied away from. Chapter 1 did feel a little like an R rated kid's film, or ""Stranger Things"" with a more meaningful monster. I hope that in Chapter 2, the fears are fully-grown. But this will do nicely for now.",It

522,mitrapourmand,My God.,3,4 February 2018,"Tried reading the novel once but i couldn't get past the lazy writing and weird plot of it , so i tried the movie , not only it is very cruel towards kids , Its story does not make any sense at all , here is the list of why this movie sucks and should have flopped at the box office :
1 ) It is a creature who leaves off people fear of flesh , or part fear part fear part flesh , its like the story could not make up his mind , does it want to be slasher ? or a psychological experiment ?
2 ) It has been living on earth for more than 15 million years ago , i am not sure but i don't think man kind goes that far , what did It eat before humans began their existence ? did it walk around terrorizing bear cubs and elk ?
3 ) apparently there are plenty of evidence of Its movements and antics through the history of Derry , yet no one thought about kicking Its butt ?
4 ) If It has been killing human kids from the day Derry came to be how come the first settlers , didn't just pack up and leave ? 
5) It leaves in the sewers , where did it leave when there was no sewers , the well house ? then why did the towns people just shut the well and seal it , its not like the creature was that strong . and later on kids can cause it serious damage.
I think the reason for Its success is its very mediocre and people can relate to it.

Written by legendary horror novelist Stephen King, Pennywise was an instant cultural icon that continues to scare readers to this day. The second adoption of the novel, It is a slow burn coming-of-age horror film that succeeds in presenting scare and drama, but lacks a distinctive flair.Led by a terrific ensemble cast, It successfully establishes the characters and their fears in a realistic and emotional manner that adults and children alike can relate. As the protagonists go through their individual stories, It shows thereby manifesting their respective fears. Events unfold that unite the protagonists and allows them to overcome their fears as a group. Acting both as a coming-of-age and horror film, the themes unite to present a single message of overcoming fears through facing adversity head on. The execution and pacing however is off. A director's cut can surely remedy the film's mistakes by adding more scenes to elaborate and coherently present the formation of the group.Bill Skarsgard as It is terrifying, evoking a child-like performance that is nonetheless scary. Vastly different from Tim Curry's more adult-like interpretation, Skarsgard succeeds better because his has an element of approachability.

""IT"" Earns It Scares And Provides Great Characters And Story",9,7 September 2017,"""IT"" is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel and focuses on a group of outsiders who are bullied and after discovering a killer clown that is really a monster, they decide to take him down. I was looking forward to ""IT"" despite not having read the book or seen the original miniseries with Tim Curry as Pennywise. The trailers made the movie look intriguing and I thought that this could be the next big break the horror genre needs. I was very pleased.Easily the biggest praise of this movie goes to the writing. This movie has well developed characters and cohesive storytelling. The thing I enjoyed about these characters is that they not only deal with middle school problems and bullying, but they also deal with real life problems that everyone in this world has or will face. These characters, in their early teens, also cuss a lot. It made the characters that much more relatable and realistic and provided a breath of fresh air into the horror genre, and the writers actually understood the age demographic and portrayed it beautifully. The story is also really straightforward. There are no crazy, so-called ""clever"" plot twists that a lot of horror movies nowadays try to include. It was cohesive and easy to follow.Not only were the kids well written, but the actors that played them were magnificent. There was not a dull performance form any one of them. Everyone is skeptical when it comes to kid actors, but each actor portrayed his character the way a kid should portray his character. Character wise, there was perhaps a little annoyance with the germaphobe kid but that could be passed off because the characters were so intriguing and relatable. The movies earns it scares too. There aren't any cheap scares either. A couple of ""jumps"" in the second half, but good jumps. The second half of the movie is full of all the scars, whereas the first half, while still having some screw, focuses more on setting up the characters and the story for the audience while also providing the necessary haunting imagery to imprint in our heads. The way the films opens up, you no there's no holding back with this movie after watching the opening scene. Bill Skarsgard did a really great job as Pennywise. He was scary, he was menacing, and damn he made me afraid of clowns again. The movie did its job and that is make adults afraid of clowns again. The movie really boils down to being a horror movie mixed with a coming-of-age drama and I appreciated that. I really like when movies have the balls to go all out like that in a horror movie. Horror movies don't have the guts to pull something like that off (runtime is another thing this movie pulls off really well: 2 hrs. 15 mins as opposed to the average 1 hr and 30 mins. for horror films), and to see something so refreshing and relatable is a breath of fresh air.

When the awful TV movies began, clearly designed as pulpy B quality from the beginning, I groaned, imagining what might have been...It was with great skepticism that I went in to this new version.It's hard to capture the nature of Pennywise, without it coming off as campy. Much as numerous actors, including the great Jack Nicolson, tried and failed to capture the nuances of the Joker character, and it wasn't until Heath Ledger forever immortalized him shortly before dying, that the character was realized in full.So too, has Pennywise finally been captured in 'his' full, inhuman, beyond-evil ancient demi-god predator from the abyss nature, in this film, awkwardly attempting to mimic human things, fears, and attractions to draw in it's prey.Bill Skarsgard, in perhaps the role of his career, expertly captures Pennywise to a T, apparently terrifying the young actors on the set to some degree as well.The movie finally captures the dread feelings I felt as I read this book. It felt like living inside the book again.Excellent performances are also turned in by the young gang of 'losers'. Sophia Lillis turns in a fantastic performance as the young Scarlett Johannson look-alike Beverly, a tortured young girl harassed and sexually objectified by every male in town.Finn Wolfhard attempts to steal the entire movie with is one-liners, and often succeeds, capturing the right blend of young humour with awkward mid-teen angst.The movie is perfectly propped for the 80's, look for the movies of that generation prominently displayed on the movie theatre each time it is used, more than once.One word of advice - I saw many very young children being taken into this movie by deadbeat parents who won't spring for a sitter. This movie IS NOT for children. IT will give your children nightmares. It is a genuinely terrifying movie.",It
532,nicktatta,It's well doneeee but...,7,28 July 2018,I sort of like the non clown parts better...like it could have been amazing as a coming of age movie without the horror...that said I liked it. It's artsy and pretty and kind of good and then not....I liked it...just didn't love it,It
533,jpasols,I lOVE IT! NOT A REMAKE!,10,10 May 2019,"First of all let me make you all be aware...VERY aware since none of you seem to be...IT (2017) is NOT, I repeat NOT! a reboot! It is simply another film adaptation of the Stephen King book, this movie is not trying to be anything like the 1990 miniseries (which I must say aged very poorly and is hardly watchable for me anymore). However IT (2017) was a thrilling, entertaining, funny, and bloody ride! This film made you feel a variety of different emotions throughout the two hours! Happy, Sad, Silly, Scared, Disturbed, etc...And it all fits nicely together, not enough humor to make it a straight comedy, it's still a frightening film! Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was by far the BEST casting I've ever seen!!! I can't think of anyone else who could have pulled off Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise!!! Even Tim Curry's Pennywise ain't got nothing on 2017 Pennywise!!!! Bill Skarsgard brought the character of Pennywise a HUGE fear factor rather than the 1990 movie did, In this film Pennywise is more intimidating and terrifying, yet still friendly looking and playful and I even got a hint of sweetness of Pennywise during the Georgie scene in the beginning! Pennywise made a terrifying attempt to connect with the boy and laugh with him and actually talk to him and kinda get to know him a bit...yet at the same time that's very disturbing because you KNOW what's about to come! It builds up the suspense and anticipation and before you know it, Pennywise's sharp fangs emerge from his mouth and he's biting Georige's arm off! This scene was terrifying especially since they showed Georgie crawling across the street with one arm and the other gushing blood! Very disturbing, sickening, frightening, and unsettling. That opening scene is one hell of a way to begin a horror film/novel and really PULLS the audience in right then and there. Bill Skarsgard A++++++++ for your acting of Pennywise!!! It was the absolute best!!!!
Now moving onto the kids in this film! O absolutely ADORE the new cast of the losers club! Way more than I did in the 1990 movie! They were all so annoying in the 90s version! Except for young Beverley Marsh of course. But I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE New Beverly Marsh played by the wonderfully talented and beautiful Sophia Lillis!! She did an amazing job as Beverly Marsh and her acting was through the roof!!! By far my FAVORITE of the 2017 Losers club! Then there's Bill Denbrough, played in this film by Jaeden Lieberher, who I thought was another amazing young actor who really NAILED the character of young Bill. The stuttering was perfect! Not too much, not too little either. Just right and he nailed it! When Bill had his mental breakdown scenes about Georgie you could actually FEEL his pain! His acting was so real I felt his pain of losing his little brother, feeling guilty about his death, and his parents becoming distant and strange after the tradgety. You can feel Bill's world turning completely upside down and on top of everything that happens in Bill's home life, he has to deal with a bully at school named Henry Bowers, as well as an evil shapeshifting demon clown picking off all the local children of Derry!!! Damn...rough life!. Last main character I want to mention in the losers Club is Ritchie Tozier played in this film by Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things)...Finn did an amazing job of Ritchie Tozier, he was definitely the funniest character of the lot and he's the legit reason why this movie was funnier than it should have been! But honestly in my opinion any scene that featured Pennywise was legit Terrifying!!!! Ritchie was funny yeah but when Pennywise was in frame it was nothing but FEAR!!.
Moving onto the CGI effects, a lot of the effects were good for the most part! There were some scenes throughout this film that relied just a tad too much on CGI and it killed certain scenes a little bit! Other than that I'd say 97% of the CGI effects for this film are pretty solid.
One last thing I wanted to touch on with this film is the soundtrack score!. The score was amazing! (Forgive me i cant remember the name of the man who composed this soundtrack) but he did an amazing job! The soundtrack really set the atmosphere of the film and setting! The score was many things, it was happy, heart warming, and terrifying and dark! The scene where the leper is chasing Eddie into the yard of the creepy house and the soundtrack that plays right there with the hardcore horror beats was amazing!!! Especially watching it in theaters!
Overall, IT (2017) truly is an amazing modern day horror film! Pennywise is back for the new generation and he's absolutely terrifying!!!! I highly recommend this movie to horror fans or movie goers in general! A great film you dont wanna skip out on rather you're skeptical about this movie or not (judging from the trailer). If you havent seen this movie yet even after a year of its release but have been debating on watching it...just do yourself a favor and watch it! Dont let the negative reviews scare you off! Over half of the negative reviews on here for this film are pathetic and give no REAL reason why this is a bad movie. This film really shouldn't receive anything below a 6.5. Also for people who keep saying this movie is nothing like the book...you too are also wrong! I wonder if half of the people saying that has even read the book themselves! This film is VERY accurate to the novel WAY more than the 1990 movie which took this story in it's own direction. The 2017 version of IT is seriously very accurate to the novel and Stephen King himself even said this film was truly amazing!. So argue with the author of the novel himself the next time you wanna say this movie isnt book accurate! This movie is accurate!!! And it's very good and scary! Definitely check it out!!!!! If you've actually read the book and paid attention to it then you SHOULD like this new adaptation!!!! You'll float too!!!My rating for IT (2017): Solid 10 out of 10 (no exaggeration!)",It

535,aburgan,A scary movie that isn't scary!,2,18 October 2018,"What a disappointment! Not scary or frightening in the least. As a matter of fact, I was tempted to laugh during the so-called scary clown scenes. Seemed almost like a parody of a horror movie. What a waste!",It
536,JoshuaMLosapio,Ridiculous,5,14 September 2019,"""It"" is the worst kind of horror movie: it isn't scary, and makes entertainment out of violence towards children. The movie's ""horror"" scenes are so silly they make you laugh, not scream, and the entire premise is ridiculous. This is best shown in the movie's now infamous opening scene. The entire plot of this movie depends on a boy not being able to see an obstacle right in front of him, hitting his head on it, then being tricked into sticking his hand into a dark, dirty sewer by a creepy clown that no intelligent child would trust. Any kid would immediately run away or call their parents if they were in that situation - I suppose the filmmakers aren't aware of the ""fight or flight"" response.My biggest problem with ""It"" is the title character: he's genuinely intimidating in a few scenes, but very quickly you realize he's mostly an annoyance who isn't that much of a threat. For the next two hours It - who is actually an ancient alien from outer space - will spend his entire time not eating children, but scaring them and then letting them live. Why? The in-story excuse is that to It, people taste better scared. But is it really necessary to play this silly peek-a-boo game with a bunch of kids? When It appears on screen he's more irritating than anything else because you know he won't really kill the main characters, making his increasingly bizarre appearances a waste of the viewer's time. This really undermines It as a villain and ultimately makes for a rather boring horror movie.I'm normally not one to recoil against violence in movies, but seeing a movie studio show a small boy's arm being bitten off and turning it into entertainment is a bridge too far. In fact this whole movie has a truly distasteful fascinating with torturing children both physically and psychologically. I'm not making the same criticism that Siskel & Ebert directed against ""Aliens."" When reviewing that film, both critics faulted James Cameron for showing a child in mortal danger. They were wrong about ""Aliens,"" which is a great movie in part because of how it incorporates the character of Newt into an adult action movie. I don't criticize ""It"" for showing violence against young people - but I am of the opinion that film studios have much better things to do than making money off the maiming and killing of small children.I could give ""It"" a 3 or a 4, but I'll give it a 5 for the following reasons: the music, special effects, and performances are all very good and the ending is satisfying. While ""It"" is impressive on a technical level, and it has a handful of fine scenes, it's still not a good movie. 5/10.",It
537,mohamedshakir-03491,"""IT"" was a good movie!",8,10 September 2019,A good storyline & screenplay will ride you to the edge of the seat but not scary at all. I think a different jonour of ghost movie. Not disappointed one time watchable.,It
538,SoutheastUK,"I didn't think they could make a psychopathic clown any scarier, but they went there.",10,19 April 2021,"The book was groundbreaking. The original IT movie was about as good an interpretation of the book as could be achieved at the time, despite the minor complaints of its critics.I didn't think a remake would come close to capturing the feel of the first movie, let alone the magic of the book and that the creative team behind this movie would fall into the trap of relying on shock tactics, gore and loud, shallow and mostly ineffective (but supremely irritating) sound effects...I couldn't imagine anyone fitting the role of pennywise, let alone bringing something new to the table.I certainly didn't believe that it would be possible to make pennywise any scarier than he already was...So, how do you make a psychopathic clown monster, scarier than it already is? You give the clown ginger hair and get Bill Skarsgard to play the role.In a lot of ways, this movie feels much closer to the book than the first attempt did and feels more sophisticated, without the slasher type excess that these types of movies rely on and which I find very off-putting.Death and tragedy are treated maturely and realistically. Fear, friendship, love and trust all given a spit and polish that makes this movie far better than the sum of its parts.The tension builds in an organic way, but once it begins, it is handled masterfully.Coupled with flawless acting across the board, these things add up to a movie that even someone like me - very much an anti violent movie customer - can enjoy.In the eighties, it was very much a violence for violences sake type of deal. I'm glad that some work from that era has grown up and blossomed.",It

540,PubHound,"A fun, enjoyable ride",7,15 November 2017,"Being more of a growing up tale than an horror , the movie focuses on the young characters ( for as much as possible given the runtime ) : Dialogues are on point and hilarious, they sound pleasantly childish, like it should be and the relationship between each other are most of the time well defined. Penniwise doesn't appear much, but that's not necessarily a defect : Although different from Curry's interpretation, this one is still a solid embodiment of the creature designed by King. Technically speaking, I never thought I would enjoy the score of an horror movie so much, it was really on point and extremely well done, as for the rest, directing and photography were pretty good and functional to the movie. Only complaint regards the tone of the film, which sometimes gets too much over the top with a few scenes",It

543,tyingling7766,A more faithful adaptation of the book,8,17 September 2017,"I don't care what anyone says, The Dark Tower was a good movie. Now, if I say The Dark Tower is a good movie, imagine what I think of It. It was awesome. I loved It. Yes, whenever I write the It, It will be capitalized. Even though I did love It, and I problem should have given It a higher rating, but there was a couple of major problems I did have with the movie. I'm not in any way shape or form comparing the movie to the book, I do hate when people do that, but the problems are there and they're major. In the book, all of the members of the Loser's Club had their time to shine. Stephen King made It so there was definitely not a single Loser that stood out more than the others, even though Bill was the defacto leader. Still, there was no centralized main character out of the group. The movie made It so It concentrated solely on Bill and his vendetta with It. Then we have the problem with Bev Marsh. Some of this stems from the movie, and a very small part comes from the casting choose of who everyone wants to play the elder Bev. The small part has nothing to do with this movie unless the cast the wrong person for Chapter 2. But, Bev was not a love interest, nor a sex symbol to the boys. She also wasn't a damsel in distress. She was a strong young lady when she was in school, and a hidden warrior when she was an adult. There was no reason to downplay her abilities. I mentioned It above, but there was one thing that seriously hurt the movie for me. I said that they mostly concentrated on Bill, well that concentration almost took Mike Hanlon right out of the movie. Almost ruined the whole thing for that character. Enough of the things that I didn't like about It. On to the good. Even though they changed the end of the battle (and I won't tell you what they did in the movie, go watch It) I did like how they ended It. They completely set up for a sequel. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was long shot from the jump, but it paid off. He didn't play off what Tim Curry did, and he didn't do better. He did his own thing. And that's what made it memorable. As for what the director did with the way of bringing him to screen, it was more close to the book than anything. He was much more menacing this time round. Can't really say much about the story. Of course they had to leave a few things out. Some were for different reasons than pacing, but they were left out all the same. The things, and the Easter eggs, that did make the movie were the right choices. Got right down to the meat and potatoes of It. I told myself I didn't want to do this, but It's all I've been thinking about seen I watched the movie. And here is my casting choices for the main characters of It: Chapter 2. Bill – Christian Bale Bev – Maggie Gyllenhaal Ben – I would say Jake Gyllenhaal normally, but Maggie is the perfect choice for Bev so I have to move to my second choice in Chris Pratt Eddie – Jesse Pinkman himself Aaron Paul Richie – James Franco Stan – Seth Rogan Mike – Chadwick BosemanMost people aren't looking at Henry Bowers in all this, but I have made a choice myself. A little out of left field, but I think he could easily pull it off.Henry Bowers – Jackie Earl HaleyRating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks.",It
544,guillermobosque,"It was a pleasant surprise, probably one of the most memorable horror films I've seen in the past 5 years.",9,3 October 2017,"Summary: It was a pleasant surprise, probably one of the most memorable horror films I've seen in the past 5 years. 86/100 (B+)First of all, it's great to be back with you guys after almost 3 years of zero reviews. So moving on, I was not expecting this movie to be good at all, the trailers did not convince me and it did not look scary at all to me. But holly hell! I did not do any research about this movie so when it started to get many attention and praise from critics I was interested. So I found out later that the guy who directed Mama made this. I liked that film in general, so I was even more excited. Anyway let's get to the film. This review will contain minor spoilers if you haven't see the film. I will not reveal anything too important.I was really surprised with the opening scene, the movie introduces us to Georgie and his brother and then we move on to that scene. Pennywise looks scary as hell and his dialogue is funny at the same time also the saliva coming out from his mouth adds a little creepy touch to that specific scene. Then we move on to the rest of the first act which introduces us to these kids and their bullies, this movie does a great job developing its main characters which are performed by many talented kids who did an excellent, magnificent work on their roles.It was pretty cool to see the individual scary scenes with the red balloons for each kid, all of this moments packed many jumps and jolts which I found extremely well directed. I noticed that this movie still keeps the ""Mama"" flavor from director Andy Muschietti. Both films have similar creepy imagery and effects. Both movies look very similar in style, color and art direction, I absolutely loved that the movie kept that aspect. I cannot wait to watch more films coming from him.The second act is slick, dreadful, a brutal explosion of blood (literally). I loved every second of it, my movie theatre was screaming and laughing all at once during this act. This is definitely one of the best movie theatre experiences I've ever had. The projector scene was so freaking good, (I will not spoil anything) let's just say that it is one of the best moments in a horror movie in years. Also, my favorite scene was the first bathroom scene with the incredibly talented Sophia Lillis (Beverly), her screams and overall performance during that scene was mind- blowing.Another moment from the movie which involves a scary looking house was very intense too. It was one of the sequences who got the most gripping reaction from my audience. Muschietti directs with energy, it is a sea of memorable scares and surprises. Oh, man this movie has so many great moments! Also, the film does a great job mixing the comedy and horror aspects together. When the film is doing horror it's scary, and when it is doing comedy it's hilarious. Mainly because of the genius and sleek dialogue between the characters.I want to stand out Nicholas Hamilton's performance as the bully guy (Henry). He did a fantastic job and he was very scary in every moment he was on screen. I actually felt very frustrated as the characters themselves. I also felt a great connection between the characters, there was good chemistry among them. That beautifully scary house sequence left me breathless, because it's the moment where shit's going down. The moment where everything goes to hell, amazingly orchestrated by Muschietti.Third act is shaky but still fun. I wish it did not have all of that shaky cam during the final fight, it was very difficult to see what was going on. It was similar to what happened with the horror/action scenes in the movie Krampus, way too dark and shaky. But whatever it was still entertaining. The resolution of the film was very accurate, I was very happy with the ending and I cannot wait to see the sequel which I hope is as good as this film.As with flaws I would say that it takes some time for the film to start the horror aspect. It takes a lot of time to develop these characters. But I don't complain after all, movies need great character development. Another minor flaw I have is some of the VFX used in the film, in a couple of moments they look kind of weird. But hey! It's from the same guy who directed ""Mama"" so I get why he decided to use that type of strange CGI in this film. Anyway, this is one of my favorite horror movies in the past 5 years. It is so extremely well directed, acted and shot. It has so many memorable horror moments and it definitely deserves to be the highest grossing horror film to date! (B+)",It

Mostly because what's on the page can often come across as silly on the big screen. IT is one of the better adaptions. The acting is fantastic. They perfectly cast the child actors. Pennywise is truly terrifying, as portrayed here. Taken scene by scene, there is little to fault. However, IMO, there isn't much of a story.

The novel is a lot more gruesome than the film. A lot of the incest and abuse scenes were removed from the film to keep it more lighthearted and focused on the main antagonist which is an evil presence that simply goes by the name of Pennywise. The young cast deserves a lot of credit. Their remarkable performance will conjure up memories of more iconic films like ""E.T""., ""Stand by Me"", and even the recent Netflix classic ""Stranger Things"". They certainly have a future in Hollywood. The film is noteworthy for Hollywood because its one of the few Horror films to come out of the industry that have generated more than $200 million at the box office within weeks of release. This alone should indicate the film's promise. It ended up being one of the most profitable films of 2017. Although, ""It"" may not appeal to die-hard horror fans or even die-hard fans of the original series, the film does offer many genuinely horrifying moments. Children are commonly used to evoke horror within the horror genre. But ""It"" managed to use the concept in a particularly new way with excellent results. ""It"" offers a fresh relief from the usual Horror fare simply because the film has characters that are believable and fully developed. The fact that such a young cast was able to pull of a Stephen King novel is a testament to their talent. Like the novel, the film is bound to be an instant classic.

In the first half or so we have a bunch of early teens spewing non-stop ever-so-cool repartee and tediously ""witty"" commentary, laced with total disrespect for all adults, who in this movie all deserve disrespect.

552,benkitching13,Largely a high quality horror experience.,8,18 September 2017,"Rather 7.5 out of 10, for clarification.As stated in my summary: IT (2017) is largely a high quality horror experience.IT hosts an entourage of young actors who are members of the ""Loser's Club"" and deliver widely impressive performances. The members of the club are, as individuals, unique and quirky and the exploits of their private lives compose some of the most entertaining on screen material. Despite this, I firmly believe Wyatt Ollef's character of Stanley Uris would have most certainly benefited from some additional lines of dialogue. The aforementioned lack of dialogue leaves his character feeling (not wholly) but noticeably underdeveloped. Alternatively, Skarsgard undeniably excels as sadistic, demonic being Pennywise. The film exhibits a praiseworthy contrast of terrifying moments and humour. It is also worth noting that the film's initial scene serves as a highlight unparalleled by the remainder of the picture, in it's scares, performances, tone and cinematography. That's not to suggest, however, that the film doesn't consistently provide exceedingly good cinematography. With this considered, it is a major disappointment that a dramatically overt cliché crops up in the movie's final act; which is then superseded by a lesser (but still present) one. The film is a mass of tension, which is evident from the offset. It's also succeeds in delivering an abundance of creatively engrossing frights; the majority of which are executed by the exemplary Skarsgard. Overall, IT is a composite of quirky characters, a terrifyingly impressive demon and a contrast of terrifying moments and humour, unfortunately diminished by cliché's in the final act. I highly recommend IT for cinematic viewing, and eventually home viewing following it's release.",It

554,Icedooitle,Floats Above the Original,8,19 September 2017,"In the first 10 minutes of the remake of Stephen King's ""It"", I was taken aback by how much more violent and graphic it was than its 1990 predecessor. I recalled a creepy yet campy made-for-TV movie that was ultimately forgettable were it not for the spectacularly unsettling performance by Tim Curry in the title role. I initially attributed this upswing in gore to the Hollywood trend of remakes, dial it up to 11 and hope for the best. It didn't take long for me to see that there was something more at work here. As the familiar story ticked on I realized that this movie isn't for those who are being introduced to the story for the first time. It's for those, of my generation, who knew that the evil of ""IT"" was waiting its obligatory 27 years to reemerge and scare the hell out of us again as adults.In the small town of Derry Maine, big brother Bill is paper folding the ill-fated SS. Georgie on his bed. Little brother Georgie scampers in to take his toy boat out to the rainy gutters of the neighborhood. Bill and Georgie have an unrealistically precious relationship. Georgie is literally too cute to live. As the little tike chases the makeshift sail-boat down the street, it becomes clear that the swollen $35 million budget was put to good use. From the original, we know Georgie's floating destiny, but how he arrives there is a red flag for the extremes we can expect for the 135 run-time. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) looks nothing like the Bozo interpretation by Curry. More like a mix between John Wayne Gacy and John Leguizamo from Spawn. The only real acting Skarsgard gets to do is in those creepy few minutes, menacingly gawking out of that gutter. The rest of Pennywise's appearances are too heavily CGI'd to require an actor. Most of the character's appearances are relegated to creepy waving and jump- scares. This might sound disappointing if Pennywise's only manifestation was as a clown.More than the terror of this ever-morphing entity, the town of Derry itself is a certain type of hell for children. There are sadistic bullies that would be showing mercy by simply punching you in the face. There are no adults in the traditional sense as they are all guilty of apathy, predatory hungers, or just being former bullies who now own small businesses. The 7 protagonist children have nowhere to turn when their personal nightmares starting coming to life. Bill has lost his brother the year before with parents who have all but moved on. Beverly is becoming a woman in a home where her single father's loving touch is completely unwelcome. Mike, the home-schooled slaughterhouse worker, may have the most traumatizing past which is only briefly capitalized on. That brevity might have been a good idea considering how it would clash hard with the tongue-in-cheek humor that makes most of the horror palatable. The other members of the group, Richie, Ben, Eddie, and Stanley have their own triggers but they don't stem from trauma At least not yet.Pennywise gets a disappointing amount of dialogue, but it is made up for by our 7 heroes, self-dubbed The Losers. Richie (Finn Wolfhard of ""Stranger Things"" notoriety) is particularly hilarious with one- liners that would kill in any Apatow flick. The others are given depth of character through realistic interpersonal relationships and convincingly fitting into the late 80's aesthetic. Their world is a terrifying fantasy, but the nostalgia is refreshingly real.With the reverence that the creators of IT have shown the material, I was surprised to find the small catalogue they have contributed to in the past. Director Andy Muschietti created the stylish, but ultimately forgettable ""Mama."" Only Gary Dauberman of the three screenwriters has had notable contributions to the genre, writing the disappointing ""Annabelle"" and much better ""Annabelle: Creation."" So it is quite satisfying to see that this was likely a passion project for these artists. The result being a dutiful and exhilarating remake that has every right to stand up to, and even float above the original.",It

556,CinematicGarbage,One of the Best Stephen King's Adaptation,6,4 May 2019,"IT (2017) is a remake of Stephen King's novel with the same name, directed by Andy Muschietti. It was about a group of unpopular kids being bullied by others called the Losers' Club and one day, a creature called IT (Bill Skarsgard), who could morph into anything anyone fears, came to Derry, Maine and tried to separate the kids apart and also terrorize Derry. The kids had to find the clown and kill it and before that, they had to deal with the things they were afraid of. You know before this movie, there was a Tv movie called Stephen King's It (1990) and I saw a few clips about it. I didn't want to see the whole movie because it was more than 190 minutes and it took really long. After seeing some clips, I was bored with it. IT from 1990 sucks, the clown Pennywise was more like a playful villain, not the one who tried to scare kids and killed kids. Tim Curry only wanted to play with kids, not to scare them and when he did, it wasn't scary, only his make-up face. I didn't like Stephen King's 1990 adaptation at all.
Starring Jaeden Lieberher as Bill Denbrough (or stuttering Bill), Finn Wolfhard as Richie Tozier, Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh, Jack Dylan Gazer as Eddie Kaspbrak, Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben Hanscom, Chosen Jacobs as Mike Hanlon, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley Uris and Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. In many movies, kids sucked at acting, especially childish movies but in this movie, I really love the acting, the kids did a really excellent job on it, swearing here and there and they're phenomenal. I really like Finn being Richie and I also liked his language (he used it wisely). Jaeden acted exactly like Bill in the novel (he stammered well like ""Ge-Ge-Georgie"") and Bill Skarsgard was 100% perfect for the role as IT. His Pennywise was really scary and usually popped out at the right time and audiences feared his character, his looks (well not the clown suit). In I really liked the make-up of Pennywise in here, much better than Tim Curry's (his face was like a clown who wanted to play with kids).
I also loved the CGI effects in here. Nothing was funny about Pennywise being edited with the effects. His face was truly terrifying. The terrifying creatures were well-set and . The cinematography was really good. It was filled with darkness and frightening. The rooms were dark and they made objects (at least one) fell and it was scary. I really liked when they're doing something that no adults would trust (like you're telling your parents what you've seen ""Mommy, I saw dead people in my room"" they won't believe and I saw movies like this such as Candance in Phineas and Ferb told her mom that her brother were inventing something and when she went to see the invention, nothing was there).
Benjamin Wallfisch did really great with the original score. The piano soundtrack was as creepy as everything was in the movie and they used kids singing (it was also really creppy on so many levels). Kids' voice were also used as a character's flashback which was scary and the line (You'll Float Too) was scary as well but I loved his soundtrack ""Every 27 Years"" the most.
It (2017) was such an excellent Stephen King's adaptation. The performances were great (Bill Skarsgard was freaking me out), the CGI was well-used and the original score was creepy. This adaptation was a hundred times better than the 1990 one and it was one of the greatest Stephen King's adaptation based on his greatest book (the book was extremely long and I hadn't finished reading it yet).",It

559,Pozdnyshev,People Don't Seem To Get That This Was Terrible,1,16 October 2017,"I hated this movie.I can't be arsed to go into too much detail. I'll just give my general impressions.This movie was marketed as having been adapted from Stephen King's modern classic ""It."" It was about seven children who come together one summer to overcome both their unique personal challenges, and a supernatural monster in their town that feeds on kids every 27 years. It's a brilliant story, a passionate giant of a book.This movie reduces it into a typical, cliché-ridden, unintelligent, and very bland horror film.Taken on its own, and without any expectations, it is a fairly decent throwaway popcorn-flick to entertain teenagers. The photography is good. The writing is extremely superficial but still has a thin arc. The special effects are okay. And the jump-scares are amusing for some people.Taken as an adaptation of the novel, it's an abomination. There is so little character development that by the end of the movie, you can barely tell one character from another. You don't care about any of them because you don't get to know them. They are all contrived cardboard cutouts, and this very much includes the villain ""Pennywise"" who looks ridiculous, and is reduced to a one-dimensional boogeyman whose existence and motivation is never explained.The jump scares never end. What the film calls ""horror"" is an extremely cheap bunch of sound-blasts along with startling close-ups of the handful of mediocre monsters.The general feel of this movie was one that was written and directed by people who had no idea what the original story they'd adapted this from was about; they just cherry-picked a handful of superficial details (a very few of which I must admit they did right -- the Leper and Butch Bowers' murder) and then added in a bunch of their own ideas which were just weird and stupid (a pharmacist propositioning Beverly? Pennywise beat to death with metal pipes???).There is a very strange phenomenon going on where people seem to love this movie. I don't fully understand this except that these people don't understand what makes good cinema, and resent anyone who tries to make them aware of this. it's weird, isn't it? it reminds me of feminism, this pig-headed denial of reality. I hazard a guess that it's some weird manifestation of people in America's discontent with a republican presidency.(edit) never before in my life have I encountered a phenomenon like the almost rabid popular defense of terrible movies like ""It 2017"" or ""Ghostbusters 2016."" Having a profound love of good art, I have had countless arguments with people who think I am wrong in hating these films. All of these arguments have ended in them hurling insults like petulant toddlers in a pram because their love for these rotting placental afterbirths are purely emotional.What is going on?Basically, this generation is not just getting more stupid, which is made apparent by their incapacity to recognize banal-assed filmmaking when they see it. they are also possessed of a certain narcissistic constellation of attitudes towards life that border on sociopathic. Their basic paradigm is that there is no right or wrong, and anyone who tries to force them to follow any rules at all is a bad person.Like closet Nazis, they cling to anything that promotes these sick values with a hysterical fervor. Some more, some less.That's why some people say they love these movies. Not because they are good movies, but because they promote a certain worldview of cynical selfishness and a disregard for truth and beauty. It's Leftist propaganda.",It
560,Robosharp,"IT starts exceptionally, but IT ends typically.",7,13 September 2017,"I recall about 20 minutes into the re-boot of Stephen King's IT, thinking I'm in for a treat here. And to be fair 20 minutes later I was just as enthusiastic. These 40 minutes had showed me slick direction, suspenseful narrative, a good introduction to our new teenage heroes of Derry and of course above all a really excellent opening scene, presenting Pennywise the mysterious evil killer clown, or other wise know as IT.Lets face it, the driving force of both the book, the original TV series and now this film is the depiction of Pennywise himself (Itself). And here Bill Skarsgard and the special effects team do a stirling job on creating a menacing and fiendish bad guy entity.So with this in mind, should I not be giving this film a higher rating? No. Why? Well the film wasn't 40 mins long, it was over two hours. The first hour I was fully engage, the second hour my engagement waned. The scare sequences became more tedious, more CGI was replacing dread. And to be frank the actual story never causes much drama, and to be fair doesn't really make sense.Why does Pennywise kill all other children and teenagers at will, but just appears to muck about with the main cast? (he kills adults in the chapter 2) IT could surly kill them at any time, but instead IT lets them team up on him and all of a sudden he is powerless, and defeated far to easily. You never really feel any of these kids are actually in any danger from IT, it has that kinda of comic book feel, which dislodges the tension. Look appreciate that this is how the book was written, so can't entirely blame the film for that.The performances from the teenage cast are good here. Most notably would be Sophia Lillis who plays the rouge 'teenage girl with domestic issues', Beverly Marsh. A clear talent with great screen presence, but her character is most notable because she gets a lot more backstory than the others, and her characters journey gets shoved in your face to be honest. Due to this some of the other lads in the group end up getting overlooked and therefore unbalances the group dynamics.This is still a decent film, with a lot of positives. Well made, with an intriguing Killer clown at it's centre. Certainly worth checking out.",It

562,xristoff93,Did I miss something?,5,6 February 2018,"-I was hearing all this noise around this movie and having not seen the older version of ""IT"" I came to believe that it would be something pretty scary.
-But what was that? A small group of kids, running around, in splatter scenes, throwing adult humour all over the place and bad language....It was so confusing. I was feeling like I was watching a children's movie from a messed up producer. There was nothing scary, no tension, no anything... In many parts it felt like a bunch of random scenes thrown in together to hastily make a film.
-And it felt kinda wrong the thought that the target group of this film was young...much younger than it should be....

563,rolandjordaan2,IT - Spoiler Free Review,5,14 September 2018,"The story of IT has always been just as much about a group of youths discovering the value of friendship, while overcoming their own personal childhood traumas as it was about a killer clown eating kids, and the first thing this movie pulls off perfectly: the child actors in this movie are great, they all have a strong on-screen presence, strong chemistry with each other and most importantly, you feel for them on their journey; the everyday traumas they are dealing with is something most of us can relate to in one way or another...and then there's the clown, the horror, the reason people have been too scared to watch this film: EVERY TIME that damn clown shows up on screen, this movie turns into an episode of Goosebumps, and I'm not kidding, that's how not scary this new version is. The original movie managed to scare an entire generation; you can ask basically any child (except me) that grew up in the 90s and they will tell you about some trauma caused by the original IT, and to an extent, I do get it. Tim Curry took the character of Pennywise and made it something memorable, on the surface he still looked like a normal clown, the design was simplistic which made it identifiable and thereby sparked a genuine fear of clowns; I can tell you now, no-one is going to remember Bill Skarsgård the damn dancing clown, why? Because it is just trying way too hard to be scary, the design looks unnatural, his voice sounds like a pedophile and his actions are all overdone...if you see this clown on the street, you're going to run away and that completely defies why Pennywise worked in the original movie. Overall, this movie works as a drama, it has the same strengths as earlier Stephen King classics like 'Stand by Me', but falls apart every single time it tries to be scary; so even though I would love to give this movie a pass on what it did right, I simply can't recommend a horror that only works when the horror isn't happening. Disappointing movie and yet another nail in the coffin of the Stephen King cinematic universe, that is never going to take off. Scariest thing in this movie...in a few years I'm going to have to sit through Part 2.",It
564,charbelelaro,I can't help but commend how well made the film is,8,2 April 2019,"IT directed by Andres Muschetti is a film adaptation based off the Steven King novel. First and foremost, this movie is directed beautifully. The cinematography and editing is prefect. Also the film sets in the film look incredible, particularly the abandoned house. The performances by these early teenage actors were so entertaining and very real. As for issues, I felt the first 2 acts were a little slow in setting up the characters and their personal fears. The film sort of goes into a repetitive pattern showing each character's fear one by one after each other. Although by the third act the film really picks up, with Pennywise the clown giving a spectacular and horrifying performance. Many critics dislike the film, as they believe it's basically not scary enough. Although as for me I can't help but commend how well made the film is so therefore I give IT an 8.",It

566,stankactorman,What are you afraid of?,9,15 October 2017,"IT: It's a horror story, but not the kind where things go bump in the night. It's not the cat knocking over the garbage can, or the bird descending on our heroes as they explore some dark passageway. It's a horror story about fear. Children in a small New England town have gone missing for centuries. A small band of pre-teens, one of whom had a brother go missing a year ago, realizes that each of them is being terrorized by an unknown entity. That entity appears as the evil, shape-shifting clown, Pennywise. Our group is composed of the usual types: the fat kid, the smart kid, the asthmatic kid, the new kid, the leader and 'the girl' who's living her own private horror story at home. Collectively, they're all being bullied by the typical group of adolescent assholes. More than that, I shouldn't say. The less you know, the better. The kids, all of them, are excellent and each has a story which adds depth to their character thanks to the outstanding writing. It's a long movie but not because there's a lack of pace. The direction is tight and taut. Camera placement is as good as it gets and is accompanied by artful cinematography which adds to the terror factor and enhances every scene. Score: 9. GO. What are you afraid of? Hmmm?",It

568,nmn34,Starts Too Strong but Still a Good Hour and a Half,8,17 September 2017,"Unfortunately its two and a half hours. I liked this movie, it was a good movie for the most part and the first ten minutes are extremely scary. Pennywise in the sewer, luring a child closer before ultimately stealing him away is one of the most memorable scenes I have seen this year. Unfortunately, it sets the bar too high for the rest of the movie and it never reaches that point again. An the simple reason is that it hows too much. There is no mystery as to what Pennywise does, it lays everything out on the bed like the clothes did for you when you were twelve. He rips a kid's arm off for God's sake, there is no reason to feel that Billy is justified in that his brother still may be alive somewhere when we just saw the kid get ate nor any reason to wonder what happened to the other kids that went missing. This makes the movie grow stale after a while, it still good for a while but eventually it overstays its welcome.Perhaps that makes it a problem, there is too much Pennywise. At the very least too much direct activity from him. Skarsgard was good at the role, he was wonderfully imposing in front of the young cast but was fairly single minded. He is there to eat kids, and that was pretty much it. He lacks the maliciousness of Tim Curry, who drew far more pleasure tormenting his victims before the hunt. Skarsgard instead pops up in just about every scene, not as a malevolent presence but as a physical flesh and blood monster chasing the kids around around with little exception. As I said, there is no mystery about him and his intent is abundantly clear. Seeing him again becomes less about his intentions and more the signal for the next chase. Its still scary but gradually is hurt by diminishing returns. I was done after the haunted crack house but still had the final confrontation in the sewers to go through.The movie also managed to hit my biggest pet peeve, swearing children. Smart mouthed children are fine, even though he was supposed to be annoying I was fine with Richie from the TV movie, but in this day and age it seems to be that wise guy means foul mouthed little brat. This Richie is especially egregious, from credits to credits every line has to have a swear or mention of the size of his penis.",It

Just one helpless and unimaginative executed ""scare""-scene senslessly glued to the other. What a mess! There is nothing here that you haven't seen before at least a thousend times. Especially the episodes with the school-bullys are cringeworthy formulaic.
The only thing clever about this is the marketing. They sure had me thinking that this wasn't just a trashy horror-flic. After the first dull ""scary-basement"" scene, i knew what i was in for. Watched ist till the end in disbelief, though. Still can't believe how boring this was. Sad.",It

571,olovsimonsson,Not disappointing,8,5 January 2018,"As a fan of the book since my early teens, I was ready to be disappointed. However, I was not. 
Sure there are a lot of things I really would have wanted to see on screen that did not make it, but most of it would have required a new mini series, or more. My biggest fear was actually the moving of the story to the 1980's, instead of keeping it in the 1950's as it is in the book. However, this was not at all a problem, as the same tone remains.The young actors portraying the protagonists of the Losers Club are doing a remarkable job. Bill Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise (I'm not just saying that because we're both Swedish). The only two issues I have really, is the relationship between these kids could be stronger. There is so much focus on finding Bill's brother and IT, that the strong bond that the kids should have is slightly thin. The second issue is the focus on IT as Pennywise, rather than the entity it is underneath the clown mask. While Pennywise if frightening, the notion of something far worse beneath the make up would have made him far more frightening.Hopefully, the next installment will delve deeper into both of these issues. With that said, it is a wonderful movie, and one that even the most die hard fans of the book should love.",It
572,mt-95256,"Excellent, terrifying and one of the best horrors of all time. Expect a nail-biting, scary story as well as a sweet coming-of-age story",8,11 September 2017,"Often when you look at click-bait lists of 'Top 50 Horror Films Of All Time', you see the same films listed over and over; 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Shining', 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'The Exorcist'. This is why it's so refreshing to see a new film with the potential to jump straight to the top of these lists. Over the last few years we haven't had many; Insidious and The Conjuring perhaps, but the amount of new entries is limited. Ever since the first trailer dropped like a bomb on the internet, there's been an inescapable hype circling It. Now it's finally here, it's a relief to see that the hype wasn't for nothing and, even more fortunately, It deserves a special seat in any Top Horror list.One thing left out of the marketing was that this is only the first film, something that's only revealed at the end. It's only to be expected; King's original novel is too long to fit an average 2 hours; also most films nowadays that enjoy any hype or success inevitably become franchises – especially when something like It becomes a record-breaking success scoring an impressive estimated $117 million on its opening weekend.Although the prospect of having yet another franchise to keep up with is worth a groan, this film isn't an irritatingly shameless attempt at building a world no one knows if they want (like with The Mummy earlier this year). Despite leaving questions open and unanswered at the end (thus requiring the second film), this film would otherwise be a strong film able to stand on its own, without a franchise behind it. Fortunately they didn't cram the whole book into one film since it would lose a lot of its strength – a great aspect of the film is the pacing, details and insights we get into each and every character. Still, this doesn't mean that the story within the film is flawless. Whilst we all understand that many questions posed at the end will be answered in the sequel, it does seem initially underwhelming and annoying not to give us any answers at the end. In the finale we find out what Pennywise has been up to, all of it not quite seeming straightforward – and then it's over, without giving us any clue to ponder on while we wait for the upcoming chapter. The end does get a bit ridiculous to be honest; the idea of a group of young children being able to confront a supposedly powerful, murderous monster begs belief.These issues towards the end aside, however, this film tells the story of Stephen King's novel excellently and with terrific pace. It's as much a coming-of-age story as it is a horror, with the director and writers allowing as much time for us to get to know the kids as they do for the scares. We don't just see a whole story revolving around Pennywise; if anything Pennywise is just the catalyst that causes the group's bond to become so strong – the real story is about the end of childhood and coming to terms with our fears. This theme and message comes across organically. The story of the group is often sweet and funny – it's not all dark and scary, oft-times coming across like a Spielberg film, Super 8 or Stranger Things. The real strength of the children is really down to the actors. Child actors can sometimes be a gamble, especially if the whole film revolves around them and it's not a movie for children. Yet any gamble here certainly pays off, since every young actor in this film is terrific and worthy of every ounce of praise they get. Having a balance between delightful, nostalgic scenes of childhood and sinister scenes of horror has a double effect; it gives us a variety of strong, rounded characters performed by hugely talented young actors to make up an excellent ensemble and the scary scenes become even more potent by contrast.It's these scary scenes that initially draw such a huge audience and they deliver the scares in spades. Mature and well-shot, there are scenes here soon to become iconic, their film techniques studied for decades to come. There are some jump scares, but they are good, satisfying and never cheap, rather the tension is built up to a wonderful climax in each horror-imbued scene. Excellent horror- cinematography aside though, Skarsgård's Pennywise is the real horror star. A perfect successor to Tim Curry's iconic original in 1990, there should be as much credit given to the design and make-up behind the clown as there is to Skarsgård's performance. Creepy and sinister with an unnerving smile one minute, then, with just a small change of facial expression, the next minute the monster within becomes obvious and absolutely terrifying. Neither underused or overused, Pennywise is certainly the hideous joy that delivers what everyone wanted from this film – an irrational phobia of clowns.The film also takes advantage of the various scares that chase the children. If clowns don't give you the shivers, then something here will. The range of scare means no specific fear becomes boring and overseen. The film also goes one step further in bringing horror from the parents of the group. Sinister and perverted, there's more than just a vicious clown on the loose and the dark aspects coming from the children's very homes make it all the more captivating and unnerving.Whether clowns scare you or not, this is without doubt a horror film that you need to see. Sinister, tense and undeniably terrifying with an intricate, scary plot, it's also sweet, innocent and very funny with a nostalgic and thought-provoking insight into childhood. The scares are big and enjoyable and Pennywise is the horror icon we all want. Everyone's favourite dancing clown is back to float this movie to a success and you should want to float too.",It

The kids in this film all represent certain types of people in society and all feel accurate and realistic. Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise is something special. A lot of the creepy aspects of Pennywise, the laugh, eye movement, smile, voice was all from Skarsgard with no special effects or anything.I must say, when the members of the Losers Club encounter their individual fears, a lot of the creatures look silly and fake, for me personally the only scenes that scared me were the ones featuring Pennywise.This film doesn't give many jump scares compared to other horror films, but does give you a good story and a creepy villain.",It

580,tyreeewebster,"IT- ""You'll Float, too...""",8,20 September 2017,"It's fair to say that recently, Hollywood has had an over reliance and abundance of horror remakes and ""re-imaginings"", from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to 'Halloween' to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'- all with varying degrees of critical and financial success (although, they tend to make the BIG BUCKS. Most of the time, we don't need them, but every once in a while a remake comes along and knocks it out of the park and into the sewer drain!I'm talking, of course, of 'IT'. The success of this film has been extraordinary. After the announcement of another film version of Stephen King's most bizarre book, and its shaky production, it's safe to say that it has all paid off tremendously well! The film-makers have created a fun, creepy, funny and at times heart-warming coming of age tale that really takes you by surprise when the surprises are thrust upon you. A film about friendship, fear and love... and balloons.Let me start of by saying that this is not a perfect horror film. In fact it's in no way that terrifying (to me, anyway). The scares, at times come of as cheap and predictable, and that's something that Director Andy Muschietti should have tried to avoid with this particular film. It's something that modern horror has made a trend of... silence... silence... JUMP!The Losers Club are fantastic. These child actors have created such real and enduring characters and they're such a joy to watch. In particular, Jaeden Lieberher as Stuttering Bill, Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben, the adorable Sophia Lillis as Beverly and Finn Wolfhard as Richie Tozier. The entire ensemble do incredibly well, but those four happen to be my personal stand-outs.However, the stand-out of all the stand-outs (and the centre of the marketing ploy that has got millions flocking to the cinemas) is Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Never before in the World of horror have we had such an ambitious and mesmerising performance. From the voice, the astonishing make-up and costume, the ticks and body language; Skarsgård has made a cinematic icon of Freddy Krueger proportions... especially when he is used very sparingly.My only gripe (apart from the cheap jump scares) is that the CGI ruins the novelty of the film a bit. In a horror film, the effects are best when they are practical.The film is a simple 'kids vs monster' film of the 80's, and I think that's what the film-makers had in mind; a good-old fashioned fun piece of film.I don't know what else to say, the movie is so much fun, with great atmosphere and great characters... go see it and float!",It
581,Fancytower,Disappointed,3,24 December 2017,"I truly do not understand the high rating on this film. Is it from people that never read the book or from people that are easily scared?I know it is difficult to transfer King's novels to screen. Anyone that is an avid reader of King's knows this. I liked IT back in the day but I didn't love it like many. It just didn't thrill me like other King stories. I mean it's about a clown. Even back when it it came out, it wasn't about the clown. It's about the kids and his or her fears. And the movie totally missed the mark. Don't waste your money. The film is awful. It's like a B movie with good cinematography. Don't waste your time or money",It
582,ChrisKleinFangirl,Complex Story Of The Destructive Nature Of Repressed Emotions-with a bit too much CGI,8,26 September 2017,"I have always stood by IT (1990) being the most terrifying movie of all time (despite the awful ending), so like many others I cringed at the thought of a remake. I went into the cinema expecting cheap jump scares, lack of plot line, overuse of CGI and a general mimicry of what was once the movie that terrified a generation.However, I was pleasantly surprised by what turned out to be a great piece of cinema, and I would recommend it to anybody who is a fan of the horror genre or just wants to see something a bit different. I could give IT a 10/10 but like all films, it has its faults;1) As I predicted, over use of CGI took away the eerie terror Pennywise possesses. Tim Curry portrayed a terrifying, yet very plain clown, leaving much to the viewers imagination, adding to the psychological tension. This pennywise has an almost laughable face and too many teeth. Other CGI moments killed the atmosphere, and it could have easily gone into ""just another horror film"" if not resurrected by the witty script.2) Plot holes, as other IMDb users have mentioned, Their are a few plot holes in the movie, but as this is part of Chapter One they could be addressed in the sequel.Now onto the good points.* Acting- The cast were wonderful, the kids were portraying some very dark scenes, but they all handled them brilliantly and brought the unique characters to life. They were all totally believable. Bill Skarsgård had big boots to fill when it came to Tim Curry, and although I personally preferred the original pennywise he still gave an amazing performance in an alternative way.* Overall Tone- One of my favourite things about IT was how it was full of symbolism, ""easter eggs"" and metaphors. So much darker than original and braving to touch themes such as Munchhausen's, Sexual Abuse, Grief and Bullying. It was gritty, but also witty. Just the right about of comic relief and one-liners. Humour and Horror combined are the pineapple and pizza of cinema.* Comparison to the original- Just look at the promotional posters alone to sense the difference in vibe between the original and this version. In terms of cinematography, the original uses vibrant colours, and light hearted comical sounds and effects. For me, this makes the movie much scarier, when portrayed as something innocent the evil intensifies (another metaphor?) whereas the 2017 version has a blatantly depraved atmosphere, using creepy Victorian circus music, blood and gore, and an overall sense of ""you should be scared"" rather than ""You shouldn't be scared, but you are aren't you?""This version is much more GothicThe original puts little emphasis on the backstories of The Losers Club, whereas this version puts it at the heart of the plot. Their definitely is a ""nice"" part of the film, a film of growing pains and friendship when being an outsider. Having this insight into the backstories allowed you to sympathise more, becoming emotional involved with them, and have a better understanding of their own fears and where they stem from, in this sense, this version is more psychologically intense and adds a depth that I believe was missed in the 1990 version.In conclusion, if the caricature CGI was cut back, and the ending scene was shortened it would be near on perfect. I also think it is worth adding IT IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT A SCARY CLOWN, YES THEIR IS A SCARY CLOWN INVOLVED BUT THIS IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT A SCARY CLOWN. IT is a complex story of the destructive nature of repressed emotions, The fear of fear itself, Being an outsider in a world where you see things differently, and taken from a universe created by the great mind of Stephen King, if you want a film that will make you jump and scream, maybe you'll enjoy IT, If you want a film about Loss of innocence and the horrors of life, You'll love it.",It
583,Horror-88,"Not too scary, but not too bad",7,7 October 2017,"Not as good as the reviews say, but still okay. Never seen the original, but gave this a watch cuz everyone was saying how scary it was. It's really not actually scary though. In fact, most of the time there was a sense of comfort cuz Pennywise didn't really harm any of the protagonists in the entire movie, and I got the idea that he wasn't going to about halfway through. There was probably one scare that made me sort've jump, but that was it. The rest of the movie wasn't that tense.

584,scandinavianmail,Good kids in a safe and a bit outdated adaptation,6,4 September 2017,"The new adaptation of IT has a lavish Spielbergian approach to the proceedings which partly works and partly really doesn't. All child actors are well cast, with their strengths and weaknesses perfectly at display. Their interaction and friendship is handled with ease and good humour and is by far the most enjoyable part of the story.Less tasteful is how they interact with adults who are distant and authoritative or just as much monsters as the one that is after the kids. The recent Stranger Things, one cast member of which reappears, had this covered much better, with the obvious note that Stranger Things itself is an evolution of King's and Spielberg's earlier works. The school bullies are also ridiculously evil and inhuman which is seldom seen in today's media.As King's popular novel is much copied, the terrifying events, however carefully produced, come across somewhat outdated. The number of jump scares feels like yet another throwback to old-school horror. Music swells to underline everything that happens on the screen, with no emotion without a score to tell the audience exactly what they should be experiencing right now. That gets intrusive quickly.What the marketing entirely skips, this is actually the part 1. It covers the first half of the novel only, with the rest coming in the part 2.",It

Anybody else notice that?I didn't like the casting of him - he looked baby-faced and childish. The kids were great. The town looks superb. But the film was very very average.

Not, this movie is horrible and completely misses the point of what It is supposed to be. It is supposed be terrifying, dangerous, grueling, grim, and depressing. Not this joke fest they've made. Completely overdone and only has 10% of gore of what the book has to offer. This film was supposed to offer NC-17 level violence and even controversial scenes such as a child having sex with another child. There's none of that in here. There's only an arm rip scene, which was done in the most non-disgusting way. Probably because Hollywood has a cynical view of cinema and they can't go all out because they're too wussy to take their ambitions to greater heights. The production is mediocre. Lots of fake looking sets, cheap digital effects that may put the audience off. The child performances are horrible as always. Just straight up cringe. Bill Skarsgaard is okay, but at times he is way too obvious. Once again, a horror film reduced to dumb characters making very dumb decisions.

It was dire. Then there was the story, can i reuse the confusing and add appalling. I guess for anyone who hasn't seen the mini series, which even Steven King liked (which doesn't happen to 99% of his works converted into movies/TV), it was a confusing mushing together of an expansive story, and was REALLY badly done...ruinous. It was basically like someone got the story and then held down the fast forward button and as a bonus threw chunks out as they sped by....just inexcusable, but i guess some people like a quick cash injection to their pockets Stop ruining already well done movies and TV Hollywood, you're just reinforcing the view of so many that you're devoid of any original ideas, and seem hell bent on extracting cash for people for things that already stood well while ruining them...Wished id never seen It",It
599,rs403404,'It' is really good,10,3 October 2017,"Everyone was excited for this movie except me. People were sending me promotional art and movie trailers and, honestly, I didn't care. All the YouTube videos that popped up in my stream included an abundance of people talking about the trailers, I ignored them. Unless it was unavoidable, I didn't watch any of the trailers. Further, years ago, I tried to read the book, but found it unbearably redundant. The 1990 television movie left me unimpressed (outside of seeing a very young Seth Green and Tim Curry's Pennywise). I dreaded this movie and all the hype just heightened my dread. Everyone seemed pumped for this movie while I was pretty certain it would suck. Honestly, I was wrong. 2017's ""It"" is a damn fine movie that is not only creepy, but actually did manage a genuine jump scare (I can't remember the last time that happened).It tells the story of a town in Maine (Stephen King's favorite state to inflict horrors upon) haunted by an evil clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård). The clown feeds on fear thus targets children more than adults. It's never explained why, but it seems safe to assume that it's because children are easier to scare. Everyone is a target, but we mainly follow seven kids (Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer, & Wyatt Oleff). These seven are all misfits for one reason or another and all have had issues with the town bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton). They soon start having similar visions of a creepy clown. It's how they chose to deal with this revelation that drives the movie.This movie is a hard R and has some very graphic imagery and lots of bad languages frequently said by children. It's not a children's movie at all, yet I also think it's not bad to take your children if you think they could handle the scary stuff. There's a strong message here about how fear can only get you if you let it. The young cast (all of whom are very talented) help the message connect with a potentially younger audience. The idea that something as terrifying as Pennywise only has as much power over you as you give to it is not a bad message for anyone but especially children.If I'm forced to levy a complaint, it would be that the story, once again, gets redundant. That's it. Additionally, this movie proves that director Andy Muschietti is a name in horror worth keeping an eye on.

600,pete-murphy97,Perfectly blended comedy-horror,8,17 October 2017,"'IT' did not disappoint, a masterfully shot, well balanced comedy- horror flick set in the oft-frequented old school US suburbia; a classical setting that is revisited here in the best way that I can recall in a long time.What makes 'IT' good is its outstanding ability to capture the character of childhood fantasies and daydreaming in such a neat package in a way not often mastered like this. The full-bodied, organic, life-like scripts and setting matched with fluent actors that fully embodied their roles added to this theme wonderfully.I can compare the innocence of the kids and the daydreaming theme to the now decade-old 'Bridge to Terabithia' (2007) which followed a similar narrative that explores imagination taking hold and making sense of the world around you as a kid.'IT' isn't all flowers and rainbows though. The film was not scared to explore darker topics, things that are very real, while paralleling this with what the kids saw imaginatively, how fears manifest - in many ways 'IT' is a parody low-key psychological horror. The film sort of explores why we are afraid of outwardly innocent things like spiders and clowns, it asks the question, ""why do we have these irrational fears?"" Through this, it has an empowering message: stand up to those who hurt you, don't let an irrational, self- imposed fear dictate what you are and what you can be. Fear takes on many forms.I don't think 'IT' is supposed to be classically frightening, but rather the film is a parodying insight into 'fear' itself, aka what (fear) 'IT' really is and how to try and define it - and also what it means to both the characters and the audience. The unusually large leading cast sort of reflects people from all walks of life. The fact they're kids simply shows how we are all children behind it all. Old fears start young and never die.Overall, a film with a big heart and an even bigger message.8/10",It
601,agentk-77301,So close being really amazing,5,27 July 2018,"I'll start with pro's and con's and later elaborate-Pro's -I like this kind of horror. They don't scream and jump on you every second, it's abrupt. Sometimes with silence, sometimes it builds up, when you least expect it (like after Bev smashed her father's face), and yeah, sometimes they do scream and jump.The CGI is quite good most of the timesThere is actual character development and somewhat of a storyIt's really relateable and silly - All of those awkward teen moments. Makes ya giggle and remember.The villain is quite quirky and fun.Con's -When the CGI isn't good, it's horrible.There is lack of character development & screen time for Mike (the farm kid), the Jewish kid and the fat kid. (And richie, I literally forgot about him and remembered after writing a whole other paragraph, which is a bad sign for the character.) All the rest got a proper treatment.The characters dynamics got messed up and wasn't even that good in the beginingThe ending.Elaboration-I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But I just couldn't.Mike. The farm kid. 
The actor was great and underused. They didn't give him enough screen time to actually make him a character. He is basically nothing more than an idea for a character.Character dynamics. 
Once everyone got mad and scared over Billy the protag and split up- Something felt... Missed, abrupt, odd, as if it wasn't supposed to happen. All the character dynamics that was there initially (the fat being awkward with bev yet they are both somewhat flirty for example) was gone and we were left with 3 characters that actually do some speaking and action - Billy, Bev and the Placebo/Broken arm kid. The rest might as well have died or dissipated and there would hardly be any difference.The love triangle.
The fact there is a love triangle is already bad. Billy, Bev & Fat kid. And honestly? I rooted and wanted the fat kid to be with Bev, and not Billy the protag. Hell, they teased for it right in the beginning of the movie, and with the post-card! It was the perfect. classic underdog kind of character that has redeemable features against his outer appearance (like standing against the bullies when they pulled the knife, which was great. And the fact he was smart as hell yet quirky, with his love for music.). There was no context or buildup for Bev & Billy aside of Billy hitting on her awkwardly. Suddenly, she only goes to hug billy for the rest of the movie??? And even after the fat kid kissed her and she found out HE sent the post-card- two minutes later and it's as if it didn't happen.
The kiss at the end drove me crazy mad and annoyed the HFIL out of me. The End.
Aside fromt hat horrendous kiss, the ending itself was quite... Underwhelming and not very surprising. They hinted all of the movie that fear made the clown strong, but the characters shouldn't have dished it out for the audience. Show, don't tell. And Georgey, why is he dead and the rest of the kids aren't? There was no need to bitter-sweet this if it doesn't make sense.

604,susana-c-fernandes,"Finally, Stephen King",9,5 October 2017,"After years of disappointing adaptations of almost all of his novels, IT is the movie Stephen King deserves. IT tells the story of a group of kids who join forces against an evil presence that is taking children away in their home town. The story is well built (come on, King wrote it) and the movie is able to capture and develop the main plot points successfully. I read the book a few years ago and watching the movie was definitely a way to go back to Derry and share those moments with the characters again, identify with some of them, simpathyse with others, fear and hate a few others.The 80's atmosphere is well portrayed, the soundtrack is great and I'm sure everyone who grew up on that time will enjoy following along the kids' adventures. If you've watched Stranger Things you'll feel this has a similar atmosphere and that maybe the movie was inspired by it, but it really was the other way around. Stranger Things is reminiscent of Stephen King's universe and you can clearly see it on IT (also on Stand By Me, but IT is way better in my opinion).Now for the scare factor. The book had some REALLY gruesome scenes that the movie mercifully left out, specially the kind involving animal cruelty and child sex. Other than that, the scares and shocking images are there, from the beginning. I think people aren't used to seeing children suffer on screen, and that is something the movie isn't afraid to throw in our faces from the very start.Also, some scenes have genuinely creepy details (pay attention when Ben is in the library for instance) and I literally felt shivers down my spine when revisiting ALL of IT's manifestations. They are really, really well done. The CGI can be a little over the top at times, but nothing too blunt, nor that it does any true harm to the overall movie experience.The cast is wonderful. I mean the kids do a really great job, they look, talk and act natural, unlike (forgive me) the kids on the first installment. And Pennywise, for once, is a freakin scary clown. No offense for Tim Curry's fans, but this clown is WAY scarier than the first, specially the way he moves onto his victims. IT leaves us with a sense of dread and nostalgia, I felt for those kids and the horrors (human and non-human) they had to endure. I literally cannot wait to see the final chapter and see who they will cast for the roles. The whole crew has some serious work on their hands if they want to make the second movie as good as the first and whomever they choose to play the grown-ups on the Losers Club has some seriously big shoes to fill.

So thanks to all of you for reading my review on IT hope too see you in 2019 for the sequel!!!!",It
607,pixiekatten,Pennywise returns in style; one of the best King adaptations!,8,10 September 2017,"I grew up with the 1990s 'It', and I am one of those people that were forever ruined by Tim Curry and his killer clown. To this day I still really hate those red nosed brutes, and I have never set foot at a circus after watching the film - not once in 27 years! (Very clever by the way to release the film 27 years after the mini TV series! You'll get the importance of the number 27 when watching the film.)So anyway, for me, Skarsgard had some very big clown shoes to fill - and I think he did a really good job. They have not copied Curry's clown - this would've been a recipe for disaster as nobody can ever master that creepy grin and quirky (but terrifying) style. There's a new clown in town, and despite the frilly costume (that was slightly ridiculed when the first promo images came out), the modern Pennywise is actually disturbing and sends chills down your spine. King must be proud! The entire cast is a talented bunch, but It has to be said, that it is the Wolfhard kid from Stranger Things who often steals the show. His scenes got the biggest laughs throughout the movie. They have added quite a bit of humour in the film, which mixed with the scary parts worked very well. A few laughs, a few scares; the script moves us along in a good pace. it is never rushing through the plot, and neither does the film ever turn into a snoozer. Some good writing from the Palmer/Fukunaga/Dauberman trio.We visit Derry in the late 1980s, which means that Chapter 2, and the return of Pennywise the Dancing Clown, will be set in present day. Will we have a whole new generation with fear of clowns? Yes there's a good chance that Coulrophobia will yet again be on the rise - and that spotting a red balloon can only mean one thing; we all float down here!",It
608,roni_arg,Want a regular horror movie? See this. Want a masterpiece? Read the book.,7,11 November 2018,"I read the book and I have to admit they are not very similar. The friends are there, and It, but that's all. Usually, books are way better than adaptations because authors say so much. They give great backstories, characters have unique personalities and feelings, events take their time to unfold. In the movie, time is a constrain, so all this is summarized and sometimes not very effectively. This is the case with It. So, to enjoy it as a horror movie you don't have to compare it to anything. The cast works fine and the special effects and cinematography are ok. Dialogues too, usually in horror movies dialogues are lame. If you want to enjoy a decent horror movie, see this. If you want a masterpiece, read the book. There's a reason why Stephen King is called the King of horror. This book is worth It (pun intended). The book opens with Georgie's scene, and this is the best scene the director managed to convey from the book. In the book though (spoiler ahead) Georgie's body is found. And there are many changes throughout the movie that is difficult to know why they were changed, since they worked great. This gives an idea of many pointless stuff in the movie, that actually make sense in the book. Also, in the book, the kids take weapons when they go searching for It. The part when they are adults is completely missing (guess they kept it for chapter 2) but this makes the movie more of a Stranger Things than It. The movie is watchable anyways.",It
609,DakotaTheGamer,Better Than The Mini Series!!!,9,7 September 2017,This movie was a great movie it was definitely better than the mini series and Pennywise in this movie was way scarier this movie was so amazing it had so many amazing things to it the only reason I give it the score I did is because it didn't scare me as much as I wanted it too and also it didn't contain the scene with the kids having sex like in the book I wish they did to make it more to the book but it was still a great movie even though that happened I absolutely loved the scene in the beginning it was so unexpected what happened that made the movie so worth watching I hope part 2 is more gory and more to the story and also scarier than this one so then I would grade it a 10/10 but it was an amazing movie definitely buying it on Blu-ray.,It
610,larrymeers,"Creepy, Funny, and Perfect",8,9 September 2017,"IT is the story of a group of children known as the loser's club that encounter an evil entity that has been feeding on the people of the town of Derry for a long time, so they unite and come together to hopefully kill IT.First of all the loser's club is fantastic. They feel like actual friends and their chemistry was just perfect. One person that stood out to me was Richie. He was really funny and he is kinda the smart ass of the group. I loved Bill too. You can just see why he wants to kill this thing not only for killing other kids, but for killing his brother. In the movie you can see the pain and grief he is experiencing and he is determined to avenge his death. Another thing i loved about this movie was IT/Pennywise (they are the same thing). He is just creepy in his design and he looks a little off, like his eyes are just tilted and not human. Pennywise looked like a true monster with how he sounded, how he moved, and it just felt like his true form was controlling him on the inside. With Pennywise it made the film more thrilling and it made you care for the Loser's club. Bill Skarsgard did an excellent job and i think this will be the new thing that terrifies children. So in the end i loved this movie. Its Intense, its Creepy, its Funny, and it actually has a lot of Heart in it. IT gave me everything i hoped for with a little bit more then i expected. This in my book is my favorite Stephen King Adaptation. A+ or 10/10 Along with Get Out this may be the best horror movie this year.",It
611,yawael,Much Better Then The Original,8,14 November 2017,"When i first saw the adds to this film i thought that i saw it's name before, and then i realised that i saw it in a bookshop at the stephen king section, so i said to myself i had to watch it because of stephen's great works such as : Carrie, Misery and the Green Mile, and a lot of both great books and a successful film adaption.I really wanted from the beginning to watch this film, but since there was an earlier version i decided to watch it first in order to understand this one more to make a fair comparison between both of them and the result was like everybody who saw them which is that this version was much away better( but we can only compare it to the first part and we had to wait to the sequel to make the full comparison).Anyway the old one was very good at the first half, but in some points it goes down by flashback story (by repeating the flashback for every character it made it kind of boring not to mention the bad performance from the adult actors. but in this version we saw it in one story line without the flash back which was away better.Another thing that was great in this movie is the scary scene i really didn't saw these kind of brilliant shots for long time. As for the evil character i think that both Tim Curry and Bill Skarsgård were at their best, but felt a little sad for Curry because his scene were so little comparing it to skarsgard.The final part of this compression was the kids which was better in the 90s version than this one ( i think this was the one thing that made me unable to put 10 out of 10 to this movie).don't get me wrong kids here were good,but not great as the old one i mean who could compete The performance of the late Jonathan Brandis, another thing was that there was a lack in the relation between the kids and their parent except only two characters and that confused me a lot because the time of the film wasn't short so they could developed a better one. Nevertheless this film is one of the best films of 2017 that no one should miss.",It
612,importantabhilash,Untitled,9,17 May 2020,"The seven characters in the movie are very well developed.these characters get bullied all the time in school..and few harrased at home ..
Going through a tough ride..they empower themselves to fight the fear inside them...and the outside fear(clown)

The movie is colourful..and few examples of those horror movies that happen in daylight
It's wonderful how relationship between the characters are obtained just by two three lines conversation
Ship is 'she' not 'he'..says Bill to his brother.
It's a fascinating film that masters every scene in a blend of all the strokes a filmmaker should have.

It's like The Goonies Accidentally Go to Hell, or Stand By Me Except Kiefer Sutherland Is An Ancient Evil Entity And Not Just A Punk. It loses a point because it's a remake and I can't say it's a 10/10 when someone else already made the thing, but realistically, there's nothing at all wrong with this movie.

614,tyer-06317,Stand By Me horror wannabe,5,29 October 2019,Horror version of 'Stand By Me'. It doesn't have a lot of scary scenes and no disturbing overall feel during the movie.

615,rexmagicman,"Beautifully produced horror film.....creepy, not scary",9,8 August 2021,"So, I'm going to start off with the fact that I read the book ions ago when it was first published, and it scared me beyond belief. Then, the miniseries came out with Tim Curry (who can do no wrong), and I was an instant fan. Then, I saw these versions in the theatre, each on opening weekend --- and, thought ""meh, they're okay, still not like the miniseries"". Not sure why that was, as you can tell that they spent a lot of money, they look great......but something felt like it was missing to me (and my friends thought the same thing as well -- we're all in our late 50s).So, in the last 4 months, I've figured it out, as I purchased both the Blu-rays, and for the first viewing, watched them back-to-back, and Eureka!! They are meant to be watched together, as ""one"", in one sitting --- not two separate movies, years apart (or even days, weeks or months apart). Watching them back-to-back, the story flows so much better, the tension and creep factor is far higher, and it's truly an enjoyable and memorable experience. It's a five-hour excursion, but is well worth it, if you can do it......the time actually goes by quicker in my mind doing it this way......did it for a second time already, this weekend, and am so impressed. The entire cast is incredible, both the young and the older actors (they did such a great job of selecting the adults who would portray the younger kids, truly believable in every way), and Bill Skarsgard is beyond frightening as ""It"". The ending has a much stronger impact......I've shed tears both times now that I've watched them as one continuous film when the end approaches......so emotional. Everything about this works, it's very well filmed, again the acting is top-notch by all, the effects for the most part incredible, and the score beautiful/haunting. A sumptuous, wonderful epic ""horror experience"".......not scary, but definitely creepy......super-creepy, and ultra-creepy in parts. Watching them together brings the same amazing ""epic"" feel reading the book gave you -- watching them separately doesn't provide that same experience at all.I'll be giving the same review on Part 2 --- the only reason I'm giving each a 9 1/2 instead of a 10, is that some of the effects just don't work for me, mainly the dinner scene at the Chinese restaurant. Originally, separately I would have given the 1st part a 7, and the 2nd part a 6 1/2, but watching them together, as one film without a break --- I give them both a 9 1/2. I honestly can't wait to watch it again this way, for my 3rd time.",It
616,georgewhittingham1,Hilarious - not a real Horror?,7,11 September 2019,"First thing to declare is that I've never seen the original, though it is in my watch list!I thought I'd start reviewing this within my first 10 minutes of watching it. We meet Pennywise the Dancing Clown almost instantly, hiding down a sewer bidding a young boy over. Now because of this, the tension and almost entire aspect of horror felt non existent. You're more scared of what you can't see, that slow progression as to what the monster is.We then spend the next 30 minutes meeting our young characters, their bullies and local area - it's very clear they're the social outcasts. We also bump into Pennywise along the way, scaring different children in various fun ways. I would add I'm so far not impressed by the acting but the film seems adequate, if not slightly B gradey? Maybe I'm a little harsh.As the film progresses, the brother of the child whose gone missing and his friends continue a search to find him.I won't spoil the rest of the film, but I was pleasantly surprised? At the very least it was enjoyable, with some fun scenes of Pennywise scaring and chasing in his imaginative way. Overall, 7/10.",It
617,ralo229,Not Bad. Not Bad at All,6,8 September 2017,"Unpopular opinion that will likely result in you guys sicking your dogs on me: I don't like the original It mini-series. I honestly don't. Do I hate it? No. I think the child actors did an okay job for what they're given and there are a couple decent scares here and there, but maybe it's just me, but I found it damn near impossible to take seriously. Most of the scares just bordered on unintentional comedy for me (I still find myself cracking up at the ""Kiss me, Fatboy"" line) and here's another unpopular opinion that will likely result in me getting killed or maimed: I didn't like Tim Curry's Pennywise. Don't get me wrong, I like Tim Curry, but he came off as more funny than he did scary or intimidating which probably isn't a good sign if you're doing a balls-to-the- wall horror film. Maybe the film was terrifying at the time it came out, but nowadays it's just really corny and dated. I don't think it holds up nearly as well as people say it does. But enough bashing of the original. How does the new film hold up?Honestly, I think it's a marked improvement. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws because it does. Its biggest issue is that it can be over-reliant on jump scares at times and I can't help but feel that was because the studio felt the need to try to appeal to basic movie-goers who consider a horror film sucky if it doesn't make them jump out of their seat at least once or twice. But to be fair, most of the jump scares are at least being used to utilize something we as the audience are supposed to be afraid of and they do manage to stir in a few clever and ballsy scares in there too. Hell, there's one scare in the first five minutes of the film that I'm surprised they even attempted. I won't spoil it for you, but it's pretty shocking to say the least. So I guess you can say, it appeals to both audiences in a way. It definitely feels a lot more like a horror film than the original did.Most of the performances were pretty good for the most part. Most the child actors did a pretty good job, the two best probably being Bev and the kid from Stranger Things. The only performance that didn't really work was the kid playing Stan. His performance was pretty iffy and I didn't really buy it at all. But good child acting is a rarity, so it is a pretty impressive feat that only one of the actors isn't very good as opposed to all of them. The kids themselves had pretty good chemistry as well and I had no problem believing the legitimacy of their friendship. But the scene stealer by far is Bill Skaarsgaard as Pennywise. Sure, he could be funny at times, but not once did I ever forget that he was also supposed to be scary and a legitimate threat. He managed to find a good balance unlike Tim Curry whose performance was so over-the-top, that I forgot that he was even supposed to be threatening.Some of the side characters were a little underdeveloped, but they at least had a lot more character in this film than they did in the mini-series. Henry Bowers was a little more than just a generic bully and Mike was more than just the token black kid who shows up randomly near the end of Part 1. They could be developed a lot more, sure, but there's at least SOME character there.So all in all, while I don't think it's anywhere close to being one of the best Stephen King movies, it's still an enjoyable film. It's creepy, it's funny, it's energetic, and it's effective. I see myself watching this version again a lot more than I do the Tim Curry version. From what I understand, they're making a second film about the adulthood portion. While even fans of the book and mini-series seem to agree that the adulthood portions aren't that great, I am curious to see how these filmmakers pull it off. They surprised me with this film, didn't they? So you bet, I'll be back for the sequel.",It

I was an still am, a huge fan of the 1990 original and that being saif, I am curious to know what drugs people on wee when they said this was a good scary movie?
It was a yawn-fest with so much detail removed or changed it irritated rather than scared me.

Let's just be honest. This one exceeds the original on every level. Not even close. This is the best horror film of 2017, and the best horror remake to date.It's ""shape-shifting"" is genuinely scary in this one, as opposed to downright corny in the mini-series.It was much bloodier than I expected. Perfectly cast. I wish we got a little bit more backstory from the Jewish kid. The rest of the characters were developed well.Creepy adults. Very nightmarish. I loved it. Best horror flick since 'It Follows'.",It
620,MovieSoup,"IT floats.....okay...done that dumb joke, lets review!!",7,11 September 2017,"I do not go out of my way to watch horror films. I scare easily for one thing and I HATE jump scares which all horror movies seem to have. Jump scares are just lazy tools to make a film scary by having a sudden, violent thing happen to a dumb character and just making the music louder to provoke a reaction. Having a monster or character that is actually scary and has menace to him/her is much more enjoyable to watch and infinitely scarier. This film delivers that but still has jump scares in IT.I can sum up IT by saying that IT is just a scary version of the Goonies without pirates, retarded strongmen named sloth and treasure. That is not such a bad thing but I just could not shake this impression and it took me out of the film a little bit, especially whenever the fat kid was involved. I just couldn't help thinking ""sloth love chunk"" whenever he was there.Okay I have talked about the bad parts, of which there are few, let's talk about the good. This film has very good pacing for starters. Most films have scenes that are filler and serve no purpose whereas all the scenes in IT help with plot and character development. The editing is good with no shaky cam going on when there are chase scenes which is my pet peeve. What is the point of having shake cam in scary scenes or chase scenes??? But luckily this film doesn't do that and that adds to feeling of dread when pennywise is coming straight for you.The music is very well mixed with the climactic parts being well complemented by music that ups the intensity of the scene and allows the audience to feel the appropriate emotion. As well as score music there is also use of pop music which sets the time of this film (late 1980's) quite well. The plot is like any other horror plot and follows some conventions like a haunted house or things being hidden in basements but these things are a given in horror films. The film surprised me by having most violent happenings take place during the day and sometimes in the open. Because there is another chapter for this movie already being produced it might be that we learn more about Pennywise and what is he and why does he do these things. It was not explained in this first chapter but that is to be expected I suppose. The characters are very well played by the child actors, each giving 100% and looking genuinely scared and not breaking character. Child actors are always a mixed bag; some can be great, some can destroy a movie totally. In this film you can tell that they all cared, yes there are some fake crying scenes by some of the cast and this is not great but I usually don't expect much from child actors so this did not ruin my experience. Not only is the acting good, the character development is good. In the space of this film we see all the kids start to grow up, take on a bigger responsibility and fight their own demons. Beverly Marsh in particular starts off as the social outcast but ends up being a hero of the moment and shows great courage in adversity.With a good plot and some great, scary scenes this film will give me nightmares but like I said I scare easily anyway. This film, for me, is let down by the jump scares which are cheap and the Goonies vibe I got from it. Everything else was pretty good and I would say watch it if you are or aren't a King fan. It is for everyoneexcept people under 15. Because of laws and stuff.",It

623,Imaculata,Does a much better job at the suspense and characters,9,5 October 2017,"When reviewing this film, it is almost impossible to ignore the older TV movie that came before it. While I greatly enjoyed Tim Curry's portrayal of the killer clown, the TV movie hasn't endured the test of time well. The TV movie was not without its flaws; most notably in the special effects, acting and the actual horror. So it is great to see another director have a go at translating the source material to the screen. Personally I feel that whenever a movie is remade, something new has to be added, or something needs to be improved over the original. I am happy to say that this is definitely the case with this remake.The 2017 version of It immediately distances itself from the TV movie, by being a lot more violent regarding how Georgie dies. It mostly follows the same beats as the TV movie, but I feel it is more successful in fleshing out the characters (especially the children) and in setting the stakes. It is also a lot more suspenseful, and manages to more effectively communicate the effects that ""It"" has on the town itself, and not just on the children.It has quite a lot of jump scares, but several are really well done. I was fortunate enough to view this movie with an audience that was susceptible to It's scares, which always makes a horror movie a lot more enjoyable to watch. It is great to see the entire audience jump and scream simultaneously, and be thoroughly invested in the movie.That said, I do feel that Tim Curry was a better clown. Curry's performance was more nuanced and realistic, like an actual adult that preys on innocent children. Whereas in this new rendition, the clown is perhaps the least frightening thing in the movie. Curry felt more like an actual threat, whereas the clown in this version mostly just flails his arms a lot, while running at the children, and not doing much else. This undermines the suspense a bit, because it feels like the clown is holding its punches throughout the movie. And the final confrontation with the clown made the clown even less threatening. I'm also not a fan of the clown's new design. It now looks like an obvious scary clown, that is trying too hard to be scary. While Curry's clown looked like a regular clown at first glance, which I ultimately find a lot more scary. But in other areas I was pleasantly surprised with the visual design. The sets are gorgeous and convincing, the clown's transformations do look creepy, and benefit a lot from modern visual effects. I also love that we got a whole different take on It's deadlights (although not called out as such during the film). But the story has two parts of course. And so it remains to be seen if the second movie will be just as good. With the TV movie, when it came to the part with the adults, the acting was pretty terrible. And the ending was greatly undermined by the limited effects of that time. That part is left for a sequel with the 2017 version, which I think is a good choice. It will leave them more time to flesh out the adults, and build a more coherent ending to a story that truth be told is all over the place. But will they be able to get us just as invested in the stuff with the adults, as they did with the children? I guess we'll have to wait and see when the second movie comes out.",It

625,darthMisaskernew,Crazy scary funny awesome!,9,12 October 2017,"I've seen It 4 times in theaters and it's excellent. However, I must say that the film doesn't really do justice as a flatout horror film, but as a fun horror-ish retro classic, in the same way that Tremors and Ghostbusters are great horror films but not because of the horror elements. I'd say It is a lot more fun than it is scary, but the scares make the film more fun and entertaining instead of chilling and haunting. I thought Pennywise wasn't scary at all. Tim Curry was much scarier because he acted like a real clown, and he gained your trust with his humor before killing you. Here, Pennywise is obviously very creepy and talks like he just ate a solid meth brick before each scene, and it's too obvious for me. It would've been much scarier had he just cracked jokes. But it's cool. I thought the hunky Swedish supermodel they hired to play a demonic space clown would've been awful, but he's pretty good. Tim Curry is much better as Pennywise though, but I liked this guy a billion times more than I thought I would. The cinematography is amazing in this film and I liked all of the child characters a lot. They were all very funny, likable, and entertaining, and it's a shame the next film wont follow them. The CGI was surprisingly good to, like Oscar nom good. The soundtrack has songs by Anthrax and Overkill which is super neat! Oh, and the GORE is fantastic, like it was flat out awesome! But most of all, the film is very fun. People expecting a genuine horror film may be disappointed, but this isn't a comedy either. It's very unique in the way that the film is serious, but not too serious and pretty self-aware, making it seem more fun and enjoyable. Overall I'm very much in love with this movie and I may see it a few more times in theaters. It's bound to be a modern horror classic!",It
626,rightkeith,Decent Amount of Nightmare Fuel,6,13 September 2017,"As a non-reader of the book and a non-viewer of the previous theatrical version of IT, I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. And yet, it somehow was exactly what I expected. The positives of IT- For a child of the 80's, this film is filled to the brim with nostalgia. The settings were perfect for the time period. Movie signs, posters in kid's bedrooms, and clothing were all enjoyably accurate. The bright spot of the show are the childhood bonds developed smartly on screen between this rag tag group of ""losers"". The characters are real, have depth, and it was easy to feel an emotional connection. The file does a good job of flipping between sentimental coming-of-age flick to scare your pants off horror in the blink of an eye. The movie had plenty of laughs and fulfilled one of my major requirements for being able to enjoy a horror- I knew when it was time to be scared and knew when it was time to not. Nothing's more stressful to me than seeing a horror movie that is non-stop anxiety about a jump-out moment. IT is very easy to enjoy during the ""happy"" times, and almost always lets you know when it's time to hunker down in your seat for some nightmare fuel. Visually beautiful, well directed and shot, and of course plenty of white knuckle scary clown scenes. Sophia Lillis was an unknown to me and her performance stole the show.The negatives of IT- IT falls into the same trap as most horror movies of trying to resolve a scatterbrained plot line whilst scaring the crap out of its audience. I felt like if I had read the book I'd have been greatly disappointed in the effort to explain the history of why what was happening was happening. Sure the kids discover some things along the way, but at no point whatsoever was the subject of WHY this was happening ever breached. In typical horror fashion, main characters make decisions that no rational human being would ever make, and every adult or figure of authority is either oblivious or absent. The humor was good for a while, but Finn Wolfhard's character (Richie) was basically there only for comic relief and was a bit overdone.Overall I had a good time watching IT. The entire theater was engaged and made it a fun experience. 6/10",It

Unfortunately, this rendition doesn't hit the mark by a long shot and it overstays its welcome at a whopping two hours. Certainly the special effects have improved as it to be expected and there are a few scares here and there but the kids characters bar the girl and the stuttering boy are all quite obnoxious and misses the humour mark by a long shot. There's even an 80s montage scene when they're cleaning the blood. It's just not worthy of all the praise and hoopla it got when it came out - I'm glad I watched on Netflix and didn't go to the cinema to see it. And for the love of God, STOP with the children singing and doing the nursery rhyme thing. It may have worked with Freddy Krueger but it stopped being scary a long time ago.",It
630,trpnallday,A stupid waste of time and money,2,12 September 2017,"The updated effects helped to keep me awake through the movie, but they weren't enough to make it scary, because the effects were only used for jump scares. The only part that was remotely scary was the scenes with the crazy mom of one of the kids and the scenes with another kid's creepy dad.The clown demon wasn't that scary. The closest it came to being scary was the scene from the trailer where it pops out of the projector screen ala Ringu. It was slightly scary because it made it clear that the demon knew who the kids were, where they were, and what they were doing.I strongly advise against seeing this movie because nearly everything in it is sooooooooo stupid! The town has been plagued by a murdering demon and also huge catasrophes that nearly wipe out the town and are probably also caused by the demon for hundreds of years and yet there is still a town. No one left??The town doesn't seem to care that there are gangs of psychotic kids roving around constantly butchering other people! There are rapes happening in the street in broad daylight and there is no reaction from anyone and somehow there is still a town. Just over the course of the movie, tons of people are killed or at least go missing and there is no reaction from the town other than a couple of missing posters. The police never become involved and there's no FBI presence!There are also no consequences for the main kids either. The kids execute a fellow kid and leave his body in the sewer and the girl bludgeoned her dad to death and yet it is never even mentioned again and she just goes to live with her aunt. WTF?Even after the demon is defeated and the kids rescue the people who had been taken, they only try to revive the main girl and they don't tell anyone in the town about it so presumably there's no investigation and the hundreds of bodies are just left in the sewer to rot... Just to give you an idea of how horribly pathetic this movie is, the boys ""wake"" the girl by giving her a steamy kiss...The movie is also inconsistent with it's portrayal of the demon! On several occasions, the movie unequivocally states that it lives off people's fear, but then why does it kill and eat people? Also if it just needs fear, then wouldn't killing it's victims be counter productive? On the other hand, if it needs physical sustenance, then what's the point of the whole fear thing? Why wouldn't it just snatch prey and eat it like a beast? Also why does it look like a clown and why do it's victims float? This is treated like a huge issue as it is referenced throughout the film and yet neither point is ever explained!Rather the kids say that it seems to show each person the thing that that person fears the most and yet despite that exposition it still appears as a clown to each of the kids!",It

632,pyenme,Still waiting for something to happen,1,15 July 2018,"I am not typically a fan of Stephen King movies, at least not the ones designed to be ""scary"" over the more thoughtful ones (like The Green Mile). I had seen the older version of ""It"" and thought it was at least creepy with Pennywise, and had the psychological part with the adults coming home to face their past. So, I went into this one (with all the hype that came before it) thinking it would be an updated scarier, creepier, more thought-provoking version. Boy, was I wrong. This movie was kind of boring. Not very creepy - especially after all the anticipation of the new Pennywise - he was almost laughable in some scenes. I can't say I jumped even once out of surprise, which I expected I would. I knew what was going to happen ahead of time more than a few times. The kids were fine with the material they had to work with. I kept looking at my watch, waiting for the adult portion of the movie, when they come back and face the past - but turned out that is a sequel. Maybe that one will be better now that the plot is set up? I don't have high hopes.",It
633,Flippitygibbit,Overegging the pudding,4,16 September 2017,"I fell for the hype, at least enough to pay for cinema tickets instead of waiting for the DVD, so I thought I should add my voice to the less than glowing reviews of this film. This is not a groundbreaking new version of Stephen King's novel, merely a big screen translation for a new generation. That's not a bad thing - if you're the target demographic and think that jump scares and CGI maketh a horror film, you won't be disappointed. But if, like me, you're interested in a new interpretation of the story, then prepare to be distinctly underwhelmed. This take isn't a faithful adaptation, and the plot gets left behind for a series of nightmare scenes which don't even provide a sense of the characters or the setting when connected. Leaving behind the 1950s for the 1980s is also a mistake, because the children in King's story are possessed of the right amount of innocence to believe that a monster can be defeated with 'battery acid' from an inhaler or silver bullets. And even the 1980s are short-changed - retro t-shirts and the odd movie poster are not enough to instil a sense of time and place.For all the fuss about the 'child orgy' scene in the novel, I feel that this 'reimagining' actually sexualises the children as much or more than King - the Losers club spend an afternoon swimming in a quarry, stripped down to their underwear, with the boys gawping at Beverly's underdeveloped chest. She is also given a reputation at school and a (single) father with an unhealthy interest in her, and instead of leading the group into the sewers with her slingshot, Beverly becomes a victim to be rescued by the boys - with a kiss! So dressing the character in boho dresses and cutting her hair doesn't make 2017 Beverly a stronger role model, in my eyes. At least King's Beverly is in control of her life and her body.Mike Hanlon is also reduced from the narrator and lynchpin of the original story, collecting the history of the town and gathering the adults for a final showdown, to a token black character. I didn't get a true sense of any of the characters' personalities, to be truthful - only the Jewish boy, the Black kid, the Girl, the Fat Kid, the Hypochondriac. Richie is not even very funny. Pennywise is also reduced to blurry CGI - that weird shuffling run at the camera soon gets old - and Halloween costuming. Pennywise is not meant to look like Annabelle's big brother, he's supposed to entice children to him by being colourful and cheerful - at first. Pennywise is evil embodied in a creepy clown, he's not supposed to be considered 'cute' or 'hot', but casting baby-faced Bill Skarsgard for this 15 certificate remake was obviously a stroke of marketing genius.The Muschietti's take on King's novel is a derivative mess, drawing on Stand By Me and E.T. for the kids and horror films like Annabelle, Insidious and even Nightmare on Elm Street (the bathroom scene, with the geysers of blood?) for the cheap scares. If IT was a classic novel studied in school, I would recommend the 1990 miniseries for students who want to cheat and skip the book. This version gives no sense of the story, and only brief sketches of the characters.",It
634,juan-hb,Disapointing,5,18 October 2019,"The first 10 minutes were very promising, basically until the boy disappears down the drain. From then on the movie starts to lose gas. Too long, not scary, could easily do with 20 less minutes. It's watchable but this is not classic or scary.",It
635,drawnsupreme,It caught me by surprise.,8,23 January 2018,"This was a great film. The performances were very good by each and every single cast member and the story felt new and refreshing.Some parts of the movie were highly suspenseful, making me very curious to see what would happen next. The director (and crew) did a great job building suspense and making the audience feel curious, keeping us glued to our seats as we watch in anticipation.My only gripe was that the 'jump scares' were a little overdone (which is so common with horror movies nowadays; these never scare me and I find these types of scenes annoying, especially when it's overused). In addition, some of the CGI effects didn't look believable or well-polished. They could have definitely improved on this.Over all, I highly enjoyed the film and I look forward to the sequel.",It

637,rolfesam,IT is What Stephen King Deserved,8,11 October 2017,"IT is a 2017 horror movie from director Andy Muschietti and it was actually pretty great in my opinion. Everyone involved in this film really deserves props for even getting an adaptation of Steven King's famously lengthy 1986 novel of the same name, let alone producing something as well made as this movie turned out to be. The film makers wisely chose to forgo the segments of the book that happen during the main cast's adulthood to focus on their childhoods. This could have turned out poorly as child actors have the stigma of being bad actors and having the entire main cast be comprised of teens under 18 years old could have backfired. Thankfully the entire cast of kids gave a very well acted performance with the only real exception being the actor who played Ben who's performance was simply ""good enough"".Of course I would be remiss if I failed to mention Bill Skarsgård who really brought new life the role that manages to both stay true to the character while making it distinct from Tim Curry's famous 1990 performance of the character. I feel like he made a great monster for the movie and really has some great scenes where I was genuinely impressed by what he did with his performance. The director is also someone that I want to briefly touch on. Andy Muschietti really showed what he could do given a proper budget and it really surprised me. He was able to get a lot of really good performances out of his cast as well as making the mid 1980's town feel real and lived in. I've got to say though there were a few moments that really stuck out where I questioned his intentions, the most memorable would be the boys to men poster moment when he played a clip of the groups music that was jarring. Overall though I am more than impressed by Muschietti and I can't wait to see what he does with the sequel and with his adaptation of Shadow of the Colossus. Overall this is a flawed movie, but so are the best horror movies. There is no doubt though that the movie is scary, thrilling, and all around a really good watch. This definitely gets added to the positive list of Steven King movies and manages to avoid joining the loser pile.",It
638,taranpannu01,IT (2017),8,16 September 2017,"Going into this film with previous expectations of the book and original television mini-series this certainly had a bar to reach. Whilst few of the cons can be considered major, the pros are incredibly overpowering and the cons will soon be deemed irrelevant.CONS -The CGI is the most obvious con, in some scenes Bill Skarsgard is completely rendered and any terror that he had in previous scenes has been thrown out of the window. He didn't need to have any special effects in my opinion and would've been more effective if Skarsgard's performance was the main focus.Some of the dodgy CGI also makes some of the children's fears completely non frightening as well as the fact the camera lingers on them for way too long. Subtle cinematography would've been much more effective here.The ending also had me quite conflicted, whilst the idea of bashing Pennywise was fun in the moment, I felt the filmmakers led the audience away from the whole idea of ""sticking together"" and just had the children completely kick the shi* out of Pennywise, which was alright but more emphasis on the themes would've been nice.PROS -The opening is absolutely brilliant (if only it wasn't for that CGI face)The performances are fuc*ing brilliant. Standouts being all The Loser's Club. Jaeden Lieberher is fantastic as our main whilst Jeremy Ray Taylor brings such heart to his role. Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer are also completely believable and were among my favourites. Chosen Jacobs also brought an amazingly mature performance although he was vastly underused in my opinion. Wyatt Oleff drew the short straw for me and was overshadowed by his peers. Stephen Boagert and Nicholas Hamilton brought great supporting characters to life.Bill Skarsgard is brilliant when his face isn't being butchered by dodgy CGI, his voice and dribbling were genuinely creepy. The one use of good special effects was that fridge scene. Easily his most terrifying scene is when he creeps up on Bev, I will admit that I jumped.Atmosphere was great as was the cinematography. Andy Muschietti and the rest of his team should be brought back for the sequel!This film does bring a beautiful coming of age story to life more then a fully fledged horror, the children are absolutely brilliant and there is a lot of heart within this. The references are amazing as is the humour. There are some amazing little scenes that play out very nicely that I will leave you to experience for yourself.Overall this film does lack the scares but has plenty of heart and incredible performances across the board to keep your interest. Props to Bill Skarsgard for his performances which brilliantly challenges Tim Curry's but the children should be given the highest of praise due to their mature, emotional, humorous and above all heartfelt performances. I'm already planning a fan cast for Part Two!",It
639,kirpo-kakkonen,"The Old version, even made for TV, was way better...",2,9 October 2017,"This new one, started out well. For the first ""kill"". After that, a steep downhill into boredom. I felt the originality and surprising with chill moments, were all wasted. The best part of the movie, some really good young actors. The adults were more or less just repeating clichés.Including the Clown. Some special effects were quite well done.

Now, just does not deliver.",It
640,CriticalRaccoon,A well made horror film that oozes dread...pity it wasn't scary,7,21 March 2019,"In a sentence I never thought I'd write: I'm glad Hollywood remade a Stephen King adaptation.Well, to be fair, the previous adaptation was a TV Movie and this is Part 1 of a theatrical adaptation...but I still hold my point firmly.It (2017) is a miracle. It (2017) takes what is an already well known tale in modern American horror and does justice to it while also offering a different perspective than what we already have seen before. Directed by Andy Muschietti (Mama), It (2017) is a radically updated version of the story that keeps the essence but makes it feel much more real. While not the best Stephen King adaptation ever, It (2017) holds a special place in modern cinema: the film that made it cool to like Stephen King again after a long list of failures. It (2017) broke records, when just a month prior Stephen King's Dark Tower underwhelmed.I'm not sure I really need to give a plot synopsis of It (2017) considering it is insanely well known but I'll do so because they did update it a tad. In 1988 the malevolent supernatural force known as It/Pennywise has started to prey upon the children of Derry, Maine - transforming into their worst fears and then feeding off them for nourishment (for sake of clarity I'm calling It by his Pennywise persona for the rest of this review). A group of young teens known as the ""Loser's Club"" band together to stop Pennywise after he terrorized them each individually-lead by Bill, a boy whose younger brother was previously taken by Pennywise. Will the kids face their own fears, become stronger and manage to stop Pennywise? Well, there's a sequel starring older versions of the kids so your guess is as good as mine.Just to preempt this: if you hate Stephen King tropes you will hate this film. It (2017) hits on a lot of them: sympathetic ""loser"" characters being the leads, one-dimensional over-the-top bully, alcoholic antagonist, sexual abuse subplot (maybe even incestuous), taking place in Maine, unexplained supernatural villain, hero character that likes to write, etc, etc. And yes, they didn't include the underage sewer gangbang scene from the book...thank god.In another sentence I never thought I'd write out: the child actors in this film are fantastic. Child actors tend to be about two-thirds terrible, but here in It (2017) they are all great in their roles. Unlike most ""kid"" roles It (2017) actually seems realistic to how kids would actually act - including swearing and getting turned on by a girl in her underwear (yay this film somehow being allowed to be R-rated by the studio!). To me the standouts are Jaeden Lieberher as Bill and Sophia Lillis as Beverly-though I admit that might be because we spend the most time with them. Lieberher gives Bill a very human performance rather than being as one-note as some of the other Losers. I'll be honest here, at times I thought Sophia Lillis was secretly a 20 year old playing a teen because her emotional acting abilities are far beyond her years, especially Lillis' eyes. Bonus points to Lillis for the ""blood scene"" because holy crap. All the rest of the Losers are good though they do suffer from a lack of screen time compared to our two leads.No matter how great the child actors are the real star that people came to see is Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise. In the original It TV miniseries Tim Curry played Pennywise as some sort of exuberant comedic psychopath and was the real highlight of the show. Bill Skarsgård plays Pennywise much differently; a terrifying and cocky embodiment of some supernatural force that knows it is basically unstoppable and enjoys the game he's playing. Pennywise is now far less funny, and more creepy. It's a good alternate take on the character that fits perfectly well with this movie's bleaker tone.The thing that sets It (2017) apart from a lot of horror movies-especially those that star children-is its looming sense of darkness throughout. The characters are fun but they are stuck in a world that seems antagonistic towards them. Derry is not a happy town, and somehow a killer clown doesn't seem out of place. The kids all suffer from stuff in their personal life, and Pennywise just seems like icing on the cake. That is not to say the film is without moments of levity because at times there can be very odd tonal whiplash; usually involving an 80s-gasm such as the rock-fight scene or a flippin' cleaning montage. When it doesn't attempt to make you laugh It (2017) evokes dread whenever it pleases in almost all aspects of its production. It's just sad that It (2017) does often fail to be scary.The backbreaking fault I have with It (2017) as a horror movie is the formula it follows in how it tries to chill you to the bone. I don't know why Andy Muschietti decided to make all of the main scares follow the same format but maybe that was in the book and he was stuck with it. The basic gist of most of It (2017)'s scares is this: a kid is alone and sees something or is led into an isolated space, something creepy shows up for a minute and then a big music boom alerts us we are supposed to be afraid, kid gets chased or terrified for a few seconds, kid escapes or an adult shows up to break the illusion, rinse and repeat. Oh, and most of that alarm is started by a jump scare; actually there are a lot of jump scares in It (2017) for some reason. Pennywise shows up way too much and it does neuter his power when he always narrowly misses slaughtering our heroes even though he takes everyone else within a couple of minutes. Yes I know Pennywise feeds on fear, but he took Georgie and others real quick. The bully subplot doesn't really evoke any fright other than the fact they are hilariously over-the-top to the point of comedy. Maybe if you are the type that is afraid of creepy images It (2017) might frighten you as it does have tons of them, but it relies a lot on personal fears rather than trying to create a sense of suspense. Following a formula so rigidly makes It (2017) too predictable; it's hard to be afraid when you can see what's coming up next. I hate to say it but It (2017) just doesn't evoke any dread in me...other than one specific part.The one legitimately creepy part of It (2017) has to do with Beverly and her father. This subplot will get under your skin in ways Pennywise never could. Sorry Pennywise, but I find the concept of being stuck living with a real life monster as far more disturbing.It (2017) is a wonderfully made adaptation that feels fresh even though it's of one of the most well-known works in modern western horror. Solid performances and a haunting atmosphere make It (2017) an easy film to like, even if it doesn't quite work for those looking for fright. The upcoming sequel will have large boots to fill, though judging from the cast Andy Muschietti is going to get every opportunity to knock it out of the park. Oh, and something something they all float.",It
641,Yee_Reviews,A Coming of Age film with a terrifyingly playful Dancing Clown,9,8 September 2017,"Good: Right from the beginning, the movie grips you and proves to be a promising horror movie. The cast all-around are excellent and have great chemistry together. The movie zones in on the adolescents and creates feelings and emotions for the main characters, while also telling the story of their daily life conflicts. The conversations the characters have also provide comedic moments sprinkled throughout the movie. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is amazing and acts in such a creepy and effective way to convey a clown we can all fear. In the beginning, the movie does not rely on jump scares; instead it goes for a creepy and unsettling tone with its ominous imagery. The horror elements are well done, thanks to director Andy Muschietti. Also the cinematography does a great job of having an 80s vibe and pays homage to old-school horror. Bad: At times the pacing is slow and can drag on a bit even in the horror parts. The children's conflicts with fear can get repetitive as it has the need to show all 7 of them dealing with Pennywise and not technically moving the story along with all of them. When CGI was needed for Pennywise it came as a distraction and had a shaky cam look. As the film draws to an end the scenes tend to be less effective and drag on as it creeps its way to the climax.Overall: This movie is excellent with a great cast that has to band together and discover ways to resolve each other's conflicts. ""It"" satisfies the ""Stranger Things"" crave and even gets a little more out of its clown antagonist. ""It"" is definitely worth the watch in a theater as you can appreciate the coming-of-age and horror aspects mixed together.4.3/5",It

643,thesandfly77,Beautifully Balanced Vision Of A Classic,8,17 September 2017,"First - this review is not of the remedial variety; the classic numbnut 'It didunt scayer me as a munched mu popcurn'.There's a ton of them out there sapping my will to live.I've read the book on three occasions since 1987. The 1990 mini-series was a frustrating, strangled attempt to get IT onto some kind of live action format. Memorable, yes - and only - for Tim Curry's Pennywise.Stephen King unwittingly created a cultural landmark, and did more to demonise clowns than John Wayne Gacy.My heart sank when this reboot of IT was announced. How do you present a consumable version of a tale so embedded in cultural subconscious, a villainous killer-clown theme so worn by terrible Z-movie clichés? How do you engage indifferent VOD generations who have seen it all, or at least believe they have? Who have experienced every trick in the cinematic horror-book? Well, you get as clever as Andy Muschetti and his production team and you build it from the solid foundations-up.They got back to the classic tale; took the spirit of the book and made sure it's prevalent in every scene, even in the new added invention that throws us some original, beautifully constructed moments.And right the way through we got raucous adventure, grisly horror, tension, and tragedy.You're never a few moments away from being reminded this is a tale that revolves around the loss of a murdered little brother, and a dark history of smalltown evil. There's a gravity to the story that grounds it constantly, and also makes it more compelling because this is the everyday evil you just didn't notice...You're also never more than moments away from laughing out loud or gritting your teeth, or a shiver running down the spine.The balance is great.My only contention - the running time. But that's restricted by budget and studio expectations. There's so much more they could have told but what they did for 2 hours 10 minutes and $35 million is remarkable, particularly to a long-time fan of the epic novel.Pennywise - well, terrific. More villain than vaudeville, more sinister than silly. Bill Skaarsgard will be very popular at his family's children's birthday parties in the years to come. Or maybe not...I loved this incarnation of the killer clown as opposed to Curry's; as much a Heath Ledger Joker to Nicholson's. Captivating, and both amusing and horrific.Overall, IT is more thrilling than frightening, and that's no bad thing; there are dimensions to this film that elevate it above the worn tropes of desperate 'horror' directors.You could say IT floats.I cannot wait to see the second chapter; I expect the adult timeline to be very, very dark indeed compared to this hugely entertaining Goonies v Kruger romp.8/10",It

I will not say that I did not like it at all, but just my expectations were confirmed. This film is from the category of ""horror 90"". For me, they are such that it is very difficult to scare, in General, as a children's horror stories or something. Although most shooting no claims as to the performance of the actors - all very worthy and truthfully, there's just no moments that tickle the nerves.
The plot revolves around a small town with a strange, as it turned out later, the story. Here every 27 years there are mass disappearances of children and no one knows what's wrong. Here a group of boys 10 years of age and trying to find the tips and edges of this story - after all, summer what to do with the kids?

The scenes depicted in the trailer are not the only scary or climatic parts of the film either and are cut well to misdirect what the viewer expects to happen. This a full steam ahead something(Pennywise) wants to catch you and kill you suspense horror film. The psychological horror aspect is present as the antagonist preys on the characters fears of course but that is all.In recent years successful horror films have succeeded in a welcome misdirection from jump scares and building on the viewers anxiety. Well crafted tales like Conjuring, The Ring and Insidious all excellent horror films are examples of this. It(2017) is an excellent horror film but in another manner. There is the psychological horror but more than that it is a welcome return to one of the genres most beloved and terrifying themes the boogeyman. A boogeyman that above all else just wants to capture and kill kids. Just explaining this sounds frightening.I enjoyed the It miniseries from years back and for a TV movie it was achieved in retelling the novel in dramatic fashion. This film tells the master of horrors story in horrific fashion. Myself and the group I saw this with all enjoyed IT and had no negative feelings whatsoever.My rating of 8 out of 10 could without question be higher if not for issues with the audience in the theater. Half way through the film I had to exit the theater and report to management the few rotten apples ruining the film by talking through most of the film.*Note* I missed a crucial part of the middle act as it is intolerable and impossible to enjoy a film with private conversations being carried on in the theater. I strongly urge fellow film goer's if this happens do not endure this or confront the ignorant party disturbing the film.Confrontations just make more disturbances simply go to the box office and demand a refund.

650,salmon62,Don't believe the Hype! Really bad movie given the budget and talent,1,27 January 2018,"I'm done believing the hype and fake reviews coming out of Hollywood. This movie had a huge movement behind it of polished previews, reviews from ""professional"" critics, and teasing trailers.
The result? A completely disappointing movie with no pacing, no continuity, questionable plot, and inappropriate content for the youth market who at the time of release was obsessed with the inane ""creepy clown"" phenomenon.
I would like my money back!
The children in the movie, and the young people who were fascinated to watch this film were exposed to completely inappropriate imagery that is gratuitous and does nothing to build fear or tension or empathy or investment in the film.
It seems that ""It"" is simply a succession of scenes that are supposed to comprise a horror movie, but actually it's only a contrived, overwrought mixture of cliched children and CGI characters.
No recent movie has been more hyped with less enjoyment than ""It"".The hype and fake positive reviews for this movie are totally dishonest.",It

I found it genuinely freaky when I was young, but now the original is laughable. This is a genuinely freaky film on every level, and is tense throughout with completely believable and wonderful performances bar none. If more the haters who review badly for shoddy reasons... There are some awful horror movies of recent years, but this is a complete standout. This and the recent Evil Dead are the only modern remakes that genuinely outweighs the original and prove that sometimes updating does work. Carrie & The Omen should have been left alone.",It

I've never seen Stranger Things but I've heard from people who have that ""It"" has Stranger Things vibes.Apart from that there's not much else to say about this film other than it's great, I wish I have seen this one in theaters I did catch the sequel in IMAX though when it was released.Great cinematography, great acting, great casting, the score was phenomenal very eerie and spooky.

654,ashturner-79373,"A spooky rollercoaster ride, but not a very coherent movie.",5,3 September 2019,"After the fantastic opening sequence in which Georgie meets Pennywise in the sewer, has his arm bitten off and is dragged away bleeding and screaming, this film goes downhill. Just like ""Insidious"" (2010), ""The Conjuring"" (2013) and any number of recent supernatural horror movies, the plot here feels like a series of disconnected spooky set-pieces with no real progression - the only real direction the plot goes is from beginning to middle to end, but everything inbetween is just spooks.Admittedly the scares are quite good at times, as they usually feel tailored towards their specific character or situation (Bev is attacked by her own hair which she cut off and nearly drowned in blood, symbolic of menstruation, for example). Pennywise himself is kinda creepy-looking thanks to some of the contortions his body ends up in and the way one of his eyes is almost always looking right at the audience, but he shows up too often - instead of staying in eerier forms like Georgie or the headless kid in the library, he quickly turns back into a stupid clown, and that's just not scary to me. It doesn't help that his voice sounds like Scooby-Doo.The performances aren't really that great, aside from Jaeden Lieberher as Bill and Sophia Lillis as Bev - the other kids are either uninteresting or super cheesy, though the dialogue they've been given is charming and feels just dated enough. There's something very off-kilter about the sound and look too (and not in a good way). The score is a strange combination of orchestral and electronic which doesn't work for me and the sound design is full of recent clichés like screeching, jump-scares or ambience whenever ANYTHING even remotely spooky happens. Cinematography is usually fine, but during the scenes with Pennywise there's usually some kind of distorting effect going on around him which makes him look superimposed into the scene.Overall, the horror sequences are fairly good and sometimes creative, and there are a couple of good performances among the kids. I just don't like the lack of direction with the story - I can't even remember which order the scary bits happen in because they're interchangeable around the few important story beats.5/10.",It
655,tor-claesson,Don't think IT should have been done - but IT's enjoyable,5,14 September 2017,"How do you adapt a hefty 1000-page Stephen King epic for the big screen? Preferably, you don't. But if you necessarily have to, I suppose this is about as good as IT gets - and don't get me wrong, IT's still pretty darn good. IT's just nowhere near as brilliant as the novel, and that spoils quite a bit of the fun. At least for me.Still, all said and done IT's a good film. The kids are all fairly descent actors, and Sophia Lillis is even really good. The actors to really outperform themselves are the adult creep-bags, though. Skarsgård is great as IT, and Stuart Hughes is equally great as Bowers senior. Shining brightest of them all, however, is Stephen Bogaert as Bev's insanely creepy dad. The all too few scenes featuring him are doubtlessly the movie's scariest and greatest moments. There should be a movie about him!Anyhow, the story takes off quickly, and is driven forward at a great pace. Sometimes a tad too great, as we find ourselves thrown from one creepy clown-encounter to the next with barely any time to settle down and get to know the kids. That's sad, since it takes about two thirds of the film to get to know them, and it's not until then you really start caring for them.All said and done, IT is a solid, non-scary but highly dramatic horror film. Enjoyable but not particularly memorable.With that said, for those of you who've not read the book: Read IT!! Learn the origin of IT, and how much more IT is than just a creepy clown.",It
656,elielilemasabachtani,"Good movie, not the true horror you want",7,14 September 2017,"Going to the cinema catching this movie, i had very high expectations. I was going in hoping it would be the most terrifying movie i would ever have watched. I was expecting new nightmares, new fear of the dark but this was more an adventure movie.i wanted it to be more scary than it was. Remembering the old TV movie from 1990 that actually gave me tons of nightmares growing up.Don't get me wrong, its a good movie, well acted, well done and very nice.It had new stuff into it so you cant look at old IT and expect something similar. Its two different movies, new dialogue, new things, new twists etc.The only thing i didn't like about this movie is that its not the scary stuff i was hoping for.the kids where acting great, same goes for the clown. The downsize of the movie, the thing that doesn't give it a full pot, is that... you never feel like you are getting chased, like it actually will get you if it gets you.old IT was different, you get caught you die. So you always have the sense of dread, feeling like you will get caught and you fudged...This is more like a fight than a run for your life. Giving it a more of an adventure feeling rather than a horror... But its nice to see the clown back in action... I just wanted to redo a few things, if i had the chance... what a movie it could have been.as I sad, kids dialogue, kids acting, kids in the show GREAT!",It
657,sara2520,Pretty Good,10,10 September 2017,"This movie is It meets Stranger Things. The movie was amazing and tons of fun. There are a few big jump scares from here to there, but overall it was a coming to age story. The kids were hilarious and amazing and each stood out in their own way. Stan, the Jewish kid, and Mike, the black kid, were pushed to the back burner. I think Mike had like six lines in the entire movie. The actor who played Pennywise was amazing creepy and scary. I also liked how even the adults in the movie were scary too. One guy I thought was It in the trailer was a regular character in the movie. I loved the actress who played Beverly because her storyline was the scariest because it was real life horror. And anyone with common sense knowing the movie was going to modernized knows what the writers changed with her storyline. I loved the cute little love triangle which was kid friendly. My only dislike was the kids' filthy mouth and constant profanity. I was able to show my nephew the original It as his Introduction to Horror because it was scary and clean without the dirty jokes. This one is laced with funny jokes that aren't appropriate for kids spoken by kids. I overall enjoyed this version as I did the 1990s It starring Tim Curry. Both are amazing but this It is only a different interpretation of the same story. This movie also has rewatchability like a fun horror ride at an amusement park you want to get back on to ride again and again. Amazing movie, great standout characters, great casting, great cinematography,and a creepy atmosphere. This movie is like going on an adventure you want to go on again and again. Yes, you can love the book, the original movie, and this version too. An amazing fun movie you will enjoy and think about the scary fun you had afterwards. It sticks with you like a great childhood memory.",It
658,omarh92,"Its like Stranger Things the movie, which was honestly great!",8,8 September 2017,"IT is a solid film, however not as scary as the trailer showed, but still a really nice movie. Like you can go in thinking its a drama/adventure movie, and its great. Pennywise was amazing, Losers club was fun, if you love Netflix's Stranger Things, this is no different, you will love it then.The problem with 90% of horror movies today, they only have one objective, to scare the audience. Filmmakers do not care about the story whether if its good or not, they only care if they scare the audience. However for IT, now it tries to be scary, and the scenes are generally disturbing and uneasy, but at least they gave a good movie, like the filmmakers, just in case the film doesn't scare you, they still put great effort and gave you a really nice story. Its great to see early teenagers go on an adventure, do stupid stuff, think they are so cool and own the world, but unite together against a threat, because that is what friendship is, that brings a heartwarming feel to movie.As for Pennywise, Bill Skarsgard was excellent. Its honestly not fair to compare him to Tim Curry, because both are pretty different takes on Pennywise. Its like apples and oranges or Jack Nicholson's Joker or Heath Ledger's Joker, one Pennywise is more wacky and lively but evil, another is dark and disturbing and more evil. Its mainly which take you prefer. I honestly prefer Tim Curry, but I may just be saying this because I love Tim Curry a lot, but no doubt Bill was marvelous and excellent, he was creepy, which was great. I will say, I prefer the voice of the Tim Curry's Pennywise, he was more serious, Bill took the goofy sounding approach, which was good and it worked, both Pennywises' are excellent.Story was great, very 80s, tons of references, If watch the Netflix's Stranger Things, this is literally Stranger Things the movie, which was honestly great! Its also like The Goonies, or Lost Boys, young people involved in trouble. I never read the novel, but I know about many key events that happen, and this much closer to the novel for sure, with many references and throwbacks to it. Its darker, more disturbing and serious. The Losers club is so much fun to watch, you'll love all the kids there, even the really annoying ones. Pennywise was excellent of course. Henry Bower the bully is more to the novel, a proper disturbed psycho, he was great. Derry this time is little more light hearted than the original, the adults, not very different from the original.All and all, IT is a great movie, but really not that scary, but surely freaky and disturbing, amazing cast, effects, story, acting everything. Enjoy Pennywise the Dancing clown.",It
659,CraigsCritique,IT's an Entertaining If Flawed Project,7,25 September 2017,"Well the cinematic adaptation of Stephen King's It was interesting to say the least, to describe it as a film of horror skits wouldn't be unfair and that is meant to be both a compliment to those successful film moments but also a word of warning that the film succeeds or fails by the effectiveness of them and I tend to go with the former.I perceive the best way to view this film and get the most out of it is to not go in expecting a horror film masterclass and instead go into this film in a more entertain in the moment kind of cinematic experience.My criticisms of the film include the fact that you could easily pinpoint a couple of pointless scenes where you could knock at least ten minutes off to make the film leaner, also given the films author unfortunately those King-isms as I refer to them do occasionally make their presence very much felt in film form, also I get it film, you're set in the eighties you don't have to endlessly tell me in every scene of the film with a poster here a song there and so on, Stranger Things may want a word with you for this reason which to an extent is ironic given that Stranger Things in essence is a heavily influenced Stephen King project.Significant film positives include the performance of the young cast where a lot of the films goodwill can be attributed and also in Bill Skarsgards performance as Pennywise that well...will not improve anybody's already delicate fear of clowns, at its best it's a wonderfully detailed and stylized horror segment piece that does what the best horror films do, make you feel the characters fear, we can all have our own personal things that give us the chills but the best of horror films go beyond this to make you fear something through someone else.It's an example of skilfully made horror segments/skits tied clunkily together with a main narrative deemed necessary to propel the film forward, is it an brilliant horror film? No it's not but it's a pretty damn entertaining one.",It
660,Miasmakoala,Generic horror movie with horrible sounds and poor team dynamic,3,17 October 2017,"I went in pretty excited, the original TV miniseries was great.It 2017 was scary. I jumped off my seat a couple of times (damn you old painting lady). However, film suffers from 2010s horror movie tropes where everything has to be loud and thrown to the screen as quickly as possible. It gets annoying pretty quick in this movie.Practically every single scary scene in the movie starts off with the obvious scary track playing. Usually one of the children starts seeing things that aren't right and starts slowly advancing towards the disturbance, because horror movie.The soundtrack gets louder and louder until you are stuck in your seat covering your ears and just hoping for the obvious jump scare to pop up. But It lets you off easy, it pretty much tells you when you are supposed to be scared. The ear breaking music nearly always stops abruptly a few seconds before the jump scare. Thanks, movie.The sound design is horrible. The loud music indicating an oncoming jump scare gets very ineffective. Along that, the original soundtrack was really nothing special. Guess it was called the ""Horror Movie Stock Soundtrack"" or something.Even more annoying was the use of real songs in the movie.I have to back this up first by complimenting the opening scene. Piano music is heard when Bill builds the paper boat for Georgie and when Georgie goes downstairs, their mother is seen to be playing the music we hear. It's a nice touch, though nothing special. The blending of the soundtrack into the world made me excited for the music.When the kids throw rocks at the sociopath bully kid, Antisocial by Anthrax plays. It is a good song but in this scene it felt so weird just because in the opening scene the piano was coming from a real piano there, the music really was there. Now when the kids stone the bully, I couldn't stop thinking that Anthrax might be somewhere there playing. It's stupid but it made the out of place song be even more weird there.When studying the history of the town the kids go to Ben's place. There, Beverly happens to close the door, because script and gotta make the crowd laugh, revealing Ben's New Kids on the Block poster. It is really stupid that the ""new kid"" in school listens to New Kids on the Block. It's like ""Hey it's fun and clever the new kid listens to New Kids on the Block see what we did there ha ha New Kids so lame ha ha the lone fat kid listens to it"". I can see the screenwriter drooling over the script paper. But yeah so Bev opens the door to reveal the NKotB poster, and guess what, a New Kids on the Block song plays for a few seconds! Mr. Screenwriter, you are a modern genius.I hated the kids.The annoying meme machine with ridiculous eyeglasses was the worst. His character was so obviously written because the of the sequel. I can already see him being equally immature and getting his mature moment of heroism in the sequel. Can't remember how it went in the miniseries, though. Eh.Beverly's actor had to be the oldest looking 15 year old they could find. She could be as someone's big sister in the movie. It's not a major flaw but still annoyed me.The biggest flaw is that the kids don't matter. The only kid who matters here is Bill. The movie is such a stereotypical hero's journey. Of course, he also gets the girl in the end. The movie would've worked so much better if they'd build the movie around Bill's journey to grow up while searching his brother.Any of the other kids could've been taken away from the movie and it wouldn't had changed anything. The kid whose mother is overly sensitive and protective? The kid who lost his parents in the fire? The kid with glasses? The new kid? All worthless to the plot and the nonexistent team dynamic.They really don't feel they like to hang out together. They just are, or end up, spending time together. All their time together feels so artificial. I wish I could've immersed myself with the world and the Losers Club but it doesn't feel real. The kids don't feel real. They feel like screenwriter gave them things to say and the director told them to say the things in a way they thought the audience would feel funny.Pennywise is also there. The clown. A critic stated that the more they show It, the less scary It becomes. It is very well said.My initial reaction was laughing my ass off when Pennywise tried to lure Georgie into the sewer in the opening scene. He sounded so comedic in a totally wrong way. He sounded like he tried too hard to be funny and scary. In the miniseries, Tim Curry's Pennywise maintained a voice which was fun and scary at all times, without changing from clown voice to a scary voice.I really don't have much good to say about it. It scared me a few times, the opening scene had its moments, the painted lady with the twisted face was cool, Ben the thick kid had a fun introduction.",It

662,alexandregatineau,Success,7,30 January 2018,"This movie succeeds in scaring you without spamming jump scares. It builds a presence, suspense and thrills. The simple sight of the clown scares you, you want him to go away, you want the scene to be over so we can go back to the ""day time"" when everything is normal.That's pretty much what I ask from a horror movie: scare me without jump scares. They did an amazing job on ""it"", although I haven't read the book so I can't judge him compared to the book. But that's the scariest clown I've ever seen. Very good balance between practical and CGI.Although probably not as deep as the book (which again I haven't read), the movie manages to be a horror movie and finds some time to tell you some side stories. The most disturbing one being of course the redhead and her father. Well, the bully stabbing his father is pretty disturbing too but oh well. Because of this, the characters are build enough to not be ""scary movie casualties"". You know them a little.Anyway, it's a horror movie so don't expect the movie of the year but probably the horror movie of the year 2017.

So for an adult, nothing to fear of course!

Although acting between the kids was usually good, the grownup actors generally weren't picked or directed as carefully and typically were bad.

The film is basically tension-free and has no build up, feeling more like a series of effects set pieces that don't add up to much. Some of these set pieces are better than others, but none of them are truly frightening or have a smidgen of intensity. If it weren't for the occasional splash of blood or f-bomb, one could easily confuse this for a PG rated children's film.The child actors are wonderful and create a believable rapport that keeps you invested and Bill Saarsgard as the evil Pennywise is best when the film allows his performance to breathe in real time and doesn't overload him with CGI gags and effects.",It

675,breheneyjames,You'll float too...,9,17 September 2017,"This film had very high expectations from most people going in given it's excellent marketing campaign. It's crazy to think that it's first trailer is the most viewed trailer of all time within twenty- four hours beating the likes of huge franchise movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Transformers"". However, it just goes to show how popular Stephen King's novel ""It"" and the property as a whole really is. People really like being scared by clowns for some reason. Anyway, I'm glad to say that this film not only met my expectations but wildly exceeded them.The movie just like the novel follows the seven teenagers of the self-proclaimed ""Loser's club"" in the seemingly timid town of Derry, Maine as they are terrorized by an entity simply called ""It"". This entity takes the form of your worst fears but usually appears as a 'Pennywise the dancing clown' to lure children in before essentially brutally devouring them. Each of the kids at some point are confronted by ""It"" as he torments them with his shape-shifting abilities. But with all their courage and teamwork they must overcome their fears in order to rid the town of ""It"".A really interesting thing about the story and each of the character's respective arcs is that it's not just the entity that causes them problems that they must learn to deal with. Instead most of the characters have very tangible conflicts. For example, Bill must deal with the loss of his younger brother, Eddie has an overbearing Mother which makes him a hypochondriac, Beverly has an abusive Father and they all deal with viscous bullying at the hands of the ""Bowers gang"". All of this realism gives the film a cerebral feel which is then complimented by the supernatural terror provided by ""It"". The reason this film works so well is because it nails down three- dimensional characters in a human story about childhood, fear, courage and friendship. The writing, directing and acting are all to thank for that. The director Andy Muschietti and the writers including Cary Fukunaga clearly understood the essence of the novel and what they needed to keep and remove to keep the film's pace steady.The cast of mostly unknowns is superb with the standouts for me being Finn Wolfhard as Ritchie who was hilarious, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie who was also funny but really gave his character innocence and vulnerability too and Jaeden Lieberher who gave a nuanced performance as the leader of the ""Loser's club"", Bill.Bill Skarsgards gives a delightfully creepy turn as Pennywise which heightens the tension of any scenes he appears in. If I had to pick one gripe with this film it's that some of the main characters such as Stanley and Mike are not really developed as well as the others but hopefully this will be rectified in part two when they are adults.But other than, all in all, this is a great adaptation of one of Stephen King's greatest and most popular novels and I can't wait for part two.",It

When I saw a monster clown haunting a group of kids I was like, maybe this is gonna be some childish comedic horror movie. Right from the start, I saw that I underestimated it. Instead of being so childish with some bunch of kids as its main cast, it rather got darker and darker as it progressed. The clown demon was scary as hell and the story line too was impressive. The choice of cast too was okay. It didn't possess outmoded clichéslike most horror films still use. It was just original with its story line. One thing I love most about this movie is that, unlike most horror films where its all about the main character running about and escaping the villain, this one actually asks the question, What if it is the villain who has to escape the heroes?

679,Kalisto069,A VERY GOOD REMAKE of the 90's mini-series,10,9 January 2021,"The first time I've watched this remake was if I remember well in the beggining of 2019. At that time, infortunately a French TV chanel broadcast the 90's mini-series which I adored and still adore... Therefore, when I first watched this remake I was disapppointed.However, I've watched this remake yesterday again without watching the original series neither reading the book (which I stll have as I am a big fan of Stephen King). ;)Actually, I've watched this remake without comparing it to the series or the book. And it is indeed an amazing remake !I was totally into it even if I remembered it.Tonight I'll watch the 2nd sequel, therefore ""It: Chapter Two"" and I am quite thrilled and excited about it.Eventually, I highly recommend it !",It
680,Skaigear,"Imagine a very good episode of Goosebumps, throw in good child acting, Conjuring-styled suspense, buckets of blood and a focused unrelenting villain",9,10 September 2017,"It is directed by Andy Muschietti and it is a remake of the 1990 three- hour miniseries which in turn was based on Stephen King's own 1986 horror novel. So what is ""It?"" As a kid browsing through video rental stores in 90's, I have always noticed the peculiar VHS cover with a white face painted, sinister looking clown on it with the title ""It"" in bold red colors. The miniseries was hailed by classmates at school to be the scariest movie of all-time and I always wondered why; the back of the VHS seemed to show the scariest thing about the film is just a killer clown. Is it because I am fortunately enough to not have a phobia of clowns that is why it had no effect on me? Then I thought about why Stephen King chose to name the book ""It"" and not ""Clown"" if it is indeed just a story about a killer clown. This 20-something year old question of mine was finally answered when I saw this 2017 iteration at the cinema on opening day. It is whatever you do not want it to be. It manifests itself as the thing you fear most. In short, it is an entity that can transform and show itself as your worst nightmare. Now that my curiosity is finally answered, is the movie any good? Well, bloody yes.It as a film in general succeeds on all facets. It was creepy, scary, funny, heartfelt and emotional. Imagine a very good episode of Goosebumps, throw in good child acting, Conjuring-styled suspense, buckets of blood and a focused unrelenting villain – the results of this beautiful concoction would be It. It could have easily been a mess of a movie, been accused of copying latest horror trends of James Wan or Eli Roth, but Andy Muschietti was able to hone everything down neatly into a spectacular package. Right from the get-go, we were able to see how beautiful the cinematography is; the basement, things lurking in the shadows, rainfalls, glowing eyes, etc. Visually, this is a gorgeously shot movie. The buildups of scares are very reminiscent of modern ghost films, but that is a good thing because they are done right with good payoffs, usually a nightmare-inducing image that sent chills down the audience's spines. I am not the kind of snotty movie goer who despises jump scares because I feel they are cheap and unearned, no I actually believe they are a vital ingredient in a horror movie and without them, even the sharpest film tends to dull out. Jump scares need to be well-timed and be used to unleash the tension at the climax of a scary scene, and It understand this very well.On one hand we have a hardcore horror film that mixes the best of both worlds of scares and violence, and on the other we have a retro old- school, band of misfits, kids adventure. This film proves you can have terrifying scares and at the same time not sacrifice well-developed characters. These protagonists are not cannon fodders who merely exist in the script to bite the dust, instead they are well fleshed-out human beings with their own problems and motivations. Bill loses his brother Georgie early on and is eager and impatient to find out what happened to him. Ben is the overweight perpetual new kid in school who is smart but has trouble making friends so he stays in the library. Beverly suffers from sexual abuse from her father at home. Individually each child actor brings it in this adaptation, they were all likable and funny, but together the Losers form a chemistry so good you would feel distraught if anything were to happen to even one of them.Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise gives one of the best villain performances I have ever seen. I would put this Pennywise up there with recent cinematic antagonists such as Hans Landa, Calvin Candie and Heath Ledger's Joker. Skarsgard's body movements, facial twitches and speech patterns were all unsettlingly creepy but at the same time still magnetic to watch. To expand upon my initial question on what is exactly is It: Pennywise the Dancing Clown is just one of the many of forms It the entity takes in the novel, but Tim Curry's performance in the miniseries popularized this particular form, so to most people It is synonymous with Pennywise, thus it makes sense for this remake to keep him as the main face.Perhaps the one thing that really made It so amazing to me is despite the villain is relentless and the protagonists are just kids, seemingly insurmountable for the Losers to defeat him, Pennywise has a clear weakness and without spoiling anything, he could be defeated. It is so refreshing to watch a horror movie of this kind where the supernatural villain is not a ghost or a demon that cannot be hurt and always wins in the end, but is someone who could lose if the protagonists work together and outsmart him in a meaningful way. This gives hope and creates a sense of earnestness and sincerity to the picture, where the underdogs can eventually overcome the adversary if they do not give up.Overall It is probably my favorite recent horror movie, and as a film on a technical perspective, it is probably the best ever. The scares worked, it looked great, and the characters and acting was amazing especially by Bill Skarsgard. I love the whole authentic 80's feel, it added a lot to the whole thing. I do not know what more I can ask for in a film in general, because It is easily one of 2017's best.",It

-Cliche horror characters doing unbelievably dumb things
-Disjointed shifts in tone (horror, comedy, horror, comedy)
-Inappropriate comedy
-No character arcs
-Antagonist isn't bound by any rulesIt's almost like two or even three directors were given the script for this movie, and the same actors and locations.

682,jonny_keogh,Pennywise is the money maker,9,26 September 2017,"So for a person who isn't really a big horror movie fan, for some reason this movie was something I HAD to see. The marketing for this film was extraordinary, and I was well and truly sucked into the hype. I'm a guy who tends to watch a horror film with the lights on, pillow in hand just in case i need to shield my eyes, and the volume down in case anything makes me jump ..... OK I exaggerate with the pillow and lights on, but I do turn the volume down when I think something bad is going to happen.But horror stories often bring out the most imagination. Horror has the most amount of versatility in the world of storytelling. Superhero movies are all very similar nowadays. Action films are too samey as well. Comedies are running out of jokes. But Horror movies have always got a new way of scaring you. Yes obviously there's the awful horrors out there, but so many recently have been exceptional. It's such a shame I don't like it when something makes me jump! As I love the story of a good horror movie/book, but usually too wimpy to watch it.'It' was different though. I know it's a re-boot, but I was excited for this, and I was surprised at how little I jumped and got scared. I didn't find it scary. I just found it to be one of the most fun movies I have seen at the cinema in a very long time. Last time I enjoyed a movie this much at a cinema I believe, was for Dark Knight in 2008. Funnily enough that had a clown character as a main protagonist too.The characters were well cast and the kids more than held their own when Pennywise wasn't in shot. There was great chemistry between the kids, and the majority of them had great acting talent. Maybe the odd dodgy acting here and there, but overall the kids made this movie better than certain people expected. Pennywise was the main draw though. He still steals the scenes which isn't too surprising. The first meeting with him and Georgie is chilling. His shapeshifting, strange ways and often comedic mannerisms actually make for creepy viewing, but he never becomes unbearable. He is always fun to watch. It's a horror/comedy, but knows its purpose. The comedy isn't forced or overbearing, and when it tries to scare you, it doesn't dull it down for comedy sakes. It just becomes funny when it needs to. And it scares when it needs to. The balance of this was spot on, and this was the biggest success of the movie. At just over 2 hours too, it never ever feels drawn out. The time between meetings of Pennywise never seems too long or too short.If I had a criticism (which there isn't many), it would be that Pennywise was not in it enough. Just as in the first scene with him and Georgie, he got a lot of screen time. But afterwards, we saw him in patchy stages, which never lasts long enough (maybe apart from the end). But that's just me being selfish. Also the CGI spoilt a couple scenes, but again that is being picky. The movie was lots of genres in one. Horror, Comedy, Drama, Action. And it does all of that very well. I haven't given this a 10, as I can't say I believe in the perfect movie, and will only give a 10 to my all time favourite film, but 9 is perfectly good.Pennywise will go down as one of my fave movie characters. Along with Heath Ledgers 'Joker' and Johnny Depps 'Jack Sparrow'. Bill Skarsgard definitely does 'Pennywise' justice.Loved it. So looking forward to Chapter Two!!",It
683,markcasa-63624,Um. Eh,7,5 June 2018,"I honestly I thought when I first saw the first movie trailer I was pretty scared, then when the second trailer came out about a month before the film came out I was also scared especially at the end. Then when the movie came out. I was like after it was finished. It was loud. And there were jump-scares.This film had way too many jump-scares for me. When Pennywise is scaring all the kids in the beginning of the movie there are so many jump-scares everywhere. Too make things even worse I saw this movie in IMAX when it first came out and the movie was just to damm loud. It sucked that I didn't bring my headsets with me because in almost every scene even when the happy whimsical music is playing I have to cover my ears because it so loud. Then theres the acting. Suprisonly the acting in the movie isn't that bad. I know when the movie came out a lot of people were comparing this movie to Stranger things which came out about a year earlier. But I hadn't seen Stranger things when I saw this movie I didn't know what they were talking about. The only person I didn't like was Stanly. He's just really bland that you could cut him out of the movie all together and you wouldn't really miss him all that much.As for Pennywise he does a good job too but unlike the 1990 tv miniseries where he was played Tim Curry this one comes of as just to scary. But I found him good too especially during the climax. The makeup also looks good to but when he's not playing the other monsters as pennywise he only has about 10 minutes of screen time.Then the CGI is just, ok sometimes it looks good like I said with Pennywise as a character during the climax. But in the beginning of the movie it just looks bad especially with Pennywise's monster forms.I just hope the sequel does a better job with almost all of these bad things I said about this. But give it a job just keep the volume low or bring a pair of headsets.I give it 7 out of 10.",It
684,theandreaceregini,"Decent on its own, BURIED by the 1990 miniseries",6,13 September 2019,"What a weird, weird, weird movie! Here's a series of unordered considerations. 1) Moving the setting 30 years forward from the late '50s to the late '80s was a good choice: most fitting music, clothes and generally a best ambiance for the whole story. 2) NOT ENOUGH HENRY BOWERS! He's supposed to be a literal human devil, an oppressing tormenter... but what we got here is an edgy kid with a hair. 3) Why does everything looks so cheap and fake? How is it possible to have a 2017 movie with WORSE special effects than a 1990 miniseries? Worst offender is obviously the CGI department, with some parts being more suitable to some indie videogame's cutscene than a 35 million dollars Hollywood production. 4) Storytelling calls another comparison between this movie and the 1990 miniseries, and the movie loses again (deeply). There's no match: this is a series of scenes attached together, more than an actual movie; and this feels very wrong given the fact that the original material - one of the best novels from King - manages to build a unique and coherent narration even if it's divided into many different chapters, settings and time periods. This movie is just... things happening after other things, followed by other things already reasy to leave space for another set of things. It's generally enjoyable but it's also... unthrilling. It's like they were too busy following online tutorials for Adobe After Effects to care about giving the script a soul.",It
685,artur-artborg,FINALLY a great Stephen King Adaptation,9,21 September 2017,"Was I skeptical upon entering that cinema? Absolutely.Stephen King is a notoriously difficult author to adapt to screens big and small, and after seeing the recent remake of ""Carrie"" I had my share of doubts about whether these filmmakers could pull this of.My fears disappeared fairly quickly.""It"" is a fantastic movie, a well-scripted, well-directed and well- acted piece of high-quality entertainment. Let's talk about those actors: each and every one of those child actors did an AMAZING job. I sympathized with, cared for and cheered for all of them. A spectacular job across the board. I predict that all these fine young actors (but maybe Sophia Lillis in particular) have great futures in store for them.The young adult aspects of the film are so compelling that I almost didn't care about the horror aspect. Essentially, even if the film had messed up Pennywise, I still feel like it would have been a great time. But Bill Skarsgård and the crew did a great job with the dancing clown as well, making him and his surroundings fittingly creepy. I was never once terrified, but consider that a good thing. The film utilizes jump scares, true, but it never becomes overly reliant on them.I have very few complaints about this movie. It was both entertaining and emotionally satisfying with a great cast, great atmosphere and surprisingly great humor. Check it out!",It

687,shoguncrosse,Go See it- History in the Making - Bill Skarsgard Has a Bright Future!,10,9 September 2017,"Greatest horror movie of the decade! No cheap tricks, no shoddy CGI, no crappy writers, no crappy director and/or producer, and definitely no shoddy amateur actors and actresses. Some of these children in the main roles may be relatively new at acting, especially in a big blockbuster, but none were shoddy or bad at there jobs. In fact, I would go as far as to say I would be highly surprised and disappointed by the Academy and other major film awards groups and ceremonies if these children weren't nominated at all, or win no trophies at all. The praise they most justly deserve for such convincing roles simply cannot go unnoticed or become forgotten. Each young actor and actress fully embodied their respective characters and personalities perfectly on film. The fear you see often within the film is genuine in more cases than not, as was said in previous interviews and news for months; so this also adds that extra layer of reality to the 'realism' of emotions most directors shoot for in order to add those extra dimensions to their films - this was done extensively, and for the majority of the time, it was perpetrated by no one other than the true clown prince himself (watch out Gotham Joker, you have a major new, well, old contender in town!) IT the clown; or better known as, Pennywise. Bill Skarsgard's portrayal of Pennywsie wasn't just fate, as he was the fourth choice to play the role, after the first two declined, and the one who actually did secure it, Will Poulter (I was interested in this actor doing it as well, but glad not!) dropped out early on once Fuknunaga dropped out allowing Skarsgard to gain the opportunity of an audition as Poulter's replacement for the evil otherworldly clown. This was the best thing that possibly could have happened to this film, as not only did Andy Muschietti take the helm, but he was one of the people who auditioned Skarsgard, but also with his great film vision of the movie and love for the original Stephen King novel he wished to create something far closer to the actual tale told. Great news for big King fans! He knew right away that Skarsgard was the man for the gig to become Stephen King's most iconic evil creation after just one interview and audition: A fear and phobia inducing monster of nightmares, creator of torment, and eater of children of Derry; Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise was born. It was something akin to a masterpiece written by a master musician far ahead of his own time, such as Mozart; so far ahead of his time, it took years for others to follow in his footsteps, and his pieces are still relevant today, all the while, his contemporary's learning from the most beautiful concerto performances for hundreds of years to come! Any clown in the history of any actor or actress who has ever played a clown on TV or on film now has been lowered to a status of apprentice compared to this masters performance; truly. And yes, I do include The Joker in this list - both Ledger and Leto - as being relegated to secondary art pieces; shown in auction before the main event piece is introduced with great excitement, applause, and ravenous bids...All great pieces of work, but the last, priceless. Bill Skarsgard's performance just set the bar so high up for the creepiest, craziest, and most psychotic portrayal of a clown that the international space station astronauts may float too, but not because of space's lack of gravity, but because of Pennywise's constantly popping up of balloons...They All Float! The definitive Stephen King Adaptation to date - no doubt! Go SEE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTING!",It

At that point, he encounters the creepy clown and the dialogue between them is tense and draws us in to the film immediately. The problem is the rest of the movie does not measure up to the opener. We're gradually introduced to the children who will be the targets for the evil in the balance of the film; however, so much time is spent on this setup the tense start to the movie is lost and it becomes disjointed. The kids do a good job overall and are believable in their roles, but they are left wandering around in a script gone wrong. The adults in the film are few and far between and are reduced to caricatures and stereotypes with no depth whatsoever. What's left then is simply a children's movie with swearing and some gore.

699,Mrbrown43,IT 2017 review: Achieving buoyancy in the sewers,9,6 February 2018,"I think it is safe to say that the original It TV miniseries (1990) has not aged well, that show suffered from a pretty decent first half before dropping greatly in quality in the second half. Tim Curry's take on Pennywise is fondly remembered and I can see why on one hand but there were moments of goofiness that plagued the entire miniseries. Not to mention the second half which somehow had adults giving worse performances then the child actors? When people heard about the remake I remember people being ill at ease. Many people feared a substandard remake that would tarnish or misunderstand the source material that inspired the miniseries. Let's find out shall we?October 1998 Georgie Denbrough disappears while playing in the rain, the following summer older brother Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) is still struggling to make sense of it. He still can't process it. He and 6 other children find themselves haunted by a terrifying clown calling itself Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård). The seven kids (Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Grazer, Wyatt Oleff and Sophia Lillis) form the Loser's club to find a way of killing this clown. That is all I can say sadly about the plot, I do not want to run the risk of spoiling things unnecessary, the movie does not deserve it. I know it is based off a book and there is TV show that follows the same plot as this movie, the half anyway. Firstly the movie gets rid of a lot of the goofy moments that might have worked as a book might not work as well in a movie or miniseries, this was something the TV series did not understand and it suffered as a result. IT 2017 avoids this pitfall by making the manifestations the children experience more relatable. The movie works well with the theme of innocence corrupted with manifestations that make sense both on a adult and child level. IT somehow makes the phase ""You will float down here"" seem actually scary and by some strange magic was able to make red balloons somewhat chilling! It also adds some new scares that turn things associated with childhood into nightmarish creations. I am saying that the film is actually frightening, unlike the TV show. Speaking of frightening Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise shines, he deserves to be placed next to Tim Curry. There might even be a debate that Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise is better then Tim Curry's Pennywise. He made my skin crawl whenever he was on screen; he is what a demonic clown should look like. There is not much more to say really, he is good, fantastic even; he deserves all the praise he gets. Another risk any film with a majority child cast has to deal with is the inherit problem that most child actors are inexperienced or lack the refined talent. Fortunately much like the miniseries the kids give great performances that feel not only convincing but real as well. The simple fact that most kids around ages of 11 will be swearing and getting into trouble makes the dialogue just that little bit more real. IT 2017 smartly starts out with the child part of the story; the second chapter I have no doubt will feature the adults. I would say that even if there was never another movie IT 2017 does not suffer in the slightest. It works on its own as well as a starting point. I look forward to chapter 2. Who knows it might defy treads and be just as good. We will see in time.",It

I adored the kids in this movie! They had great chemistry, and you can really buy that they are best friends! Something I loved that this film did was it didn't have any exposition. It was all visual story telling. You can tell what scared the kids, without them just saying ""(this) scares me"" they develop their characters until you eventually find out on your own. There are many scenes or moments that finally tie into the story at the end. I loved the effort put into this movie! And of course, the horror in It is so scary! Not the typical jump scare, false scare, loud noise, predictable scare fest we are used to with a majority of horror films now a days. The scares were very unique! Some people might complain the scares were too over the top, but it's supposed to be imagination. The emotion towards the end works so well. It made me feel sad. And last, the humor worked so good! It was very funny and all jokes landed! I would say my issues with the film is I wanted more screen time with pennywise. He wasn't in a lot of it until the third act.

705,gigitville,"Pretty Good, That's the Best Way to Describe It",7,26 February 2018,"I'm not a usual horror movie viewer, but upon seeing the trailers for the It remake, I knew I was going to see it. It looked like a genuinely good movie that used horror in a supportive and smart way aside from jump scares with no plot. And once I saw it, it more or less confirmed my thoughts. Though there are pros and cons to every movie. 
So, the pros. It was extremely well made. The setting was warm in an 80's way, though vibrant when dealing with Pennywise which played in the fact that he was, you know, a clown. The acting was surprisingly great on all accounts, which is always a tedious expectation with large child casts. The effects were amazing and all the utterly skin crawling fear sequences looked so realistic, which added to the creep factor. There was plenty of memorable cinematography, so many shots will stick with me, like Georgie's arm scene, Ben being chased by a headless boy, and the kids jumping off the cliff into the water are some that come to mind. And the suspense was masterfully presented which had me not at the edge of my seat in anticipation, but curled into a ball trying (and failing) to hide my face in fear.
As for the cons, they weren't so glaring that it added up to a bad experience, they were more or less just some parts that were a bit obvious in comparison to the greatness of the rest of the movie. One was the fact that some kids were one note, which could have been the writing in the book. It was like this for most of the group that weren't Bill and Beverly. I also wished they balanced the responsibilities between the group so all of the members of the Losers Club really felt needed. This includes having a different member of the Losers Club being taken by Pennywise to bring them together in the third act because Beverly definitely wasn't the damsel in distress type. I wish the kids' fear sequences were shown in a different way than one right after the other. I don't know if it was my expectations of the movie going in, but I felt they could've been presented more creatively. Some of the CGI with Pennywise was unnecessary, and I would've liked to see Bill Skarsgard do his thing with the character more, because he was the best part. I wish they showed the kids maybe spit firing some ideas on how Pennywise came to be, but I bet they'll touch up on his origin in part two. And lastly, the clanging jump scares. I thought the movie was above them, and would've been truly special if it also expanded its horizons with some silent or creepy quiet moments. Also, Bev was most certainly not a damsel in distress so having her as one the boys had to band together to save was out of character.
Overall, great movie that I'm so glad I saw, and will see again, despite it being extremely and awesomely freaky.",It

I really loved the way how the horror scenes and humour seemed to shift to and fro. The CGI was really good, I felt. Despite the numerous F-bombs and sex jokes, the humour works and is an essential element, the film could not have done without.
Peformancewise, Bill Skarsgard steals the show. Among the child actors, I felt that Finn Wolfhard was great. In fact,everyone was great in this one.
A must watch for Stephen King fans.

711,esthercross,Chessy like a cheese sandwich made with an entire wheel of cheese.,5,27 September 2017,"I went to see 'IT' armed ready with the criticism of the film not being scary enough, and tried to view it as suggested- a mildly chilling adventure story. The problem with changing my point of view to suit this film is that I could really sense the makers trying like a dad in a Halloween costume to scare the audience. Since the films monster lives and thrives of fear it seemed strange to me that the film itself didn't engage the concept of generating suspense. There were many moments where the changing manifestation of IT would pop out of nowhere and try and be 'scary' with out much lead up and I just wasn't buying it. These scary creature sequences had my mind distracted with thinking 'this is a person in a costume doing a silly walk'. I think it was definitely a fault of the film to show too much and too quickly. I was really hoping for the, 'breath on the back of the neck' atmosphere you get when the impending horror slowly creeps up on you but I was was almost never transported into the world where these threats exist. There were definitely problems with the script. Whilst I found many of the characters likable and interesting; I did find that I wasn't convinced in people's reactions to events in the film. Moments after something grotesquely horrific happened the characters seemed to make miraculous emotional recoveries. The film had the sensibility of a cheesy 80's quest film but without the charm of it being actually made in the the 80's. If this film was made a few decades ago, i'd probably have grown up fondly ignoring the errors however, it wasn't and therefore I cannot ignore the clunky flow of the film, the lack of fear and the cheese on toast that was the dialogue. As much as this film wasn't for me I do have to praise how it kept me entertained even when sceptical as the worst thing a film can be is boring and 'IT' never was. I also thought there was an amazing craft behind appearance of 'IT' as he was beautifully Gothic looking like an Pagliacci clown, and was striking with every appearance! I also really enjoyed the performance of Sophie Lilis who had a captivating charm about her and I thought her challenging range of emotions where convincing. What 'IT' does have going for it; is a really great score and an empowering message about strength, bravery and uniting as a team.",It

Granted not all movie adapted from Stephen King novels are done well, this version of IT does so very well. When appropriate, it makes small gestures to parts or subplots in the book, and omits stuff that would have been completely inappropriate (if you read the book, you know what I mean). Add that to the comparison to the mini series, and it needed to somehow set itself apart; it managed that as well.
These kids fit their characters so well and naturally, and Bill Sarsgård makes the Penny's character his own in absolutely legendary fashion. The sets are incredibly well designed. The tension is built so well through acting and script. This movie will go down in history.",It

716,legorocks-30147,One of the best horror movies in recent memory,7,16 September 2019,"Here is my review for the 2017 remake, ""It"". Minor spoilers will be discussed in this review:I love this movie, it's one of the few remakes that surpasses the original, and it's by a huge margin. This was the first movie that had the guts, to show a child getting his arm bitten off. It totally payed off, and it's one of the best Stephen King movie moments, ever. I personally like Bill Skarsgård more than I do Tim Curry. Like I said, Tim Curry's Pennywise didn't possess any real threat. But, Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise looks and feels like he could potentially do a lot of harm, and I felt like he could definitely kill these kids. There are scenes in this movie that really do scare me, and the ones that don't definitely creep me out, this film had incredible tone. But not to be overlooked are the child actors. Every last one of them did an incredible job, they all really convinced me. My personal favorite was Eddie. He was hilarious. A big thing I want to talk about is the humor. Yes, there are a couple times when the humor undercuts the tension, but most of the humor was perfectly placed, and that's why this movie is hilarious. The adults too, are heavily improved in this movie, they are written so much better. The bullies I feel are a bit too threatening, they are introduced in the movie and they already feel like psychotic murderers. Still, I like them better here than in the miniseries, the actors are far better. I love the ending to this movie, it is so satisfying. I'm super excited for ""It: Chapter Two"", but I would've been fine if they left the story off here. This is one of the best horror movies in recent memory, and I could totally find myself watching it over and over.Conclusion:

721,Nicknielsen99,Skarsgard is pure gold,9,7 September 2017,"From the moment I saw this trailer, I could instantly feel a fantastic vibe from it. After seeing Bill Skarsgard cast as Pennywise, I was ecstatic! Unlike most, I personally loved him as Roman Godfrey in Netflix's Hemlock Grove. He delivered a performance of the ages, and every moment he was on the screen, my eyes were fixated, and my ears perked to hear what he said in that creepy, yet oddly satisfying, clown voice he spoke in.The movie itself was spectacular in the field of grabbing you from the start, and not letting you go till the final black screen forced me to leave. The cast itself of the ""Losers Club"" were all perfectly written. From the hysterical comic relief of Richie Tolzier (Finn Wolfhard), to the ever so memorable stuttering of Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher). Nowadays in films, most effects are washed and thrown at you in a blur so quickly that you get a headache from all the moving parts. Muschietti excelled at balancing the horror with the drama, while adding in some of the most grotesquely gorgeous visuals that have been brought to the big screen. From even the slightest parts of either maggots or blood, to the full blown disgustingly horrific visuals, it was a treat from the get-go. Remembering the 1990's original TV movie, this film was an amazingly done ""big-screen"" remake. Skarsgard's performance, for even being in a limited role, was on par with that of Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight, which speaks BOUNDS to his performance. There is even an IGN article which discusses how he made the child-actors cry on set, because he didn't want to break character. Amazingly done on his part, and the casting selections were all phenomenal. The whole time I kept tying it back to the original, as well as the book itself, and I wasn't even close to disappointed...All in all, this film is easily one of the most memorable of the year, and following what seems to have been the worst weekend in Box Office history, this is an amazing rebound. IT was a spectacle from start to finish, and left me begging for more! (9/10, 16+ due to gore, and language)",It
722,adean81,IT review,8,14 September 2017,"Even you are not a fan of Stephen King or horror, you should still watch the movie IT. As a suspense/horror film, the movie does a good job building the intrigue and mystery of the town of Derry as well as Pennywise the Clown. Pennywise looks very creepy and is an interesting and engaging villain. It uses impressive special effects for the demon clown and shows what IT is capable of becoming in order to scare the kids. Using their fears to attack them. There are some good jump scares but the movie does not overly rely on those.One thing that the movie does overly rely on is the music cues to build up the suspense. The overuse of it made the scare beats become a bit predictable in the film. There were also weird times when random songs would pop up and then be cut off abruptly. There were some cool camera tricks like rotating and zooming that I thought were impressive. Overall the film looks great and has an aesthetic similar to The Goonies or Stranger Things. What this movie succeeds at is telling the story of the children. This very much feels like a young adult coming of age story. The child actors all do a great job, and the characters are really engaging which allows the audience to become sympathetic to them. The story is focused on the kids and their fears. Each kid has a fear or obstacle in their life that they need to overcome in order to help defeat Pennywise. They are all very distinct characters but still feel like a group of friends. The movie was at its best when exploring the lives of the children.The movie touches on some of the mythology about Pennywise and the town of Derry, but it's important to remember that this is the first part of the story. There is going to be a sequel movie that can delve deeper into some of the material from the book. While there are some minor problems with the movie, it is still a very well made and engaging film that I recommend people checking out. Even though it's cast is a group of kids, I would not recommend anyone under the age of 13 due to some very adult themes and imagery. This movie succeeds at being a suspense drama with elements of horror that keeps the audience entertained throughout.",It
723,nimdude,Terrifying and gross in the best possible way,8,7 September 2017,"I walked into this movie with a heavy fear of clowns. I was very hesitant to see it despite my huge love for horror movies. I can safely say that this is one of the best horror films of the 2000's. First and foremost this movie is SCARY. It is very very scary. Bill Skarsgård was a perfect Pennywise. The cinematography, sound mixing, music, makeup and performances were spot on when it comes to a horror movie. The child actors are all highly commendable for their performances. Jump scares are present but masterfully utilized whenever they occur. On a technical level, as previously mentioned the cinematography and visuals all contribute to the overall terror of the movie and are very well executed. The dialogue between the kids is funny and believable. The tone of the film jumps a lot between horrifying, happy, sad, playful and just plain weird but nothing ever felt out of place. The story and the characters had a brilliant flow throughout the entire run time.""It"" is a horror movie from start to finish and it didn't have a single dull moment in my opinion because I was in constant fear and anticipation for the next time Pennywise or his other spawns will be on screen. 9/10",It
724,chazzheaton,Creepy!,7,11 September 2017,"I think this is one of the best horror movies that has been made in a long time. I must admit I haven't read the book so I can't compare but as a movie it works very well. The young actors are brilliant and the writers gave them a script so they actually sound like how kids hanging out with their friends would talk. Plot is well driven and runs very smoothly, doesn't feel like things are happening too fast or slow. There are plenty of creepy moments! Personally though, I feel as if it wasn't scary enough. I think that they overused Pennywise so he lost his scariness as he kept appearing every few moments. Great monster horror movies give you a little bit of the monster each time (think Alien or Jaws). I think they could have used the music a bit more to create suspense. Also I don't think they wrapped up the ending (which I won't spoil) enough, personally. Other than that the film was funny, well produced and had a great cast and I'm sure it will scare audiences!",It
725,hatsunemiku-27340,A Shock to the System,8,11 September 2017,"Modern horror films have never been my cup of tea, relying too much on low budgets, cheap scares, and uninteresting plots to make back dozens of times the cost of the film with little effort. It seems to have had a lot of time and love put into it, creating a sort of homage to horror films of the eighties while maintaining much of the modern staples we've come to expect.The story of a bunch of misfits coming together to battle against a terrifying creature that predominantly takes on the guise of a clown is interesting in the contrast between the whimsical and lighthearted slice-of-life moments and the scenes of pure terror. What I felt was a good foundation for a much longer movie was sadly stripped down, leaving less development of the kids and a lot of missing exposition that could explain their fears better, and instead going straight for the scares. While I understand that the director and writers are giving the audience what they want, I feel that with twenty or thirty minutes more of development, I would have felt a deeper connection to the Losers.The horror elements are good but I never found the movie particularly scary. A later scene in an obviously ""haunted"" house was very tense, but I wouldn't say it was terrifying. That's not to say that the imagery won't stick with you. Bill Skarsgard is wonderful as Pennywise and some of the visual scares (Pennywise in the meat processing plant, the scene where the kids watch the slides) are unique. But overall, I wouldn't call this movie scary in the practical sense, more in the fact that scares are accompanied with startling loud noises that are just annoyingly cheap at this point.Despite the problems, I really enjoyed It. It's one of the best horror films I've seen in the past ten years with excellent acting, great visuals, well done cinematography, and a bit of heart that you wouldn't expect. It's also a film perfectly suited for a theater experience. Suggested!",It
726,SomeGuyName,Tries to do everything at once,6,21 September 2017,"I loved Stephen King's It, as I am such a cultured critic, and I'd always wanted to watch it in movie form blah blah, on to the real review:This movie was not really that scary. I love horror movies and sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers too young to even be here. I refuse to believe that they could in any way be scarred by this experience, as each scare was undercut by humor, and the scares themselves were not really that intense. In fact, I'd recommend this movie to people aged 12-15, as the toilet humor and sexual jokes seemed to be right up their alley, and I'm saddened to hear that the language apparently was enough to warrant this movie an R-rating. One of the problems is that this movie - beautifully shot and heart-warming as it is - fails to both build up the tension and provide something genuinely scary as a pay-off. Sometimes, it did manage to do one or the other, but never at the same time. It doesn't help that the monster appears way too often, and with all the kids fighting, running, throwing rocks and what-not, it often felt like I was watching a particularly gritty action movie, not an actual horror. As for the music, it sucked. Not because it was exclusively bad, but because it was too loud to have any subtlety, and because some of it didn't match the tone of the scene(the loudness making it even more grating).Now, the kids. As others have stated, their acting was great, in fact I found them better than most of the adults. They had actual screen presence, and the casting and dialogue between them is where this movie shines - their personalities and actions really did ring true most of the time, at least for me. One thing I continuously took issue with, though, is the treatment of the character, Beverly Marsh. I've read the gross-out controversial scene between her and the boys in the book, and was thankful that they left this out of the movie - but this is still no excuse. I know we are supposed to watch her through the eyes of the teenage boys, but they overdid it. The collective sum of the many full body shots, the red lipstick and the way the camera follows her around is not only kinda gross, it also hinders and changes her character development. They could have chosen to make her just as much a part of the group as she was in the book, but instead they made her almost exclusively an object of desire, and - in the end - a damsel in distress. Beverly is still presented as a complex and brave girl - but unlike the book, she is first and foremost a ""woman"". Like how they changed her father from a controlling physically abusive man, to a hair-sniffing pedophile. What's the issue with this, you say? Oh, nothing, save for the fact that the boys also continuously point out her hair, writes poems about it, and so on. It's supposed to be cute, but it can't be, because of the newly introduced context of sexual abuse. When Beverly is unconscious and is awaken by a passionate kids from one of the boys, how can you feel anything other than uncomfortable, when you've just seen her crying over the sink, cutting off her hair in deep shame and fear of being desired? So many situations here reminded me of the book Lolita, but in a bad and exploitative way. I also did find it strange that they didn't just set the movie in the 50s, as I think the unsupervised children and the dark violence the entire city inhabits, had more to do with an era gone by. I know, I know, things like this still happens now, as it does in the 80s, but it would've just been more believable this way, what with the evil cop and people getting burned to death just because they're black. Besides, It is a story of innocence lost - and what era has been viewed more through rose-colored lenses, as the 50s? I really wish they would've avoided the 80s trends here, and just focused on the truth of the story. In fact, this is the reason why It never completely works, and you can't fully blame them. They had the running time of a movie, and they tried to do it all - but it's impossible to sum up a 1000-page book with 8 fully-developed main characters, even when you split it in half. And it is crucial that you get inside the character's heads in this particular horror story, because their personal deepest fears is all you ever get to see. And how can you be scared by this, if you don't understand them? They would've been better off sacrificing even more of the source material, in order to have a more consistent tone, and more well-developed characters. It was doomed to be a mess from the beginning.",It

728,MsGoreXale3723,Excellent adaptation of a King novel!,10,12 September 2017,"I have to say I absolutely loved this movie. Stephen King is an excellent and very detailed writer. Adapting his work is difficult, and as we've seen, has been done very poorly. However, there are some gems and, for me, this adaptation shines the brightest of them all. I know that's a bold statement after seeing great films like The Mist, Carrie, The Shining (3 of my favs), and a large list of other great horror films based on his books. I loved everything about this movie! The directing, the acting, the cinematography, everything done with a good eye for making this movie real. Not real in the sense that it could happen, but real and believable interaction between these kids and every other character in this movie. These children were nothing short of spectacular. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was amazing. He didn't try to mimic the great Tim Curry (regardless of some opinions, I thought Curry was also amazing); he really got into the mind of this character truly making it his own. I couldn't imagine anyone except Skarsgard playing ""It"". This movie was creepy, funny, and sad at times, but in all the right places and timed perfectly. I urge you to see this in the theater. This movie went beyond my expectations and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. I'm actually going to see it again. In my opinion, this was a perfect movie.",It

731,admcdonough,Scary and Enjoyable,8,8 September 2017,"I enjoyed the novel and the original mini-series and of course this only covers the part of the novel and mini-series when the protagonists were kids. But as for me, there is no question that this version is superior (in fact vastly superior) to the mini- series. The locations were great (Port Hope is used for the downtown of the imaginary Derry while most of the film is shot elsewhere in Canada) and the cinematography top notch. The special effects were excellent and scary. Although I suspect most people who see this will have read the book or seen the previous mini-series, I won't spoil your pleasure by giving any of the plot. The acting was very good. All of the young actors were fine. A particular shout out to Jeremy Ray Tayor who plays the overweight kid and really nails the role and to Sophia Lillis who plays the only girl in the group of loser kids and is absolutely great. But all of the kids give excellent performances. I think those were the two hardest roles to pull off well which is why I note them. Bill Skarsgard is a convincing and terrifying clown and Stephen Bogeart as Sophia Lillis's father is almost as creepy. Nicholas Hamilton was convincing as the leader of the bullies to the point where I almost didn't recognize him from his role in Captain Fantastic. All in all some good scares, some excellent acting, a visual treat and I can't wait for part two when the kids are grown up.",It
732,tinjo23,"Not all that terrifying, but packs a surprising emotional punch.",7,7 September 2017,"In a word: Impressive. This truly has all the right ingredients to be a great movie. Plus, even as a horror remake (despite leaning on serious horror clichés) it is by far the best made yet. However, with the release of Strange Things, you'd be hard pressed not too see the clear (but lacking), similarities between the two mediums. Furthermore (pretending as if 'Stranger Things' never existed), it owes much to King's other novel/movie adaptation 'Stand by Me' in the 'young kids in the 80's find meaning and maturity in their adventure days' plot line. But lets be clear; even comparing those two greats to this film, should make clear, what class of filmmaking is on display here. The strongest element of the movie is by far the cast, and they are, by all accounts, rock solid. Truly, you want them too live. Gifted child actors seem to be coming out the wood works these days and how great it is; allowing cinema to opt for a fresh, more unique perspective on old material. You could call them all idiots for the things they do, but truly, they are kids. They are daring, stupid, timid people. And (with the exception of how often they ignore injuries that require IMMEDIATE medical attention) what they do, never really ring false. On the contrary, very occasionally, their motives register astoundingly believable. And that is a hard thing to pull off in cinema.",It

I am aware that the gross earnings say otherwise, but there is honestly no way around it : the original 1990 movie was much, much better. Let's try to motivate my judgment. 1) In the first movie they at least tried to stick to the interconnected past-future narrative technique that King himself chose for the book. This deserves appreciation. I can only imagine how hard it must have been to adapt the plot. 2) The overall atmosphere was much more dramatic back then, when they did not need to fill dead time with sad jokes. 3) Rhythm, the great unknown. I have been, literally, bored to death for the whole movie. There is no space between scenes, everything happens without interruptions in a continuous stream of low quality ""action"". However, there are some (just a few) bright sides. This time it was successfully underscored how the kids are long time friends, almost accomplices, in spite of how old they really are (it is never mentioned, though being their very young age quite important), without too much emphasis on the ""team spirit"" cliché. Also, Finn Wolfhard (Richie), as already seen in ""Stranger Things"", and Sophia Lillis (Bev) gave amazing performances; I hope to see these two again in the future.",It
735,amerbajramovic,Finally a good horror.,8,27 September 2017,"Perhaps it is my sin and i should not do it but I can't help myself. I can't watch a movie if it is written by the book and if I haven't read it before. That is why I always end up being bit disappointed at the end. And 'IT' is not a exclusion.Considering myself a big King's fan I have of course read 'It' before the movie came out. And as any horror novel reader I was blown away aka terrified. Without any attempt to undermine a movies quality I stand behind my words when I say: Books! Can't! Be! Beaten! By! The! Movies! It is just impossible. That is why I need to be a bit harsh on this one too even though I was so eager to see it. I guess the problem is almost always the same. So much content is unfairly excluded! Or to say it this way, too much to say in too little time. But this is not the thing I did not liked about IT. It is unnecessary stepping away from the original plot. I learned not to expect a book story but I could not forgive some stupid calls producers made that took them aside of following a horrific Stephens narrative. It was easy to go with Georgie's album, real pistol and silver bullets, Barrens importance, Clubhouse... I realize there is too much to be shown but at least some of this could have been implemented. A small bad-thingy is I haven't felt that 90-es vibe. It felt almost like nowadays. But is just a miner complain from me.But here I am, only complaining on an amazing horror movie that actually can scare you to bone. To be honest, I was hoping for something bone chilling but Pennywise made me gut go mad. I was genuinely horrified by so many scenes that is was unbelievable to me. And it is not just jump scares. There are plenty of eerie scenes that last and truly hurt your mind. This movie is such a refreshment to all this similarity in 'Demon' horror movies. Pennywise is not just a regular demon. IT is The Demon. The boss for all those low key demons out here at movie market. He is different, he is mental, and on top of all, scarier from most of today's evils. One small complain is that movie Pennywise lacks jokes. He is way to serious while he is actually a Jokers idol.One big hurray for producers which is so lovable and amazing, and which go crossroads with first part of my review is that they put many Losers jokes and pokes in a film. And that is one more thing that puts this movie ahead of other horrors. It's not just gloomy and terrifying. It has a soul. You can connect with characters, love them, hate them, laugh on them... I really felt that kids spirit while watching. I felt like one of them. It's just different. And amazing.One of my 'Must-watches' for a so many reasons. Thank you King for making such a stories. You truly are the King.",It
736,singhrohan-89622,Goosebumps most of the time,6,27 September 2017,"The review is late, but I'll still continue with it, The movie was good but it wasn't a clinical masterpiece as what everyone is saying, it just a well directed film, it does justice to horror genre by the way. The scares are prominent in every scene they could have put on, with a bit of humor. I haven't watch the older parts so my review is fresh and clear minded. The most intriguing part of the movie was horror and it doesn't fails in it and it's only the strong point The rope that keeps the movie bonded is good direction and really nice cinematography. On the acting bit Bill Skarsgård did justice to the part of Pennywise the clown. I've head that DC is making a standalone Joker Movie and they should consider him for the part. The story was sort of feeling very predictable during the conclusion of the movie and felt very childish, but I had a difference weather it was a horror movie or kids scare movie. Finn Wolfhard also did a good job but rest of the cast felt a bit like filler. Again talking about the script there was no proper backstory given so that watchers can understand what is happening and they were bit lost in establishing past, future and present. FINAL VERDICT: This movie is a one time watch and not a master-piece and it feels like it can be kept in shelves of school for movie time and can be placed within likes of Baby's day out and other hit Disney movies.",It
737,wholelottalove-93562,Book lover who loves this movie,10,24 October 2020,"I think the most amazing thing about this movie is the seller child cast. The group of kids they brought together did a fantastic job embodying these characters. King's greatest strength is the dynamic characters he creates, so when a movie adaption falls flat on casting or character focus, it makes his stories seem weak. This movie went above and beyond to bring these kids to life. Little Eddie is just too perfect. The ""gazebos"" line was improvised!There were some changes, the biggest of which was Bev being trapped by the dead lights. I wasn't a huge fan of that because I think it took away from trying to highlight how powerful the group is when they're all together, but I can forgive it. But I can forgive little things like how Eddie broke his arm, what It became for each of them, Georgie's body never being found.There were several easter eggs for books readers throughout the movie that were fun to spot. Of course they skipped ""that scene"" and I always think it's a shame that King is expected to apologize for it all the time.Really, I love this movie.

738,tyelder,see IT for yourself. just not by yourself,10,23 July 2018,"Definitely the most anticipated horror thriller of the year and my personal most hyped film of the year. It was scary. It was funny. It is something that will give you nightmares. Go see IT!
 The two biggest highlights were the chemistry that was within the Loser's Club and Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise. The kid actors, and actress, nailed their parts with such great skill that it seemed they were all friends in reality. 
 Their swearing and come-backs were some great comic relief and really showed how a group of kids act-of course how any kid would act if a flesh-eating shape-shifting clown was after them. 
 It is one of the greatest this year and one of the best in its genre since it has truly opened the doors for further possibilities in the horror/thriller industry. The jump-scares and the tension-building moments combine to make this movie one to remember for decades to come-just as the last one has for 27 years. 
 Stephen King even has stated he is very pleased by the film and it's portrayal of the characters from the novel. So if the King of Horror, himself, says this is one of the greatest, I think everyone should go out and see IT for themselves.

This movie convinces me that the world has gone mad. This is entertainment for what age groups exactly? If its for adults, why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this level of blood, guts and graphic murder? The story line is directed towards a certain mentality, which is not of appeal to adults, at least not mature adults. Why on earth is this so popular? It failed to scare me on so many levels that I found myself imagining better scenes. How is it acceptable that kids of 12 years old were in the audience, looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their arm torn from their body, a man with a knife right in his throat? What the hell?! As soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their imaginations, it was a pointless exercise. What happened to all the kids that were floating down at the end? Where was the main characters brother at the end? Wait for the next episode? No thanks. I would have enjoyed a psychological horror, but gore is not what I was expecting.

It really does stand up against the original and surpasses it of course there is a bigger budget here and way better effects. There is nothing really scary about it like any normal horror but it's a great drama with the ageless charm of "" Stand By Me "" and the supernatural of "" Stranger Things "" you really can't go wrong and for me this hasn't.The casting is superb all the kids interactions are well done and funny, Pennywise is excellent and will make you hate clowns all over again. The town of Derry looks quaint and charming and you would want to spend your summers there once ""It"" has went to sleep.It remains to see how the handle Chapter 2 and who they cast, for me casting big names to the roles may ruin it.

Pennywise was a lot more menaching from the start and I am not sure I am a big fan of child mutilation and gore was a bit too much. I am fine with varying degrees of gore with adults but I don't know if I can stomach kids. Maybe its because I am getting old but certain elements of the kids lives felt a bit forced.I guess as a horror story of its own, its not quite as bad if you can stand seeing a bunch of kids being traumatized.

While this movie was not bad, it certainly was not very entertaining either. The story is a balance between the experience the children have in defeating evil and what happens 27 years later when the evil comes back and they have to decide if they will fight it again as adults. Some of the best parts of the story are derived from comparing the characters in their childhood years to their adult years. This movie had none of that. It only dealt with the children, obviously banking on a second feature. Because of this, all the charm of the movie was lost. It felt like a second rate ""Stranger Things."" Even the made for TV version was better. I am so glad I only paid matinée price, but even that was too much. The best part of this movie was the clown, Pennywise.

We live in an age of unbelievable stupidity and lack of originality. Pennywise was updated accordingly, and it is bland. Say what you will about Tim Curry, but the original Pennywise is far better, scarier, more memorable, and had an amazing dark humor. The new Pennywise has CGI and a hygienic visual. **** this new clown. **** this movie. The dialogues with him are unnatural and a bad attempt at being scary while using dark humor, but it fails altogether. It's kitsch and insulting to the intelligence. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the loser's group is kinda OK, though Eddie's mania is a bit over-the- top.

The best part of this remake was Skarsgard who played Pennywise almost exactly how I had envisioned him when I read the book. While I loved Tim Curry, who made Pennywise evil, if not a little fun, Skarsgard made Pennywise seem deranged/psychotic/creepy. The movie itself was slow in some areas, but I chalk it up to character development of the kids, especially since this is just part 1.

Lucky for me, this movie ended up being less horror and more drama/character drivenIn IT we start off with your typical horror-esque situation with the kids going to the scary basement, all the lights are off, mother is playing creepy piano music, and there's a clown in the sewers. It's everything you see in the trailers and everything everyone is raving about. But then we fast forward a month and we're dropped into a completely different mood. Instead of scary we are now in a middle school setting following the Losers club as they spend their summer doing kind of dangerous things but also fun stuffIn a way this is where the movie could get boring if you walk into this thinking you're going to be scared. The scariest part happens in the first few minutes of the film and from there it's mostly us getting to know these kids and by the way, there's a killer clown on the looseThis had a very Jeepers Creepers feel + facing your fearsOverall I really did enjoy this movie to the point where I was okay seeing it twice. (By the way, if anyone is going to watch this I recommend it in Dolby. Really makes the experience different). I don't know what the original was like and I haven't gotten around to reading the book but because of the title, I feel like Pennywise was supposed to be more of the focus of the movie, except he wasn't. In a way, he was like an afterthought but I didn't mind. I liked him as the representation of fear and how each character went about overcoming their fears.

758,WYLION-SOTIRISKING,WYLION - This will float in our memory,8,2 October 2019,"This movie was fantastic. What makes it so good though? I'll tell you!The acting was brilliant for all the characters. You could really feel the emotion and the fear that the characters were feeling. Also, Bill Skarsgard was definitely very scary as Pennywise which is what I always wanted.The camera work was top of line as it was used perfectly to set up scare scenes. One of them will for sure get you! Which one? You'll have to watch to find out!The director (Andy Muschietti) really understood how to scare the audience, there wasn't any breathing time in this movie.A lot of this movie shows how children feel and act when they are scared. Of course, none of the adults are winning parent of the year but it really shows how adults will never really believe what their child is telling them.This movie is just much more frightening because they are children. That was the issue with the second part of the miniseries. I mean it was awful, but on top of that it just wasn't scary because they are adults and as we know you become less scared of things with age.Looking on the controversial side of things, I really hoped they took one part of the book and put it in the movie. Unfortunately they didn't as it would have been ballsy and could have cause some issues. The part I am talking about is where they all think they need to become adults to stop IT harassing them so they did what adults do.

759,kylemcdavid-27399,"An improvement to the original, just awesome!",8,9 October 2017,"Oh my god this movie. This was an anticipated film of mine of this year, and I finally gotten around seeing it yesterday, and it was equally what my Hype was, this was just a interestingly fun horror flick, with some really creepy scenes and other things that make this movie so, superior. Basically the plot is half of the original's story as it only focusing on the kids this time not the adults, but this is just the first film, there will be a second one, don't worry. So really ain't that much to say in which it just a group of kids whose lived in a small Maine town called Derry that have a history of missing children, who are actually killed by an unknown being that can turned into anything that would be feared of, mainly a clown named ""Pennywise"", and up for these kids, whose are being bothered by him and also threaten to be murdered, to destroyed once and for all.This movie have some really good characters, quite faithful to the book, and I would like to nailed-down each one of them. Beginning with Bill, the one who Stutters, he was a emotional character in this one compared to his character in the original who was still interesting, but this portray was better. Beverly was great in this one as she was closed to what she was in the book, a redhead and a tomboy who struggles living with her abusive father, her father was great as he was quite creepy a little bit. The other characters like Ben, Richie, and Eddie were all decent characters. My favorite of the characters is the Bully Henry, who is like your typical bully, a complete psychopath. He was quite intensely insane, but there is one disappointment about him which is one of the few problems of this film, his last scene which I'm not going to give away but it kinda make it looks like how he would be in the Sequel, now in the old one I like it how they shows what all the Kids end-up being as Adults, including Henry, as he became Mentally Unstable like again your typical bully, and that the only positive thing to say about the adult characters in the original, and the last we see of him in this one is kinda have stretched your head. Now I want to saved this character last, and that is Pennywise, now Tim Curly still do a great job as him back in the original, but here the dude who plays him did it more better, as he's more creepy, especially the redoing of the first scene of him in the Kids' section, with Georgie was really well-done, just perfect. I also likes the redoing of the blood in the restroom scene, more creepy as its craw under my skin, for real. The special effects was well-done, and it got a-lot of gore, which all makes this an improvement to the original. There one other problem to bring-up so, the constant use of Jump-scares which is something common in these modern horror films, and I don't like it at all, and you guys should know why I wouldn't. Over-all this movie is a great remake, just a good improvement, and I totally recommend it to you guys if you to see something that craws under your skin, and especially have a fear of Clowns and wants to challenged yourself.",It

762,nbfcblog,One of the Best Stephen King Adaptations,9,1 October 2017,"While the miniseries was far from perfect, it's most fondly remembered for Tim Curry's (Rocky Horror Picture Show, Legend, The Wild Thornberrys) legendary performance as the terrifying children-eater Pennywise the Clown. However, even with the over three hour runtime, certain details or story elements were still changed or entirely left out. One example being that Pennywise was much more cold and demonic in the novel as opposed to Cury's Freddy Krueger-like interpretation.Now, how much a movie is faithful or not to it's source material is of no consequence to me because most of the time..I just want to see a good movie. I don't care how much King hates Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining for being unfaithful to his original story, it's still a horror masterpiece.Having said that, I think the thing that intrigued me most about this latest adaptation of the novel was the decision to split the story into a two-parter with the first movie strictly focusing on the Loser's club story from when they were kids in the 1980's (as opposed to the 1950's in the novel) and the second one with the Loser's club coming back to Derry, Maine over twenty-seven years later to fight Pennywise again as adults.It's a strange choice from an adaptation standpoint since a key element of the novel and the miniseries was it's constant back-and-forth between the two stories in order to showcase the past's effect on the present. The adult narrative also served as the framing device for the child narrative.But in a way, while it may have sacrificed some of the nuances of the novel, keeping the first movie fixed on the past vastly improves the narrative for me because, personally, it made for a much tighter and more intense story. One of my personal pet peeves are when movies make it clear right from the outset that the characters are going to be alright because it kills any suspense. Heck, the movie itself doesn't even make it clear that there will be a chapter 2 until the very end.Plus, I always found the kid story of the Loser's Club from the miniseries much more interesting than the adult story.If I had to describe this movie, it would probably be a combination of the demonic spook- house thrills of The Conjuring series combined with the setting of Stranger Things and the antics found in 80's nostalgic classics such as The Goonies.Even though the trailers have sold It as a horror film and while it is indeed a solid horror film, this is not the movie's strongest attribute. That is because at it's heart the movie is a touching coming-of-age story with Pennywise serving more as a metaphor for the traumas and personal issues that each of the members of the Loser's club must overcome. I think it's due to this reason that the movie not only ends up being one of the best King adaptations ever, but possibly one of the best movies of the year period.This feat is thanks in no small part to the excellent cast. Bill Skarsgard ended up being a great choice to fill in the clown shoes of Curry. Skarsgard's Pennywise is every bit as creepy as he looks and I love how he gives the character a more creature-like demeanor, almost as if at any anytime the unstable Pennywise is on the verge of going full-on monster mode. The character of Pennywise is also helped by the sheer amount of terrifying hallucinations he imparts on each member of the Loser's club in order to bring out their worst memories or fears.While I will always prefer Curry's portray of the character due to the sheer amount of fun he brought to the role and the fact that he iswell.Tim Curry, Skarsgard interpretation is nothing to sneeze at either.But the true stars of the movie are the Loser's Club. For most of the movie we are strictly focused on their perspective and fortunately the quality of the acting is excellent across the board. There is literally not a single weak performance and the chemistry between the actors captures the magic of those coming-of-age classics such as Stand By Me.When it comes to acting prowess Lieberher and Lillis obviously come out on top but probably my favorite character was Richie Tozier played by Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things fame due to his endless supply of hilariously inappropriate jokes and one-liners.I also liked how the sociopathic bully character Henry Bower, played by Nicolas Hamilton who funny enough has been in TWO Stephen King movies this year (The Dark Tower and It), is given some much needed depth compared to his miniseries counterpart.While the film does not skimp out on the horror in anyway (some of the novel's darker elements are included where they were absent in the miniseries), the coming-of-age story and the child actors form the very tender human heart that makes this film seem so special compared to other film's in it's genre.I think this is why I am able to forgive a few of the film's flaws such as Chosen Jacob's character Mike Hanlon disappointingly given the shaft when it came to character development and dialogue, a couple of scare scenes suffering from less-than-optimal CGI and Benjamin Wallfisch's overall excellent moody score getting a little over-bearing at times.So if you are one of the hold outs who hasn't seen It or simply looking for a quality King adaptation to wash away the bad taste left by The Dark Tower..then what are you waiting for?!?!?!",It
763,willnye-74430,Scariest movie since the original,10,27 August 2018,"So this is a brutal, suspense filled horror movie that Steven King himself probably loved and much like Tim Curry, Bill Skarsgård stays in character in character throughout the entirety of the movie. Although I feel that they went a little too far out of their way to make Pennywise scarier in this than the original. Also Georgie's death was incredible and horrifically gruesome, the way Pennywise bites off Georgie's arm and when Georgie struggles to crawl away was great",It

766,Duveteux,Who says Pennywise cannot be otherwise?,9,1 October 2017,"I think a lot of people dive out of cinemas angry and review things before they've had a breather and a think and sometimes a re-viewing can help quell that immediate HATE reaction.I've seen this new IT twice in the cinema because I really wanted to come to terms with what I wasn't happy with and what I was happy with before ranting or approving.I did not like Pennywise as soon as he appeared in this movie the first time I saw it. I was cynical and thought Bill's portrayal was a bit silly and bizarre and not at all charming or funny like Curry.I went away a little grumpy, mostly because of the missing lines. When IT is in the fridge I'd have suppressed a little happy squeal if he'd said ""This is a little inconvenient, Eddie, just hold on while I make a few... adjustments"", it was teasing us that it would be the case when he was tapping his fingers, just teeeasing us!! Or if the sink had gurgled ""you'll die if you try"". Good God, he didn't even say the infamous line, ""Oh yes, Georgie, they float, and down here with me... you'll float too!"" He DOES say ""beep beep Ritchie"", and although I was pleased this line actually made me think maybe it's a good thing he didn't say the rest because I'm not sure those charismatic, confident, cocky lines are well suited to this new interpretation of the clown.Bill may not be charismatic, but there's almost something interestingly naive about the chuckling baby faced clown in the gutter. Something child-like. Something I can see would attract the kids equally well as being charismatic and funny. And the contrast between the baby faced gutter clown and the later deformed by pole through face and menacingly tall and drooling kitchen scene clown gives a good comparative perspective on the manipulative shape shifting monster. Take a look at a picture of the gutter clown opposed to the clown poised to pounce at Ritchie on the coffin lid online and it's actually quite a cool transformation from careful, hidden predator to something all encompassing, evil and powerful.I'd actually say Bill's portrayal is more like a monster posing as a human than Curry's is, because he tries to be human and never quite gets there! He seems more animal, more like a hyena that has learned to mock us. Those wonky eyes, that baffling ill-defined voice - both age and gender are undefined at times. He is consistently strange and ""other"", and that is fitting. Could say he's a bit alien (nudge nudge).So yeah, I like this interpretation, too. It's new. That doesn't have to be sacrilege.Am I a Millennial? I was born in 1988 and I was scared of Curry's Pennywise as a child of around 8-10 when I first saw it, like a lot of ""original"" fans. I like the first adaptation although it isn't scary to me anymore, Curry's acting is still brilliant. I do not think I'm blinkered by the Millennial generation's tastes at all. I don't think it's a generational issue.The reason this film changed the dates from the 50s to the 80s was purely to make the year the next film comes out as close to the true date, implying Pennywise has re-awoken from his 27 year slumber in real time (or approximately). It isn't something that's done to appeal to the Stranger Things fans, but is trying to be clever in bringing IT to life today. The original adaptation would have been set proximate to the modern day at the time just coincidentally, so why not do the same with this one by bringing it forward? Not so much harm in that.As an aside I was very surprised reading someone on here thinking IT is a remake of Stranger Things. Stranger Things is deliberately borrowing a lot from already existent horror, including IT. It isn't a coincidence that is has similarities and it is meant to be like IT. It is a multiple homage.Anyway.IT is not scary. No. I will have no sleepless nights. And I am a horror fan. But I am also just a fan of good movies. This is just good fun, if you don't have to be so precious.It doesn't have to be like the original, and it is a little bit like the book, like how the original was only a bit like the book.Neither adaptation IS the book. And thank God for that cause King is a terribly verbose and slightly pervy writer and he spoils the comparative innocence captured in both adaptations that makes the children so likable.Aside from the orgy, I'm not sure anyone would take to the leper chasing Eddie around offering him a BJ like he does in the book, either. Let's just admit some of that book needs to stay in the book! You don't have to be born in the 90s or dislike horror to enjoy it, and I'm still Team Curry if it ever came down to a Pennywise-off, because that man is just terrifying dressed as a clown and delivers those lines so charmingly.I also appreciate that they gave the kids license to make the characters their own and don't necessarily ""act the part"", I think they all work well. No one, I don't think, is denying that the kids do a great job. I just wanted to put my penny's worth in for the clown.",It
767,CobraLaLaLa,A collection of Crap that floats too,2,5 October 2017,"This movie was a collection of scenes thrown together with no cohesiveness or logic what so ever. There will be spoilers in this review so if you did not see it yet, by pass this review. The kids are not just kids, there dumb kids with no intelligence or wit whatsoever. I looked at this movie, as if I knew nothing about the original. So if you know nothing about the original like many people who were born in the early or mid 90's and up, this movie will not explain anything to you. Here is a quick breakdown of this dumb movie for you. You have a group of kids, dumb kids I might add, who see's apparitions in there town where they live in various places. These apparitions are caused by some evil entity that is a ""Clown"", or at least that is his disguise. No one else see's this clown or his many disguises that he uses. Wanna know why? Me too. Only kids can see him. Wanna know why? Me too. Movie doesn't explain it. The clown killed a couple kids in this movie, and had the chance to kill some of the kids in the ""main"" group, but didn't. Wanna know why? Me too. The kids were scared petrified, but in the movie they said they weren't afraid, but their running around town screaming bloody murder. People usually do that when their scared. Not in the movie ""IT"". I guess they were just getting exercise.The lead girl Beverly was being molested by her Father which was despicable. Towards the end of the movie she cracked him in the head with the top of the toilet bowl, leaving him unconscious on the bathroom floor bleeding from the back of the head, not moving. I'm assuming he's dead. At the end, she moves away to live with her Aunt in Portland. And her Dad? Who knows. As far as I know he's still laying there as I type this. She never called the Cops, her aunt never called the Cops, no Police report, no questioning, for murdering her FATHER! She just gets to move away. Oh, and one of the kids whose name is ""Michael"", killed a kid that was bullying him by knocking him down a well. No one's looking for that kid I guess. And I can guess like Beverly, their will be no Cops, no Police report, no juvenile detention, life just goes on.If I did not have movie pass, and paid some outrageous price for this ticket, I would have been livid. The Clown does many different things to scare the kids and they all work, the kids go running and screaming and hiding. All he does is scare them, never kill them, like he did others. Wanna know why? Me too. But at the end, the very end, they are no longer scared of the Clown. Maybe that's because he never kills any of them, just plays a bunch of scary practical jokes. The Clown in ""IT"" is just that, a Clown.The End. There will be a sequel, as it said the End of Chapter one when the movie went off. Chapter one is enough for me. You can keep Chapters 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 through infinity. If you want to watch a evil Clown do 2-hours of scare tactics, then this is the flick for you. If you want something with substance and a compelling and interesting story line, You wont' get that here. You'll float too. Your thoughts that is when your watching this. Most people call it daydreaming.",It
768,parnell-rj,It just isn't scary,3,17 December 2018,"I read the book, so of course my critique on the movie is going to be harsh. I understand that most often comparing books to their theatrical counterparts is comparing apples to oranges. The biggest problem with the movie is that it's just not scary... at all. Nope, not even a little.
I was pretty excited when I heard about the reboot of the It movie, since the original was a bit comical, although it did a fair job of capturing the essence of the characters.
Unfortunately, I think this movie just missed the mark on every level from the rushed character development to the silly looking clown. It felt like a dressed-up, watered-down version of what it should have been. The essence of It isn't in a scary monster-clown. It's in an unseen malevolent force that haunts a group of misfit friends one fateful summer. It's the unknown, inescapable, and underlying foreboding that lurks ever near. This movie just doesn't get it.",It

They tried too hard on the clown that it doesn't make the movie nor the clown creepy, It feels more like an adventure magic type of movie then a Horror. The old it was 16+ this is more like 12+. I don't say it is a bad movie I just dissapointing that this movie doesn't feel like a horror movie I just hope the second part is more scarier but with that clown im not sure.",It

But that's just my opinion. Still think the old ""it"" was way better and way more scary than this one!!! But you can be your own judge...I'm hoping part 2 will be a little better.",It
772,geno-young,I now have even more appreciation for the original.,5,29 October 2017,"This is the way that I see it. If you wanna be scared and awed, watch the original. If you wanna see a lot of expensive CGI tricks played for shock value, then this is your film. At times I wasn't sure if I was at a movie or a CGI convention. This movie looked TERRIFYING in the trailer, but I wasn't afraid ONCE! The jump scares didn't even work. There's a difference between a film pushing the envelope, and being just plain over-the- top for the sake of crowd pleasing. This one relies on cheap jump scares and graphically gory/macabre imagery at the expense of great storytelling and character development. The kids are all likable characters and their acting is compelling, but their lines and COUNTLESS sexual jokes are tedious, disgusting and depraved. Plain and simple. They make for a very uncomfortable atmosphere. How many times can you spout off the same old ""yo momma"" and d-ck jokes that are older than time itself? It gets very tedious VERY soon! But enough on that, let me get to Pennywise. Bill Skarsgård gives one heck of a performance in this picture, and it's the only reason, I MEAN THE ONLY REASON why I'm giving this film a 5/10 rating. He's over-the-top and really hams it up on this role; he's clearly having fun. But his job isn't to have fun in this role, it's to be terrifying and to stick with the audience and haunt them after they leave the theater, and for decades to come. Tim Curry's Pennywise scared me before I even saw the miniseries, the cover alone caused me to steer clear of the film for YEARS (and that's saying something because I'm a horror buff). But Skarsgård's colorful performance will not have that haunting effect, I'm afraid. I'm not even trying to be extra critical, he simply wasn't scary. There are few things scarier than Tim Curry's pasty makeup and terrifyingly haunting grin on the cover of the original film. Skarsgård's Pennywise tries to be too over-the-top which is where he fails. Less is ALWAYS more in horror films. Graphic imagery and cheap jump scares CANNOT substitute for the terrors of the mind, which is where the original triumphs. Blood and guts are appealing, but not scary. SUSPENSE is what's scary, which this film has none of. Even the clown's makeup isn't scary, Tim Curry's pasty white makeup, and those eyes, oh those eyes, is absolutely horrific to this day. Because of its simplicity and lack of features, you kinda cast your own fear upon IT. It's all psychological, that's the premise of ""IT."" This thing that plays on your deepest darkest fears. Many people dislike the original because of its pacing. I have news for you, in 1986 Stephen King published a MAMMOTH novel! It took 3 hours just to do it justice and to make room for character development etc.. There's A LOT of plot in ""IT"" the novel and miniseries, yet this film misses all of that. As said before, this film feels like ""The Goonies Vs. An Evil Clown"" or something! Substance is what makes a good film, most people wanna see action, action, action and when there's plot and actual story/character development they label the film as ""clunky"" (Example: Star Wars Episode II). It takes a keen palate to understand King's signature edge, and quite frankly, I have reason to believe that such a task is impossible for today's moviegoers. If it isn't shocking and full of depraved, foul remarks that aren't even remotely funny, they think it's garbage. This film isn't exactly a stinker, but it's a far, far cry from a classic. Rule #1 of remakes: Don't f-ck with the original! I find this film tasteless in nearly every way. P.S. : There are MANY plot holes which I won't get into. Read other reviews for more on that.",It
773,maxigarciasoto,IT - Movie review,9,8 January 2018,"I'm not a big fan of thrillers or horror movies, but when i eared that this movie was happening, i was very excited and very curios to see what this movie could live up to.""IT"" is a movie that is about how a group of kid in the little town of Derry, and how this kids come together to fight against Pennywise. A demonic entity that has taken this town over the years and now he has come back to cause some disasters.This movie is one of the best thrillers in recent years, not only for the originality, but for the way is directed, edited, and produced. The production design here is very good, very creepy and dark. From the way this film is directed, you don't even know when the clown will show up again and when is shows up, is very scary. Talking about the clown in this movie (Pennywise) Bill Skarsgård does a magnificent job in this film, he is very scary. Is a very original villain and i was very happy with the way they handled his look and the visual effects to make it even more scary. Keeping on with the performances, the kids in this movie are brilliant, each kid has his own fear, and Pennywise will use that to manipulate them. And you see their fear be represented by things that Pennywise show to them, but also in real life. The tension inside this group of kids that they are going to fight against something that they don't understand all that much, is great, and you really feel that you are with them in this battle, and you feel that you want to help them. Inside this movie there are some things that took my breath away, and I couldn't be happier with this film and i want to see it again. This is one of the best movies of the year, but there are some issues that at times distracted me. For example, in the first act, they show every single fear of each of this kids and we see some very horrifying things happen to them, this all segment feels like they have to show their fear quick because they are gonna keep going, and it feels kind of rushed. Those scenes are not bad, in fact are very good and breath taking , but i don't like the way they put them together. Also, in this group of kid, there is one called Mike. This young actor give a very good performance, but his character is one that we don't learn so much about. We learn about what is afraid of and all that stuff, but we don't know anything else about him. And in some scenes, the group has to come back together, and he just randomly shows up. Instead of the other boys that the talk before they meet again. This are issues that bug me, but not in a great way like ""¡Aaah!, ¡I hate that!"" Is nothing like that. This are some issues that could happen in any movie so, doesn't really matter.So guys, ""IT"" is a very good thriller and one the best Stephen King's adaptations of all time. I looking forward to the sequel in 2019 (I'm not sure if that is the year that the sequel is released) and this is, with out a doubt, one of my favorites movies of 2017.",It

Actors - bad and unconvincing, locations - bad, violence - grotesque, graphic level, clown - ridiculous! nothing of the really scary Tim Curry clown who worked with expression, voice, psychological fear, no, here we have ever screaming kids, (and not for a second did I believe these were kids of the 80s, I am an 80s kids, and it was all just off, the haircuts were just not really like they were etc. and these kids had a way of talking, no one used back in the 80s), oh, and a totally overanimated clown-thing.

I love the book this is based on. I have read it 3 times all the way through and other times just to revisit the creepiest moments. It is truly a masterpiece, and to try and capture all of it in a movie is unthinkable. What this movie does well is it maintains the most important aspects of the original story and focuses on the friendship formed by the Losers. It cuts out the additional world-building that is in the book (I can't stress enough that is it a strong point of the book) and streamlined the tale to focus on the children rather than Derry as a whole. Cinematically, this is brilliant and well executed. A terrifying movie and well done. Jump scares are sparingly used, as it should be for a movie that does a good job of building a terrifying ambience. I can not recommend enough if you love horror!",It

I was very mad at the character waste with Patrick and how they killed him right at the beginning since how crazy he was in the book.

We don't get any character development or explanation as to why he is there, or for any of the things he does, killing and otherwise.The gang of children who are being terrorised by him are OK and watchable, they mostly act logically unlike the protagonists in many of these types of movies.I would class this film as a bit of a ""ghost train"" ride, it throws lots of things at the viewer and definitely passes the time, but 20 minutes before the end I was itching for it to just finish.

My review of!!!!! Just saw this movie last night' expecting to Crap My pants since the original did. If your expecting IT 2017 to be very scary' and to blow your pants off ' don't bother seeing it. I was kind of disappointed and was expecting the new IT Film to deliver more of a frightening bloody more detail FILM. This is a whole different FILM nothing like the original from the 1900s. the new IT FILM has nothing to do with the original.. this movie should have had some part with the original. This movie in my books Did not deliver.... The only good things about this FILM. the kids in this movie worked hard. This Film has more blood than the original'. this film shows what kids did in the 1980s ... This film has more violent scenes' I would say this NEW It Movie will beat the original in Blood' violence' swearing' just overall more going with the flow....The bad things. The movie was rushed' the movie does not follow the original' the Film kind of does not make sense and this Film is not very detailed like the original... The original was planned out ' it had major twist' it just had more details' the original had you on your seats wanting more' this new film does not... The new it FILm was OK and yes I will watch it again but is it worth waiting for nooooo. The 1990 Clown was more real ' the new Clown is more scary but is more Fakeish not very impressed with the director going with this new clown look. It very well could of been way better and could of delivered a much better much more detailed Film Like the original did.... The original will go down in history as being the best of killer clowns... Hopefully IT 2017 for part 2 will be better. Maybe it will change my mind and give me something that's like the original... You never know.,It

You'll Float Too!,8,14 September 2017,"No one can adapt the saga Stephen King has written accurately because it is simply too big to be adapted into just two movie, but still 'IT' will surely scare you. I just loved how terrifying Pennywise is. I loved how one of my favorite chapters 'The Apocalyptic Rock Fight' is there in the movie with a kick-ass score in the background, I loved the kids who played the characters, I absofuckinglutely loved the BGM and I loved the comic relief; it was hilarious. What I didn't like was the excess of scares. It's not bad, but whenever I remember conjuring, I think that's the way to make a horror movie, the buildup should be so terrifying that you don't have to put that much closeup shots of the entity. Next, I have had the same problem from Andy Muschietti in Mama as well. I hate the overtly done CGI. Keeping it real is more scary than those cartoonish transitions the CGI monster makes. Apart from that, I loved it. 8 on 10 I just love when they do it in the old school way! Regarding the climax ****Spoilers**** It was decent. I mean, IT feeds on fear and it was somehow justified. They couldn't have put up the orgy thing in the movie or it would have been banned, but yeah, it was a poetic thing and hard hitting at the same time.

He'd make a good joker replacement to the grandiose Heath Ledger.I expected the kids to just be a screeching annoyance, but wow they can act! I was especially impressed by the very young brother. They looked genuinely terrified in a contagious way, which made the movie credible.It's deeper than just a monster movie. Each kid has dark social issues that may be worse than the demon. Some scenes were brutal. The children's courage was inspiring.Stephen King is truly the master of horror, and I am happy that someone made a movie to show ""it"".It takes talent to turn something fun and silly into something terrifying.I also enjoyed the movie: Clown (2014)",It
786,Alanaji_16,"""Best Horror Movie Of 2017""",8,26 October 2017,"IT directed by Andi Muscheitti is a coming-of-age horror thriller. It's not just another horror movie where the makers try to scare the viewers by throwing too much violence on screen. This film has a well made script which talks about friendships, fears within teenagers, their bonding and so on. The film tells us the story of seven kids led by a kid names Bill, who are bullied,who find themselves in a situation facing a demon names Penniwise, the dancing clown. For any horror movie to work out, it should have the fear factor which IT has and that too in well proportions. I would like to mention the scenes which scared me out of hell but it would doing injustice to the movie. Those scenes are to be experienced. But the film, as I said before, does not rely too heavily on the horror factor but also has its own light moments. The bond between the characters are done well and you feel for them, such is the way of presentation. Technically too, the film does not disappoint. The Music and the Background Score (Benjamin Wallfisch) was terrific. The cinematography (Chung-hoon Chung) was also good. Editing (Jason Ballentine) was done neatly.

787,savagerox-39160,Frightening flick,8,17 October 2021,The made for TV mini series was cost prohibitive and limited it's impact although still pretty scary this one pulls all the stops. You already know the story this one is visually stunning followed by an equally scary sequel. The Stephen King movies of late have eclipsed some of the lesser ones The Mist and Dreamcatcher come to mind. Childhood nightmares come to life on a grand scale in this movie.,It
788,pkollmeier,"What a buildup, what a letdown",5,7 December 2017,"Oh man. I read Stephen King's IT a couple years back and was enthralled. It's creepy, funny, disturbing, inappropriate and so much more. To say I built this movie is up is quite the understatement and honestly this is the first negative review I'm writing on here. I feel bad doing it but we all have opinions and I suppose we are entitled to them. That said, IT is not a good movie. There is just something completely off about this film that starts when the movie rolls and it never quite goes away. First, it's not scary. Yes, I know fear is subjective so maybe you will think it is, but I'm just not sure how. I saw people giving Pennywise Freddy Krueger comparisons before the film was released in the U.S. and I couldn't sit still at work that day. Freddy Krueger?? I went on a Thursday evening, before its technical release in theaters, and boy was I met with a feeling I can't really describe. I felt broken. First, the movie is choppy. The editing is all over the place and even after reading the book, it's hard to know how a lot of these characters even come together in the film. I can't begin to fathom how difficult it would be to make a novel into a movie. I really can't. Especially this one. But, man, did I have a completely different vision for this film. After reading on the Duffer Brothers and their push for this film (rejected) into their eventual success with Stranger Things, it does now seem that IT as a high-budget television series would be perfect. For starters, there are so many characters and stories essential to IT that didn't make their way into the film. It would be impossible to get them all in there, but as we are currently seeing, a television series (if done correctly) is an excellent way to build characters, story lines and emotions throughout a 10-episode run. IT would have benefited from this medium.Second, the scares are completely random. The audience sits there as Pennywise scares his victims one-by-one, almost like we are all on a carnival joy ride. Throughout IT, I never felt any sort of connection towards the characters or the town of Derry. I actually thought the creative change to the 80s was the wrong move as well, and it felt like the actors were standing there reading lines in this choppy, strange format. The bullies were cringe-worthy. From the onset, Henry Bowers wants to kill the losers but we don't know why. We aren't shown into anyone's world (except Bev Marsh's) and those are by far the scariest scenes of the entire film. The casting of Mike and Stan is also very bad and it all just seems so cheesy and fake. I wasn't a huge fan of Bill in the movie either, honestly. Then, when some key creative changes are made from the source material later in the movie, that was about it for me. The creative differences were just too much and I saw this film playing out in a completely different light.It's tough for me to give a negative review of something because I know just how hard these people work to make a film and to create their art. I kept getting a Jim Carrey Grinch vibe from Pennywise throughout the film and I saw the evil entity more as a demon when reading the novel, and less as a stereotypical monster as this movie makes him out to be. I never got that feeling of dread I felt reading the novel and I definitely didn't get a sense of evil in the town of Derry. I'll be passing on Part 2, unfortunately.",It

I liked the original much better, this one was just bad. I know lots of people are going to say ""how was this bad"" but this is just my opinion. It wasn't scary and that kinda disappointed me. I used to have a fear of clowns but I don't anymore because this movie helped me get rid of that fear.

So I took the plunge, and I'm so glad I did.Super creepy but not in a cheap, startling type of way. It was more of a sick, twisted anticipation of what was coming next.The humor was incredible and so well intermingled with the drama, suspense and horror. There were definitely some laugh-out-loud funny moments that give you a chance to recover from your last creepy interaction with Pennywise.

The performances by the cast was actually very good, and naturally the story is good too but many years ago I saw the original and read the book and it terrified me. This film didn't terrify me and trust me I am generally scared by most horror films. For me, the scary people were just not scary and quite badly done from an SFX viewpoint. They looked made up and it was just laughable. I've been waiting for ages to see this new release and I thought I'd love it, but I really didn't because it just wasn't scary enough. Now the positives are that the cast were great, especially the kids. All of the characters were brilliant and I loved the element of humour they'd injected into the movie with the kids. So I'd score the younger cast 10/10, just brilliant. Overall I'd say it was the SFX that let the film down.",It
796,neon_demon,Flawed but Fun,5,27 September 2017,"I don't want to pick this one apart in too much detail as it did raise a lot of questions while I was watching that were just never answered.In short this is a mostly entertaining if maybe too long winded movie loosely based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. For those who missed the 2 part mini series starring Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown, that movie was basically a direct to TV affair that lacked most of what made the book such a great read. This movie does provide some more blood and shape-shifting effects that its moderate budget allows, but it doesn't go with the source material in providing too much in the way of background into what Pennywise is and what the link to the town of Derry is all about. For me this is one of the main issues with the movie.The young group of early teens provide plenty of light-hearted banter amidst their ongoing trials against the supernatural Pennywise and their issues at home/school. The problems that each in the group experiences during the over 2 hours of run time are never really explored to any great detail so after a while, the skin deep quips start to lose their impact as we don't learn anything more about the kids other than what we get in their opening scenes.Pennywise too begins to lose his impact as he appears in nearly every scene of the film during the 2nd and 3rd acts. Again, his antics are enough to hold your attention for most of the film but it becomes apparent pretty quickly that no one is in any real danger apart from the peripheral bully characters who, as it turns out are way too unlikable to care about anyway (even though they are still kids).Make no mistake, this is not a kids movie or one which you should be taking your kids with you to go and see. The horror elements are pretty full on for a major studio release while the sound and score of the film adds to the terror moments with pretty good effect.All in all its a decent enough film, but by no means is it one which will have you recalling characters names, memorable lines very long after you vacate the multiplex.",It
797,hmxaraj,Not Impressed at all,4,12 October 2017,"I haven't watched the original movie but if this is an absolute remake of the older version then that movie was also ridiculous. Not for one second I felt like the movie was horror at all. The different parts of movie were not connecting to each other. The movie clearly fails to make the viewer understand that what is happening and why it is happening.There hasn't been a lot of acting on part of pennywise but his getup was good.The only two positives from the movie were the acting skills of Jaiden Lieberher (Bill Denbrough) and Sophia Lillis (Beverly Marsh). That stranger things kid didn't met my expectations.This movie is not worth the hype its getting.Its a waste of your 2 Hours , better sleep em out or do something useful.",It
798,nicole10221991,So much potential and hype but one of the biggest let downs in horror history!,3,29 August 2018,"As a horror film fanatic, I was looking forward to this movie thanks to the trailers and a brilliant marketing ploy; Pennywise returns every 27 years and the original film was released in 1990 as this remake marked the 27th anniversary of the original film. How brilliant. Watching the film in theaters I was very impressed with the Georige scene as it gave me hope this movie was going to be badass. I was wrong. I felt there was too much editing, not enough character development and awkward uses of cgi. There would be an awesome scene but its cut short! I don't understand why this film has gotten so much praise and great reviews. I think the fan girls of Bill (Pennywise) are to blame for the success because honestly if you take ""the hot guy"" as Pennywise away you still have a boring film. Honestly fans who love this movie can you give me examples as to why you love this film (and not because Bill is hot) I will say that the kids in the film were great actors it would have been nice to see them reach their full potential but their scenes were too short. I won't watch the sequel and I will only give this film a second glance if there is an uncut version out there. Hollywood; enough with the cgi, the remakes and the fear of truly terrifying people! This could have been a great horror film but it was a bore.",It

800,dvdbvvmn,Better than the 1990 TV adaptation but...,7,12 September 2017,"If this is your first encounter with the story but haven't yet watched the film read the book first. Or even better watch the 1990 TV adaptation if you can't wait long but I suspect this film will be a disappointment.If you haven't read the book and don't know the story you will wonder what is going on if you have watched this for the first time. The whole story isn't just about children, it is about them as adults because Mike Hanlon stays in Derry and realises that children start disappearing again and he contacts them all to promise on their vow to return.Back in the 1990s I read the book twice and it is my favourite Stephen King story. I also had the DVD of the 1990 adaptation for a long time and to me a comparison is almost inevitable (for me anyway).One thing I have to say is that I think the portrayal of the clown in this version is much better than Tim Curry's but the children in that version had much better chemistry and more character development in about 90 minutes than this version did in 2 hours. I think that is the only thing that really lets it down.The other is that in the original story (if I am not mistaken) it is Mike Hanlon who does the research in to Derry's past events rather than Ben Hanscombe and that reduces Mike's contribution to the story which I think is a bit sad.",It
801,justinpkelly,"Beep Beep, Richie!!!!",8,10 September 2017,"Here it is! The most anticipated horror movie of all-time? But did it live up to the hype??I can answer that question with a resounding ""yes."" For those of whom wanted a movie full heart, creativity, and fun, this movie will be very satisfying for you. I thought the characters were very fun and that I really had bonded with (most of them) by the end of the film. Beverley, Eddie, and Bill were the standout characters for me and thought that they were great. Pennywise was also very well-represented; he was definitely creepy but was also very funny in a couple of scenes which I thought was great since he is a clown. All of the creatures and weird things that Pennywise morphs into were also so devilishly creative and creepy. I also loved 99% of the CGI effects for Pennywise with the exception of when Pennywise kills Georgie (I thought the CGI in that scene was horrible). The movie was just a breath of fresh air when compared to most horror movies nowadays which are filled to the brim with clichés and feel incredibly predictable. It was so much more creative than most horror movies are and was even a little insane (in a good way). It's also ridiculously well- directed and looks gorgeous. The movie's not perfect though, and I do have some problems with it. First of all, the music and sound effects were a huge problem. They were all loud, obnoxious, and annoying and it was completely unnecessary. That was one of the things about the movie that felt very ""2017"" to me since so many crappy horror movies add those ridiculous loud noises to make the scene feel scary when it's not needed. There were also some scenes that seemed to tonally conflict with the rest of the movie like when they clean up the blood in Beverley's bathroom to 80's music. That rock throwing scene was also just ridiculous and should not have been in the movie. I was OK with the fact that this movie had fun and even comical scenes sometimes, but those scenes in particular stood out as out of place and it was quite bothersome. I also felt like some of the characters were never really fleshed out, particularly Richie, Mike, and Stanley. After leaving the movie, I felt like I never really got to know them on a personal level, unlike some of the other characters. Also, Henry was used in the movie pretty poorly in my opinion. I guess they kinda tried to flesh him out by showing how afraid of his father he was, but it honestly just wasn't enough. Then he kinda just goes insane and starts trying to kill anyone (and I don't care if the book explained what happened to him, the movie does not and so I have to ding it for that). I also have to admit that Beverley waking up just from receiving a kiss from Ben felt a little lazy and I think that could have been better.Overall, I had an absolute blast with ""IT"". I think it's a really fun movie and was a lot better than most horror movies that we get nowadays, but it was not without its problems. I hope that the next part of this story will be even better and I can't wait to see the characters as well as Pennywise back on the screen once again.8/10 Grade: B+",It

804,hearthstoneivan,The Horror Adventure genre at its finest!,9,28 September 2017,"8.8/10 (Space for an over-saturated ""It"" pun). Advantages of recent critically-acclaimed horror movies usually are a reliance on the atmosphere rather than jumpscares and a well-thought out concept. Surprisingly, the main advantage of this particular horror movie is the plentiful amount of other genres, ranging from a Lovecraftian adventure to a teenage drama. I certainly don't mean it won't make you check your closet late at night, shivering in cold sweat, but that if it didn't, it would still be a serviceable experience. I have yet to read the book,that Mr.King allegedly wrote heavy on crack,so i won't be able to compare the gory details of both.Instead i'll brag on some more about my feelings towards the cinematic counterpart. The Losers' Club surprised me undeniably. And with what you ask? Hollywood has a past with struggling to find decent child actors, so imagine my reaction when all of them are acting to the point of perfection. The adults in the movie seem like directly written by the ""King of Horror"" himself , as any traits of reasonability get thrown out of the window. Tim Curry is considered an iconic take on Pennywise by a major amount of people. Beg to differ,i considered him too silly and unintentionally comical to make your blood run cold. As for the new Pennywise, well he freaking rocks. Skarsgard succeeds in being both frightening and delightfully zany, without letting you feel any other way than disturbed when he is on screen. Even this movie has its occasional silliness, which (when is played the right way) I don't mind. The one thing that bothers me is the pacing. It's not too slow or too fast, but kind of formulaic. Every kid has to have his own encounter with the entity and it feels like the director is checking boxes. The boy with the glasses met the clown - CHECK, The girl met the clown - CHECK and so on. This is not necessarily bad, but the movie just keeps going with these scenes, one after another, without giving the viewer room to breathe. And the day after they get scared shitless after the first date with The Dancing Clown, each of the kids acts like he doesn't remember it happening. Does Pennywise visit them on a set routine and they are kind of used to it? Or into it? Who the hell knows? The individual jumpscare scenes are superb, but they fail with meshing them well together. Thankfully, this goes on only for the introductory chapter and after that the movie gets the right to shine. What I really appreciated is the way the Losers communicated. When I was their age, I swore like a sailor in the company of my scurvy shipmates, so I am amused that kids in a big Hollywood movie finally talk realistically.Conclusion: The new Stephen King adaptation hits almost all the right marks, with a ""Stranger Things tone and ""Stand by me"" themes. All the kids have their moments to shine, Pennywise has a magnetic screen presence and the cinematography is stunning. The first act felt formulaic, but as the film continues it makes up for it. ""It"" is a bloody good time at the movies that guarantees a lot of fun. Damn, I slipped.",It

The fear and apprehension that should have been sketched as it's supposed to be when your brother is killed off by a paranormal evil entity was watered down by the all over the place spectrum of emotions.And by God the length of the movie was way overstretched for the content that they had to offer.Just...mediocre B grade movie.

It's about a group of children living in Derry, Maine who are constantly terrorized by a creature in the form of a clown named Pennywise. in order to end this terror, they decide to confront pennywise in the sewers, whilst dealing with bullies and their own personal demons in the process.I'll start by saying that I've never read a book from Stephen King in my life. since I'm fifteen now, beforehand I've only learned of his stories through the movies adapted from his books. I've learned of the best movies adapted and the worst ones adapted from his stories. seeing as how this is another adaptation of the book of the same name, with the last adaptation was in 1990 in the form of a TV miniseries which is seen now as more of a joke than an actual film to be scared of. does this new version of Stephen King's famous novel fare better than the miniseries? or is it just as much of a joke? I'll be happy to say that this movie exceeds on every expectation I had for this movie and it is even better when you think about it often enough to see it again. however a review is still a review and I must give pros and cons no matter how much I love this film. so what do I like about it?first off: Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is Friggin Fantastic. this could be his best role to date. every scene works whenever he's on screen and it always pays off. not a single dull moment with this performance as well as this character and you know what- I'm actually scared to see him sitting in the corner of my bedroom before I head off to sleep fully knowing all this is fictional. if a character sticks in your head like that after seeing a movie because of the performance, you know It works. the child actors are especially amazing. watching them, you actually do get the feeling of their friendship within the losers club or the insanity sweeping over the scenes with Henry Bowers. much like Bill Skarsgard, there's never a dull moment with these actors and their performances and everyone in the losers club gets a moment of heroism in saving each other from the dangers they face and every emotion just works. the scares while not scary (and we'll go back to that later) are still frightening and creepy. from the first scene where we meet pennywise, to any scenes with him in it, to any scenes with the bullies, to any scenes taking place in the sewers. it's creepy and it always pays off, while not in the way that you'd think it'll work. The cinematography is beautiful and completely makes you feel uncomfortable in certain scenes, and more intrigued in others. The music from Benjamin Wallfisch also adds to the uneasiness and intrigue of the movie and it works in every level. I still hop onto youtube just to listen to some of the tracks. What don't I like about this movie? well, I guess the only gripe I have with the movie is that While it is creepy and some scares work well enough to traumatize viewers, the film is never like so scary you just can't take it. a lot of the scares are very easy to handle if you're a lot older to see a movie like this like if your above 13 or 14 (cause obviously anyone underneath the age of 10 cannot handle movies like this unless they got the heart of a lion). movie isn't scary-scary but it still works as a tense filled movie and the fears driven within it work to it's advantage. So overall, The movie is AMAZING. I encourage you to go see it. even if your not a fan of horror, you'll walk out of the theater very happy you saw a great horror movie such as this one like I did. if not, well film is subjective cause everyone has a different opinion and I understand if you think differently. go watch it and see what you think but trust me you won't be disappointed you saw IT.",It
817,bluejeffb,What a tragic mess,5,23 March 2020,"Really didn't want to have to compare it to the original TV mini series but ultimately it's inevitable.
I think most fans of the book thought the original adaptation was generally very good but had it's faults, not violent enough for one thing and a poor ending, although to be fair Stephen King doesn't write endings which are all that easy for film-makers to replicate.
One thing the TV version did do though is capture the magic surrounding the kids and their almost complete togetherness as a collection of ""losers"". No disrespect to the young actors here but they simply are not on the same level as those of 30 years ago. Also, Beverley looks 5 years older than the boys for one thing !!!
And why rip up so much of the book's important story lines and then have different characters saying things which originally belonged to another. I know this was done by Peter Jackson in the LOTR trilogy but it was done in a very logical way which helped the films continuity.
And the comparisons to Tim Curry's Pennywise aren't even worth starting !
Such a let down after all this time.
Worst thing is I've now got to pick myself up and watch the 2nd part.
After that, it's gonna be another re-read and then re-watch the mini series just to make me feel better.
Such a let down after all this time waiting.",It

819,SciFiandScary,"Big fan of the original, but loved this It!",8,22 September 2017,"IT is one of the best horror movies I've seen this year. The only other one that stands up with it is Get Out. It was extremely well- done, from the directing to the acting. It was a perfect mix of moments that make you laugh, and scenes that make you cringe. They did a great job on not relying on jump scares for every little thing like almost every other horror film released recently. It is dark and sad and hopeful and fierce all at once.Really, there were only a few things in IT that I didn't care for. Some of them can just be attributed to the fact that in comparison to the original IT, they come up lacking. Mostly, the actors. The main one being Pennywise himself. Bill Skarsgård had his own version of Pennywise, and I thoroughly approve of that. He did not try to imitate Tim Curry's version. His Pennywise was much darker, and rang true as an insane evil. However, I honestly believe Curry's version was scarier. (My partner commented that if they would have had a guy dress up in the suit and let Tim Curry be a voice-over, it would have been perfect.) Curry's Pennywise was all the scarier because he could appear so weirdly evil and funny one moment, and be deadlighting you the next. Also, the Richie character seriously lacked Seth Green's charisma. I know Richie is supposed to be an obnoxious snot, but Seth Green made Richie a funny obnoxious snot, and therein lies the difference!On the other hand, I absolutely loved Sophia Lillis as Beverly. She did an amazing job. Lillis practically glows on the screen, and is completely believable. I couldn't take my eyes away from her when she was on screen. I cheered (mentally, because movie theater!) for her on more than one occasion. I also applaud the choice to not overly sexualize her. Even the scenes where the boys were ogling her were very tame. This was a fantastic move in an age where people feel the need to push the envelope with sexuality in young girls. Whereas in the original IT movie, Bill was my favorite, Beverly definitely shines brightest this time around.Speaking of Bill, Jaeden Libeberher does a great job. His performance is on par with Jonathan Landis' in the original. The acting is spot on, and when Bill is openly hurting, I hurt with him. Likewise, Jeremy Ray Taylor did a great job as Ben. He was as believable as Sophia Lillis was. You just knew that Ben was a sweet kid with a good heart. This version of Eddie was better, as well. Mouthy little hypochondriac.One of the only other things I didn't like about IT was the way they shot Pennywise. The rapid-jerky-fast forward movements are overdone. Every flipping horror movie with a ghost/demon/evil does them lately. It wasn't a deal-breaker, obviously, but the movie would have been great without it.Overall, I really liked IT. It was considerably darker than the TV version, with far less camp, and left me curled up in my chair. At one point I had to consciously take my fingers away from my face because I was afraid I'd walk out of the theater with big fingerprints on my cheeks! I went into the movie trying to be open minded, but still fairly biased towards the original version. By the time I came out of the theater, I realized that this IT was just as good as the original, but not in the same way. I think fans will be able to appreciate both versions for what they bring to the table.",It
820,JoeBagz,IT... should have been better,4,23 January 2018,"ITNo spoilers. Pretty mediocre effort but a decent film based on a novel by Stephen King, which I have read several times since it was published. 
The Plot: A loose knit group of nerds come together to fight a monster from the past that returns to hunts children... eventually stalking them. It's a great plot, timeless even. Worked great as a novel, seems much more of a challenge as a film. 
Screenplay: was decent and had to have been a challenge to pick and choose scenes with so many characters to develop from a book that's almost 1200 pages long. That said the opening sequence was pretty creepy. 
Direction: Think the film starts to lose traction soon after when the director forces the actors who are kids to try and act like kids. Tried too hard to make them look and act like losers, made them sanitized versions of kids. Andres Muschietti and the cast should have watched the 1995 film 'Kids' before the shooting started. Lastly, many scenes drag on way too long, shock value goes away pretty quick. 
Cinematography: The film is shot in such a way that the audience never 'feel' like they're in the shot, more like they're just watching from a distance. Need to stay in your face, up real close for it to work.
The Climax: Again just mediocre and way too drawn out.
Overall worth a watch maybe but given the budget could/should have been a lot better.",It
821,ildimo-35223,'80s aesthetics bullseye,6,13 December 2017,"Even further than just being an '80s revival product - you know that thing that started out as nostalgia (Super 8, Expendables) and is now a full blown mania (Guardians of the Galaxy, Stranger Things, etc.) that rules box-office and, on occasion, pop music - ""It"" is the correct one. It has the structure, the aesthetics, the ""each face corresponding to its mirror image from the era"" (there is a homework for you truthful ones!), the meta-jokes (""It's bullshit, it's a Gazebo!"").
It is it.Watching it one gets a good idea of why King is the pop culture royalty he is -he digs into the collective fears of the western id AND the American superego locating the source of trauma - here racial tensions, disintegrated family, bullying and incest take the cake.Muschietti is in complete control of his means, anything more tempered would miss the point of it going full retro, I can't see how the 40-ish generation (who liked it back then) won't be charmed by it.Hell, enjoy it while it lasts. Directors/screenwriters/designers and DPs who grew up in the '80s are now having their field day feeling kids again, recreating the seeming simplicity of it all.

823,woodcoinmagazine,It's full of holes and gimmicks,1,6 July 2018,"Why this film received any critical acclaim is the only scary thing about IT. And why it has any fan base at all is truly frightening. Aside from a handful of capable child actors, the script makes no logical sense and the CGI frights are so basic and ordinary that BABADOOK looks like an artful masterpiece compared to the dull incomprehensible fluff of IT. To start with, having the clown amputate a 7-year-olds arm is a sick marketing ploy to show how ""edgy"" the director is... Yet by the movie's ramshackle conclusion any intelligent viewer wonders how every single member of the nerd club from junior high makes it through with barely a scratch, cleverly defeating the clown by ""not being afraid"" despite the actors jumping and trembling at every cliched movement the clown makes. Aside from some minor scratches, the only injury (a broken arm) is the result of falling through the rotten floorboards of the phoniest haunted house ever put on film -- each terrified teen miraculously escapes the slow-moving clown even before they figure out that It's power is wholly based upon their own fear. Except... Wait... Other people are also ""floating"" in suspended captivity without being eaten (as the 7-year-old was gorily consumed) because they also must have figured out the secret of being fearless in order to be floating. Add on a few one-dimensional single parents from Hell --that their offspring can murder them without consequence -- and a few missing older folks never explained or explored -- and it's easy to wonder who the villain is. And let's just ignore the bloody bathroom scene that only the teens can see and, miraculously, can clean with soap and water... Even the fabric shower curtain! Why the girl not murdered in that scene despite her quaking fear is beside the point. With an entire town's population connected by a sewer system it's quite a puzzle why the clown keeps chasing after the nerdy kid club instead of eating or ""floating"" anyone else for over two hours of cinema crapola. What's even weirder is that HBO labels this kid's movie with a R-rated ""rape"" rating just to make it seem all that much more graphic. Yet there is no rape, only hints at incest or physical abuse. The scene with all the middle-schoolers in their underwear at the quarry is an attempt to show their vulnerability? Or maybe just soft core kiddy porn of them splashing and surreptitiously masturbating while a turtle lurks in the watery depths? This, the most intriguing scene of the film, has no plot point whatsoever. Strangely, though, to sit through the entire film is a bit masochistic in that it's got just enough suspense (due to inarticulate reasons for the clown being active) to keep a viewer annoyed yet hoping for entertainment to somehow happen. It doesn't.",It
824,anonveli,They finally nailed it with a Stephen King adaptation,9,27 September 2017,"When it comes to horror, Stephen King is regarded as being the master. Not everyone agrees with this, but there are very few people that would disagree that It knows which buttons to push. It is one of King's most recognizable works due to his play with coulrophobia, otherwise known as the fear of clowns. I've personally read some of the book and I've seen the 1990 version starring Tim Curry as Pennywise. This version had its pitfalls and unfortunately brushed over some details that would have helped it stand a bit stronger as a film adaptation. For these reasons, I was a bit reluctant to see yet another Hollywood remake for something that I wasn't sure even needed a remake in the first place. Let's take a closer, spoiler- free look at what this remake offers.The Good: All the kids played their characters extraordinarily well. Normally I'm not the biggest fan of children actors, in fact most of the time I'd prefer they not be in movies or shows. Nothing is worse than when you're in the moment of watching a good movie with a solid performance from the entire cast, then some little **** jumps in and yanks you out of it with terrible acting. For this I can say that I was impressed to see all the kids own their characters and behave like actual, non-acting kids. I was also curious to see how Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things would follow up in It and he absolutely nailed it as Richie. He played the perfect little, wisecracking smartass that Richie is in the book which is a sharp contrast from his role in Stranger Things. Good things are on the horizon for him for sure, let's just hope he doesn't follow the road of other children actors, ahem Corey Feldman.The story ended up being vastly different than that of the 1990 version, which in my eyes is a good thing and is also kind of risky. I felt that the first film captured the spirit of the book a little better even if it wasn't perfectly executed. Overall though, I can understand why they made changes where they did. First being that the story is set in 1988/89 and the time lapse will bring us to 2016, allowing modern technologies to be a part of the story as well as making it generally more relevant to a younger audience. The key points were kept in place which made the minor changes along the way seem ultimately insignificant. The story still takes place in Derry, Pennywise is still Lord Commander of the sewers and the Barrens are The Loser Club's stomping grounds. If anything, some of the changes add motives to character's actions which I liked quite a bit (IE; Georgie's fate, which if you've read 10 pages of the book it's not really a big spoiler).As far as the horror element goes, I wouldn't really define this is being the scariest thing I've ever seen. They did a fantastic job with the atmosphere and making each scene uniquely creepy, but 90% of the scares are predictable. That's not a terrible thing because they didn't rely entirely on jump scares (although there are a few) and they focused more on building tension through the course of the film. There was also plenty of variety in the ways that Pennywise antagonized the kids, and I do love a creative villain.Speaking of which, I haven't forgotten Pennywise, the star of the show. The biggest concern most people (including myself) had was that the costuming and characterization of Pennywise came off as too menacing and therefore not in the original spirit of what Pennywise is in the books or the original film. Despite his gnarly makeup and fancy Victorian getup, he had a lot of qualities that made him friendly to naïve children but just creepy enough not to trust. I was not disappointed in what they did with Pennywise and I loved his interaction with the kids in the final confrontation.The Bad: I'm not one to nitpick too much at CGI since most movies have it now, but there were definitely a few moments that I felt weren't necessary to use it. It wasn't all terrible, but it was often used whenever Pennywise was around and there were some scenes that absolutely did not need it. Practical effects aren't always perfect so I'm not saying that it's the cure-all in this situation. The film seemed to rely very heavily on CGI and I'll be curious to see how this holds up down the road.As much as I like Richie, he's also probably the sole source of the R Rating. The writers tried to throw in as many F-bombs as possible and I'm not entirely convinced that it was necessary. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a solid R rated movie, but that's a rarity in theaters now because most studios are afraid to lose money over it. For this reason, every instance of ""fuck"" in the movie felt somewhat forced just so that they could get the rating they wanted. Then again, most 13-year old boys usually don't know how to communicate outside of using expletives (and neither do I), so maybe it was the appropriate amount of usage and I'm just nitpicking.Check out the rest of this review and more at TheCynicist.com",It

I wanted to try proving this by taking my daughter to see It but my wife refused saying that she would have nightmares. I mean she was willing to see it proving that it can't even scare a kid. When it comes down to it Hollywood needs to stop trying to force child actors in our face, I mean they are bad just cause one is good doesn't mean you should keep relying on them.

827,ventery,IT Horrified Me,8,4 December 2018,"I was a bit apprehensive when I heard about the new adaptation of Stephen King's IT because I have a fear of clowns and horror movies just don't seem to scare me anymore. However, IT has most certainly managed to horrify me in the most amazing and scary ways possible.Set in the the late 80's, IT follows a band of bullied teenagers from a town called Derry who face their worst fears when a shape-shifting creature starts snatching children from the streets. Together the children set out to banish both the creature and their tormentors which takes them on a harrowing journey through adolescence.What made this film particularly terrifying was not so much the cannibal shape-shifting creature that was killing the children but rather the situations the children had to face both at home and at school. Here you have a town that is in disarray and teenagers free to roam about the streets without any proper parental guidance, resulting in a horrifying portrayal of everything that can go wrong with parenting.The brutal and real-to-life portrayal of bullying gave me the creeps and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. From innocent name-calling to the brutal attack on a boy with a knife, IT covered the whole scope of bullying and painted a horrifying image of what children are capable of.Moreover, there was no end to the acting talent in this film with Jaeden Lieberher as Bill Denbrough and Sophie Lillis as Beverley Marsh, not to mention Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. Lieberher whom I have encountered in other films was astounding in his role as Bill. He portrayed a stuttering, grieving older brother with great ease and managed to captivate me from the beginning. Sophie Lillis whom I have never seen before IT, was brilliant in her role as Beverley Marsh and Bill Skarsgard made a pretty impressive cannibal clown.Aesthetically, the film had everything you would find in a horror movie -- gratuitous violence, blood and gore, a shape-shifting monster and jump scares that would have frightened me more if they weren't so predictable.Nonetheless, IT is a coming-of-age story that portrays everything that could possibly go wrong in childhood and how significant events can impact who we grow up to be. Dealing with themes such as bullying, child abuse, teenage hormonal angst and grief in such a horrifying way, makes IT one of the best horrors of it's time.",It

It's almost like the writers and director went to some standard book of what scary movies had in the '80's, and just copied what they saw. EVERYTHING was predictable and boring.Also, the lead female character, Beverly Marsh? Nope, I could of bought her as a 17 year old, not a young and inexperienced 13 -14 year old girl. Her character was ruined. Where's the abusive dad? Why write a scene showing her almost (ick) flirting with a pharmacist? She looked WAY too old to be hanging out with the pre-teen dudes.

What about the children when they stop floating; wouldn't they be brought back to life?Not to mention the length of this movie. Over 2 hours for a simple and predictable (as in not complex and interesting) movie is way too long. You have a thousand attempts at jump scares, and the clown really isn't scary.

834,greenmemo,A love letter to the Stephen King oeuvre and an unforgettable and magical cinematic experience,10,7 September 2017,"The hype is a killer, but this movie knocked out of the park nevertheless. People who are saying that this film is not scary have no idea what they are talking about or must be too used to the usual tropes of horror movies of late. This is one of the most unrelenting, upsetting and nastiest (in a good way) children centered movies to ever make it to the big screen. This is HARDCORE Stephen King, with a memorable villain at its center (mesmerizing Bill Skarsgard performance) and a group of kids fighting demons (supernatural and the others) and grappling to figure out the inner workings of social life, learning about solidarity, facing the ugly facts of life and even becoming murderous under certain circumstances, while adults remain scary caricatures in the best Roal Dahl tradition. In more that one way, this is the definitive thesis in fear. You meet the characters through those specific things that they dread the most, and all these fears form a rosary that starts swirling around this enigmatic figure of a deranged clown who ""feasts on their flesh and feeds on their fear"". Director Andres Muschietti does such a sterling work in highlighting the best of Stephen King prose here that is surely going to bring a tear to the eye of the most devote readers. He takes licenses too, and even make bold choices like the use of the 80's soundtrack which I found exhilarating at times, or the source of blissful release in moments when the dread sank too heavy upon my chest. This is a visceral experience that must be experienced on the big screen but be prepared to have your senses assaulted!. I was riveted, and only at the beginning of the 3rd act the film's momentum seemed to wane slightly, but by the time the character of Beverly wakes up the movie grabbed me again by the throat. Muschietti conjures some seriously unsettling imagery helped by a cgi has an abstract quality to it, like the over-sized Pennywise in one hell of a scene that got the whole audience gasping, or a Modigliani painting come to life; the musical score is also brilliant, as it is the sound design.

I walked out feeling a little bit like I did after watching the Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit series of films. The basic storyline was there, as were many of the events that occurred in the novel, but like the Tolkien adaptions there were too many jarring omissions, additions, other assorted departures from the book for my liking. There were also a tremendous number of continuity errors, mostly concerning characters falling into/being doused with various liquids in one scene, then in the next (during which essentially zero time has passed) being completely dry. The acting was very good - all the characters did a good job in their roles, Bill Skarsgård is a worthy successor to Tim Curry, and was a pleasingly revolting Pennywise, the child actors continued the course set by Stranger things, and were neither annoying, or whiney most of the time, as children in films often are. For a 135 minute film it zoomed by, normally I consider this to be a good thing for a film of this length, as it means I have enjoyed the film, and/or the content has been paced correctly. In this instance, however, it felt rushed, very rushed, as mentioned above, a large amount of content has been omitted from the book - the individual characters stories were heavily truncated. I get the feeling that this film was very much released as a stand alone film, and had it failed at the box office, there would be no part 2 (thankfully this has been averted), and am expecting, a year or so after the second film there to be (like LotR) a very much extended version released, because there is so much that could have been added to the film without making the film seem too long.

This really was a fantastic film.There's jumps and laughs and even some sad scenes. It's not just horror, it encompasses a variety of emotion and brings me back to my childhood to a time when being a kid was like living a fantasy.Acting was top notch here too, these kids are great. Anyway not much more I can think of but check it out I mean it!!",It
839,brownpelican,Disappointed,1,16 January 2018,Don't waste your time. The movie drags on with no real plot. It's a long 2 hours 15 minutes. No different than the first It movie. Not even worth the rental. Don't get the really great movie reviews but to each their own opinion. The ending like the entire was nothing out of the predictable boring conclusion. They beat up the monster clown killing it. Then romance brews with two of the children. Good movie to fall asleep on though.,It

If the movie would have taken only 20 minutes of the 2 hours and 15 minutes of it, to explore the characters, and the rest of the film would have been scares, i'll say that it's bad. Fortunately, that's not the case. All the actors are great, and Bill Skarsgard is a great Pennywise. But, the real heart of the movie, is their under age actors, they are so charming. This movie will be a symbol for this generation, not for traumatizing it, but for marveling it.",It
841,bunsen2019,Up Close and Personal with Pennywise,7,10 September 2017,"It is the end of the 1989 school year in the beautiful town of Derry Maine. Summer vacation has begun for Bill and his friends 'the losers', and they're dodging their psychopathic bully classmate Henry and something even darker lurking in the sewers below. IT delivers the jarring contrast of sweet childhood friendship and warm small town summer days with the everyday dangers of molesting parents, bullies and the far worse supernatural terror of Pennywise the Clown. The film is rife with 'jump scares', but the pace is too fast and repetitive. There are too many encounters with the Losers escaping Pennywise. The director gives into the temptation of turning the movie into a 'chase' film. Pennywise is too revealed, stripping away his mystery and terror. The magic and eeriness of a good horror story are mostly missing. The viewer doesn't need to see Pennywise's tonsils, nor in extreme close up. The art of the horror story is lacking and veers instead into action film territory.",It
842,nickyjohnp,"""Hi Georgie, would you like a balloon?""",7,28 October 2017,"From the insane mind of Stephen King comes IT, which was originally a novel from 1986, than the 1990 mini-series starring Tim Curry that everyone know's, to the long anticipated R-Rated feature film that was released September 9, 2017. The film explores what the mini- series couldn't do, with a more expanded story-line and more dark humor that is like the comic relief besides Richie, also the fact that in the background you see Tim Burton's 1989 Batman is playing at the movie theater. That's pretty cool how they included that I think also how they kept true to the novel and the mini-series is important to me as it show's consistency work's in this situation, while obvious changes were made for good reason's. Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise was amazing as it introduced a new, next generation, creepy clown. And the balloon's were good but used a little bit too much as in the beginning they were good by the end it was okay. The acting was solid with the kid'shaving actual lines that kids nowadays would use (authentic). Andy Muschietti directing and his wife Barbara Exutive Producer P.G.A., a ton of writer's and Stephen King's seal of approval make this a fine film to watch not only for it's reputation but to enjoy.",It
843,theresamansweto,One of the best movies of 2017,8,10 September 2017,"I didn't get to see a preview screening of IT but what influenced me to watch this movie was the constant good reviews by people and celebrities like The Rock posting an Instagram post praising the film, but also because I thought it was exciting bringing back a classic Stephen King adaption and upgrading it to a good length. The movie overall was brilliant and believe it or not it felt quite different to IT ( 1990 ). I went into the cinema with high expectations and it did meet them I have to say. In terms of it being scary and giving you nightmares may be a little over-exaggerated, sure the movie was scary especially if you imagine yourself as the children of Derry, but it wasn't cover your eyes scary if you know what I mean.The actors were spectacular and I'm talking more about the main children cast and being probably the same age as them myself I would die to be a cast as one of the children in the losers club. The actors were so professional that you really feel as if they are friends and that they have a close bond. What really impressed me was Jaeden Lieberher's performance. He was probably one of the main characters but also he managed to take on stuttering for the whole movie which I thought turned out amazing considering him being about fourteen years old. Finn Wolfhard as Richie was probably my favorite character for introducing a comedic dialogue into the movie which kind of chilled out the cinema. Bill Skarsgård plays a good clown and all I could think was: next Joker. I thought the way he talked was very disturbing and the voice you could remember for a long time, I will always think of him as Pennywise The Dancing Clown.There was a lot of special effects that the movie took advantage of because of the disadvantage the 1990 version had with lack of effects. I thought they used it in mostly a decent amount of times and ways which didn't spoil the movie.The thing I liked about what the director did was express the name of the clown and the backstory, in IT ( 1990 ), Pennywise was barely said but in this 2017 version they introduce the clown as Pennywise The Dancing clown, and also they expressed how Pennywise returns to Derry every 27 years which I thought made the movie better. I thought the ending wasn't bad although I'm not gonna go into too much detail so I don't spoil the movie, I am going to say it is a must see and the movie deserves the credit it is getting when the amount of work that went into the movie and the marketing team was really smart when promoting the movie like putting red balloons in the sewers on the premiere night and putting Snapchat filters for the movie and all sorts of stuff, and I really like how a red balloon is now a symbol for the movie. I am glad I can call this movie a classic.",It
844,noahlenzi,Loved IT,8,12 September 2017,"My expectations for IT were to get a few scares, watch some likable characters, but most of all be entertained. It's a film about a killer clown, not Citizen Kane. IT exceeded my expectations. I didn't get terrified, I only jumped a few times yet it never lost its pace and the intensity. The monster itself was incredibly done and chilling to watch. There was a combination of make-up, practical effects and CGI to bring Pennywise to life. His first appearance at the beginning had me a little worried for a second. I was thinking: ""he's kinda funny actually- OH SH*T""! It's an incredible performance from Bill Skarsgård and I hope he doesn't quit the role.I found the group of friends to be very entertaining and funny. The Losers Club as they call themselves are a group of characters we can truly root for. We want to see them make it. The development is good for the main characters of the group but a few of the others felt left out in the end. The film also opens with one of these characters but that character is non-existent for nearly 20 min after that. Its a small editing flaw and hardly subtracts from the film.I loved watching IT but I think we need to stop pretending like its a 10/10 movie. Overhyping a film can lead to the wrong expectations. As long as you have the same expectations as I did you'll love it. IT is a good time at the movies and might be more scarier to some than it was for me but IT is nonetheless less a great watch.",It

Well, read to see what to expect.",8,15 September 2017,"I like this version of the movie, not more or less than the 1990 mini series, each one has its own charm.No spoilers.1. This movie is more stick to the book than the original mini- series. Of course some changes have been made as all book to movies. 2. Is not for hardcore terror fans because the Director killed the suspense or tension from some scenes by adding jokes right after a scary Pennywise scene. Even though all people in the movie theater jumped more than once. 3. People saying the 1990 mini-series is scarier it's because they were KIDS when they watched it. I'm a hardcore IT fan, I love it since the mini series was released but if I re-watch it, I realized it was not that scary but when kid I had a different vision and innocence.4. For those who complain about CGI, what they were expecting? This is not 70's, 80's or 90's, ALL horror movies have CGI on this days, or they still like to see ketchup as blood and jello as brains?If you go trying to compare it against the mini series or expecting to be 100% faithful to the book, let me save you some money, you WON'T like it.

It has a good plot and a bit of comedy here and there which does not compromise the horror. A very good watch. I would recommend watching it in cinema for best experience.

849,joan-37304,Good: don't compare to the miniseries,7,8 September 2019,It was overall a good movie. The beginning was great and very shocking because of the fact that pennywise bites off the kid's arm. The dialogue between the two was great. Already loved the actor who played ritchie because of his part in stranger things so he couldnt do anything wrong. People's mistake is to compare the movie to the miniseries but that's not the way to look at the movie. You have to see it as an individual movie and based on that make an opinion. You cant simply unlike it because you think it sucks compared to the old miniseries.,It

Too-polished, CGI-heavy effects that didn't land like I thought they would; didn't feel very palpable, and it was jarring from the tension. Having grown up traumatized by the original movie, my anticipation of the remake gave me more anxiety that the actual movie.

854,Jo-Cino,I mean...,5,8 September 2017,"... yes, i thought Andy Muschietti did a nice job directing this movie. ... yes, the kids were a lot of fun to watch throughout this film... yes, Penny Wise was recreated in a way that every purist would be satisfied with.but the story?.. oh man, more holes than Swiss cheese! Where are the Suicide Squad critics when you need 'em? I've read a ton of these reviews here and i am just amazed at how many people just don't care that the actual story was a complete and utter mess! Does anybody even TRY to consider the basics of storytelling when watching movies anymore?? There should be more to the story than, ""Avoid the clown, he's trying to get you - get him before he gets you""For starters, they never really clarify what 'IT' is - or why - or how to kill IT... or when to expect IT... or how to avoid IT.. or how it became IT etc. There's no rhyme or reason to IT and there will be no explanation, so I hope you're not expecting one.IT never is explained! They never draw a line and let you know when IT is playing with their minds or when IT is real and physical - or why... or why THESE kids are being haunted. Are any other kids being haunted? (Is this even a haunting?!) Why can some see it and others can't? What does IT want?! (Geez!!) Oddly enough, they spend more time focusing on each kids' parents, who are all abusive in some way, whether physically, sexually, or emotionally, than they do developing the Penny Wise story. Virtually every parent is ugly inside in some way and they never connect these dots. Even the town pharmacist is a lurking pedophile (""You look like Lois Lane"" wink~wink) They spend all this time on the parental development and none of it factors into the ending or the rest of the story. Makes no sense WHY they would have chosen to spend the time here.They do make a quasi attempt to show one of the kids interest by showing him researching the town's history in the town library -this leads to the kid running through the library basement trying to get away from killer clowns - but as it turns out - they're not even real!! Just a figment of his imagination apparently.But, then there are the over-the-top, neighborhood bullies that do a little more than simply knock your books out of your hand and poke fun. These thugs are out for blood for some reason (literally). One day, after catching one of their favorite targets they decide to carve initials into his belly with a knife (yes, fourteen year old bullies). The kid somehow breaks free, a chase ensues which leads one of these bullies right into an above ground sewer. A few minutes later, the bully is shown being attacked by a group of killer clowns while in the sewer... you may assume this was just a figment of his imagination too, right?... but no - this time, it was real. Why was this one different than the other? How do we know this one was real? Well, it certainly wasn't because the bullies were talking about it, or mentioning it at all. Matter of fact, the bullies carry on each day beating on kids as if he was still right there in the group.The only way we know his interaction with the clowns was real (?) was because there is a two second clip that shows someone posting a 'Missing Child' poster with the bullies image - but it's business as usual otherwise.**SPOILERS** The young girl is captured at the end of the movie and then looks down Penny Wise's throat at some kind of light.. this seemingly puts her in a trance and now she just floats - er - hovers in the air looking up at the sewer. No explanation!... however, when the group finally catches up to her and finds her floating, one of the kids grabs her and kisses her - magically, her spell is broken and she is normal again... no explanation!... why? To follow up on the hovering girl... during this same final scene, everybody is in this big room where it appears that all the missing kids from the years before are floating in the air in a slow, circular motion. They are doing nothing but floating... NO explanation... just floating... now, one would assume that just like the girl in the group that had her spell broken by being kissed that these kids were not actually dead (?) and could be saved (?).... Once Penny Wise bids his farewell, the children start floating back down... but... that's all you know. Do they wake up? Are they floating down to die in peace? Do they all walk out together? NO EXPLANATION!! As far as the other elements, i thought they tried WAY too hard to copy Stranger Things, going so far as casting Finn Wolfhard. I thought this was a really bad idea. Not because of Finn (I love this kid!), but because it should have tried to separate itself from Stranger Things - not try to get closer to it.The kills were ALL pretty soft. Nothing creative. For example, when they killed the main bully, he only fell down a well (he deserved such a bloodier fate!) Penny Wise was smacked around a little with some clubs but he left on his own terms (he wasn't actually killed!) Meh... too much, ""NO EXPLANATION"" for me. It was an OK movie. It was entertaining and some of the shots were nicely framed. The score was pretty nice and eerie at times. Many of the elements that you would have wanted to excel were all here – it was just the bad story line that's tough to forgive.",It
855,Nolafilmmaker,Outstanding! Not so much scary as it is engrossing,10,9 September 2017,"I went into this movie on the fence about it. I did like the trailers a lot, but the film was extremely hyped and I wasn't THAT excited to see it. However, it blew away my expectations. One thing this film did extremely well was tell a story. No, it wasn't all that scary, but more of a mystery/thriller, which was OK with me.The cast was perfectly cast, and everyone had great chemistry together. The film also really did an excellent job of creating a mysterious atmosphere around Pennywise and his taking of the children.Though the film was over two hours long, it didn't feel overly long at all. Overall, a great movie. It really captured the atmosphere of the small town and the events happening, and also did a great job of creating a mystery.",It
856,FilmWriter569,Renewed my faith in moronic horror movies,3,12 September 2017,"I never go to horror movies -- haven't seen one in over a decade -- because nearly every one of them is made by those lacking talent for an audience that lacks any understanding of what potential the horror genre is not living up to -- other than taking everyone's money. They are never scary, never frightening, never edge-of-your seat thrilling or any of the above -- OK, maybe if you're a 13 year old. I just don't comprehend what people see in so much garbage that is produced for this movie genre. There is so much potential for some great horror films, yet they are, time after time, so poorly made. A movie that truly gets into one's psyche and creeps you out -- I suppose that's my definition of a horror movie, but show me one that's been made that does that for anyone else than the teenage-mentality masses. That's because they don't know how to make them. I thought this one might be the exception -- because the trailer looked good. ...and that's where my compliments end --- The marketing was truly the most talented thing behind this movie, hence it's opening-weekend revenue. But don't let that fool you. It was boring, boring, boring. Nothing is thoroughly explained. The characters are unconvincing as it is overly acted in every scene, therefore horribly acted. Slow. boring. Not scary. A real snoozer.",It
857,bigbenjr48,"""IT"" Wasn't What I Expected",6,23 September 2017,"I despised the made-for-TV movie, and this theatrical version only fared slightly better. Here is how I summed up this one by character portrayal:1.) The naive Beverly Marsh from the mini-series was portrayed more like the naive Beverly Marsh from the novel. But the Beverly Marsh from this updated-retelling was portrayed like a nymph who knew more about her sexuality than she was suppose to know. Her father (stepfather in the novel) was portrayed in a way to have us suspect that Beverly kept his bed warm at night. But thankfully, at least they included the scene with Beverly and the blood-spraying bathroom sink.2.) Ben Hanscom was portrayed accurately (save for substituting his love of ""Highway Patrol"" for ""Boy-Bands""; which was an awkward change, but no big deal. He was just the right size as portrayed in the novel, and bullied by the Bowers gang in the same way. But the problem I had was the missing encounter with ""The Mummy"" (who was ""IT""). This was instead substituted for a basement encounter with a headless corpse. But overall, I'd say Ben Hanscom was more on the mark.3.) Although Bill Denbrough had the stutter down-pat, the person portraying him was just too darn tall. This was one of the same problems I had with the TV version. In fact, most of these actors were too tall. He was also too demanding that they help him find his brothers killer, as if they had no choice in the matter. In the novel he was more begging/pleading for help. Bill's father was more of a grouch in this than he was in the novel. There should have been a tad more screen time for him to show his softer side.4.) Richie Tozier was the same jokster as portrayed in the novel. Even though they showed the statue of ""Paul Bunyan"", they never showed his encounter with it when ""IT"" possessed it (tongue- twister). Richie instead had no personal encounter with ""IT"" until later (in the novel, Richie dismissed his encounter with Paul Bunyan as a bad dream). The only problem I had with Richie was that he spoke so fast that I couldn't understand much of what he was saying most of the time. And there were times all of them spoke fast. It was as if they were speed-reading their lines.5.) Stan Uris had little to do in the novel just as he had little to do in the TV movie, and he also had little to do in this version; so his character was spot-on. He was more intellectually aware of what was happening and how impossible this all was. His mind could never come to grips with how something so unreal could be so real. Although they showed the standpipe in this movie, they never showed Stan's encounter with ""The Dead Kids"" when he ventured inside of it. Also, they didn't touch on his love of bird-watching (birds became his power of escaping ""IT"").6.) Michael Hanlon's character was completely skewed up in this film. I can't begin to tell you how much they skewed up every detail of his being and his place in the Losers Club. For those of you who read the novel, you'll know exactly what I mean. What was up with that step-daddy? Where was his real daddy? What was up with that Sheep- farm? Where did that come from? Mike's role was so minuscule that his character was almost useless being there. And that's a shame since he was a major character in the novel. All he did was follow them around with little to say.7.) Eddie Kaspbrak was another speed talker who I could barely understand at times. But at least they had his ""size/height"" correct. His fear of all viruses, diseases and bacteria was just as funny as in the novel, and his mother was near perfect. And thank goodness his encounter with the Leaper was included...just not his original way of escaping.8.) Pennywise. Well, Scooby-Doo has a new voice if they ever need one. But I still liked this portrayal a lot more than Tim's (I know that's blasphemous for those who never read the novel and only saw the movie). I still had the same problem with ""It"" being a Clown for 90 percent of the film like in the 90's TV movie. In the novel, ""It"" only morphed into Pennywise when he wanted to attract children. He mostly became your worst fear in the novel. In both movies he mostly killed as a Clown.In conclusion:Beverly: too tall. Too sexual a persona. No Mother. Talks to fast. Bad portrayal.Ben: No encounter with ""The Mummy"". Portrayed well.Bill: Too tall. Well portrayed.Richie: No ""Paul Bunyon"" encounter. No ""Teenage Werewolf"" encounter. Talks too fast. Still aptly portrayed.Stan: No ""Dead Boys"" encounter. Portrayed well since his character was small in the novel.Michael: Horrible. No father. No Mother. No encounter with ""Giant Bird"". Not enough dialogue to judge portrayal.Eddie: Portrayed good.I'll end by saying; the Losers Club entered the sewer via the Barrens, NOT the house on Neibolt Street (as shown in this movie). Their point of entry was from a sewer-cover in the Barrens where they played. And oh boy, did entering the sewer from that damn house suck up everything for me.I'll give it a 6/10. But 6/10 ain't all that bad, because the TV movie is still worse, Imo.",It

I thought the Horror genre was getting back on track especially after watching Get out and another title I can't remember the name but I was wrong.
All the blood splashing, ugly dolls, disfigured creatures, all the nonsensical stuff you usually find in lousy horror movies were in it. 
This movie does not make sense. It's just a mix of ""try to be frightening scenes"" put together with many weak connections and zero real explanations. 
The CGI part was excellent, the kid from Stranger Things was good, but it was not enough, in my opinion, to make IT a good movie.

859,Retrochamber,"Nothing says ""strong together"" like killing a killer clown",7,30 December 2018,"I am a bit annoyed about the little sunshine features of political questions, I understand the basic underdog concept in a horror story, but somehow I feel that the 1990's pic was far more of a horror film. I think I experted a modern form of art film, a bit more avant gardy. It's funny how people demand realism in an unrealistic plot. Of course, Stephen King is widely known for his realistic dynamics especially with young characters, but that put aside, I expected more of an experimental flick. There is an annoying blockbuster feeling about this. And regarding the fact that Skarsgård did a tremendous job visualizing the clown, I felt like the children where presented like superheros in a way, and that is probably what makes med think of the politics. I don't want to see superheroes against the clown; I want to see broken kids with broken souls from broken homes and broken world views get physically dragged into the concept of challenging Pennywise.",It
860,Tucch,"IT... (a paedophiles dream, a Scooby Doo fans nightmare)",5,5 October 2017,"I'm not gonna play around, I'll just cut straight to the points. Things I didn't like:Pennywise (the clown) sounded very similar to Scooby Doo, imagine Scooby Doo, with a slightly menacing voice and you pretty much got Pennywise voice down. Seriously I didn't know whether to laugh or what whenever he spoke, don't get me wrong he was scary sometimes but most of the time I was laughing at how much he sounded like Scooby Doo or struggling to hear exactly what he was saying (on one part he even sounded like Daniel Day Lewis in 'There Will Be Blood')Some terrible acting from the kid that took the pills in particular, mixed with every character not being likable, except the fat kid, neither none of the kids being relatable, neither much bonding or growth between characters either, I don't think the black kid in the film even got a chance to speak did he? For real characters were weak as hell.The violence towards children & amongst the children was absurd & I'm not even a religious person. I've played violent games like Manhunt, GTA and watched movies like Natural Born Killers, all my life, so you could say I'm very desensitised to this stuff. Although even I thought the situations the kids found themselves to be in were just borderline satanic and added nothing to any kind of horror, art or creative elements, just pure shock value. It just seems asif many scenes were made to set the bar even higher of what things can be shown in films these days. You know typically in a movie, if it's like a home invasion scene for example they'll show a man shot, even a woman shot. But when it comes to the child, you just hear the sound of the gunshot and maybe see a small body bag later on. This film does not do that. Within minutes we see a child with his arm cut off, and later, we see the same kid shot point blank in the head with a cattle gun. By kid you might be thinking like some 14 year old who looks like he can pass for 17... Nooo no, i'm talking about a 5 year old here, 6 at the most. Is this the kind of entertainment you wanna see? Really? I thought people were overly desensitised when films like Hostel and Saw came out, I shudder to imagine the kind of things people will class as normal in 10 years from now. (Shocked the rating was a 15 to be honest) The fact other people haven't mentioned this and shot it down for this has annoyed me too, it's disgusting.Another message the film seemed to convey throughout was sex and profanity amongst those viewed as innocent. It was asif Hollywood's top paedophiles, Charlie Sheen, Roman Polanski, Victor Salva and the rest of the gang all got together and decided to make their dream film, a film where kids run around in their pants, shout obscenities every 5 seconds, & make sexual references every 10 seconds. And we're supposed to believe this is set in the 80's? Go watch an 80's film, people didn't speak this bad back then, it's like they wrote a script for 2017 kids, but their environment just looks 80'sish. I think they really failed to capture the spirit of the 80's with the script. I know 18 year old, 20 year old, older, younger with more restraint than these kids, it felt odd throughout the entire film with just how much bad language was said.Why was it that eveeeeery parent was a big bad wolf, I'm not talking 1 or 2 I'm talking eveeeeery single one in the film. Actually no, it was every adult now that I think back, from a sexual abusing dad, to the emotional abusing dad, to the black kids overly harsh guardian, to the main kids dad who we see in one scene talking smmmmack to his kid (and his mom who doesn't exist) to the kid who takes pills who's mom had this evil way about her, even the pharmacist was a full blown paedophile, who the young girl just knew would fall for her young charm, like am I the only one seeing this!!!! I saw it with my aunt, and we both saw it the same way. There was a very menacing undertone throughout this film that either... (A. People are too desensitised to see it. Or (B. People are seeing it but nobody is talking about it.I felt almost asif the film is a part of an agenda to desensitise people to paedophilia, something which, would not surprise me with all the things I've heard from Hollywood.All in all I gotta say, horror wise it was better that most the crap that comes out these days, it's got plenty of scares that come at a really balanced rate, it's not just clowns either, you got zombies, abstract things, ghosts, all sorts, so as far as that goes it gets a good mark. The overuse of CGI (which was expected for the director of the unbelievably terrible Mama) really let it down though in my opinion, I can't seem to find things that I can see too be computer generated as scary. To be honest I could go on and on about this film, the ending was terrible, some parts didn't even make sense. I'm baffled as to how it's almost made IMDb's top 250 films of all time to be fair. I gave it a 6/10 and with its disturbing undertones and it's debauchery, it's lucky to have even got that, maybe if the films wasn't so obviously a product of the ages we live in and it could have produced scares withing sinking to sick levels, I could have rated it higher. But nope, it's a low 6 for me.",It

The first is definitely terrifying and probably the best scene of the movie as Pennywise eats poor little Georgie. The kids in the movie are spectacular and definitely are the best part of the movie. There are some very scary scenes like the projector scene though some of the scares fall and some of effects are not very good. Finally Bill Skarsgard is a great Pennywise. He has very great performances that can be both terrifying and quirky at the same time. Just remember everyone that the sewers are a great place play in so you can float to🎈,It
863,alexkkarvell,Contender for laziest film of all time,1,30 September 2017,"This is not really a film. It's: - a bunch of horror clichés (e.g. nobody seems to be able to run 10 meters without falling over) - a handful of sub-plots that go absolutely nowhere - 90's CGI - cringe worthy Americanism (e.g. friends cutting hands to bind a promise) - a mess of characters that don't develop, don't have anything unique about them and don't need to be in the filmI can only assume the people who liked this have all read the book and therefore knew the story going in, because the film is not going to explain any of the following: - what the clown is or why it is doing this or what his powers are - what relevance 27 years or the towns history has - why none of the adults seem to mind their children missing - why the police don't go in to the sewer - why the adults don't see what the children doYou could literally remove 70% of the characters and it would make absolutely no difference to the plot.Make no mistake, you may like the books and the screenplay (minus the CGI) is quite good, but this is a terrible film. If this film scared you then do yourself a favour and don't watch a legitimately scary film with an actual plot like the exorcist because you'll probably have a heart attack.",It

I came into the film as a skeptic and was blown away by how dam good it was. the clown was very well done and surpassed tim curry. the only thing i have to say that was bad was the cgi in it but its not as bad as some of the cgi in horror films. the acting was well places and you can really feel the kids realness. it has some good jump scares that even me got me to jump. im not going to give out spoilers and stuff like that. i really recommend it to any horror or stephen king fan out there if u liked the 1990s version u will be in for a very good surprise on this one. it does drag a lil but its not to the point where u fall asleep(unless ur like my sister LOL) but it was well done.,It

We all wanted to get up and leave as this is so boring and not scary at all. These reviews where people are saying it's scary and creepy are totally wrong.

This barely has plot, it's more funny than scary, the characters have no clear motivation, and for almost half the movie there is nothing connecting scenes! No plot points! There are more filler scenes than actual plot advancing scenes! And the best part is: This is only chapter one!

868,criticadelcinema,One of Stephen King's best screen adaptations is somewhat soured by tonal missteps.,7,12 September 2017,"From the moment the iconic opening sequence ended, (book readers and fans of the miniseries know exactly what sequence I'm talking about) I felt something was off. This same feeling persisted through most of the film, but I couldn't quite place what was off about IT. During the third act, I finally understood what had been bothering me. Pennywise just wasn't scary.Like many of Stephen King's screen adaptations, IT squanders much of it's potential. Not to say this is a bad film. In fact, this is one of the best King screen adaptions to date. But at the end of the day, IT is a horror film. Horror films are made to be scary. Is this scary. Well...Not really. This brings us back to my original point of Pennywise not being truly frightening. For a character that is supposedly draped in mystery, the film chooses to lift the veil on the iconic clown far too early. Much of the effective scenes are built off the implication of It and not the actual bucktoothed, erratic, borderline humorous clown. Only when we get quick glimpses or partial views of Pennywise does the film really shine in it's horror aspects. Where the film truly succeeds is it's cast of characters that aren't dressed as clowns. Since the film chooses to focus solely on the childhood portion of the original IT novel, we follow a cast of preteen children. This could have gone horribly wrong.Inexperienced director? Child actors? Horror film? IT averts this recipe for disaster with strong performances by it's young leads—with some help from an excellent script. Finn Wolfhard (who you might recognize from Stranger Things) is the obvious standout here as he provides some hilarious comic relief. Jaeden Lieberher is just as impressive in his performance as Bill Denbrough, the film's stuttering protagonist. Surprisingly, there is a fair amount of emotional moments in the film, and most of these moments hinge on Liebrher's performance. The comedy between the kids works, Wolfhard is undeniably funny in nearly every scene he is in. But, the good comes with the bad (as with nearly everything in this film). The constant comic relief actually deflates much of the tension built in the film. After every scare we are immediately hit with jokes or situational humor. The shifts in tone are glaring here, something that definitely took me out of the film.I enjoyed IT. While my expectations weren't met on the horror aspects of the film, I was surprised by the character depth and the performances from the young actors. While IT is ultimately disappointing, it delivers a genuine coming-of-age story with a few good scares.",It
869,bsempowski,Better than the book,5,26 March 2019,"This movie is fairly good, suspenseful and slightly scary. However I overall think that Penny wise is not very scary and his voice is not as intimidating as I thought it would be.

Overall I would recommend this movie by would never recommend the book because I believe it's 1000 page sleeping pill that's disturbing I will change your opinion of Stephen King. I would highly recommend this movie however I should I would consider it more of a psychological thriller that a horror movie. On the interesting to see what the sequel is like.

Whilst the first scene starts out pretty good, soon the movie derails into a strange mixture between an 80's kids movie, drama and horror. In addition ""IT"" tries to deal with issues such as friendship, sexual harassment, bullying and...oh yeah, there's also a scary clown as a bonus. The movie lacks a clear motive and story line and basically fails on all of above counts. The horror which is haphazardly thrown in between other types of storytelling is not even truly scary as it is mostly quite ridiculous. IT does not manage to find balance on any front: it does not know whether it's a drama, comedy or horror, it does not know whether it's intended for adults or children and it does not know how to edit all these scenes together. The scenario is a random succession of scenes which are vaguely connected. I don't feel like writing much about this highly overrated movie. Simply speaking, a boring and uninspired mess.",It

875,joakim-ericsson,An honest review from a 40+ guy who read the book,7,6 October 2017,"Really liked it, but it's not perfect.Hard to judge how much of the liking is because of the 80:s (like Stranger Things) nostalgia, but it's far from all of it.+ Kids act great, especially ""Ben Hanscom"". Good touch and psychology in the coming of age scenes. Dark and serious social stuff in between the jump scares. Like most Steven King stories, the best parts are in between the horrors. As a member of my own hometown's ""loser club"", as a kid, I really felt like I was one or all of the protagonists. The film has a good heart. Pennywise is a great mix of a powerful, psychopathic, godlike entity, and a playful kid. Scary and sad at the same time. Music is good too.The pacing feels rushed, scenes are stacked on top of each other in a ""too fast"" tempo, just to stay true to the book. We don't have enough time to really get to know our young heroes. I feel this movie could really have benefited from being 30-45 minutes longer, or even better, a 5-10 hour TV series.I think this story is hard to do justice in 2 hours of film, but it does a good job, the visuals are also great. Art direction and all.Overall: Way, way better than the weirdly over appreciated 90:s TV series. I saw that as a teenager, who really looked forward to it as well. It sucked then, and it sucks now. Don't understand how that production was ever talked about by fans. Tim Curry might have been OK, but the dialogue, makeup, production value, and acting (except the kids) was horrible.This adaptation is 10 times better.

From there on it shifted very fluidly between horror and comedy. I really did think I was watching a new Goonies film. By the end of the film I was thorough disappointed.On a positive note, I thought Bill Skarsgard played a good Pennywise; a little endearing even!

878,ConnorMacleodoftheClanMacleod,Beep beep...,9,30 May 2019,"Before I begin my review I believe that everyone is entitled to their own views which is why I won't slate the previous pessimists... oops.I watched this film the day it arrived in cinema, I could not wait to see it on the big screen and unlike some I was not disappointed. I have been a huge fan of Mr King and his world since sneaking my uncles VHS copy (look it up kids) of 'The Thing' to my room to watch when I was 9 years old, spending almost six months as a 15 year old trying to conquer 'The Stand' and imaging myself as 'The Gunslinger' well, until now. It is no secret that in all of Mr King's stories there has been the immortal struggle between good and bad and that is exactly what this adaptation shows, the good vs the bad.I've read the comments stating that there was too much CGI within the film which in turn ruined it, pish posh! We live in a world now where you can sit in a cinema with 3D glasses, moving chairs and screens as large as football pitches (soccer to others). Why should expenses not be paid on amazing CGI, do we as wonerfilled fans not deserve the best? The CGI mixed with the phenomenal acting of Mr Skarsgard truly encompasses all that is right with how cinema is moving forward, we as the fans want to see the horrible creatures that Pennywise can turn into, we want to be scared, we want to be made to jump out of our skins, we want to go home walking passed drains and empty house and have butterflies fill our stomachs and this film provides that perfectly!Not only does this film terrify but it also inspires. Whoever was in charge of casting I take my hat off to you. The child stars of this film rival any who grace the acting world. Watching this I believe without question the friendship levels portrayed, the love lost between brothers and the love gained. From the get go you root for those in The Losers Club, you sympathise with them and share their pain. I can't reiterate enough how believable each of them truly are and I can't wait to see them in Chapter 2. I laughed, I cried and I was terrified!If I have to be negative about one thing, and I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel, them it was the fact that not all of the book was in the film, that said we've still got more chapters to come, and I can't wait!Just remember folks this is an adaptation, it'll never be perfect and that is the perfection to it.Honestly, we watch films as a form of escapism, I think people forget that.

879,gemimah-henderson,Totally disappointing,5,31 October 2017,"I wouldn't believe anybody who has read and enjoyed the book who tells you they thought this movie was a satisfying experience. It might be scary for pre-teens, but it has nothing of the unsettling supernatural build up of the book, or any of its 'sympathetic observer' style social commentary; there is none of Stephen King's chilling blend of everyday human cruelty and humanity turned cold by supernatural intervention. Instead it just skims the themes of the book and cherry picks the elements necessary to create a likeness of the book's story line. There are so many opportunities in the book for a genuine horror or thriller film that were for some reason neglected in favor of unremarkable CGI monster scares so generic they are laughable and unenjoyable. I believe that even someone who has not read the book, would find the movie lacks depth, what with all the scares so conveniently staged and glossed over in order to bring the viewer rapidly to the climax. The source material in its entirety obviously cannot be adapted into 2 hours of film, but I do think they would've done better homage by following closer to the narrative pacing of the book, building the scare scenes slowly, at the cost of the lengthy CGI chase scenes. After watching 3/4s of the film, I turned it off and I wanted to contribute my disappointment. As far as storytelling goes the movie is a failure in my opinion.",It
880,aaronadoty,"Strong in parts, IT struggles to stay fresh and maintain cohesion",7,25 June 2018,"With some great set-piece scares and an ensemble of impressive teen actors, IT works well and hews close to the feel and substance of King's source material, even though its narrative core often feels weak. The movie struggles in places to escape cliché (heavy reliance on a scary house and scary clown being the main offenders), but manages to find disturbing power in the behaviour of the adult (and near adult) citizens of Derry. Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nashawaty complains of Pennywise the clown, ""the more we see of him, the less scary he becomes"". This is true, but - whether intentionally or not - this truth reflects a central theme of the movie: it is by banding together and overcoming their fear of IT that the ""Losers' club"" ultimately prevails.",It

I love every Stephen King book I've ever read and there is NOTHING quite like an excellent Stephen King film adaptation and this is one of those great film adaptations. What I love so much about IT is that it's a horror film while remaining a comedy and while still focusing on the bigger story line. IT was never a story about a killer clown, but a bunch of kids who banded together for a huge adventure. I loved that the movie gave the audience some excellent scares while still remaining authentic to the comedy of the book. In my opinion the highlight of this film was the banter between the kids and the perfect delivery of one liners by Finn Wolfhard. That kid seriously stole the show. I also liked that there were some moments that felt a little campy and some truly horrifying moments because it made the movie feel more realistic.

Just like this one which was released this year and actually had surprisingly held up impressively well with its updates. The actors and actresses did very well like the original cast. But instead of it being about the late 50's/early 60's, they updated it to the late 80's. Which one could presume updated as in for millennial interests, but it does excellent in story and acting. The original (1990) film used practical effects and were more convincing, in my opinion. The digital effects in this one were good at points, other moments you just knew it was CGI. But I have to mention that kid who played Richie really must have enjoyed that role. I just had to mention his acting was charming and the other actors and actresses compliment well in the atmosphere and in their own charming way.It was a surprise this remake was better than most out today.

889,julia-00157,Pennywise is a murderous Halloween prank,4,24 September 2017,"A group of children face their fears in the truest form: Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Should I start out by saying I am a sensitive person? I don't usually do horror movies because even the most obvious jump scares make me, well, jump. I saw this movie because I'd seen it get good ratings and heard it wasn't that scary.The movie opens with young Gerogie losing his boat in the sewers, thus bringing him to Pennywise. The first scare isn't bad. Actually rather lame, if I may say. The movie centers around the Losers' Club: six boys and one girl brought together by their encounters with It (and the local bully.) It starts by terrorizing them with their greatest fear, then turning into the clown, played by Bill Skarsgard, Skarsgard did a good job of playing a disaster of a villain who's only fear aspect is that he just appears. It did the opposite of say, Jaws, in that it shows you the monster from the very beginning. But this isn't just any monster, no. It can transform, and it's mouth can get really big. The movie does fall victim to, I don't want to say every horror trope, but it comes close. The kids follow things they shouldn't, split up, see dead people, etc. Something about the movie is that when ever you see a red balloon, It is near. The movie probably used this once or twice in blindingly obvious ways, but not every time? In my opinion, if you're going to go, go all the way. I get surprising the audience but if you've already established something you can't just push it aside and hope no one notices. The young actors in the film, particularly Finn Wolfhard, were hilarious. The movie took breaks from its ""horror"" to have them make fun of each other in the way thirteen year old boys do. They're pretty well developed, and I say pretty because I've heard so much praise on that front but it can't quite reach. The film repeats what it thinks works a lot. The blood (which I must say there wasn't as much as the average horror movie but like, still) was unnecessary and gratuitous. The friendship between the children is fun, and feels genuine, but they also try to force a romance between the one female characters and not one but two of the oddball misfits. I guess I knew what I was getting into but I think the best parts of the movie are away form Pennywise, with the kids just joking, getting hurt when they can get better, throwing rocks and telling inappropriate jokes. To be honest that's the only reason I rated it this well at all. The ending, which was supposed to be satisfying in that telling the thing that feeds off their fears that they are no longer afraid unfortunately fell short. The 80s aesthetic of it was, I guess, nice, and they had interesting cinematography when they weren't über focused in on the scary parts. The plot was thin and everything in the long run was pretty predictable. Again, I feel like I have to say I am sensitive to horror movies. I was jumping and covering my eyes, but the second I left the theater, I was fine. Nothing about it stuck with me.",It

There was no chemistry between the kids... At. All. Beverly looked like Little Orphan Annie... She was not very good at faking a nervous smoking habit, which they tried to imply she had, and just about everything those kids did/said, was incredibly stupid. The whole thing was like a bad joke. The dialog is just insulting, and the ""scary"" parts were just gore or jump scares. I was never less emotionally invested in a set of characters. I found myself wishing Pennywise would just gobble them all up and be done with it.It absolutely dragged too. About the only thing they ""improved"" was the role of Henry as the murderous bully. He was truly horrific. Everything that made the original so good was missing with nothing of value added.If you've always wanted a version of IT, without any heart, humor, subtly, intrigue or fear...This your movie!Fake looking CGI's galore, plenty of predictability, as well as ""Said No One Ever"" dialog, and ""I could care less about these kids"" character development.

Like the first review said: it's more like the Goonies than, say, the Babadook. It's more like a pre-teen coming of age film than a horror film. There's no tension! There's no atmosphere! That's not to say there aren't moments where the film tries hard to scare its viewers... but it falls extremely flat.Take the clown, for instance. It's just not that scary in its base form, not nearly as scary as Tim Curry's version for instance. The fact that it's layered with CGI gives it this shiny appearance that really takes away the scare factor. Same goes for much of the other set pieces. They should be scary, but they just aren't! Because there's no atmosphere!I remember, in the original miniseries, theres a scene where a girl is attacked by the monster through clothes drying on a line. You barely see the clown, and there's no gore. Yet the tension, suspense, and sudden switch in circumstance makes it a particularly haunting scene. Here, the monster is so much more in your face, there's so much more gore, but just it somehow isn't as scary.Another scene for comparison is the locker shower scene in the original. Here, there's a real feeling of helplessness one feels for Bill as he is alone, naked, confused, and face to face with a demon. There is no comparable moment in this film, despite its much greater production value.I really wanted to like this movie, and on paper it sounds scary. There is disturbing stuff in here, but it's just not as impactful as it should be. I think it's really the super high production values and big budget cinematography. There's just too much brightness, the environment is too well defined and the areas are too open to allow for tension and suspense.Also, the music! The music sounds like it was lifted out of a Narnia film. It sounds like some top dollar fantasy action kids movie... not a horror film. That really screwed up the tension for me. This movie probably would've been way scarier if it just completely cut the music at times, or maybe replaced it with some genuine horror soundtrack.This movie was hyped super hard, and it didn't live up to it. I feel cheated. I know a lot of people will let that go, but not me. It was so totally not worth the 2 and a quarter hour runtime. The Babadook does so much more with a much smaller runtime.I will say, however, that the humans in the movie are far scarier than the monsters, and if the director was going for that: bravo.",It
893,jhanks-45230,Tim Curry is my only Pennywise,6,15 September 2017,"This was not an awful movie, but it just isn't as good as the 1990 version. I liked the way they updated it to take place in 1989 instead of the 1950's, and the changes they made to the story were rather cool in that there were surprises even though I am familiar with the story, and it showed parts that were left out of the 1990 version. And no disrespect to the guy who played Pennywise here, he was a good creepy clown, but he just didn't bring the magic the way Tim Curry did. I'm still hopeful about the sequel though.. I think doing a story of this size in two parts was the right call.",It
894,laneben,Absolutely hilarious,7,12 September 2019,"I watched this with a friend at around 1 in the morning. I don't know if it was the movie or lack of sleep from the night before, but we laughed our asses off throughout this movie. There were one or two instances where the movie actually got a tiny bit scary, but that didn't last for more than 30 seconds each. After the semi-tense moment passed it was followed by some penny wise scene that was comedy gold. One time he jiggle ran at a kid and another he literally started bouncing side to side. I get this movie was aimed at a child's perception of fear, but my god this isn't what id call a horror movie. We constantly laughed throughout this movie (mostly at pennywise's shenanigans), and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Horror movie: 1/10 horror spoof comedy: 10/10",It
895,dmartinez-52655,Childhood Fears in 2017,9,13 September 2017,"We all had a fear when we were little, the boogeyman, ghosts, school, etc, and all that can still haunt us either way, even when getting older. One example being the notorious Pennywise the clown, birthed by the famous novelist himself, Stephen King. king manages to bring us a character in a story where no matter what age or person you are, you will be afraid. The original story managed to spawn a TV series in the 90's that wasn't really a movie but a series spanning over three hours. It wasn't that bad in general, the first hour was okay, but the rest was just cluttered and confusing. But when I was little that Clown scared me, Tim Curry was born to scare children just by laughing or staring at the camera while mocking you.Years passed and we were soon introduced to a image on the internet of the teaser image of Pennywise for the 2017 It movie. My mixed feeling for this look were that he looked ridiculous, and what happened to your forehead dude? But later in the summer the world was given the official trailers! Honestly, I was still mixed if this was gonna be good or another sleazy attempt like 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street or 2013 Carrie. Finally, after a long wait, It had reached cinemas and I saw it. Children disappear in the town of Derry, Maine, neighborhood kids work together to fight against Pennywise, whose history of murder and violence dates back for centuries. In this movie, we are introduced to some great characters, when people think of child actors in movies they imagine sleeping at a middle school reenactment of Romeo and Juliet. But watching these kids was still great, they have spot on emotions and are slick with pulling off some actual fright in their eyes. Pennywise was just amazing, watching bill skarsgård as the Iconic clown was a thriller, that man scared me multiple times with his tension and that voice. I think Bill was just as sweet as the other actors and supporting cast members. The Scenery was cool, this movie does feel like Maine or any type of country town with how we see even the most creepiest thing when the clown appears.The story does take place in the eighties with the looks, vehicles, and slang, and the young actors do pull of a decade worthy movie. While sometimes the backgrounds may seems simple and bland, but that rarely happens, and we get more detailed and chilling scenes that could seem like a fever dream or Satan's imagination. During the part where a kid is trapped in a clunked room with creepy dolls and figurines, I was expecting some baby faced dolls or nutcracker rip-offs. No, a lot of them were creepy with soul crushing eyes, pale clown faces,and some that made me wish I didn't sit in the first couple of rows.The scares are somewhat great, I love the building tension it brings when they're faced with their nightmares or running away from the clown. This movie doesn't shy away from creeping you out with a beast that can kill you or the feeling of being in a circus. While some scares weren't that impressive on some levels whether if they tried or the trailer ruined it, the rest were great with how they stood. The effects or makeup did look fake on some moments, sometimes characters will have some pale face makeup that look cheap. This movie does have some strong gore in it, with characters being pulled apart and blood splattering all over a room. It could make some people squeamish, but it feels overused and may seem like they're trying to be practical.Overall, I loved this movie, it is great representation of the original Stephen King story, and I have to give it credit for attempting to make me enjoy the ride, and I did. I enjoyed Richie, Beverly, Mike, and the rest of the Losers. The acting was talented, this movie has some fantastic performances, especially by these young teens,the realistic portrayal of kids feels impactful and felt bad when a kid died. The scares are great, while some may not be spot on or terrifying, a lot still pulled through. I enjoyed IT 2017 because it brought a more refined adaptation with still some fresh new relations and scares. I can't wait for a possible sequel because this was fun to see and I am excited for more!",It
896,henryluck,IT (2017) Review,9,21 September 2017,"Great horror films are rare these days mainly because most of them are redundant sequels and remakes that do very little to aid the story or the scares. Even though this 2017 version of IT is a remake of the Stephen King classic, it is one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. With killer clowns, death of children and monsters attacking you left and right, what's not to love? The film follows the same plot as the massive first part of the classic 1986 novel with the second half to be finished in a sequel. Seven children are being hunted and prayed on by a child-eating alien disguised as a clown known as Pennywise for each of their own fears and traumas. One child in particular, Bill Denbrough (Jayden Lieberher) is obsessed with founding and defeating the clown because he believes he will also find his younger brother who was captured by the alien months earlier with many believing him to be dead.  This makes us connect emotionally with Bill as well as the other characters who have fears of their own such as Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) the only female of the group who is sexually abused by her father. This formula can be repetitive but it is terrifying when each child has their own encounter with Pennywise. Cinematography is also to great effect in IT. Camera movement gets incredibly shaky during intense chase scenes but the camera also takes the time to slow down to explore the emotionally levity of some scenes. Shadows are used effectively to add to the sinister nature of the film like the sewer locations where the unknown evil of Pennywise lurk. The actors of the children also act well in their current surroundings and reasonably act like coming of age children. Bill as mentioned earlier is obsessed with finding IT and his younger brother and due to his young age acts impulsively without much consideration of his actions or his friends like any coming of age child would. CGI can look pretty suspect in a few scenes with Pennywise. When he starts attacking, he does these really forced shaky motions that can take away from the scene a little bit, but not enough to ruin the horror and tension of the scenes. For any horror fan, IT is an absolute must see, especially in the dark of the cinema.",It
897,JediMichaelCera,How a good horror movie should be,10,7 December 2017,There was maybe about 4 jump scares in the entire film. The rest of the horror was truly great and clever ideas to scare the audience. There's not many horror films like that anymore. They all just mostly rely on cheap jump scares to trick the viewer into thinking the film was scary.Not only was the horror side of the film done extremely well but the comedy aspects were perfect. All the cast with funny lines/actions delivered them perfectly.This film was unbelievably better than I was expecting.,It
898,mooviesuniverse,It scared me so much that I lost all my milk!,7,18 September 2017,"'It', based on one of Stephen King's bestselling novels, is sometimes touching, often funny and always scary.In the town of Derry, Maine several children have gone missing. A group of seven young friends (the Losers Club) are being tormented by Pennywise the clown, an evil shape shifting entity that feeds on children's fears. As the threat becomes larger the kids decide to fight and kill It.Since the novel is so long 'It' is difficult to translate to the big screen but the writers did a pretty good job. First off it's impossible to cram the whole book into one movie so they opted to only cover the childhood of the seven friends and not the adulthood. Another change from the novel is that the timeline shifts from the 50's to the 80's. Apart from some pop-culture references it serves no real purpose so it wasn't necessary.Director Andy Muschietti knows this kind of movie only works if you care about the characters. He takes his time to introduce them to us and to flesh them out. Then again he wastes no time and sets the tone from the start. The opening scene is brutal and serves as a warning for things to come. The scares follow each other up pretty fast.Pennywise played brilliantly by Bill Skarsgård has a lot to do with that. He's the main attraction of the movie. Although perhaps too much driven by CGI, Skarsgård is terrifying. But there's also another kind of horror. The children all have to deal with their own personal demons (loss of a brother & an abusive father among them). This makes 'It' a coming-of-age story about a bunch of friends facing their fears together and that is the heart of the movie.A lot rides on the child actors. They are mostly solid with Jaeden Lieberer as Bill and especially Sophia Lillis as Beverly standing out. She's a star in the making. Finn Wolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie, the loudmouth who brings the much needed comic relief. Wyatt Oleff as Stan wasn't great but that might have to do with the fact that his character was perhaps a little flat.If you don't know what to expect, mix 'Stand By Me' with 'Super 8', add a splash of 'The Goonies' and top it off with a scary-ass clown.While 'It' is perhaps too long at the end (runtime is 135 min.) it's far better than the 1990 TV movie. If the movie is a success a sequel is inevitable but that's something to look forward to.",It
899,LilithSeaborne,I loved it,10,15 December 2017,"I am usually not a fan of remakes, but this one blew my away! I would not say that it's better than the original, as they both have their own greatness. I absolutely loved it.",It
900,kimd-38939,Disappointing. Not scary.,5,23 December 2017,"As a huge fan of the horror genre, I had eagerly anticipated watching this movie and had high hopes regarding its quality. Unfortunately, it disappointed me greatly - pun intended. My main point of contention with this movie is the glaring plot holes:
Did all the floating children come back to life at the end?What happened to Georgie? Is he gone forever?Why don't the bullies ever address that their friend has gone missing? Why do the bullies hate the Losers' Club so much?Who does Beverly like? I'm confused as to why she kisses both Bill and Ben... Why does Pennywise use the sewage system if he can manifest wherever he chooses?Where are the kids' parents whenever they disappear to fight Pennywise?Does Pennywise actually eat his victims? If yes, why are they floating?In addition to being left with these burning questions, my other major issue with ""It"" is the lack of character development. I found myself not caring about any of the characters because I felt that I knew very little about them. The movie provides almost no back story on the characters. For instance, I wonder about Henry's relationship with his father and whether or not that contributes to his sadistic behaviour. The camaraderie between the Losers also raises questions. It doesn't make sense that Beverly, Ben, and Mike instantly bond with the Losers just seconds after meeting them. They're literally strangers to one another, yet they risk their lives to protect each other - how unbelievable! In summary, the movie does not deserve all the praise it's receiving in my opinion. A sequel is said to be released in the future; hopefully it'll be an improvement. In the meantime, I'm going to read the original novel and hope that it'll fill in all the gaps for me.",It

903,dylanchang-75837,Overrated and not scary for anyone that's watched the horror genre before.,3,1 September 2019,"I've watched over 300 horror movies in my time, and have read a good handful of horror based novels as well. For pros, the production itself is fine I guess and the actors are okay given their young age. However, the movie adaptation of the Stephen King novel is NOT scary and very cheesy and cheap given how much money went into it. The jump scares and boring and very obvious, and most viewers who have watched horror movies before will likely be able to predict the scenes that occur before they even happen (even without having read the novel).The movie was a huge letdown given the hype and doesn't deserve the huge amount of money it grossed in the box office.",It
904,kondia8,Underwhelming,5,25 July 2018,"IT was underwhelming. I have not read the book and I barely remember the first movie, so I'm commenting on it as a standalone movie. I didn't like how IT's properties are not well defined. When can he appear and when not? Why did IT rip the first child's arm off with its teeth and then later was just french kissing the Jewish child instead of instantaneously ripping its face off? Were there no other children in that town (well, there were as we saw in the school scenes)? Why did IT pick this particular gang? How is it possible that children go missing every exactly 27 years and no one but the fat kid noticed the pattern? Too much suspension of disbelief for my tastes.
When the three kids entered the house, why did they wander off one by one when they knew what they were facing at this point? They're supposed to be scared. The natural response is to stick together. I hate nonsensical things like this in movies just to make for fake suspense. Since Bev was the only one willing to enter the house in the first place (did not raise her hand), why did she not go in with them? The scene were they leave one by one at the end was cringy and to Stand By Me-ish. Also, I think the fat kid had done enough in this movie to get the girl (that would have been original at least). Stutter boy was just going from one stupid decision to another the whole movie.I also didn't like the Goonies/Stranger Things atmosphere (made stronger by one of the kids being in Stranger Things) with the cliche rural America friendships, the bikes, the token girl and the token black or asian kid. It's been overdone and I loved it at its prime when I was about that age, but it needs to go away for a while again.",It
905,fctyger22,Book + Movie= Bloody Terrifying,10,8 September 2017,"I have never read any of the books and, until today, I had only seen 2 Stephen King movies; the 1990 release of IT (taken from an NBC television broadcast) and The Night Flyer on DVD. And neither one of them, or any of the scary scenes in all the movies I had ever seen, could've prepared me for this. From the trailers, to the premiere, to the final scene, this is truly one of Stephen King's finest works. The Bible speaks of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I've come to regard and admire Stephen King, George Romero, Wes Craven, and Alfred Hitchcock as ""The Four Horsemen of Horror"".Give me Dracula, The Wolfman, Godzilla (classic and modern), The Blob, all the 8-legged freaks, and you still won't be able to hold your ground against, or your bladder, when faced with the works of Stephen King. I applaud the entire cast and crews and I am not ashamed to say that I am absolutely terrified of IT.In closing, and in the spirit of another one of the 4 horsemen of horror, let me take a page out of Wes Craven's book: We had chapter one. In chapter two, IT will be back for you.",It
906,Cheajk,Michael Bay's It,4,23 September 2019,"The magic of the 1990 mini series was left out of this one for me.I enjoyed the original series because it centered on weighty conflicts for the individuals. The challenge of keeping a promise you made. Summoning the courage and bravery to fight the monsters in your life. To stand aside from your peers and become a leader. To realize that you'll need to fight as a group or be torn apart, etc. It felt like these kids were going on an adventure/journey that would have a lasting impact on their lives.The 2017 movie failed to do that for me. I felt like it leaned too heavily on CGI and filming effects. The backstory seemed very short. The movie felt satisfied with being a generic horror movie rather than trying to do anything more. I think the 1990 segmented flashbacks did a hugely better job conveying how strongly the events of the story impacted the characters.In the miniseries I loved seeing Bill deciding to fight for what he believed in, and to lead the others to do the same. A group of kids coming together to be stronger than their individual parts. I had a hard time searching for that admiration with the 2017 version.While watching the 2017 version I kept feeling like the film was trying too hard to be scary. For me, 'It' isn't a story about fear, it's a story about coming together and finding strength in yourself through others. To do things that you didn't know you were capable of. I don't need to see another generic horror movie that's dark, has creepy jerky walking, and showcases the CGI gross out scares on-screen for the audience to marvel at. I thought the clown was overdone; it is so overpowered that I felt like the kids should have been killed multiple times. There seems to be very little depth to it.One of the things I really liked was the casting- the kids seemed well chosen and I thought the acting was good.I heard lots of raving about Skarsgard. He wasn't a bad actor for me, but I really couldn't connect with the character. I preferred to see an anonymous, vaguely eerie apparition more subtly tempting the children in multiple forms. It felt like there was more depth and something to be interested in with that.
I'm not sure if I recommend watching this one. At the least, watch the 1990 mini series first if you haven't. There's not much foreplay here, and too much time wasted in the dark and on overdone horror tropes.",It
907,toriw-36706,"Expectations were high, and stayed high",10,11 August 2019,"This movie was amazing. Now, I have seen some reviews saying that this movie was not scary and sometimes the scary moments came off as funny. As somebody who is terrified of clowns, this movie gave, and still gives me, nightmares. There are some scenes in this movie where pennywise is messing with the kids heads and mocking them, and those were funny. But for me at least, scenes like Patrick's death, Stan getting attacks by the flute lady, etc. got me. This movie also contains a ton of comedy, mostly from Richie and Eddie, and it worked great. The acting is great. Overall would give a 9.5/10 because sometimes the CGI would be great and sometimes it would be bad. If you are scared of clowns this will scare you. If you don't care about them it might not. Would recommend, and I'm very excited for chapter 2!",It

Nothing like the book.
Poor story and character development, it slumbers from one set piece to the next.
Sloppy editing, lacks cohesion.
Too much foul language, when will script writers learn that its not edgy, just grating.
Little to no back story. Some scenes and relationships just hang there unexplained.
Gratuitous jump scenes offer nothing if you're over 15.
Moving the film from the 50""s to the 80's didn't work very well.
Many missing scenes that made the book and original film endearing.

913,tp-Isle,January Embers,9,16 September 2017,"Stephen King adaptations can be a mixed bag. For every masterpiece, A Shawshank Redemption and The Shining there are other productions that sit opposite, CELL, Bag of Bones and the deplorable Mist TV series to name a few. King has a huge body of work and some times it takes a film director to make or break his writing for a cinematic audience.Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Cary Fukunaga announced a cinema version of IT in 2014. Muschietti had directed MAMA and Fukunaga had gone into bat for Woody Harrelson and Matt Mcconaughey for the first season of True Detective. It was an interesting peering and then the production went quiet. until the first trailer.Based on the the Novel by King and the television version which featured Tim Curry as the clown antagonist obsessed with killing children the question was; would the trailer that broke the internet match up to everything read and seen before? and if so would it be better?After two full versions Andy Muschietti had a lot of work to do.Bill, Ben , Beverley, Richie, Mike, Eddie and Stanley live in the fictional town Derry Maine. They are all very early teenagers and find comfort among each other and are very close. Early on Bill loses his brother and it soon becomes obvious that Derry houses a demon so evil that adults cannot see it leaving it to the teens to do something about it. This is a very Stephen King story.After a relentless death that will go down in the halls of Horror as a great film murder. This becomes a very adult version of the story compared to the mini series but not so the novel which is even more adult. Stephen King WTF !!. The Clown PENNYWISE is pivotal early and Bill Skisgard is owning it in the first few seconds which is important not just for the story but also the cinematography sound and general tension.Muschietti has done an amazing job. Stephen King has mentioned he did not expect this to be as good as it is and he is right. This is a fantastic horror film but in saying it pays homage to the classic 80's and also addresses the issues of teens growing up ( Well almost ) and creates an on screen entity that future films other that the sequel will struggle to compete with.PENNYWISE is not nice, Hannibal Lecter not nice.A film that has had the highest opening of any horror film ever and it deserves this, We deserve it , This is the mini series on steroids and fills the gap between the three. Smart acting directing and writing for a simple horror film which has fallen into very caring hands.Bring on Chapter 2...It's going to get very nasty.",It
914,DreamOWD,I can't believe I have to say this about this movie but,5,7 September 2017,"The truth about this movie is that it's not scary. All of the content concerning the clown is pretty good but it's another one of those things where you're like ""I wish he was in a different movie."" Because they went way overboard with the comedy in this. In fact, the reason this is even rated R is not because of anything gruesome or scary. No, not at all. This is rated R because of the language. The movie is littered with d*** jokes and s*** jokes all throughout the entire movie from start to finish.While the movie is well shot, good soundtrack and great cinematography, the scares that we came for do not deliver! They use every last predictable Hollywood horror cliché in the book for every scare that's not the clown.And the finale. Okay, so the clown gets clowned. They literally end this clown to the point where the clown is scared of the kids and the kids aren't scared of the clown at all. None of them die by the way. There are no stakes. And yet the movie still tries to setup a sequel. Can you believe that?Many of these characters I didn't even like. With the main character kinda being an a****** dragging their friends into danger chasing down what they already know is not real. The female character being poorly treated and the psychopathic bully who gets discarded from the film like he was never there in the first place.No, this movie does not deserve a sequel and I hope it doesn't get one!

The amount of details included from the book were very good. Then suddenly the movie turned into disjointed scenes with a bunch of scare jumps that are really not that scary unless your perhaps 10. The deviation from the book is ridiculous, almost worse than the original mini series. I think the kids did a great job and Bill Skarsgård shined when they didn't ruin his character with CGI, but unfortunately this movie left me disappointed. I think people who have not read the book might enjoy it, but they'll never get the true dread, hopelessness and fear that the book instills by watching this.

919,angus-lamont,Great adaptation but not terrifying,8,8 September 2017,"Just been to the midnight showing, which was great! Just before I give my thoughts, it is worth pointing out that I am only a quarter of the way through the book, which I was aiming to finish before seeing this 😕 I have also yet to watch the 90's TV version (which I was to watch after finishing the book), so I can't really draw any comparisons. From the initial reviews, I was expecting to be seeing a terrifying film, which ""It"" is - if you have a clown phobia. Unfortunately I don't so it wasn't as scary as I expected, but definitely creepy and suspenseful in some parts. Another point that the reviews brought up was that the film was low on the jump-scares which isn't true really as most of the scares seemed to be generated in this way. Also some effects sequences looked a little fake, particularly when Pennywise is moving about, which seems to using CG (quite pointless if you ask me). Onto some positive points. For a film rated 15 though, this film does have a fair amount of blood/gore which I found quite surprising. The cast are great and provide some great drama (as well as some laughs) to the story. The actor playing Pennywise is great, and it'd be interesting to compare with Tim Curry's approach. The film overall was beautifully shot, with great set pieces and a score that fits the tone of the film. However it did seem to go on longer than expected - I honestly thought I'd been sitting for 3 hours (the run time is 2hrs, 15mins). That said, at no point did I ever lose interest in what was happening. Not really a spoiler, but this is the first of two chapters so the ending is really a cliffhanger of sorts, which I was expecting and I do look forward to viewing the next film. Overall the moral of the story here is not to get caught up in the hype of a film. I think people want to be scared by this film, which is fine, it just didn't deliver what was being said in the initial reviews. I'll give it an 8/10 for just now, as it may change after I've finished the book.",It
920,vojinvidanovic,"Bad modern ""reboot""",1,22 September 2017,"Please mind that this comparison is made based on seeing 1990 twice as long classing AND reading the book.While special effects have advanced since 1990, obviously the idea of horror based on fear, psychological fear, more the visuals, has faded.Movie misses the grownup part, trying to make this kid only horror. Its forcefully modernized with sexual references, WTF lines by kids, unneeded zombies etc. swapping characters and parts of the story, taking away the ITs strongest weapon - knowing our fears and masking beneath them.Much of content and context is lost, and I highly recommend to anyone attracted by this budget filler to go for original and 200 pages book. Its actually Lovecraftian monster and not just evil Ronald McDonald. Does not need to rip hands off and produce fake missing posters.Yup, better done and played IT killed Ronald McDonald,and I like it. No unhealthy advertising to kids :-)",It
921,Muxje,Run-of-the-mill horror with some resemblance to King's book.,5,10 December 2017,"""IT"" is a fairly well made horror movie, if you watch it with no high expectations or prior knowledge of the book. The cast and cinematography are above par for the genre, and there are some genuinely great moments. The opening scene really stands out; it does a great job of drawing us into the story and introducing us to Pennywise. And there is a bone chilling moment when the gang watches a slide projector go mad showing Pennywise truly come alive. It's a shame the second half of that scene is botched by an almost slapstick like manifestation of the clown cut mercifully short. That scene in the garage is a good example of why this movie isn't ""IT"". The book and miniseries weren't about cheap jump scares but about character development. The evil in the original story wasn't something scary jumping at you out of the closet; it was something more chilling and deliberate: waiting, and inevitable. That is why those kids went after it: they didn't want to, they didn't just up and decide ""let's kill that .... clown"", they did it because they had to, despite their deepest fears. An incredible struggle for anyone let alone a bunch of kids, and something masterfully described in the book, yet the movie manages to completely miss this point.The second half of the movie feels hurried and sloppy, almost as if both writers and cast are eager to get to the final scene. Again a complete departure from King's careful pacing and attention to colour and detail. All in all, it's a decent horror, but it doesn't do the original any justice.",It
922,raiderhrhr,Best King film adaptation ever.,10,24 February 2018,"I'm a huge King fan. Read all but 2 or 3 of his novels and read It, The Stand and The Dark Tower series 3 times each at least. Everything written by Stephen King made into a movie or film usually bites. This movie was great. It doesn't wait teasingly showing just a little here and there. It gets right to the gore and the horror just and keeps going. It also adds some modern pieces that fit fantastically. Those that saw this and say they don't like King: why then, you went to a movie you knew you're not going to like. Go home. Be quite. ThanksThose saying it doesn't follow the book:
1. yeah, it's in the 90's instead of the 60's like the book. That's better for me because it speaks to the time I read the book the first time.2. Pay attention to cinematography ever? The graininess, style and colors of this movie are so 50's and 60's you're blind if you don't see it from the opening scene. Especially at the end with the bright greens and pastel blue sky.That's about it. Just my opinion. Like all the real-world Pennywise's that litter the internet for real now, most of whom spend their time on the internet thinking their tired un-asked jaded opinions even matter and whine about any and everything like a bunch of diaper rashed babies. See if it you want, or don't. Who cares.",It
923,judegraysmith,Clowns and more clowns,9,18 September 2017,"If you didn't like clowns before and if Tim Curry scared the beejesus out of you with his version of Pennywise, you are going to walk out of the cinema this time vowing never again to want to see any clown, including ones which seemed benign before.Where do I start with this movie. Obviously a lot of the book is not here (as what movie maker ever wants to see kids getting it on with each other) but this movie at least shows better than the mini series, how Bill and Beverly have a sexual tension between them and Ben looks on with heartbreak. It also shows the other boys gawping at Beverly as teens will do. Very well done at least for showing just some of the reasons why the 'Loser Club' bonded so well. The scene where Beverly's dad tried to rape her is very close to what happens in the book, showing how the evil permeates all the actions of adults around Derry. Henry and his teen bully gang are seriously nasty in this movie, again more like the ones in the book. There are extra things added in like Stanley being scared of a picture of a woman which looks like a Munch painting 'The Scream'. There's also changes in how each child repels attacks. Odd scenes have been added as well but I will leave it to you to see if you think they fit in with the flow of the movie.My teen son went with me to the movie and was checking his watch all the time as he didn't understand the slow build up of the story and was waiting for more 'boom-shock-horror' than the movie really has. His loss not mine as I was engrossed.Pennywise is more awful than the Tim Curry version as it is quite clear in this movie we are not dealing with a normal ghost/spectre/ghoul even at this stage of the first movie (of what will end up as 2 and obviously the second movie will show the kids as adults, just like part 2 of the mini-series did). Only thing I found false was that near the end, Pennywise halted for far too long to attack/eat some of the kids.Overall, a very worthwhile experience, albeit with changes from the book and mini-series. The child actors are very, very good and 'own' this movie. The landscapes are much better than in the Mini series and I thought I understood much better the layout of the Barrens. Bill Skasgard has a hard job of following Tim Curry but his version of the evil clown stands up with the old one. Very, very well made movie and I can't wait to see part 2!I will also dust off my old paperback version of the story and re-read now after 20 years.",It
924,MikeyBoomBoom,Some good points but ultimately disappointing,6,17 September 2017,"I was full of excitement sitting down in the theatre, my cinema trips are rare these days, and as a fan of the book and a member of the generation terrified by Tim Curry's Pennywise in 1990 I SO MUCH wanted this to be good. The opening scene is very strong. Georgie is out playing on a flooded rain-swept street, then his paper boat is swept into a storm drain. peering down the drain, the face of a clown appears, who introduces himself as PennyWise, the dancing clown. The clown jokes and joshes with Georgie, talking about circuses, and popcorn, they giggle together, then suddenly, the clown falls silent, his face goes slack, and he just stares..... It was a truly chilling moment, and I was thinking ""Yes! They've nailed it, this is going to be great"" Opening titles roll, and we get introduced to the other kids in the next few scenes. I was pleased to see that all the kids in the losers club, with the exception of Mike, were very capable actors with real screen presence. Bev, and Eddie have real star quality, Henry Bowers is suitably hate-able. So far so good! And then, and then.....something went wrong, and the slow deflation and disappointment began to set in. I can't say this film was bad, it wasn't bad, but there was simply nothing new here for me that I hadn't seen in fifty other horror movies, Pennywise just became another bouncy vibrating CGI monster, with no more menace or substance than a video game character. In the first few encounters with the kids and IT, you quickly realise that we're back to very familiar ground, a series of suspenseful build ups to noisy jump scares which get just a little bit less effective every time. All this leads up to a final encounter which, although interesting, was unsatisfying, and most definitely not scary. As other reviewers on here have pointed out, this is a perfectly decent movie for young viewers who have not had the chance to become desensitized to the well worn tropes of the genre. Sadly, despite that early promise, there's nothing special, new or innovative going on here. Such a shame.",It

926,maxjosh72,NO Spoilers as such but I am confused,5,13 September 2017,"I believe I am generous in my rating and I am in minority here for sure. IT is overrated and too much hyped. OK let us come to the point.Is it a horror movie ? Is it Comedy-horror or horror-comedy.? No it is unintentional comedy with little bit of jump scares.Few points to ponder over as follows - 1. There are bullies in school who are beating up fellow students at will and no body complains and no parents are affected either. 2. Were American parents mostly evils or bad in eighties ? 3. Bully head boy has a sports car in eighties which twenty first century kids will be envious of. Who gives car to such young kids. 4. Why kids have to swear so much in the name of conversation or pleasing audience to smiles ? 5. Sewage is so much integral part of life in that town that every alternate scene is shot in sewage locations. 6. That Joker type entity is comic book. Movie has kids but to be viewed by adults. Utterly confusing. 7. Entity feed on your fear (flash too I guess) but young boy died in front of our eyes in first scene. Was not that real ? The blood in bathroom of the girl was not real ? All kids washed it together, though it was not visible to evil father of the girl, leading a pathetic life of an adult. 8. Bollywood is put to shame if you see the melodramatic tone of the movie at times. 9. Everything which Stephen Kings writes does not have to be great. 10. There is no police in town, even a policeman is murdered by family number. 11. Kids can be so fearless and can put adults to shame by their research work. 12. No adult is bothered by happenings in town except kids. 13. Be prepared for a sequel demanding more dollars from you.14. Can somebody return my 2 hours (money was not too much as it was a weekday with a descent crowd mostly college goers in a very big plush South Mumbai Cinema screen) plus 2 hours of commuting to the place because of hyped created so I wanted to enjoy the experience in an exclusive place. My friend could not complain to me much in shame or hesitation. There is a lobbying of reviewers in Film Industry of all countries. Movie was a bit entertaining if not viewed seriously. First 15 minutes are too good really especially concerning paper boat and young boy.",It
927,EdD5,Annoying. Dumb Stereotypes,4,3 January 2018,"Positves; the actress playing the one girl in it. Negatives: virtually everything else. Every other character is an obvious, obtuse stereotype both written and played with virtually no subtlety. By far the most glaring and obnoxious of these is the bespectacled kid who incessantly (literally INCESSANTLY) does nothing but make supposedly funny sexual remarks every time he opens his mouth. It's weak, lazy, unrealistic and thoroughly aggravating. Of course, some kids that age attempt crude humor, but no one does it non-stop like a hack morning DJ. It being completely witless makes it all the worse. The hypochondriac kid is almost as bad and just as hackneyed. Making characters lazy types rather than human beings is cheap and speaks to a lack of talent on the creators part, as well as a lack of respect for the potential audience.

Because it's not a horror film. Yes, I know, the label says ""horror"" and it's based on a horror novel, and I acknowledge that the horror factor was definitely there, but it wasn't a horror film. Hear me out.Horror films never do well in theaters because they try too hard to scare people. If it's not scary, then it sucks; if it's only kinda scary, then it sucks; if it's too scary, then it sucks. It's an endless cycle we've put horror movies into, but notice how ""IT"" is getting better reviews than some Marvel movies right now. That's because they never wrote the script to be a horror film.Also notice that the label says 'drama' alongside 'horror'. ""IT"" was written to be a comedy with the horror factor always present, thus making it a horror movie like the book and something that appeals to the audience. Hence the constant jokes throughout.

Maybe it's just me who's now older and not as easy to scare as when I was a kid, but before I went to see the new adaptation in the cinema, I saw the 1990 mini series, and that version still gave me a creepy feeling.I had really high hopes for the new version, and many of my expectations were meet, but I wasn't scared or had any real moments, where my heart beat faster or so.For me, there were just something missing, like more violent scenes or scenes where kids were taken by Pennywise, instead of just hearing about missing kids. The opening scene with Georgie... well... let me say, it was good, but not scary good. They could have shown Pennywise eat his arm or something, where they really went over the line and made Georgie suffer. Because it sounded like he was laughing when Pennywise took his arm and drag him into the sewers.And that was just one of the things I think was wrong or missing in the movie. It just wasn't scary, creepy or anything as I had high hopes for IT to be.It's not Bill Skarsgård's fault, cause he did a great job, but at no point in this movie, did I find Pennywise really scary. Andy Muschietti have made a very good adaptation, but IT could have been much better, if they had just made it scary and more violent, by showing Pennywise eat a kid or two or three, instead of just telling about it.",It

The dialogue is copied from Disney's teen programs and ""spiced up"" with a lot of cussing, in the hopes that that somehow will catch the interest of the audience and make it seem more ""authentic"". Sadly, the movie makers didn't have trust in the creepiness of the original story, so they had to overdo everything- even the main character- the clown, which now is not even a clown anymore, but an obvious monster with not sharp teeth, but 10000000000000000 sharp teeth to make it extra scary. It's very difficult to feel for the characters as they don't seem real, since the dialogue so planned and predictable- just like the Saturday morning Hannah Montanas...

938,garodardavis-08913,One of Best Modern Horrors.,7,10 October 2017,"I imagine most people as myself came to the IT teaser trailer with huge hype and greatly anticipated one of the Stephen King's greatest antagonists - the demon clown Pennywise. I had mixed feeling whether or not the trailer would ruin my expectations, but it did not fail to deliver one of greatest modern horror experiences yet.The movie is about group of kids who are part of the so called ""Losers Club"" trying to stop the demonic clown from kidnapping any more kids from their city. They go on about this pursuit of 'IT' without caution and get in trouble which kicks in the tension, the feeling of the movie and starts the story. I have to admit, this movie was pretty well made. The level of details put in this movie is incredible, along with great cinematography and a horror story mixed with a little bit of humor in it. This also has to be the first time in a while I've seen kids put up a great act. Honestly, I was surprised at how well they all performed their roles and the amount of enthusiasm that was put into their roles was mesmerizing. The Pennywise was just... perfect! No other words can be used to describe how well Bill Skarsgard played as Pennywise. I love it.Now, although this is a great movie, I do have few issues with it. There is such thing as ""too many"" characters. I feel like there was too many characters and it was hard to really give any of them a developed background we can latch on to when something goes wrong with them. Many times in the movie, few kids got hurt, but because I couldn't even remember their names, I couldn't really feel bad for them, or relate in any way. Another problem is that the movie had a bit too many jump scares. I mean, we're talking a lot of jumpscares of which 80% were pretty predictable and not many of them managed to keep the tension that was suppose to go upwards. There were quite a few clichés which really didn't bother me as much, but it also felt like they weren't as mandatory. For example, there was the scary old house, the kid tripping over stuff while running in danger, kids running towards and not away from the danger and the dead end cliché. The clichés don't really contribute to the tension and can be swapped for much better ways of keeping the tension. The major plot hole with this movie is the lack of interest by every person in town with what's going on. Is there no police on the ""missing kids"" case? Did they find the missing kids in the end? What happened to the rest of the floating kids? How did the old lady not hear George scream? Those were only few questions this movie failed to answer.Although this movie has a great story, pretty good execution, acting, the feel and cinematography, I'm giving it a 7/10, mostly because I have hard time accepting mistakes. I still really enjoyed the movie nonetheless, but you can feel free to disagree about the review.",It

I watched the original IT this morning to get ready for it and have some reference. And it was absolutely terrible. Seriously, TERRIBLE. Not only did I want to walk out the second Pennywise was shown in the beginning but the rest was torture. I was with other people so I couldn't walk out. Here's the thing, this is the first time I've ever been so disappointed with a movie that I went out of my way to write a review about it. The clown was not scary in the slightest. The teeth were stupid. The acting was a joke. The kids made a ton of terrible and sexual jokes. It didn't stick to the original movie whatsoever. They took the ""you'll float too"" a little too seriously. It just plain sucked. In the original, the kids were innocent and actually dorks but this was pathetic the way the kids were talking. And why the hell did we watch them in their underwear?!? I still keep wondering how the hell this movie is rated above an 8 when it should be a disappointment for anyone who knows what a good movie is. This was so much CGI that it took away from the whole movie. I could keep going but I think I've made my point. I wouldn't waste your time or money. Watch the trailer and that's as good as it gets.

940,luiginastro,"""A great film trapped in a good film""",5,1 April 2018,"I took the liberty to quote Adam from YourMovieSucksDOTorg in the title of the review, because it's exactly what this movie is. A very competent movie with lots of good aspects and potential, but in the end the negatives got in the way of my enjoyment of the flick.The goodDirecting, cinematography and visual effects: the Argentine director Andrés Muschietti, at his second film in his career after the 2013 ""Mama"", has done a very good job. All I can say is that the movie looks pretty, thanks also to the surprisingly good cinematography of Chung-hoon Chung. Props also to the visual effects department, which created some very eerie and fun to watch visuals.The acting: nobody stands out, except for Bill Skarsgård. He is incredibly creepy and made a perfect Pennywise. Probably it's an unpopular opinion, but I think he's even better than Tim Curry was at playing the iconic demon. The rest of the cast did a fine job too. Even the children, who are well-known to be the worst part in these kinds of movies, are convincing. There's chemistry between them and it was fun to watch them interact with each other. Also, and this is a very person note, I was so glad to see Finn Wolfhard. I really like him in Stranger Things and I'm just happy his movie career started as well.As far as I'm concerned, these are the main aspects where the movie excels. There are also plenty of issues, and those really ruined the movie for me. Let's get into that, shall we?The badClichés: even though the actors did a fine job at portraying their characters, that doesn't mean they were particularly well-written ones. Their backstories were so clichéd, especially the bully type character, whose name I can't even remember. He had no relations to the overarching plot, or at least not one that I could find. I can't fathom why he was so prominently featured. I just didn't care about him.Finally, the biggest and worst flaw in my opinion of this movie is the overuse of jump scares. They had Skarsgård at his finest, being creepy with just a simple expression. However, they felt compelled to use the trite technique of the jump scare, a very cheap way of scaring people. Using jump scares is not clever; it's the easiest and laziest way to get a scare out of your audience. I hate them! They should've used Skarsgård and his creepines more, istead of relying on this horror trope, because they were nervous people wouldn't get scared enough. Such a pity!Overall, this movie is a big missed oppurtunity. If they had made a movie similar to It Follows, for example, I think I would've enjoyed it more. My rating is 5/10.",It

Beep Beep Richie, The Deadlights, the turtle, and many other things. The substance of the book was gutted from the movie.

Creating this mickey-mouse 80's atmosphere just by placing a couple of posters in a bedroom and the name of some 80's movies in the local Derry theater was also irritating, as all these kids chosen for the roles all look like just what they are, millennials who have no clue about the 80's as whilst watching I was kinda trying to spot the outline of their iphones from their shorts.

My wife was dreading seeing it because the whole idea of a scary clown freaked her out, but even she walked away from the cinema asking what the big deal was? However saying that, I have to applaud the acting from the kids in the film as their parts were well played and they performed the funny punchlines with brilliant timing, much to the amusement of everyone in the audience. The question is? Would I watch it again? I reluctantly say yes, but only if nothing else was on TV, but personally I would rather watch the original.",It
950,LWSheffield,Surprisingly good,8,20 September 2017,This movie had me after minutes. The introduction of Pennywise is handled excellently by Bill Skarsgard who delivers a note-perfect interpretation. The switch from playful and infantile to menacing is no better exemplified than in the moment we hear him segue from a jubilant 'pop pop pop' to a guttural hiss. Genuinely the stuff of nightmares. The film devotes time enough to each character to give them substance without diverting for too long from the threat of an appearance from 'IT'. The 'loser club' are as likable as the bullies are repulsive. Perhaps the only downside to this film is the message that 'adults are the real monsters' is perhaps a little too on-the-nose but nevertheless this message certainly rings true. A thoroughly enjoyable film and deservingly the surprise hit of this summer.,It

Yes, maybe the effects were spotty at times, but overall the story was captivating, paced well, and the acting was great.

Now, I'm in my mid-20s so I'm not afraid of cgi clowns. But I found the characters likable enough even if some of them were a bit grating at times and the spoooooky parts were creative enough to be at least interesting if not scary.My only major complaint is that the film gets really repetitive and the scenes are sort of awkwardly crammed together sometimes. Overall though, I was pleasantly surprised and I'd recommend seeing it at least once. It's not spectacular but I enjoyed it for what it was.",It
953,lucas_abridgwood,"Good scare (and some laughs), but not great",7,15 September 2017,"The actor of It is fantastic--genuinely disturbing and creepy. The acting was very convincing, with some very amazing shots and scenes. The kids also were great. They provided appropriate comedic breaks in the terror, and their relationships seemed genuine and were interesting. The story was a pretty typical horror movie story, with some nice twists/differences, especially a strong minded main character. However, the movie just doesn't seem to consistently piece together these individual assets into a nice flow. The beginning of the movie gives you a barrage of haunting scenes that is too fast or too much too quick to be meaningful. I even found myself yawning in some of these scenes that were meant to be terrifying because of that! Similarly, some scenes are just too much--either way too ""cartoon like"", or its just trying too hard. Also, the movie sometimes, especially in the first half, felt too choppy, and it felt like there was hardly any flow, really ruining the story telling. I was going in thinking I was going to get something similar to Stranger Things (TV), but instead at times it was like a poor haphazard description by a friend who had too much caffeine. I hope the next movie will correct this and take its time more with meaningful scenes instead of trying to fit in a lot of unnecessary ""scary scenes"".",It
954,ali_ebrahim,One of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date.,9,14 September 2017,"IT is a horror drama film based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Starring Bill Skarsgård in the title role, the film not only succeeds as a terrifying horror film but also as one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date. In 1989 in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of outcast kids known as the ""Losers Club"", are each terrorised by a frightening, shape-shifting entity they collectively refer to as ""IT"". When no one else in town will come to their aide, the kids decide to band together and fight against ""IT"" themselves while also overcoming their own personal demons. Like with comedy, horror is a highly subjective genre. What one may find scary may cause others to roll their eyes in annoyance. Thankfully, IT provides enough scares that seem as realistic as possible and prevent the film from being silly. This retelling takes itself very seriously and doesn't constantly rely on jump scares for legitimate horror, instead by building a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and individual torment in each of the kids. The cast is fantastic, Bill Skarsgard's performance as IT, in particular that of his clown form Pennywise, is terrifying, almost on par with Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. He definitely feels like more of a threat than Tim Curry's version, whom by today's standards seems a little too goofy and wacky to be scary. In addition to Pennywise, all of the child actors are brilliant. Not once did I ever feel unconvinced of the fear that they were feeling. Even the usual Stephen King tropes seemed more subdued in this film, aside from the usual setting in Maine, of course. If this is the future for adaptations of Stephen King's work, then I am most certainly on board. I rate it 9/10",It
955,jhenson-29069,"For simple minded, Stranger Things loving, millennials",1,10 September 2017,"If you've ever seen the original, and you have even the slightest modicum of respect for originality, story telling and artistic integrity, this movie should infuriate you. Firstly, it isn't really a movie. There is no story. It's basically just a 2 hour collection of different sorts of scares. The brilliance with the original was that it was a story of kids torn apart by a traumatic event, and then brought back together as adults to face their fears and avenge their friend. Great story. But this version was essentially a haunted house on the screen. They abandoned the kid to adult story and just focused on a group of kids getting scared. There was way too much ""comedy"" being sprinkled throughout. You know, the lame kind where the characters make some unoriginal comment and everyone in the movie theater bursts out laughing like Dave Chappelle just hit his stride on stage. And the random love stories among the kids that didn't matter or further any narrative. I could write a 10,000 word essay going into the depths of all that is wrong with this movie so I'll stop. The worst of all is watching all of America fall in love with this. It makes me feel like a cynical jerk, but I think really it's just a clear sign of the dumbing down of people on this earth. No one respects or cares about great storytelling anymore. Just give them cheap pop-up scares and they will be happy. It really is sad.",It

957,laylastepford,Stephen King's IT As A Generation X Period Piece,8,23 September 2017,"(1.) Independent (If you had never seen the original): Acting: 15/20 Writing: 34/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 34/40Overall: 83/100 BReview: This movie is more of a period piece about what life was like for many kids in Generation X, rather than a ""horror story"". There is so much negativity and despair without the presence of IT, that IT really only serves as a cherry on top of an already deflated childhood experience. IT is more symbolic of how Generation X were left as ""latchkey children"" while their Boomer parents were ""finding themselves"" and otherwise not taking full responsibility for themselves and especially not as parents.Since the story is more focused on the kids, they are seen much more in this film than IT/Pennywise is. The kids do a decent acting job, they're not awful or ""unbelievable"" but they definitely weren't trying to win any acting awards in their performances either - except for the kid who plays Eddie Kaspbrak, who does an outstanding job that goes above and beyond all of his peers in this film. While the other kids only did ""B"" or ""C"" grade level performances, this kid gave an ""A"" level performance and in a lot of ways, ""stole the show"".From what was seen of IT/Pennywise, the performance was adequate - nothing particularly special in a positive nor negative way. Overall it was a decent performance that didn't really stand out. The performance of IT/Pennywise is usually underwhelming and not very frightening as this film leans more on cliché ""jump scares"" rather than building any kind of real suspense or dread about the character.*Spoiler Alert!*Overall, the film serves as a great representation of Generation X's childhood, as well as representing Boomers and Silent Generationers during this time. The Boomer parents are mostly absent, abusive, overbearing and/or blame the Gen. X kids for perceived problems in their eyes. The Silent Generationers are tough, wise and politically incorrect.The film has some comedic Gen. X references, such as the recurring theme of ""New Kids On The Block"", which may very well go over the head of many Millennials.Unfortunately, part of the trouble of this film was it's goal to serve 2 Gods: Telling a story about Generation X as well as telling the story of Stephen King's IT. The result was that neither stories were able to reach their full potential and the intertwining added a bit of confusion/inconsistency.*End of Spoiler Alert!*(2.) Compared To Original TV Mini-Series: Acting: 12/20 Writing: 33/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 31/40Overall: 76/100 CReview: While it was very interesting to place this film in the 1980s and added something new and creative to the story, it also took quite a bit away from the original story and fear of IT, itself.*Spoiler Alert!*Part of the brilliance of the original IT, was the story about the ""loss of innocence"", and this was best portrayed in a 1950s setting - as in the 1980s, the children didn't start with much innocence to begin with. This greatly affected the suspense and scariness of Pennywise's character overall, as well as took away from this film being a ""horror"" film.As far as performances go, most of the kids in this film only did as good or lesser than their previous counterparts. This cast of kids didn't have the same chemistry in this film as those in the original and these kids were certainly less charismatic overall than their previous counterparts.Overall, some changes made were for the better, some for the worst, and some were neutralized by having both positives and negatives.Unsurprisingly though, the change that hurt this film the absolute most, was the change of Pennywise as Tim Curry is so irreplaceable. The thing about Tim Curry, is that he was a Broadway actor and the talent he had with his voice and acting ability is part of what made the character of Pennywise so iconic and memorable. Curry had captured the perfect essence of Pennywise when it came to look, voice and demeanor. His look and voice were perfect and consistent in their imitation of a clown and his behavior was frightening in the most subtle and suspenseful of manners. He was scary much like a crazy person is, the kind of crazy person that you never know what to expect from. In this remake however, Pennywise looked like an obsessed fan of KISS that wasn't enticing to any children at all and looked more like a ""loser"" than a ""monster"" or even a ""clown"". His voice was terribly inconsistent and a dead giveaway that something was wrong with him, logically serving as a HUGE clue for any kid to run away. His behavior can best be described as something between ""silly"" and ""lame"" - either way it was not frightening, compelling or memorable.Since this movie is such a Hollywood movie and not limited to TV production as the original was, this remake had much more consistent production work when it came to the special effects. However, this lacked a lot of the iconic and memorable scenes, shots and locations that the original had - including the ""house"" that linked Pennywise to the swamps, as the remake version was much more generic and nowhere near as inherently creepy as in the original. (Go figure.)*End of Spoiler Alert!*Overall, this was an interesting take on IT if it took place in the 1980s as opposed to the 1950s - and worth seeing for that reason, but it clearly didn't reach it's full potential and therefore was more underwhelming than it was impressive.Independent & Remake Scores Combined: Acting: 13.5/20 Writing: 33.5/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 32.5/40Overall: 79.5/100 C+/B-Overall this film was an interesting take on incorporating Stephen King's IT with a Generation X childhood period piece.",It
958,clairesmaybin,It's a no from me,1,18 September 2017,"There just isn't the heart that was there in the mini series. In my opinion. The actors were fine, but the story wasn't there. I believe there is to be a next installment covering the (now) grown ups. I'll probably watch it - if I've nothing better to do. It's simply not Steven King's ""IT'. ALso,they appear to have recycled the CGI lady from ' Mama' at one point : can't find it now, but look out for it. ""Beep,beep, Richie"" appears once, so far as I can tell - a long way into the film. Against all odds, I looked forward to this. But it's another turkey. Steven King tells great stories - why do the Hollywood mob insist on killing them?

959,liampemberton,Best Stephen King adaptation in years!,7,9 September 2019,"In the second adaptation of the classic horror novel of the same name by Stephen King, IT is the best King adaptation we've had in years. What many of his recent works turned into films seem to be missing, is competency and heart. Director Andy Muschietti gives us both of that. IT is a clear love letter to the 1980s like STRANGER THINGS (Finn Wolfhard is even in both), and at its heart, it's not a horror film, but a sweet coming-of-age story, that would make the film better than it is, because let me tell you this: It's a horror movie with a creepy clown, but that's not what makes IT IT. It's really the coming-of-age drama, watching these characters grow and experience love, bullying, etc. Whenever the movie is just about the Losers Club swimming or fighting their bullies, the story is at its peak, but then Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard) shows up, and my entertainment is drowned, and now what I'm witnessing is loads of misery, that is still fun, but not as engaging because to be quite frank, I don't care much about horror.All the child actors in IT do a good job, but the performance everyone keeps coming back to is Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, who is clearly very committed to the role, and thankfully not trying to imitate Tim Curry, but make a version of his own.",It

963,TorsoDahlia,A good film that could've been great but is still loads of fun.,7,7 September 2017,"This is a good film but not great by any means. Perhaps, to some extent it is the film buff in me or the Stephen King fan as well, even though I am not a die hard King fan, but I truly love and appreciate It more than most novels. Another could be the fact I am not a teenager and am 40. I grew up afraid of clowns because of the circus, Ronald McDonald and mimes and was ridiculed and teased for it for years. This also was when the very real urban legend of pedophiles dressed up as clowns were driving vans and cars around New England trying to lure kids into their vehicles many years before ""It"" was even around. Creepy stuff but very real. The original mini-series horrified me with the chameleon Tim Curry. Let's face it the only reason anyone remembers that film was Curry (even though the kids were great). In many ways, Curry spoiled us with showing why and how clowns are, or can be scary without needing crazy effects. This brings us to the remake. Personally, for a guy that clowns can scare still (think Bozo, Gacy, old school mimes, Curry) Skarsgard's Pennywise had none of that, but he sure brought the laughs. I really did enjoy when he was actually in the film but the overhaul of CGI took away from his performance. Over the top? Oh yes, but great fun regardless.I really enjoyed this film because it is a lot of fun. The kids to me were the film as much as the atmosphere was, but the character changes show how underdeveloped many of the characters were written such as Henry Bowers, Belch, Victor Criss, Patrick Hockstetter, and poor Mike Hanlon has nothing to do, which to any It fan raises red flags. Despite this character shift, the film still works. I see the film as some have called it as a darker version of Stand By Me but without any amazing acting or writing. Everyone in the film however, was good, but having no real character development before we rush you to the next big jump, or scare really left a bad taste in my mouth. Muschietti has some real talent (remember Mama?) in how the camera tells the story and he sure as hell loves the big scares but goes for them way too often which at times at least in my opinion takes away from its effectiveness as in overkill. One thing you can take away from it is, these kids can act and its a lot of fun viewing despite the horrible CGI shoved down your throat, the character rushing, and big changes that leave you scratching your head. Of course, many will likely have no idea what I am talking about, but others you know who you are.Personally, Skarsgard was likable, over the top of course but scary? Nah. I thought he did good with what he had but I found myself thinking who would be afraid of this clown? I wasn't, but perhaps that is the adult in me talking, although Curry sure as hell makes me flinch still to this day by mere looks and mannerisms alone. Here, Skarsgard's take on Pennywise does not seem developed if that even makes sense, and comes off trying too hard in longer scenes. At times early on he sounded like Yoda, then later on goofy noises and a voice resembling Heath Ledger's brilliant Joker, which on a side note I have found in several characters of late, so perhaps I am projecting. I found it amusing but not scary.In the end, It is a fun film that has a lot of good points but also is lacking in several others. If you are a King nut there are a couple of plot points that will no doubt make you rather angry, I get it I saw it too, but the film is still enjoyable despite them. Grab your popcorn, milk duds, sour patches, soft drinks, and enjoy the fun film that IT truly is.",It
964,waez,"Not as good as it should have been, but not THAT bad",7,4 January 2018,"Finally got to see this last night, and while the film is not a perfect adaptation of IT, far from it, it is certainly not a 1/10 train wreck like some of the reviewers here claim. Having read some reviews my expectations were extremely low, but the film had an impact on me in a way I did not expect. While it was good and scary as it should be, it got me thinking a lot about the book and how it affected me.I read IT in the spring of 1989 when I was fifteen years old, which means I don't remember much more of what happened in it than what they brought into the movie. However, I do remember how it made me feel. It made me feel longing, dread, love, loss and sorrow. When I finished the book I cried the rest of the night, not because of what happened to the characters in it, but because I wanted to be with them. They were my friends and I would never be able to be with them again, and that hurt more than anything I had ever experienced before. IT was the first and still is one of very few books that has ever had that effect on me. Watching the film last night did not in itself have that effect on me, but it did bring back some memories of those feelings.I believe for an on screen adaptation of IT to really capture the essence of the novel A LOT more time needs to be invested into character development. Therefore a well produced and written TV series over two seasons would have been much more fitting, IT is just not a story that allows itself to be crammed into a couple of two-hour films.Because of that the film leaves much to be desired as an adaptation of IT, but as a scary film on its own I liked it. Of course it helps that I don't remember enough detail from the novel to be offended at all the omissions. It has been 29 years since I read IT, and watching the film made me realize just how little I actually remember of it. I just bought myself a paperback edition, tonight I'm about to start out on a journey meet my friends again, and I couldn't be happier.Not a bad result for the film after all.",It

974,mcintyre64,Solid Remake - Did Not Disappoint - 7.5 - 8/10,8,18 September 2017,I think the original mini-series is underrated but considering this remake is bringing IT to the big screen and this is only the first chapter it really holds its own whether you have read the book or not and seen the original TV mini-series or not. The original is primarily narrated by Mike so it is strange that now Ben is the one who knows the towns dark history. However as the original is all flash backs and mixing childhood and adulthood that narration style would not work here. Pennywise is scary but I was disappointed there was no school shower scene as I thought that was one of the scariest scenes from the original. Special effects in the original were not great sometimes but here everything looks sharp. I did not understand how when the Losers Club are hunting down Pennywise they gain access to the drains and sewage system through the house on Neibolt Street unlike through the Barrens in the original. This is the only part of Chapter 1 that I did not think was as scary or well executed as before and there was a big change with how Beverly faces down Pennywise she was the best shot in the original but they took that whole narrative away here. Also they make no reference to the dead-lights verbally anyway which is quite strange considering that was a big part of the original and event though Beverly does get exposed to them this time Pennywise never speaks of his dead-lights. It may sound like I'm finding things wrong with IT but there were other changes to the story-line that I was not expecting which work pretty well and potentially if Chapter 2 is at least as good as Chapter 1 then this could be better than the original. Very clever how its released 27 years after the mini-series and how Chapter 2 will be in the present day again 27 years ahead. I also think if you have not watched the mini series then this would be scarier and you would not be anticipating what Pennywise will say or do.,It

This was so very one-dimensional just like the characters in it were - one dimensional. Wow! I expected more than this crap. It was flat.I loved the 1990 IT TV mini-series. It succeeded at everything this one failed at.Are we so used to quick sound bites and tweets that we can no longer have well-developed movies with substance?I will say I did like some of the nods to the old movie or book and the nostalgia of the times. They threw in a few of Stephen King's references to the times. I would say see it on some forum whether Netflix, the movies, or rental just as a flashback to the 1990 one.

So as a fan of King and his intriguing work I thought I'd give this film a watch. From the appearance of the 'Warner Bros' logo we are immediately sent into the town of Derry where a very atmospheric and effective first encounter with Pennywise occurs. The element that was so great about the miniseries was encapsulated in the introduction of this film, being the played innocence of Pennywise in persuading Georgie to take the boat with the untold sinister intent of killing him later. From that first appearance of Pennywise we don't get another one like it.... Instead we get jump scare after jump scare. Some I realised were necessary and had some weight to them but others felt forced and formulaic. And it seemed as though (due to all of the advertising)the movie had to show Pennywise past the appropriate amount of times until he was just about as scary as one of the kids moms. That being said I enjoyed the banter had by 'The Losers club' and the solid acting by the kids. The story as a whole was also entertaining (even though I'm not the biggest horror film fan)and Bill Skarsgard did a good job as Pennywise especially when he used subtle movements and mannerisms. There are some scenes that are exceptionally disturbing then some which are comical which I also liked.The ending was okay, I'm on the fence about it. They came together as emphasized because they are technically a 'club' to defeat Pennywise and overcome their fears. But then at times during the end fight it felt silly and too 'in your face.'

The humor worked so well, indeed it is a horror movie but you're going to end up laughing your ass off with this movie, it's a very funny movie where all the jokes landed!
Now addressing the second-rate part, there is not really a psychological horror, the special effects are not bad but there are points in this film where a should-be terrifying movie moment was kinda laughable!

Rather than performing on fleek, they look a little clumsy, even ridiculous (after all, they are not cool people like jocks or cheerleaders in school). However, for this reason, the determination that they show to defeat the clown is amazing and esteemed.I am still afraid of jump scares and heavy sound effects. I wish no clown in the movie so that I could immerse myself in the their childhood despite imperfect. Beverly always comes up to my mind when I am ruminating over the movie. On the one hand, she is still young, but she is mesmerizing and sexy that in her age it suppose not to be one of her characteristics, and due to her sexual attractiveness, she is bullied by others in school. On the other hand, she is bothered by his father over-care monitoring, so she can't relax and feel comfortable at home where should've been safe haven to a child. Fortunately, she comes across Losers's Club. It is a life-changing event in her life. Perhaps some people think that some plots in It(2017) are unexplained, or not clear enough. I, rather, am acceptable to the design and arrangement of the story. Audience could be aware that there should be more stories and backgrounds behind characters. However, it is smart and well-trained that screenwriter chooses to manifest ""fear"" the most, and the rest left blank for audience to imagine.So, many people may be curious about Beverly's relationship with her father. Here comes a big question: rape or not? Does her father toe the line?Ensemble cast, in a sense, is a good practice that makes the movie in a nice-paced tempo, in doing so, audience can always be excited and never feel bored.Also, it makes the most wicked antagonist, Pennywise the Dancing Clowndeed, ubiquitous. He can appear everywhere. In other words, fear appears everywhere. I can make a very distinct description of one scene -- all members of Losers's Club gather together watching slides and, all of sudden, the slide machine is out of order, moving through the slides at a breakneck speed......and you know what happen if you have watched the movie or one of the trailers. Brilliant! The best horror movie in 2017!",It

983,Film96,Terrifyingly brilliant. You'll float too.,9,31 August 2017,"What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: ""I wasn't prepared for how good it really was"".He's not wrong.""IT"" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor. It's a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original's tricks; it isn't filled with loud in-your-face jump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is why it's perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without the obnoxious gore.Watched the pre-release as a critic - August 28th.",It
984,Pansarfluff,"Good movie, but not really horrific",5,15 September 2017,"I was absolutely sure that this movie would terrify me, but it does not contain as much horror as one might expect. It contains a lot of humor and the scenes of pure horror are mostly short, which makes the movie feel like an emotional roller-coaster. This might be appealing to some people but I personally prefer the movies that mercilessly hold on to the horror, barely letting go even for a single comic relief.I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but as I expected to be scared I was disappointed anyway. The CGI looks ridiculous at some points and the funny parts are actually better than the scary parts. I could recommend this movie, but not to anyone who wants to watch a scary horror movie.",It

986,lynx1967,A King Mishmash,5,24 August 2019,"This movie seems to get rapturous praise from a segment of the population, a segment I suspect that has never seen a Stephen King adaptation made prior to 2014. I never fell in love with the book the way that many others have, and was not expecting much from this adaptation. I got what I expected.
Let's see.....a group of early teens calling themselves the ""Loser's Club"" bullied by psychopathic older teens....The Body/Stand by Me.
Sadistic parents who the Losers Club have to contend with every night....Carrie.
A creepy abandoned mansion that overlooks the town and is the center of the evil....Salems' Lot.
An evil plaguing a small Maine time...take your pick of any King adaptation (from Pet Sematary to Needful Things to The Mist).
And just to make sure the Loser's Club is politically correct, we have an African American teen and a Jewish teen.
At 2 hours and 15 minutes, the film fails to develop many characters clearly. It prefers to dwell on set pieces. It all seems to be a set up for ""Chapter 2.""
This apparently is the most successful horror film of all time. I'll stick with pre 2014 King adaptations. Except perhaps Maximum Overdrive......",It
987,calmdowndude,"""It"" is more than a horror movie - it's a great film",9,13 September 2017,"Note to the film makers out there who consider themselves horror aficionados... When you create a horror movie, start with the intent to make a great film.""It"" has a built-in cult following as many Stephen King adaptations do, but this film stands alone as the best Stephen King adaptation outside of ""Shawshank"". Why? The filmmakers do justice to several crucial elements to any good film: 1. They focused on a true-to-life script that felt real for both the setting, the characters, and the villain.2. The acting, especially by the child actors who are the lifeblood of the film, was phenomenal.2A. Let me single out Bill Skarsgard here, playing Pennywise is no small task, it takes a wide range of emotions that play out each time we encounter It - on several occasions we see Pennywise elicit several emotions in a matter of seconds - he brings an unpredictability and sporadic physicality to the role that works INCREDIBLY well and really keeps you on your toes. You're engaged whenever he's on screen. Kudos to his voice and terrific evil clown laugh, there's so much to love about his performance which I feel may be understated - the makeup is so scary that it may get lost just how much Skarsgard is bringing it in every scene. 3. The villain was the stylish, creepy, Pennywise - obviously the film needed this character to be near flawless to create a sense of impending doom at any moment... Success, Pennywise, even for those not afraid of clowns, puts most inter-dimensional pseudo-demonic villains to shame.The film works so well because character development was handled very carefully, we learn about each of our young protagonists along the way, and what we learn about them is continuously exposed by Pennywise in order to weaken their will. Without spoiling anything, this is a film about children being tormented by a demonic-clown, the very thought of children in danger can be unsettling, but ""It"" takes it to the next level - within the first 10 minutes of the film you will understand what you're in for, and you'll know right away that NO ONE, regardless of age or how you might feel about violence toward children, is safe. The other great thing about this film was cinematography coupled with special effects... honestly, and I did not expect this going in - but ""It"" is a visual spectacle - the set design, the scenery, the color-scheme, it's all beautifully (and sometimes terrifyingly) done.I could go on and on, this was a top notch horror film, plenty of jumps (if you're prone to that sort of thing), lots of spine tingling moments, and truly, nothing cheap - this film doesn't hold back. Beyond being a great horror film, it's a terrific coming of age tale, well written, well acted, well directed. I wouldn't be shocked if the film gets some surprise nods during awards season for cinematography, editing, sound, makeup and special effects, just my two cents.In summation: ""It"" is a dazzlingly terrifying spectacle that will stun you with every punch it doesn't pull. It goes beyond being one of the best horror movies of the past few decades, ""It"" is simply a tremendous film. Horror movies - take note, THIS is how it's done.",It

990,smittenkittens,"Some plot issues, but kept my attention",7,27 July 2019,"Okay, first thing is first, this movie could have been a lot shorter. Many of the reviews saying that there were too many character lines to follow and that some just didn't fit into the context are definitely true. Also, I do agree with reviews that it was annoying how ""IT"" would come attack when all of the kids were together at one time, since getting them alone would be much more efficient if it truly feeds off of childrens' fears. Then after attacking them, IT would just kind of...disappear all of the time.Now, some people say that the ability of IT to do anything and everything is annoying because IT seems to have no set and specific capabilities. He can change appearance, pop up anywhere, sprout tentacles, whatever..you name it, IT can probably do it. But then again, that's what I LOVED about IT. We don't actually know what IT is. Apparently it's some kind of evil force who masks himself as clown and preys on childrens' most inner fears. IT is not human, is it a demon? Some kind of alien? I liked that IT could do all of these things, because it wasn't predictable for me.The movie wasn't scary in the sense that it had a lot of ""BOO"" moments. In fact, I think there were only a couple, but a lot of the things were completely messed up. It was more psychologically freaky in that I was like ""WTF"" a lot of the time! That's my own personal preference though. Some people like stuff that jumps out at them the entire movie.Another interesting fact about the movie is that it has a good deal of...comedy! It's basically a horror/comedy kind of like The Visit.Of course there are plot holes and stuff that kind of doesn't make sense, but I choose to just look over those because it's Hollywood.",It
991,shelbylyn-92984,Anyone giving it above a 6 is stupid,4,11 September 2017,"So after all the hype I really went into this movie expecting a lot. I truly believe the best horror films are about simplicity and stereotypical jump scares just don't do it. I was hoping this movie wouldn't be composed of just that. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Overall I would say it was okay. The kids were great. But after having read the book and been a huge fan of the original I was really let down. ALSO ANYONE SAYING BILLS PERFORMANCE WAS BETTER THAN TIM CURRYS IS ON SOMETHING. To even make such a comment shows a complete lack in knowledge on the character of penny wise. The first scene I felt could've been much stronger on bills part although I was pleased with the rest of his acting in the film. Even still it will NEVER compare to Tims version. I'm the original when Georgie mentions the paper boat floating Pennywise gives a CHILLING orgasmic reaction when he replies ""oh yes Georgie it floats we all float down here"". This version was missing that initial orgasmic reaction that was so captivating and chilling in the original. This version of Pennywise was so cgi and over the top to a phony point it took me right out of it. And that's not a comment towards bill but rather the direction of the film, I have NO clue why Beverly looked into ""It's"" bright lights when In the original version that was reserved for Stan and explains his later suicide. There were so many things changed for the negative. Oh yeah and everyone saying they went to see this or liked it all because Stephen king said it was good is an IDIOT he makes an insane amount of money in royalties off of remakes like this from his books of course he's going to say that. He's said that about a lot of crappy films, America regain some integrity when it comes to art and what's mainstream. This is why people like the Kardashians are famous.",It
992,yedidakaren,8 out of 10.,8,3 November 2018,"I enjoy watching this movie a lot because it represents an adventure, a thrilling one to be exact. There are some predictable scenes and I think it's odd for me to see that the 80s don't really look like the 80s but overall, it was good.I like how the monster represents a child's nightmare and the concept of not believing things we see will make it disappear is also very interesting which makes the adults think the kids are being 'kids'. That's what this movie about, a kid's nightmare right? Though, of course there were adult victims too.In spite of I don't read the novel, I think the characters are acting very well. But I'm sure the novel version is definitely more complex than it shown in the movie. And I'm curious on the monster's history.",It

As with all horror and with comedy what you find scary or funny will be entirely subjective, but this movie does manage to create a beautifully creepy experience whether you are scared or not. It is highly enjoyable and I am particularly fond of the acting performances given by the children. I would highly recommend seeing this movie in theaters.",It
994,unwhiskyetaulit,If you float than IT...'s Monty Python's Flying Circus,6,22 October 2017,"Being one of those who read the book then saw the TV movie of 1990 (which had some ups and downs too), my opinion is that IT could have been way better than what I saw.Already in the trailers, what annoyed me the most was how Pennywise looked like. a real picture of killer clown. Far away from the Pennywise made by Tim Curry, where he continually mind played the children, the ""new"" Pennywise just tries to scare them.So sad because the Georgie/Pennywise scene was really very good but they didn't keep that pace for too long. And there are a lot of loopholes! For example, Pennywise killed Georgie nearly instantly, as with Patrick Hockstetter...but when IT faces one of the loser's club member, even isolated, he just let them live. And the kidnapping of Beverly is just completely inaccurate.Then some characters are really badly written. Just like Henry Bowers. In the TV movie, Henry was a real menace. Here, he only appears when needed to add some kind of tension...And after his fall, no one ever talks of him.Same conclusion with the kids. They've beaten Pennywise, found the victims and then what? Did they told the grown-ups or tried to give some clues? We won't know...Even the bond between the kids doesn't seem so strong.On the good side, Bill Skarsgaard really tries to do his best, Finn Wolfhard shows the same performance as in ""Stranger Things"" and Sophia Lillis's Beverly Marsh is excellent!To resume, IT is just a decent film that tries to respect the book but fails loudly on trying to be as scary",It
995,jaretricejhr,Loved IT.,9,21 December 2017,"I could not believe how much I enjoyed this film. I am not really much of a fan of the 'Horror' films, I definitely like a few, like Get Out, The Shining, It Follows, and others, but not a whole lot of them. But this film I couldn't help but enjoy. I really love the amount of comedy that they had put in this film, also loved Finn's role in the movie as Richie, reminds me of ""Stranger Things"". The fact that they were able to put a relationship (Bill and Beverly) along side the horrific story line was pretty incredible to me. Really wasn't expecting the sewer scene to be so horrifying when Pennywise literally BIT off Georgie's arm, which is honestly what they should've done considering that the mini series wasn't able to do it, because of it being on live 1990 television. The amount of story that they had put into this was pretty amazing. This was the most incredible way to make this movie and they definitely outdid themselves with it. After watching this movie, I started reading more Stephen King novels, mostly because I really enjoyed this film and couldn't help but credit this movie's story line. Also liked the style of horror it used, they used such a classic style of horror, but they made it even more nightmare-ish to the point where it's actually genuinely disturbing. After this movie, I'm definitely going to start reading more Stephen King novels. If you enjoy more of the classical horror, then I'll bet you'll enjoy this flick.",It

I don't wanna be anyones mom but I liked the kids A LOT. They just rocked being a kid... I don't like all the gloomed and doomed kind of scary movies so the smart ass jokes made them very endearing. I didn't care about the logic flaws because I liked the cinematography ... the 80's vibe. Well they overdid Beverly's dad..and Eddies mom but that's that... And Mama makes an appearance... Its so weird that some would expect art each time they go see a movie...

1001,Hotdaugz,IT.,10,31 May 2019,"IT can be disappointing for many movie watchers who loved the original. It is hard to please a large audience of previous fans, due to nostalgia and the original being beloved by many. The film also disappoints horror movie fans who are used to more high-depth scares. Before seeing the new IT movie, I watched the original movie to ensure that it was fresh in my mind. I do believe the new movie has improved on the original movie. The original movie, leaves viewers wondering, how horrific were IT's actions towards the children he planned on consuming? For eg. The sewer scene is much more graphic in the new movie, and showed exactly what viewers in the original film would have imagined to have happened, unlike the original which just fades out. IT with in the original movie, was a lot more creepy.. towards the children and seemed a lot more stalkerish, making him seem like a cannibal. The new IT seems a lot more interested in scaring the children, so he can feed off their fear, which is what is supposed to be his intention. (Both movies have a different approach).I really loved the world that the movie was situated in, it reminded me of movies such as: The Goonies, Stand By Me and Stranger Things (All which I love). I really love films that bring you back to your childhood and allow you to relate to how easier life was back when you were a child. All the young actors were amazing!I believe that if you are to watch this movie, do not go into it with a horror mindset, although it is a horror, it is not that scary. It almost feels like a children's Horror movie. But I love this movie, as the world they are in and the characters have so much 'character' to them, they are all quirky in their own little way. Some of the CGI Scenes are a bit disappointing. For eg. The scene in which the woman comes out of the picture, was unnecessary for me, but was a tribute to the movie Mama.. but just felt out of place for me. But overall I loved the CGI in the Sewer scene and the CGI did not put me off. I really hope they improve on the horror aspect in Part 2 though, and I believe they can as it will not be revolved around children, and there is a lot of stigma about what you can portray on camera when using child actors, as there can be a lot of back lash if something is too extreme for the audience that is watching.One thing I will say is that I wish there was more character build up for Georgie as it would be a lot more emotional, to watch the sewer scene and shocking, if you were more attached to Georgie, you'd feel more for Georgie being swept away into the sewer. Although I believe this would have been an added benefit, I also believe that this could have made the movie too long and also could be unappreciated as it is also great that the movie gets into the story right away.Overall I found this movie to be mildly scary, but if I was not to consider any genre for this movie, I would not mind. I believe this movie is enjoyable without being scary in my opinion. I believe that for viewers who do not typically enjoy horror movies, this could be one to watch to ease into the horror genre!",It

Probably the most well known horror movie of our time and it's definitely as good as what it's stacked up to be, if not better. I've watched it multiple times because it's just an amazing film adaption. I thought all of the kids were 1- funny and 2-talented. My favorite character was Richie, because he kept it all light even though they were literally being chased by a killer clown who can manipulate your sight. Another character I loved was Beverly. Wish she would have realized Ben wrote the letter, though. Sophia Lillis is extremely talented and I would love to see her do more horror. The special effects were great on Pennywise but Bill just played him in a way that nobody else could have. So glad they picked the perfect actor. Such an amazing movie in every way. I kind of wish there was more explanation behind 'It's' origin though, because I spent a long time trying to figure out what 'it' truly was but I never found much of an answer. Maybe a movie/book about that clarifying if it's a spirit or a supernatural force? I don't know, but that's the only reason I'm not giving it a 10.

How come he suddenly turned into an outright killer? The black boy... at one point we see him next to the well, exhausted after the fight with the bully; in the next shot, we see him in the sewers, running with the other kids. Other than that, this film was actually a pretty good thrill! The special effects were awesome, and it had some genuinely creepy moments. Spooked me a bit!

Here it's a clown with some kind of unpredictable behaviour. He switch fast from a childlike innocence appearance to a monster with a psychedelic smile and multiple rows of sharp teeth. But it's not pennywise who steels the show. This is more a coming of age movie and the young actors are performing absolutely amazing.

The screenplay represents the case of Pennywise vs. Derry adequately. The ending has one asking a few questions, namely about the lost children and the parental crises with the children that dominate much of the film's track on the otherwise not Pennywise.Definitely a very scary experience, with references to Psycho, Don't Look Now, and many other films, without copying or trying to better the previous takes on evil.

However, the film is so much more than that.IT 2017 is directed by Andres Muschietti and stars a group of very talented young actors, with the stand out being Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things fame, as well as Bill Skarsgård playing the classic Pennywise that will give you nightmares for months.The film is about a group of kids who live in Derry, Maine who ban together to stop a killer clown, Pennywise, from feeding off children's fears. The film's story has been told before in the 1990 miniseries of the same name, however in the 2017 reimagining, the film is told entirely from the kid's perspective and is light years better than the miniseries. Skarsgård, who plays Pennywise, the dancing clown, gives one of the most bone chilling and memorable performances of the year.Skarsgård owns the role from the way he moves to the way he talks and completely sells the creepy nature of Pennywise as well as still maintaining the mystery and mystique of the character. Even though Pennywise is shown more they some might deem necessary, he owns the screen and has the power to scare the hell out of anyone with a pair of eyes. The character is selling point of the film and will be remember for years to come.Muschietti has crafted a beautiful looking film with scares that will keep you awake thinking about them. Particularly, one in a garage, have fun sleeping! Not only do the scares work, the humor is also, very funny. The writers have done a great job on having the dialogue sound believable. The things that the young cast say are very much how young grade school kids would one another. From dropping F bombs to talking about each other's sisters, the humor works.As I said before, this is a beautiful film. From some very nice wide shots of Pennywise to the look of Derry, Muschietti has made a film that could be realistic while also sticking to King's classic feel. This is very much a Stephen King film, thick and through. From the kids jumping off cliffs into the lake in only their underwear to a father that really likes his daughter, King's signature touch is all over this film.However, with all the positives, come the negatives. I have one minor problem with the film. That problem being that when the scares come and when Pennywise appears on screen, the film never gives the scares time to breathe. When the tension is at an all-time high, it is broken with funny dialogue. When you have a scene that is very intense only to break the intensity with humor can become rather annoying for the audience.Out of all the great films this year, from Get Out to Baby Driver, IT has, without a doubt, been the most fun I have had all year at the theater. From the great scares the film delivers, to the hilarious dialogue, IT is not only a great horror film, but one of the best films of the year.",It

I had to turn it off it is possibly one of the worst film ever made and the fact people cannot see that makes me sad for the human race. The sound design is so awful there is no subtlety its just loud noises and SPOOKY CLOWN CUT, next scene, someone walks around doing something meaningless and the LOUD NOISES SPOOKY CLOWN!!!

The psychological prowess he has is not seconded in the horror genre.It the film, starts menacingly enough, but labours to try and crank up the psychological impact of the foreboding fear. The nostalgic intricacy and network of these teenage misfits are wonderfully executed and outside of this framework would stand alongside the movie based on Kings' short story ""Stand by Me"" as being a sublime and engrossing cinematic experience, but it isn't. The jokes, exploits, and perceptions of these kids is shadowed by an over cgi'd, frankly not scary clown. The jump scares may get you, but the clown is weak, and a caricature so familiar that it failed to scare, shock or delight me in it menace. It was so weak on horror elements that I found myself wishing for the film to end. I was thoroughly disappointed by the overall piece and lament yet another failed attempt at capturing King's mastery of horror.",It

1020,hferdon,I'm thankful I didn't pay money for this in the theater,3,27 June 2018,"I just watched the original It from 1990, and that was pretty good, considering some parts were a little hokey, but all in all a pretty good film I might buy later. This remake... I don't think I can say the same. I only watched the first 45 minutes, and then turned it off because I immediately felt uncomfortable and sick to my stomach. I understand that Pennywise is an alien that comes every 30 years to feed on the children to survive, but from what I saw of the first 45 minutes, they made It too graphic and gory. It's one thing to know that Georgie gets killed by It, but it's traumatizing to see Georgie try to crawl away from the storm drain on a knub of an arm... That gave me the complete sick feeling and uncomfortableness. The whole thing with Beverly getting picked on by a girl at school, in my opinion, was not needed and completely annoying, and the whole Michael having to kill lambs for his uncle's meat shop was COMPLETELY uncalled for. We all know that us humans eat animals, but we don't want to see animals get shot and killed, which made me feel completely uncomfortable and sick again!! AND, last but not least, I know that the guys encountered the bullies, which is expected, but I didn't think that Henry would go as far as ACTUALLY carving into the kid's stomach, I thought it would be the same as the original in the sense of he kicked Henry and then fell back before actually being touched by the blade, which made me also feel uncomfortable and sick. Do you guys see a pattern!?!?!?!? I don't like these certain parts because they made me feel very uncomfortable and sick, and that's not something I want from a movie. So, if I had to choose between It 1990 and It 2017, I would definitely choose the 1990 version hands down!",It

My girlfriend and I are big fans of the original IT 'Miniseries"" and it made us happy to see that they had done this new movie well.The gore was over the top for sure but it seemed to work and kept me tempted. Every time you thought, the jump scare was not going to happen, it did and I hate when a horror movie builds up a scare and then it never happens. All that for nothing.IT was genuinely scary and held true to the story for the most part, which was awesome. It had an absolutely amazing cast, which included an amazing casting choice for IT and the kid from ""Stranger Things"" was in it.The scares were great. The Comedy was great. The story was held to.

It's not just the best horror film I've seen but the best film I have seen in a long time. The comedy and Horror element is balanced perfectly. Reminds me of the kids banter and humour in stand by me. It can get really scary at times and lots of jumps and thrills and laughs to keep you engaged. Also the running time is perfect, you may think it's long but you do not notice it as it's so enjoyable from start to finish. The people on here who give this film bad reviews seriously need their heads examined. Do not take notice. I can't wait for chapter 2 however without the kids I don't think it would be as good but who knows.Go and watch asap it's Excellent!!!",It

In this times usually you know that remakes are full of invented things to make it ""better"" or for a bigger audience, this one stays in the same context which i loved and respected.

1031,chrisandjade-59663,Wow wow wow,10,9 September 2017,"The original film/mini series, like most people scared the hell out of me as a child, i remember i couldn't even look at the VHS cover in the video shop! As a teenager I tried to read the book, but never made it passed the first chapter (I love King, but struggle too read him). Years later, I re-watched IT and it was more funny than scary but I appreciated it for the classic it is.So, with news of the remake, and the trailer I was so excited! I love horror films. Watched it last night and I'm obsessed and very impressed.First of all, Pennywise, I actually preferred this one. Yes Tim Curry was iconic and has die hard fans out there but this guy for me was intense. From the discreet drooling from his mouth, his voice, his speed and agility...fab! i've read some criticism of the cgi effects but no complaints from me.The child stars are incredible little gems. Little Eddie is my favourite. The innocence and chemistry between them adds to the amazingness of this film.There are a whole new group of nasties that IT takes the form of. The lady in the painting, oh my god, one particular scene was grim af.This film will make you laugh, feel scared and make you care. I can't wait to watch it again.",It
1032,mitchellzelenak,The mass amount of hype made this a let down,6,8 September 2017,"When I heard all the talk of the new movie, It, I was nothing but excited to see what the film had in store. Unfortunately, the movie didn't quite live up to the hype. There were many amazing scenes throughout the film, with top notch music, creepy moments, and surprisingly good child actors.I think the downfall lies in the lack of scare factor, the run time, and the mass amounts of comedy. I have no issue with comedy in a horror movie, but when the movie is over 2 hours long and 60% is comedy, I start to wonder where the scares are. I found myself laughing in scenes that were supposed to be serious due to characters trying to throw in ""just one more joke"" which began to wear on me. It's a good movie and should definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the original or just looking for a new horror flick.",It
1033,phamtastic_info,The message buried inside the abyss.,9,19 January 2018,"This film does a great job at portraying the very dark struggles of life. It's rare to come across such films, especially with a cast of youth executing the messages, calling it well done would be quite the understatement. This is one of those light beacons capable of taking anyone out of a storm.I'm not someone who has read the book, or seen the original film but I can definitely appreciate how deep they tried to go with this remake.The hidden messages revolve around deep rooted fear, and ironically, a clown gets to be the icon. Representing all the horrible things man is capable of. Subjects of degeneration, egotism, incest, selfishness, and despair, to name a few, were all drawn out.Which really makes the moments of unity tear dropping, I have never cried watching a horror movie, but this one got me pretty good.Certain people will appreciate this film a bit more than others, particularly the ones who have been touched by the dark side and are struggling to find the light.Stay enlightened dear friends!",It
1034,juliewozniakstar,only the acting was sometimes good,6,7 January 2018,"After such noise about this movie I decided to watch it. I was expecting frightening movie but I am disappointed. The title character wasn't really scary, every 'to be' dreadful scene was so predictable. The plot wasn't that bad, in my opinion if the clown wasn't there, the movie would be a 7/10 drama movie. I would like to congratulate the young actors that played very good and at many moments I was amazed by their role play. The thing I was also disappointed in was the ending, I was expecting something gripping and it was too happy for me. After all, I give it 6 points out of 10 mainly because of the actors.",It
1035,amandafeelashes,Average but worth a watch,6,9 September 2017,"A solid 6I was so looking forward to this movie. We have waited a long time for it (27yrs) I wanted not to be disappointed but....it was all just very average.Before I continue I want to make it clear the love I have for the original TV mini series. It was on repeat in my house as a child and I feel nothing but nostalgia (and fear) when I think of it or watch it. So to see this new version miss out on some of the vitals that made the original so special was disappointing.Things I didn't like. The kids were not innocent or naive enough. The original story took place in 1960 when of course it was a more innocent time. This was lost in this new film as it was set in 1989. The constant babbling between the boys was really annoying and pointless to the story. When the kids were all experiencing their individual encounters with Pennywise there was zero structure with no purpose or history to their encounter. The kids were flakey, they didn't have the strong individual personalities needed to make them distinguishable. The second part to the mini series heavily relied on us caring about the kids in the first half then continuing their stories as adults and how their lives had panned out since leaving Derry. In the 2017 remake the only ones I cared about was Bill, Beverly and Ben the others just blurred into one character. Too much cgi!! Poor and not scary! Most disappointing was the cgi encounters that were not Pennywise e.g. the lady in the painting, the headless man in the library and the zombie creature outside the derelict house. Why even bother it was done so badly. I also never really got the feeling from this film of how wrong and bad things are in Derry I felt this was skirted over a little. And last but not least a lot of the scenes with Pennywise I couldn't help but notice his contacts (eyes) or whatever they used for his eyes were in wrong so took away from the experience of fear as I was too busy wondering what was wrong with his eyes! And no mention of dead lights anywhere :(Things I did like. Most of the scenes with Pennywise packed a punch and were frightening. I liked how they linked the famous phrase 'they all float down here' to a visual in the end scenes. I liked the creepy chemist character and Mr Marsh, to me they represented Derry and all that was wrong with it. Bill, Ben and Beverly all great and well developed characters. Good humour throughout and it was used at correct times in film.Bad out ways the good unfortunately but I do think this film has done well in continuing the clown fear legacy!",It
1036,ashleynkateri,One of the Best Stephen King Adaptations,9,9 September 2017,"I thought the movie was amazing.Bill Skarsgard did an amazing job of playing Pennywise in my opinion. I remember watching the 90's miniseries and wondering how kids got lured by Pennywise because he seemed sinister right off the bat. However, in this movie although Pennywise was undoubtedly creepy, in his scene with Georgie I thought he did a great job of seeming more friendly for a short time. Bill's version was sinister and felt really deranged. He didn't get as many lines in the movie as I would have hope for, but the scenes where he was taunting/fighting them I thought were really well done and pretty scary. Although, that being said, one thing I didn't care for about Pennywise was when he attacks them he does this bizarre shaking thing which can be seen in the previews. Maybe because he's the dancing clown? I'm not sure but it made me laugh in the theater. My friend was terrified though so maybe I'm just weird.This movie doesn't follow the book exactly, but I think in terms of film adaptations, it stays pretty close. The one thing about the movie that bothered me was the nearly complete lack of stories that Ben, Mike and Stan got. The book has tons of backstory on each of the losers so I thought it was strange that they're kind of just background characters. Ben is on screen more than the other two, but really has no backstory other than being the new kid and having a crush on Beverly. Those three aside, I thought the kids who had the most screen time did an amazing job. Richie was absolutely hilarious and pretty much what I had pictured when I was reading the book. I think Eddie, Bill and Beverly were also pretty much spot on. Overall, I think this movie is worth the watch. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hardly noticed that it was over 2 hours because the cast did such a great job. I'm really excited to see what they do with the next movie.",It

""Goonies""... 80's kind of vibe... which I believe was the goal in this movie... I found myself very much on the side of the kids... in particular the character played by Jeremy Ray Taylor and Finn Wolfhard... These young actors really stole the show for me...However as for ""it"" being scary... Is there such a thing as an actual scary movie anymore?? Bearing in mind I am getting old now... I couldn't take Pennywise seriously and didn't find him scary at all... Bill Skarsgård played the part well.. but he wasn't as good as Tim Curry... He was good...

The scares are well-produced, even where the CG is heavy-handed. The spirit and flavor of the book, the heart of it, is very much intact for anyone willing to look.For detractors who see a Stranger Things scapegoating, I'd ask you to consider that the book was published over thirty years ago with characters who were meant to be contemporary. Setting aside the budgetary issues involved in encapsulating both the fifties and the eighties (production design for It 2017 didn't cover proper packaging in the pharmacy scenes, whether by choice or not), sticking to the original timeline would have obstructed the story itself. It would be less accessible, and with more time wasted making the touchstones of generation upon generation ring true. Time moves on, and these characters have moved with it.That said, It was incredibly well-crafted by people who seem to love and understand the source material, both its profanity and its divinity.

Well the movie was a big big delusion.First of all, why change the time period from '50 to '80 ???It doesn't make any sense, if not for the appeal of the new generation of kids......but still nonsense for me, and most of all for the story itself.
The best parts of the book were cut off, like the characters presentation of the kids, totally missed ; the fear they feel about what is happening in town; the story of Derry and the story of Pennywise, the Turtle, and mano otterrai things.

1051,rosspatrick-26-445640,Things really do float down here. Like this TURD,4,9 September 2017,"OK so firstly I see myself as a horror fan and loved the original IT when it came out all those years ago an IT fan and was super excited to see an IT remake announced so I have been following the hype on this quite closely. It's sad to say this is the same kind of empty let down that I felt with the new Blair Witch. So the film the acting in the film is great the kids are great, the overall 80s look and feel for the film is spot on. However the let down is unfortunately the star attraction Pennywise. I was felt the original Pennywise was more scary as he looked like a regular clown that someone could dress as and from my faded memory of the original this clown invaded the real world and creeped us out there, which is why it was scary, similar to Freddy Krueger. This new Pennywise is more alien and looks like a Victorian clown I think they must've tried to match him to dates and the history of Derry. The new Pennywise also only seems to operate in a very restricted way in his own body utilising the fears of children so he never really physically leaves his domain which leaves this film with a main character that doesn't do too much. There's some good cgi effects in this towards the end of the movie but also some really lame effects applied to the way Pennywise moves. In a nutshell the movie is too long and spends way too long trying to decide whether it wants to be Stand by me or Stranger Things which leaves it in a really weird unscary wilderness. Not a great movie and I'm feeling let down.",It

1053,Wally-E,Pretty good,7,10 September 2017,"I didn't see this movie in a normal theater, so that might have an effect on my score. I saw It in a Dolby theater and It sounded amazing. With that said, here is my review that no one will see or care about.This movie is the opposite of most movies in the since that the kids were great and the adults acted like a paycheck was gonna be given no matter how bad they were, except for one. Bill Skarsgård.Skarsgård has said he wanted his own Pennywise and didn't want to emanate Tim Curry, while I don't think Skarsgård is Oscar worthy, he does a damn good job as Pennywise.All of the kids are good in their own right, but Jaeden Lieberher as Bill is fantastic. He never broke character, I thought his stutter was very realistic, and of all the kids I think he has the best chance of having a career. But non of this would work if the movie looked and sounded bad.It doesn't, like I saw this movie in a Dolby theater, so that might be why It sounded so damn good and loud, but cinematography is really good. I really am trying my best to not spoil this movie and I am coming off like I can't review a movie, but trust me when I say. If the adults were better, this would be an 8.4 out of 10.

I watched the movie, and the opening was humorous enough to make me burst in to laugh. This movie is nowhere near scary, even for a teenager. Apart from the mediocre cast, everything is horrendous including the CGI, cinematography, directing, and the worst of them all, sound effects. It reminded me of children's animations like Tom and Jerry, making jolly noises hitting each other with baseball bats. Furthermore, IT does not deserve to be on screens, let alone receiving so much publicity. I've been in IMDb for almost 10 years, however, I rarely write any reviews.

For starters,ALL of the children cast did a phenomenal job. The actor who portrayed Pennywise was both creepier and more disturbing! This actor made the character his own and was nothing at all like Tim Curry.Enjoyed most of the writing and changes of this version of the movie. Overall, I thought ""It"" was great and I'd go see it again.For fans of dumb-downed, Slasher Horror Films like ""Saw"", this is NOT ONE OF THEM!!! This is a smart, entertaining horror film with good writing and character development. Go see ""IT"" for yourself.",It

1057,stamenkovickosta,This movie demonstrates why hype is a bad thing,5,21 January 2018,"This movie war hyped up big time: it's trailer was excellent, it was promoted all over the internet and TV as a huge, game changing horror. Having read the book it was based on, hype seemed reasonable. But i decided to ignore the hype and postpone reading the book so i could see this movie without bias.It wasn't that good.On bright side, all actors do good job (especially kids that play Bill and Beverly). Movie looks nice and on technical aspect, it is better than 1990's miniseries. But when it comes to bad stuff... Oh boy.First big problem that is easy to notice is time period change. It was completely pointless and seemed more as a cash-in on Stranger Things and other 80's nostalgia crap. Due to this change, story loses a lot of it's important elements, like racism. It was definitely much stronger in 50's than in 80's.Second: characterisation. Bill has lost his brother and wants to find him. OK, that makes sense. What about everyone else? What do we get to know about them? When it comes to Eddie and Richie, they are more comedy duo than characters. At first they were funny, but they got annoying after some time. Beverly is the closest one to having some form of character arc, but it remained mostly underdeveloped. Her relationship with Ben started out as very sweet, but then, all of sudden, she loves Bill. Where the hell did that come from? Characters of Mike and Stan are pointless, as they do absolutely nothing of importance throughout whole movie. No, wait, Mike pushed the bully down the well. Yay! But so could anyone else.Third: Pennywise. In older adaptation, Pennywise was your typical monster with unknown origins and without any backstory or explanation of what it is. But he at least had personality, thanks to Tim Curry. From being joyful, he turns into monster within seconds. And that's great. In this movie, on other hand... It was just a generic, dumb monster without any character or personality. I honestly couldn't understand how he managed to lure children to come to him. Even though he was intimidating in the opening scene, he got more and more annoying with each next appearance, up to the point where you don't even care. And the fact that he was mostly CGI didn't help him.Fourth: CGI. How can 2017's movie with multi-million budget end up with such bad and unrealistic effects? None of the CGI monsters looked real, and therefore were not scary nor intimidating. The most annoying part was that they would always show up followed by annoying loud sound effect, which only ruins suspense even more.Fifth: plotholes. Yes, there were those too. Like: why the hell does Henry Bowers wants to kill Ben at the beginning of the movie? Did any of the bullies notice that one of their friends is missing? If one kiss brought back Beverly from lifeless state, could they also save other kids? What happened to Georgie? Was he also among the floating kids? Why are those kids floating in the air, anyway? Isn't it more logical that they float on surface of the water? Did director just wanted a cool visual? Why does Beverly kiss with Bill even though Ben kissed her just 5 minutes ago? If you can overlook these issues, you will find this movie good. Myself, i could tolerate some of them, while others would just piss me off. And now after reading the book, i have to say that IT fails as an adaptation too. Even though it has some fun parts, IT is very forgettable movie, and definitely not a game changer in horror genre.",It
1058,finnski,Best film of the decade,10,17 September 2017,"This is the tale of It, the first big screen adaption of the Stephen King bestseller of the same name; and that opening sequence is so iconic now that it has been swallowed into our collective subconscious like an urban legend.(Contains possible spoilers)This film has had a hard 7-year road to get to our cinemas, and that road has been littered with replaced directors, and actors tasked with playing the title character. It arrives on our screens with the weight of expectation and trepidation on the part of its many many loyal readers who have been waiting with eager baited breath to finally see what they have anticipated ever since first discovering the sublime book, and pinning their hopes on a faithful adaption.So was the wait worth it?First a quick summary of the films plot – For centuries the town of Derry has been home to Pennywise, a monstrous creature who can become your greatest fear to 'season the meat' as it were, and Its favourite prey is children, with their furtive imaginations and powerfully felt emotions. After the opening scene's death of young Georgie, his brother Bill grows obsessed with the idea of ending IT's reign of terror and, together with his band of 'loser' friends, sets about killing IT.Also in this mix is The Bowers Gang, led by unhinged snivelling bully Henry Bowers; and the losers have parent troubles particularly Beverly and her entitled and abusive father, and Eddie with his Munchausen's by Proxy mother. The town itself has a rich history of savagery and sacrifice, which is touched on also.There is a love triangle that is achingly realised, and a deeper story about the fear of growing up and confronting your own monsters, whatever they may be.The novel has a more fluid timeline darting between childhood and adulthood as they battle this eternal beast, but the movie has separated the child storyline from the adult one and so it is 'chapter one' we are discussing here.This sounds like a straightforward monster movie but it is so much more than that, as the mythology itself stretches out far beyond the confines of this film. Having said that, the scares are effective and memorable, and that opening sequence in the rain is brutal and breath-taking, an amazing start to proceedings.Directed with a deft touch by Andy Muschietti (Mama) It is equal parts coming of age nostalgia and creeping evil horror. He knows how to tug at your heartstrings, make you smile but then look around the frame for the next delicious morsel of horror coming your way.The musical score is sometimes expansive and epic, sometimes creeping and haunting – impeccable.The cast is nothing short of astounding, everyone brings their A game and its truly wonderful to see each beloved character cast so perfectly; I'd love to pick a stand out but each one imbues their character with just the right look or nuance. Jaeden Lieberher as Bill is vulnerable and strong and sweet and determined all at once, his love for and loss of Georgie keenly felt and portrayed. Sophia Lillis as Beverley is knowing and generous and guarded, as she is in the book. Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie is commanding on screen and utterly believable in a part that could have gone awry, he is an explosive new talent and has a big career ahead of him. Finn Wolfhard as Richie has flawless comic timing and brightens every scene he is in whilst still allowing the character to be real – effortlessly perfect.And Pennywise? Bill Skarsgard is a revelation, by turns menacing and petulant and childlike and evil; I wish there had been more of him but I understand that an over saturation of such a character would have unbalanced the movie and so best to be left wanting more.It is not slavishly faithful to the novel, and weirdly, I'm OK with this. I view it more as an appetizer, a companion piece to the novel. Many things are touched on in the film that would then be expanded upon by reading the source material. The majority of changes made did not hurt the things that are most important in this story because ultimately its not about the details or even IT itself.This is a movie about that fraught time between childhood and adulthood when you feel your old self slip away and become someone else entirely, its about the power of imagination and how friendship can be your greatest strength against the things that scare you, its about love and life and growing up.This movie may only scratch the surface of the books depths, but it has the novels heart and spirit, and is everything I could have hoped for. That, for me, is enough",It
1059,chris_rossbach85,Not good....laughable,5,9 May 2019,"Oh where to start...? Let's see, I really liked the original movie and was stoked to see a remake coming out, so expectations were pretty high which usually doesn't end well.I'll just stick with a couple main points that I couldn't get past:
1) the casting for Pennywise, terrible! It's a kid! Nobody is scared of a kid....would have been wayyy better for it to be an old man clown, how about Tim Curry?!
2) Again with the clown, what's with the weird like baby talk he kept doing?? not scary!
3) Furthermore, with the CLOWN....the stupid CGI type effects of him moving around were way too over the top
4) Lastly, in this review anyway, was how much the kids used cuss words. I'm not against swearing in movies at all. But this seemed so over the top ridiculous and forced that it was super cringe worthy",It
1060,jacklowriewilliamson,"Give IT a watch, if you dare...",8,16 September 2017,"Adapted from Stephen King's best selling novel, 'IT' is a horror/thriller film that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. An evil, paranormal creature that preys on children in the guise of a clown, affectionately named 'Pennywise the Dancing Clown', has risen from the sewers after 27 years to feed on the fear of the innocent. It is up to Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) and his friends to hunt down the creature and avenge the death of his younger brother.Personally, I am not a big horror fan, probably due to the onslaught of awful films (i.e. the Paranormal Activity series) to hit the big, and little, screens in recent years. However, I can confidently say IT has put my faith back into the genre. It is very thoughtful to the original King book, following the same story, except in a highly condensed form (which can be problematic in some areas). All the younger actors are brilliant, portraying a really believable 'buddy' dynamic throughout; reminiscent (ironically) of The Goonies and the other classic flicks of that era. Jaeden Lieberher's character 'Bill' and Sophia Lillis' character 'Beverly' stood out the most, in my opinion, with their different connections to the creature representing how IT fed off the vulnerable and innocent.Bill Skarsgård's portrayal of Pennywise was truly outstanding. He maintained the continuity of his characterisation throughout, without trying to rip-off Tim Curry's infamous interpretation. I like Skarsgård's portrayal, which is extremely creepy and bipolar. I wouldn't say it is inherently scary, however if you consider the context of who Pennywise is and who he is preying on, it does send a chill down your spine.A few reviewers were complaining about how the story had been moved from the 50s (as in the original novel) to the 80s. I personally think the move was great. They could have very easily transported the story line into 2017 and filled it with forced 'current' references. However, they chose to update the story (a bit) by making it more relevant to its adult audience, who probably grew up in the 80s. Remember, the story is trying to represent how innocent and vulnerable children are, since they are the only ones who can be tortured by Pennywise.Like mentioned above, the compressed nature of the story can prove to be problematic at times, with some characters receiving little screen time or limited characterisation, such as 'Mike'. The addition of Henry Bowers and his gang also did seem pointless at times. However, it is clear that King and the screenplay writers wanted to juxtapose the vulnerabilities of (so called) 'harmless' high school bullying with the evil, child preying clown. Overall, if you are looking for an entertaining horror film that has an immersive and menacing story line, give IT a watch.",It

Unlike some other reviewers, i dived right into the movie's world and enjoyed every second of IT. 8/10 because IT's not a perfect movie, highly entertaining though.To Wade Huski - the movie is R-rated, so you obviously shouldn't take a little child and show him IT.",It

1063,benjaminmoleb10,"A fun movie, but nothing special",6,7 September 2017,"(I'll be playing fast and loose with spoilers here)I generally enjoyed this movie but there were a whole lot of really odd things that irked me. Characters in this movie generally make good decisions, something you don't often see in horror movies, so it felt really odd when one character was assaulted with a knife and they don't take him to hospital or even tell the police; they just steal some cotton balls and... patch him up? Another point, I know in American movies the bullies are always cartoonishly evil but come on, they carve letters into some kids chest with a switchblade. That's an actual crime. But heck, perhaps it's just set in the most anomalously amoral town in the world, because the adults are all evil too. From the rapist dad, to the insulting librarian, to the 50-somthing pharmacist flirting with a 15 year old. I wouldn't mind but the movie explains none of this, it spends the whole time talking about something that happened long ago, and alluding to a curse and goes nowhere because (surprise surprise) this is IT: Chapter One, of however many chapters will stop making money i guess. With all this said, i didn't actually hate the movie. As child actors go, they got some good ones (the main 2 or 3 especially); and the creature is fantastic. Some of the vfx were a bit unconvincing but most of the effects were great, i loved pennywise who was brilliantly acted and choreographed, and the score was really brilliant.Unfortunately i didn't find it scary; mostly relying on cheap jumpstartles. There was a scene or 2 that were scary (and one that was actually very scary to me at least) but mostly the scares were pretty telegraphed. I recommend a watch, but only really for the villain. 6/10",It
1064,acemark102,Overrated? A bit. Good? Maybe.,6,8 September 2017,"I went into 2017's It with decently high expectations. I haven't read the original door-stopping 1000+ page novel that it's based on, but I did watch the incredibly silly TV mini- series. And while I ultimately came out disappointed, the film wasn't without its high points.The film takes place in the fictional town of Derry (in Maine, of course. Can't be a Stephen King story without a mention of Maine) in the late 80's (as opposed to the 50's, which is when the original book and the mini-series takes place), where a mysterious, evil force simply referred to as ""It"", who takes on the form of a clown named Pennywise, appears every thirty years to feast on the fears of children. A group of misfit kids known as The Losers Club then must band together to take down the evil creature, all the while battling the evil forms the monster assumes.First, the positives: the child actors in this film do a fantastic job. They all have chemistry with one another and deliver their lines convincingly. Some of them may be a little one-dimensional, but they're all still really likable. The final battle with It feels triumphant because we've come to like these kids, which is always something a film should do. The forms It takes are bursting with creativity, even if the scenes they're placed in vary in spookiness. Pennywise himself is also pretty great, with Bill Skarsgård being able to almost match Tim Curry's intimidating (but also silly) performance in the original mini series.That said, this movie also has a lot going against it. This is one of the most tonally inconsistent films I've seen in a while, with scenes shifting from ""80's music montage"" to ""spooky predictable scares"" within a matter of seconds, and it doesn't feel like an artistic choice. It feels like the producers wanted to shove in as many scares as possible, whether they fit in the scene or not, and it ultimately results in none of them standing out too much. As cheesy as the original mini-series was, it knew when and when not to attempt to scare the audience; as opposed to the 2017 movie where it feels like it's throwing something at you every five minutes.The bully characters, like in the original mini-series and a lot of other Stephen King stories, are extremely one-dimensional and unnaturally cruel (except for at least two bullies in the movie who may actually have restraint). The movie tries to give the main bully a little bit of explanation for his behavior, and it makes some of his mannerisms make sense, but in the end he's just another Stephen King bully. There are also points where it's kinda hard to tell if the movie's trying to be intentionally or unintentionally funny. Richie's dialogue, while endearing, I didn't find that funny. Meanwhile, in almost every one of It's encounters with the kids, he does something that may or may not have been intentionally funny. Not to spoil anything, but there's a scene in the climax where he lives up to his ""The Dancing Clown"" subtitle and I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be funny, spooky, or both.In the end: 2017's adaptation of Stephen King's It is a mixed bag. Its scares are predictable, occasionally unintentionally funny, and far too plentiful, but the monster designs are creative. The child actors do an excellent job and their characters are super likable, but the side characters suffer from Stephen King stereotypes. The film's climax is incredibly triumphant, but it doesn't save the film as a whole. However, despite the film's numerous flaws, I didn't regret seeing it. Six blood-filled balloons out of ten.",It

1072,nickykelly-65134,Has both great and poor aspects,7,21 September 2017,"All in all, I enjoyed my time at the cinema watching this film. The excels in characters but unfortunately contains many horror movie tropes.Full disclosure - I haven't read the book, although I will get around to it.The characters, as I said, are handled well, and there are a number of characters. Most films that have these many characters become a complete mess and can often lead to very un-compelling films. The film of course, did have something of a head-start since Stephen King was truly the one that wrote and created these characters, however I have to give it to the film for presenting these characters as well as they did and actually make you care about them.Bill Skarsgard did an incredible job as Pennywise, and was without a doubt my favourite part of the film. However, I think the director should have re watched 'Jaws' before making this film, as Pennywise does get quite a lot of screen time, which can make him less scary at times when the film is trying to be at its most terrifying moments. Despite this, Skarsgard's performance is fantastic.As for the tropes, jumpscares. Lots and lots and lots and lots of jumpscares, in fact I'd say about 90% of the film's scares come from jumpscares alone, and they become quite forgettable. What's funny is that the film's scariest moments are not the jump scares, which shows that the director knows how to frighten the audience, but decided instead to devote many of the scares to a technique that almost literally any common person on the internet can achieve. As well as this, there are a number of times at which these kids suddenly decide to go full idiot and wander off on their own before being predictably attacked by Pennywise. There is also a massively tropey part towards to end of the film, that I won't spoil, but I've seen so, so, so many times before and it made me laugh when it happened. As well as this, this film re-uses the old 'to overcome our fears, we must face it full on' message which although I think is a good message and is absolutely true, has been used in many horror films before.The film's direction is OK at best. I can't say I was impressed by the way the director created scenes, in actuality a lot of the film's scenes follow the same exact structure. The editing was good although the film didn't quite flow seamlessly from scene to scene as it probably should have, it's a lot of a scene ending, skipping time and saying 'oh, and then this is what happened next' which wasn't by any means a big distraction but I think it's worth noting.Overall, I would recommend this film to horror or Stephen King fans, but don't expect 'The Shining', expect something closer to the average modern horror movie.",It
1073,barryhalmore,Unreasonable violence and CGI,7,10 September 2017,"Don't get me wrong, several scenes including the very first one were masterpieces of gory horror but bluntly beating the life out of a terrifying monster pretty much killed the fear factor towards the end. Then again it was refreshing to see a modern adaptation of a classic horror novel with children playing the lead roles. Jaeden Lieberher's performance was above average and not being able to recognize adult actors is a very positive attribute these days. Having double checked my apartment for unnatural creatures last night I'd strongly recommend watching ""It"" in case you're one of us enjoying disturbing horror flicks that spawn butterflies in your stomach.

1078,amullen34,A horror movie that doesn't forget about the story or characters,8,27 March 2020,"There are a lot of problems with modern horror movies today. Unfortunately, this movie does fall into a couple of common tropes with these kinds of movies, but it also does so much more.Unfortunately, like many modern horror movies, this movie does rely on jumpscares for its scary scenes, for the most part. And, like many other movies, those jumpscares frequently are not very frightening. The scares in this movie are pretty predictable, and outside of one scene, I never found myself too scared or tense. But generally, these problems didn't bother me, because this movie is meant to be more than just scary.This is not a movie about some evil monster that kills kids. This is a movie about a group of adolescents who are forced to grow up quickly one summer. The kids make this movie. Every child actor in this movie is phenomenal, with Finn Wolfhard as the standout in my opinion. This movie succeeds because the audience really feels for the kids. No doubt, there is at least one member of the Loser's club that you probably relate to from your own childhood, and that's what makes this movie so enjoyable. So many other horror movies forget to make the characters actually relatable and likeable, but this movie puts the focus on these characters and their own struggles and problems, and how those relate to the overall problem facing their town of Derry. As a result, there are many scenes of this movie that involve no horror whatsoever, and I think that turns some people off who were expecting a non-stop horrifying experience. This movie has scary moments, but I would say this is a coming-of-age story disguised as a horror movie. And I loved it.",It

1087,EJ_The_Reviewer,IT (2017) review,10,26 August 2019,I saw this movie with a good friend of mine not expecting much because of the miniseries that premiered on ABC in 1990 so i went in with low expectations but WOW! this blew me away. i had read the book before seeing this movie and i was suprised how much they were able to put into this movie. and it was awesome to see what they did with such a small budget. all the actors and actresses were FANTASTIC! the losers club and the bowers gang were great. and bill skarsgard was a fantastic Pennywise and loved his preformence and look. But if you are wanting to get into horror movies this is a great movie to watch and try and get into the genre. 10/10 definitly recommend.,It

1089,sirhoraceslughorn,Made me want to shrink myself and hide in my Mother's womb!,3,20 November 2020,"This film terrified me so much that I wished I was never born and was still a baby snug and safe inside my Mother's womb! I used to think I was a manly gent before I watched this film, before this film terrified me so much that I vomited whilst watching it and screamed and cried in terror! The barbaric heartless amount of gore this film had made me puke and for days after watching it I couldn't help but imagine that little boys dismembered arm being on my plate every time I was about to eat dinner or breakfast which caused me to not eat well for days! However this film does have a few redeeming qualities, Pennywise's hair for example reminded me of cheese puffs so I dreamt of casually ripping Pennywise's hair cones out of his head and eating them and the hair tasting just like cheese puffs in my dreams. The film wasn't very complicated so it was simple enough for my doddery old mind to understand and comprehend. The acting was old fashioned in a very positive way and the film sends a good message to the viewer about keeping friendships close and keeping your enemies even closer, especially if your enemies have tasty hair like Pennywise. I urge all people to think long and hard before watching this horror movie, it's definitely not for the faint hearted and I don't think anyone with heart health issues, irritable bowl syndrome or anger management issues should watch this brutal film made for psychopaths who can stomach the blood and guts in this strange film.",It
1090,zakulecedyta,A Really good unfortunatly not scary movie,8,28 March 2020,"This is a great "" Reboot "" To the IT Miniseries, and i really enjoy the movie. The kid cast is great, they all fell like good actors, and the 13 year old kids are relatable to actual Teenagers. Walking into this movie, i was hoping to be scared like everybody else because i love movies, especially when they begin to scare me. Unfortunatly however, this movie was not scary, but that does not make it a bad movie. Here are the best things about the movie.
The kid acting and cast ( Just generally brilliant )A Masterful tone of dread and suspense.Some actual Decent ComedyBill Skarsgård's acting for Pennywise was brilliantAll of these are what boosts the movie to being great, and a lot of fun in both entertainment and a bit of dread and suspense. The movie is a little bit dark, especially as this movie opens with a kid getting his arm bitten of by pennywise. Here are a few flaws to the movie in my opinion.
A Few scenes which are unnecessary, which drags the movie to other 2 hours. In my opinion, this movie should be about 15 or 10 minuites shorter than it really is.The CG Jerk towards the camera used in some of the scenes with pennywise.Overall a great movie which is rewatchable and also just amazing.",It

1094,mkiekenapp,Lacking tension and fear,4,14 May 2018,"Like many who have reviewed this movie, I too have the same complaints. The movies falls extremely short of the book in regards of a suspense or a thriller. One begins to question did anyone from the writers to the director ever read the source material. Hell even watching the original movie might of helped. Bill Skarsgärd was going to have a tough challenge ahead of him to even come close to Tim Curry's performance. Anyone would. He just doesn't project the creepy, scary, edge of your seat performance. The kids in the movie have been written to be more like the kids from Stranger Things then the kids from Derry, ME.",It
1095,Shamoth,Not creepier than the original,6,11 September 2017,"The original cannot be beat, and Tim Curry was, as expected, not beat. The original just has that funny+creepy touch this one can't live up to, and the costume is not satisfying. I tried but was unable to dive into the world itself and become that kid. The original managed to bring me in that way.It was good of course. The actors did well, nice cinematography, Bill did well (and the ending is better than the original), but it just didn't haunt me as the original did. He didn't look and perform as creepy, even though he was creepy. I just got the feeling of a typical modern horror movie, which has its flaws. Definitely worth a cinematic watch. Do not let this horror movie slip through and end up on a small computer screen. One of the better horror movies of the decade.",It
1096,mr_coffee1026,Someone broke their time machine,1,16 September 2018,"The original movie/story was written for the time period when my parents were kids... this particular remake was written for a time period that did not exist... both with references from the original time frame like paper boats made waterproof with ceiling wax and New Kids on the Block which certainly would not have had a fanbase from the outsiders from when I was a kid. Tragic departures from the original story like the bathroom cleaning scene - which only had spooky significance in the book and original film in so much that Beverly had to attempt to clean it several times on her own where the mess would nearly instantly resurface... where as when she got her friends to help the mess did not come back again. The effects are certainly updated but that is the only thing this movie has going for it and wasn't really worth the time.Leaving out the references to things like the mummy and the werewolf didn't do this story any favors. I think if you want to reboot a period piece like this you should really go all out, not attempt to 90s everything and hope it still works, because it really doesn't. character development for the kids was severely truncated so when major scenes came about later it was hard to sympathise with them Seems like there was a whole lot of the story the rewriters didn't think was that important, they weren't right.",It
1097,PhxDwn,"A faithful adaptation to the book, not a remake of the 1990 tv miniseries.",9,21 September 2019,"Here is my lenghy, in-depth review of Stephen King's 'It.' This is mainly for those who have read the book, or those who have seen the film. Or maybe those who are just curious.I'll just start by saying the I absolutely loved I've read the book six or seven times, and I was thoroughly pleased. I'll get into the changes and differences later, but all-in-all, it's a fairly faithful to the source material, captures the heart of the children's friendship, and is absolutely terrifying.My thoughts on the 1990 Made-for-TV version:This blew that version completely away. Many people look at that adaptation with fondness. I'm not sure why, because the TV version is pretty bad. While it is somewhat faithful to the book, it's cheaply made and poorly directed with extremely mediocre cinematography (the lighting and composition is cheap.) Not to the mention the effects are pretty bad, but that is due to the technology available at the time, not due to a lack of skill on the filmmaker's part. And since it was a network television presentation from three decades ago, it just wasn't scary. Which brings us to the most important part: Pennywise the Dancing Clown.Tim Curry vs Bill Skarsgard:Everybody loves Tim Curry, and rightfully so. His performance as Pennywise was what made the TV version. He stole the show, as the saying goes. He played the role with delightful, over-the-top madness. But the thing is, he's not scary. He's funny and entertaining. He's endearing. He serves the correct purpose to the story, but the audience wants to see him when he appears. He's really more of a mascot than a villain.Bill Skarsgard's performance, on the other hand, is the embodiment terror. His other-worldly body language, masterfully timed head movements, bone-chilling facial expressions (behind full clown makeup, I might add), his smile that quickly changes from joy to terror, his eyes, and his voice all sends chills down your spine. Granted, much of this performance was aided by special effects, but it's still Bill at the core driving it.Tim Curry deserves the respect, but Bill Skarsgard is the nightmare that feeds on children's fears. Tim is not.The rest of the cast:The casting is perfect. Everyone from the Losers Club is lifted straight from Stephen King's pages, right down to their physical details. Henry Bowers and his gang are perfectly cast as well. Even minor characters, like the Pharmacist, Eddie's mother, and Beverly's father contain the exact details described in the book.Directing and Cinematography:This film is masterfully directed. Every shot serves a purpose. Every frame is filled with so much detail, some details that the book lovers will pick up on, other details that are there for symbolism purposes. Other details that foreshadow the sequel. There is so much going on in the background of every scene that warrants multiple viewings to consume it all.The cinematography is sheer perfection. There are subtle things happening that show the tremendous skill of the DP (Korean cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung, best known for 'Oldboy.')The lighting when the friends are together compared to when they are apart, for example.Setting the film in the 1980s:There are some people who whine when a film is not exactly like the book. These people are pretentious idiots who think they are displaying superiority with their 'the book is SO much better' attitude that annoy me to no end. Films cannot be exact replicas to the book. They are different mediums. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get on with it (here's where the majority of the spoilers will take place.)The film focuses only on the children, and leaves the adult versions of the characters out entirely (the sequel tells that part of the story.) The biggest change is setting it in the late '80s instead of the late '50s.There are some who say they were just jumping on the success of 'Stranger Things,' but this is not possible, as the film was already written and well into pre-production before 'Stranger Things' was even a thing, and the production of 'It' began immediately after 'Stranger Things' wrapped. That is just coincidence.The time-change setting did not bother me. It was still a time when kids would care-freely play together without helicopter parenting (side note: Eddie Kaspbrak's over-bearing, over-protective mother represents pretty much what all parents have become now.) So much of the sociological elements of the '50s worked just fine in a later time period. If it had taken place today, the kids would be all inside staring at their phones, and there would be no story to tell.The time setting did require some of the horror elements to be changed. In the book, Pennywise tormented the kids by using many of the iconic 1950s movie monsters, such as The Mummy, The Werewolf, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. This does not work in an updated time period, as those monsters were quaint by then, so some changes happened. Bill's haunting by Georgie and Eddie's leper remain, as does Beverly's bathroom scene (one of the most memorable scenes in the film, and even more disgusting than the book described.) Ben's mummy makes a very brief appearance.The disappointing changes for me revolves around Stanley. In the film he is afraid of an odd painting of a woman, and she comes to life to pursue him. In the book, his fear of drowning is much more effective. I so wish I could have seen the scene in the Standpipe where he is chased by the bloated, drowned corpses of children. Why that was changed is a mystery to me, and unnecessary, as the passage described in the book was quite effective. The Standpipe does make an appearance in the film, and as a book fan I appreciated seeing it.With these changes also came changes in the way the Losers Club battled It. Something that was completely lost in the film is how the kids used what they believed could defeat the monster, and it worked because it made them fearless. So the silver slugs they made are gone. Also, in the book Eddie uses his asthma inhaler to repel Pennywise, simply because he believed it would. There is a particular scene where I was anticipating it to happen, as it was the right opportunuty, but it did not.Changes to the characters:The only character changes made were with Mike Hanlon and Ben Hanscom, but they were rather minor. Mike's parents are dead in the film and he is raised by his grandfather, and I'm not sure why (unless I'm remembering the book wrong it's been a good seven or eight years since I last read it.) Also, Mike Hanlon was the town historian, not Ben. He was the one that pieced Derry's history together and figured out the patterns in great detail. In the book, it was the adult Mike who is the conduit of all this information to the reader. In this film, there is no adult Mike, and the viewer still needs the exposition. So this role was given to the child Ben, which does make sense as he spends a great deal of time in the town library. However, Ben's interest in architecture and engineering prowess is missing, which is a character trait that's important to his adult counterpart.Henry Bowers:As for Henry and his gang, they are all portrayed well. With the restraints of a film's run time, a lot about them is lost, which is unfortunate. Henry and his gang are a constant threat to the Losers Club, but in the movie they just show up a few times. An odd change is made that his father is a police officer instead of a farmer. Why the change? It makes no sense, unless it was some leftist 'cops are bullies' message that was being shoe-horned into the film. If so, that is unfortunate. Regardless, it was unnecessary.The rock battle at the Barrens takes place, but the retaliation does not. It is Henry that breaks Eddie's arm in the book, but in the film the break happens when Eddie falls through the floor of 21 Neibolt Street (more on that later.)As for the other members of Henry's gang, the viewer never learns about Patrick Hockstetter's sinister and twisted 'activities,' and he is killed without the viewer ever knowing anything about him. Belch and Vic are there, but disappear from the film with no explanation (a deleted scene does explain this.) In the book, they join Henry's hunt into the sewers after the Losers Club, and Henry witnesses their murder by It, which further drives him mad.In the book, Henry is blamed for the murdered children, and is institutionalized after being declared insane, driven that way by his bully father and Pennywise's manipulation. His insanity is touched on in the film but not adequately developed, and the important plot point that Henry Bowers is convicted for Betty and Patrick's murder is left out entirely.21 Neibolt Street and The Barrens:As for 21 Neibolt Street, the house is portrayed perfectly. A good deal of the film takes place at the house and beneath it. Much of the Barrens is removed, though. The Barrens is an important part of the book, and it should have also been so on the film. The Barrens was where the Losers Club hung out. It was where they bonded, where they escaped into their world of childhood fun and friendship, away from the adults, away from Henry. It was where they felt safe. One of this is retained in the film. The kid's emotional and physical connection to the Barrens is also what made the rock battle such an important triumph for the reader. They claim territory and drive Henry away. In the movie, those emotional stakes just aren't there.The Final Confrontation:There is much that is changed here. Beverly is snatched by Pennywise, and he forces her to stare into the deadlights (a phrase that isn't even mentioned in the film, but is mentioned in the sequel), placing her into a catatonic state. Her friends then have to come rescue her. My first thought is that it turns her into the 'damsel in distress' cliche, which does not make sense, as she is such a strong character, the bravest character i",It

Right from the outset, IT will have you in the edge of your seat with all its suspense and toe-curling scenes. The visual effects are outstanding for a horror film.

The only way you could tell that this movie was ""set"" in the 80's was it being mentioned in a subtitle. The kids all visibly look like they don't belong within the same age category. They made one of the ""greasers"" 6'3"" and he looks like Kylo Ren.The bike and reference to The Lone Ranger makes no sense sine the movie is set in the 80's. No pubescent boy was watching that. It would have made more sense to emulate Eliot's bike from ET or the traditional BMX bike that was highly popularized at the time.The worst part is how flat the made the characters. Richie is always sexualizing everything with his humour. The dialogue is dry and leave no room for character development. It comes off awkward.They missed the mark with the horror aspect. The beauty of the first IT was it's implied horror. It added to the mystery of IT and it really made your imagination run full tilt because you never got to lean enough about Pennywise. This was substituted with subpar CGI and an over explanation of who and what IT is. By effect, killing the mystic allure.Avoid this movie if you don't wish to tarnish what you love about the book and original movie.",It

It is a fine adaptation of the book and captures trauma and fear through visual metaphors. The movie is about coming of age and resolving mental problems as the years keep passing by and finding your true destiny in life. It is a psycho-thriller (so not a horror movie) with visual horror as an implementation of forgotten trauma's. You can spot psychopaths in the movie theater as they are not interested and victims as they laugh, because after all it's not supposed to be funny neither stupid.

Though to be honest, the villain clown could never convince me enough before watching this film and sadly couldn't do it even after watching it. The plot, I felt was pretty much drawn and lost its way here and there. And the fear quotient was also not that much up-to-the mark. So much so, that I dozed off a couple of times in the middle and also found the appearance of the 'ghost clown' funny at times.
To make things worse, some of the characters were not required in the main plot and the characterization was also a bit below par, I felt. Also, the romance between the characters was uncalled for and it only maligned the main plot. Also, this movie has one of the worst endings that I have seen in a horror flick. You end it with a 'totally-not-required' smooch! Oh God! And this movie was supposed to scare the hell out of us!

The original went bam,bam,bam boom and pulled you in. This one stayed way to long on building up drama when the original did it much quicker and got to the point. This also does not stick to the plot of the original and takes liberties in making it something that it is not. I am not disappointed in it because I knew months ago when I seen the (2017) clown that it wasn't going to ""have IT"" so this went along as planned. PLUS this is only part 1 which I did not even know because I always saw IT as one movie even though it was a TV mini-series shown in 2 episodes. The original IT was 3 hours & 12 minutes for both.

Each character in the original had an unusual quality that made them stand out in some way while the kids in this film just kind of blended in with the crowd. The Ritchie Tozier character in the original played by Seth Green was far better and I was a bit let down they took away most of what made him so funny and unique with the gags and jokes and stuff. They also left out Ben's backstory about his father who died in the war and the fact he and his mother were forced to live with relatives.

You must also understand it is a complete deviation from the original 1990 miniseries up to Tim Currys performance as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Bill Skarsgard is no comparison to Currys work yet puts on a mystic and unsettling presence that personifies his role to full nightmare fuel. A particular scene comes to mind when in the Neibolt House Pennywise emerges from the refrigerator in a spectacle of awe and terror. The film itself however is only scary at times but it's not about Pennywise it's about the Losers Club, brilliantly portrayed by Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, among others. What I got from this film was a throwback to classic films such as The Goonies, Stand by Me, and I believe it lives up to those films even. There is never a dull moment among the Losers Gang and Finn Wolfhards character ""Richie"" was a standout player spewing wisecracking remarks even in the face of danger.

This is what happens when the movie is based on amazing source material from the likes of Stephen King who is a prestigious horror author whose written the likes of the Shining, Salems lot, misery and many more. The movie was jumpy and the clown was very sinister/creepy but the movie also had a lot of charm to it catching a late 80s feel to it. THIS IS THE BEST HORROR FILM I've seen in a long time and the let's face the Horror Genre has long been in dire need for a film like this. The characters were on point, you actually cared for most of them. So character development for each character was perfect. There were also plenty of comical elements in the film with also the right amount of shocking scary moments. In all,my suggestion would be to take heed in all the positive reviews and follow suit with going to watch this great compelling tense story in the cinema to get the most from this movie. The clown in my opinion, was probably the 2nd best clown performance after the Joker (Heath Ledger)that I have ever seen, so full credit to the actor who played him. I would not be surprised if he was tipped to play the Joker in future batman films. But yes you will not be disappointed with this movie, it has everything that a 15year old and older would ever want. So Enjoy!!!",It

1121,ericoancea,"Poor horror movie by itself, horrendous as an adaptation",3,14 September 2017,"This is a review made by someone who read the book and I can say that it is a huge disappointment even if, if you've read the book, you know right from the start they couldn't have ever made it to match the book in its entirety.The movie seems to be made by someone who heard the book plot from his friend while binge drinking. The monster behaves by different rules, which make it a lot weaker than it originally was. There is no explanation given to the audience why people were violent and ignorant. The vision-inducing ritual is replaced by research done off-screen. Apart from Georgie (the trigger) and a bully, no other kid is killed on-screen. The Losers' assault on the monster's lair is not fueled by their desire to stop it from feeding again, but by a damsel in distress. To top it all off, the monster's final form is not actually a giant spider, but remains just the clown.Now, onto the movie's issues taken after forgetting there ever was a book. It's a cheap horror, full to the brim with jump scares. The characters all behave stupidly and go wandering all alone in dark sewers away from the group, even though they know they're hunting a child-eating monster. The monster gets way too much screen time and looks goofy, not scary. This is the type of horror that's so bad, its tropes are some of the most parodied.""IT"" is the only movie where I felt the need to just walk out of the theater midway. It's a poor horror and, on top of that, an embarrassing adaptation. Total cash grab piggybacking on the book's fame, do not recommend.",It

In the beginning, the Georgie scene, the 10 yr old ends up crying because she's scared. After that, it was all laughs. Pennywise looked like a teenaged Easter Bunny and kind of sounded like he had something stuck in his throat. I don't understand the following this movie gets at all. It isn't scary and it isn't horror. It's downright, straight up, comedy.",It
1124,stanicnenad,An excellent introduction to the darker second chapter,9,6 January 2018,"I do not understand the criticisms of this film?!
If you liked Stranger Things you will love the first chapter of this story.
The movie is great, acting is also good, the new clown is terrifying.
The old film was very bad and deserved a bad reputation, but this remake is excellent.
It is misinterpreted, this is not a classic horror with a lot of blood and brutal scenes.
The essence is at the psychological moment and internal struggles of the main characters.
Difficulties in growing up, poor family relationships and abuse are some of the problems children are struggling with.
The clown is a metaphor of inner fears, but also a fear of the unknown outside the comfort zone.
If we observe only the monsters, we will see that it is also complex, and in a mysterious way, plays the game with its victims.
Instead of the horror scene, we have awaiting.
Discomfort causes more fear than the expected bloody scene.
Tension and creepy moments are a sign of a good movie.
Fear and nervousness grow in us, and the expectation is greater.
The film is an excellent mix of mystery, horror, tension and humor, because the main characters are children.
I expect the second chapter with adult people to be darker, scary and bloody, similar to the classic horror.
So the first part is an excellent introduction to the second chapter.",It
1125,thedirectorjacob,Pointless changes but an amazing movie.,8,13 April 2021,For this movie the horror is real. Pennywise is as creepy as ever - little too creepy to lear the kids on like in the book - and the actors playing the kids are on point.Only issue for me as an ultimate fan of the book is the pointless changes that tainted the perfection that is Stephen King's IT.Mike is no longer the historian who puts everything together. They took the most important role in the story away from the black kid and made him more so a fan service.In a world where race is everything nowadays it is wild that they would do something like this.Pennywise is played amazingly. The only issue is that he is 100% creepy in every scene. Pennywise is way too creepy to attract children like he does in the book. The original film with Tim Curry had this problem as well only it wasn't as noticeable.I would say in total- watch this film. You'll dig it and find a lot of frights and excitement. The perfect blend of a coming of age horror story.,It
1126,ethannorthup,A modern classic,9,20 September 2019,"Anyone who's a horror fan needs to watch this movie, even if they don't like the book or the original show.This movie cuts out all the filler from the book and made a perfectly concise standalone movie. Making this film only focus on the kids and not flashing forward to the adults was a great decision because it makes the story way more cohesive. The kids are all great and the scenes with them together are very happy and funny, and they serve as a good contrast to the sad and scary scenes.The only flaws I can think of with this movie would be the editing. Whenever there's a scary part they play really loud noises which seem like they're telling the audience ""here's the part where you're supposed to be scared!"". Other times, in some intense parts where pennywise runs towards the screen, the camera gets all shaky and there's a bunch of motion blur around him. Also there's a couple parts where they show pennywise in broad daylight which makes him less scary in my opinion, it takes away from the mystery of the character. But these are just filmmaking nitpicks that don't really affect the story.Even if you don't usually like horror, this is still a must-watch",It

1128,kohle-69615,Disappointed expectations,4,11 October 2017,Movie about the fight of a group of teenagers against a scary killer clown.Because of the big success of the film I visited the theater with high expectations but I was disappointed.Biggest problem are the scenes with the horror clown. They are much too long with many effects and lose so their horror. It's more like an endless ride through a tunnel of horror on a funfair - exhausting but not really scary. In scenes of 'normal' conversation to a child without special effects the acting of the clown is excellent. Here the clown is much more threatening.The acting of the teenagers is mediocrely. It's sometimes overacted and sometimes it seems they are standing around and have forgotten their text.Another issue are the parents of the children. There's a fat mom who wants to be kissed by her son and a disgusting father with filthy mind to his daughter. It's difficult to figure out whether a horror clown is more threatening than these parents.There's also sentimental sob-stuff e.g. when a boy revives the girl by a kiss.The camera work is appealing and the mood of the horror environment is good.The message of the movie is that if losers stick together they can win.I think the movie is about 30 minutes too long.,It
1129,marcusfernandez-28887,IT - Not Your Average Horror Film,8,18 September 2017,"There is certainly no scarcity of Stephen King adaptations in Hollywood, from the gems that were the Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Misery and The Shining, to the wasteland of movies like Cell and Sleep Walkers. These adaptations occupy both extremes of the spectrum. IT is yet another adaptation of perhaps one of the author's more popular novels, the thousand page book was adapted into a mini series in the 90s with a great performance from Tim Curry as the iconic character Pennywise the clown, the series however received mixed reviews yet all the same is considered a beloved by many King fans. Needless to say this latest remake had some high expectations to live up too. After less than a month in cinemas it is safe to say IT has exceeded them.Andy Muschietti has helmed horror before, his 2013 flick Mama although trampled by critics was adored by audiences. Mama did well enough at the box office, earning $146 million, to pique the interests of studios for the IT adaptation which was at that time in a dormant period of production. Finally in the early months of 2016 Muschietti signed on and production hit the fast lane. Almost two years in the making, with little marketing Muschietti has managed to craft a film nothing short of profound.IT is not your average horror film, it's not the run of the mill, cliché overflowing jump scare fest that most modern horror films are, but instead a sophisticated and character driven thrill ride. The film doesn't deliver because of a single aspect , it's not just the scares or just the acting, or just the sets it's every cog turning to work the bigger machine. Perhaps the the most vital component of a horror film is, well the horror and IT doesn't disappoint. The two hour fifteen minute run time is a hundred and thirty five minutes of high quality horror. Are there jump scares? Yes, but not only are they justified but they work. So rest assured, there are no raccoons jumping out of trash cans to give the audience cardiac arrest. Bill Skarsgard's acting as Pennywise is really what fuels the horror in this film, the fact that he looks evil and hides in dark sewers is not what makes his character terrifying. It's the range he shows within this character, at times he really does seem like a great guy to hang out with, that is of course before he dismembers you. The opening scene of this movie really sums up Pennywise, the scene is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie and perhaps one of the greatest scenes of tension and terror in modern horror. Skarsgard effortlessly embodies his character perfectly creating the sadistic, diabolical and twisted Pennywise the clown.Now the scares aside, does IT work as a film? This is often the fear audiences have walking into a horror film, often directors get so caught up in making a genre film they forget to make a good movie. IT has a great antagonist but the audience needs to root for someone, they need the relatable but realistic protagonists that modern horror often overlooks. Our protagonists in IT are the losers club, a band of bullied kids in the town of Derry. They are quickly thrown into the whirlpool of evil and soon become the town's only hope. The cast includes Jaeden Lieberher, Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, Jack Grazer, Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs and Jeremy Taylor. They're all kids yet they play their characters like they've been acting for years. The chemistry between these teens is perfect, their characters well written and varying, however to the extent that you believe they are true friends not paper thin, expendable victims. In fact the acting all around is near perfect, the characters are not exposition machines, the kids act like real kids not mature adults in child bodies, the result is a film with characters you are invested in and characters you care about.Andy Muschietti said it himself in an IMDb review, ""this is not your average horror film"", it really isn't. Muschietti doesn't treat the movie as a pure genre film, he weaves in humour and light hearted moments which do not come off as abrupt or out of place but natural within the setting and among the characters. The film in addition, adds details and hints throughout that may not directly affect the plot but that certainly do contribute a layer of complexity and depth to the outcome. For example the film opens with the haunting and beautifully composed score. As the scene progresses we see the score is not in the background but is being played on a piano by a character. There's a scene in a library, keep your eye on the librarian. It's moments like these that set this film apart from conventional horror. From the horror to the acting the film grasps every opportunity to craft a meaningful horror film. IT will last, it is far from forgettable and deserves repeat viewings not so much to comprehend but to notice the artistry. King fans will be pleased, horror fans will be pleased and all of them will be up at night after this one.",It

1132,lee_impressionist,All shout and no atmosphere,5,21 July 2019,"Sadly, it's fallen into the 'jump scare' category.
""If you're not careful, Pennywise will Chase you to loud music while screaming!""
The most effective scene from this movie was in the library when Ben is looking at the history of Derry and the librarian (Pennywise in disguise) smiles just out of focus behind him. It creates such an uneasy atmosphere and actually makes you nervous for what will happen.
Unfortunately, audiences seem to prefer the sudden very loud music and jump scares which has ensured that no modern 'horror film' is too dissimilar to 'The Nun'; an absolute archetype for the kind of directorial thinking that goes something like 'if we make the audience jump and ply them with unbelievable CGI, that's even better than creating mood or atmosphere!'
A truly good horror movie makes you afraid to turn off the lights, it makes you question what's in the shadows, and this movie just does not achieve that. You know nothing is in the shadows because it would've run out of the shadows screaming at you, ""PLEASE FIND ME SCARY!!!""",It

Those kids and teenagers really show the meaning of true friendship. And the parents were such great examples!I bought my little daughter a red balloon and poster to hang in her room.

1148,XugeParis,Awful,1,20 April 2019,"The overuse of CG ruined any sense of tension or fear and Pennywise's tactics didn't make sense. If he feeds off fear, why reveal himself to each of the kids within a close time period? Why not concentrate on each child individually, causing far more mental torment and making them an easier kill? Pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere at anytime, and disappears randomly. I don't find it scary when the antagonist manifests itself, attacks a character and right before doing damage IT vanishes..The story is a mess and there are far too many characters. I swear the first 40 minutes is the longest montage in film history. A montage of each child's development and exposure to Pennywise. It was predictable and monotonous. As for the story, I don't know what to say, besides there really isn't one. Character motivations are weak, Bill is the only one who makes sense. Where were the parents at? Not a single parent seemed to care about their missing children. The few on screen parents there were, came off as caricatures. And there were a few scenes that felt completely pointless within context of the story. The school bully and his dad, being the oddest.So in closing, IT is an uneven movie or more accurately a collection of scenes that don't flow well in a tangible story. There are some good laughs, and a few entertaining scenes. But all in all it's just an average movie. Which should've been an evident sign, when the original attached director Cary Fukunaga jumped ship.",It

Either Scary or Funny movies can be good and entertaining and putting together both of these movies styles you form IT (2017), even tough it's a good movie and will make you laugh, will make you scared and sometimes discomfortable as I said in the beggining, but believe me, It (2017) is worth watching.",It

I didn't find a single scene or shot the least bit scary. I thought the intro scene was interesting, and I was definitely intrigued by the appearance of Pennywise who had a welcoming creepiness about him... but this was totally lost in all of his subsequent scenes for me. I found most scenes where Pennywise was shaking and screaming to be borderline laughable. Every jump scare was clichéd to the point of predictability (not a single one landed for me), and I never once felt any sense of dread (and sadly, I never got a single spine shiver, which is what I seek when watching a scary movie). Although it featured gore, as a horror/scary movie... it completely failed. (The only scene I found suitably creepy was the old woman out of focus in the background in the library!)But... aside from the horror elements, I actually found the human characters to be quite interesting and very entertaining. I think the boys (and Bev) were perfectly cast, and they were each interesting in their own arcs. The witty banter was immensely entertaining, and felt very natural... this was largely what kept me interested throughout an otherwise dull horror film. I also thought the 80's setting was handled quite well... certainly giving a feel of the era without ramming it down our throats, and the character sensibilities felt true to that period also. So... as a horror film, for me it totally fails... but as an 80's coming-of-age drama, I actually quite enjoyed it!",It

This isn't the typical horror movie with pop ups, which is what I like because it can be redundant. This is a 2 hour film so expect a lot of character buildup and history of Pennywise in the small town of Derry. It compares to other original slasher/killer films because you can feel him, see him, and he can be defeated. It literally feels like an 80s horror flick in modern time, like stranger things. They do show IT plenty of times in the film, always constantly stalking each child with fear, so it never gets boring. Way better than the original there are more scenes that was from the book, like the opening scene, they added more lines to Pennywise and extended that scene.

Go watch it for his presence alone. His acting and make-up got me terrified, during the movie. The effects were cool as well. A very good and scary adaptation of the original film. Yeah, the ending was a bit flat, but don't judge it because of the last 15-20 min. Up until then this movie is a horror gem! 10/10! The thing i didn't expect was, that it actually was a very long movie and every bit of it was scary. That alone contributed to build-up fear into the audience, which i guess was the point. When you have a few chilling or scary moments in a movie, that is cool, but it does not leave a long-lasting impression after you've seen the movie.

1161,jp-450,Extremely Disappointing,2,16 April 2018,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to begin. I wasn't expecting much, but considering I typically respect IMDB ratings, and since this movie has a rating of 7.5, I thought it would be fun to watch on a rainy day. Nope. Let me begin by saying that this is really a teenager themed movie, in other words the maturity of the story is for kids maybe 16 and under. Think ""Stranger Things"" and ""Super 8"" mixed together with a whole bunch of other incongruous ideas, and you have the general story and feeling of this movie. However, the ""F"" word rears it's ugly head every 15 seconds or so, as well as talk about genitalia (both male and female) throughout the film. You actually get tired of how often the F word is uttered, it's annoying. ...especially considering that the story would only appeal to younger teenagers. Then there's the whole idea of the movie; is this really a horror movie?? There wasn't one moment that the film seemed scary, in fact, it was so predictable as to not even make me even slightly flinch, not once. The story line was all over the place, and constantly left you thinking ""what the hell did that have to do with the story?"". The music and mood changes so often, you think something that will make you like this movie will come along, like comedy or a really bizarre twist that ties it all together. Nope, nothing. I would give the overall movie zero stars, but IMDB requires at least one, and I had to give one more for production value since it did evoke a feeling similar to how ""Super 8"" had a unique feeling to it. Otherwise, the disappointment is real, and I can only think that the IMDB rating is driven by paid reviewers, not real people who spent hard earned dollars to watch this. Although I do not think this next sentence is a spoiler, don't read on if you want to be totally surprised. The way the film ends without wrapping up all the open issues and subplots will make you want to point a flamethrower at the screen, and immdeiately log in to IMBD to give your one star review.... the closing shot is a title screen that says ""IT, the first chapter"". Arrrghhh! When that screen appeared, I yelled ""Is that it?!!!"" and everyone laughed because the word IT was on the screen. Afterwards, I was told by co-viewers that my shout out was the only entertaining moment of the film!",It

1165,SilverUsurper,"Interesting visuals, poorly constructed",4,9 September 2017,"The film's a tremendous disappointment--especially given the hype. ""It"" is chaotic and unfocused. Mind you, there are some moments that feature truly spectacular visuals, and the film wants to have heart, but it's never scary and the narrative is--at best --picaresque. What's the mystery of Pennywise? The movie doesn't care. Why is Ben being sought out for special attention by town bully Henry Bowers? Forget about it. As a result, there's no real sense of drama, and some of the adult characters are so terribly stereotypical that any scene with a grown-up in it is difficult to watch. I'm crushed. i really hoped that this film would do for horror what Avengers did for Superheroes. That is, I hoped it would signal the start of something really epic. Instead, it felt like flipping through a bunch of movie channels on Oct 31. Sure, you see some scary images, but you just can't seem to care that much about them.",It

This was a well directed film with lots of great special effects, and it stuck to the story and characterisation pretty closely BUT I found myself getting restless and losing focus. I was not the only one as people seemed to be walking in and out of the cinema all the way through. It certainly didn't hold our attention to the point we were riveted to our seats. I don't know why though. There were moments it felt laughable, and overall it just felt like a kid's movie. It would've been more helpful if I'd realised it was only part 1. I was looking forward to seeing them return as adults in the second part, because that's what brings it all together. For me Stephen King's strength particularly in this book is characterisation. Although this was a horror story, the real focus was the power of friendship and how it triumphs over evil. There was some reference to this in the movie, but the adult part would've really brought that to life. I will see part 2, but I left part 1 feeling disappointed that it felt more like an action film for kids rather than a depiction of the real story beneath the horror and a reminder of the power inherent in that.",It

Younger movie goers will be in awe at the antics of Pennywise and adults will be impressed as well.My suggestion is to head to your local cinema now. The movie might be a bit loud at times (I blame the theater for having the sound up too loud) so I advise against taking toddlers or infants to the show.

1169,bha099,A scary movie that isn't scary.,5,8 September 2017,"The opening scene is good. From there on...not as much.I guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much more than those who are. That being said, I don't think it is possible to make a satisfying adaption of ""It"" without doing it the Game of Thrones way. More time is needed to dwell on each of the novel's parts to create the feel the book gave us. To tell the story as it was told on paper. So I guess I'll forgive the filmmakers for that.The kids are okay. They've managed to portray the losers and the relationship between them decently enough- considering the running time. Again: more time is needed for better development. Much of what actually happened between the kids and It has been cut, but again - running time. They had to.That they've changed the setting from the 1958 to the 80s was a bad choice, and so are the other changes. They're creating scenes that aren't in the book. They're changing things that are there. The biggest problem I have with the film is the execution of the horror. Constant jump scares, way too much CGI, and a complete lack of understanding of the fact that less is more. Waiting for a scare is the scary part of horror, and this movie just throws everything at you constantly. It just isn't terrifying. At all.I didn't find myself bored, though. Besides the poor performance when it came to being scary, it is an okay movie. It just isn't a good adaptation.",It

The script has all of these special moments. Then they are destroyed by the presentation.I'm not saying that the script is flawless. It has a lot of flaws, most of them are in the third act (i'm not a big fan of the ending).Bill is doing his best, but he's not allowed to be creepy, because jumpscares and CGI is surrounding him.It feels like the movie, has low self esteem.

Furthermore, there's no mystery or anxiety regarding the exposure of the villain; he's hopping around, yodeling like an ostrich from the beginning.

1172,gavondo,It (2017) in one word: Unrelenting,9,24 October 2017,"There were some horror movies from my childhood that stuck with me for many years. One Halloween, after returning home from trick-or- treating, my dad was watching Sleepwalkers (1992), also adapted from a Stephen King novel. Images from that movie haunted me for at least the following decade. I've never seen that movie since, but I saw the cat-man character in my closet countless times as I tried to fall asleep. I imagine that some of the images from It will be with me for some time as well. Skarsgard, as Pennywise, is excellent, but perhaps not as excellent as the effects for his character, which are masterfully chilling. Each time a demented creature transforms into Pennywise, or as he contorts his body and moves so unnaturally, I couldn't look away even though I wanted to. It's marvelous. On many occasions, one of the kids sees a monster in broad daylight. They are outside, it's sunny, but the monsters are still completely terrifying, the kids' fear palpable. Outdoors, with the sun shining, isn't that supposed to be the sanctuary? That's supposed to be the place you go to escape fears, to feel safe, because nothing can lurk in the darkness when there is no darkness. But, there are no safe places in the town of Derry. Pennywise is the villain yes, but not the only villain, and perhaps not the most evil. The villains of bullying and abuse fill the spaces between Pennywise's jarring, jittery appearances. They fill those spaces so completely, and fill the film with such constant dread, that each appearance of the clown almost feels commonplace. Pennywise manifests a child's worst fears, and those fears don't rest. Those fears are commonplace. But there is hope in teamwork and friendship. In It, this, not sunshine, is the refuge. And the chemistry between the kids is another way the film excels. The young actors have any easy nature about them, excluding Finn Wolfhard, of Stranger Things fame. It feels as if the writers tried a bit too hard to make Wolfhard's character, Richie, seem cool, relying heavily on crude remarks that feel forced. It's distracting, but as a whole, the gang shines, particularly the performances of Jack Grazer (Eddie) and Sophia Lillis (Beverly). Time will tell if the cast of characters 40-years senior will be of comparable quality in Part II.More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo",It

1176,samturver1200,It (2017)- The goonies meets nightmare on elm street,9,12 September 2017,"When ""IT"" was announced early this year, i was sceptical. Mostly because of the look of pennywise, it looked a bit too off. Even though Tim Curry's outfit was a bit goofy, the performance of Curry helped the goofy outfit become creepy. 2017s Pennywise looked like something edgy prick would make on tumblr. Even when stephen king commented on the movie saying ""people have nothing to be afraid of"" (meaning the movie isn't bad) it made me nervous because the man has praised such films as death race 2000 and 2012. However, after watching the film today, i was rather impressed. Plot- In the small town of Derry, Maine, children go messing 6 times the normal average, mainly because of a killer clown called pennywise that goes around kidnapping children and eating them. So in the summer of 1989, 7 kids face their fears and try to stop the clown before any more kids get taken. What i liked For one thing, this is an incredibly tense, creepy and downright disturbing film. The film is clear from the intro that is means business. For example, in the 1990s mini series, when georgie is killed, it simply fades to a funeral scene, however in the 2017 version, poor georgies arm gets eaten off by pennywise, he then riggles around in pain before being dragged into the sewer to be eaten. Did i mention that this kid is only 7. After that scene, i knew this was gonna be a really good horror movie. I also love the way in which the characters emotions help develop their personalities. For example, Billie, who was the older brother of georgie, is, throughout the film, constantly under the belief his brother isn't dead. The way the character is holding on to a small sliver of hope that he is still alive really makes you empathise with the character. There is one scene near the end which almost had me in tears because of how touching it was. I also loved the chemistry between the losers club. Usually when a group of kids are the main protagonists in horror movies or even movies in general, they are usually written by a group of 50 year olds who guess what kids talk and acted like. However, this movie nails what kids that age talk about. From mum jokes to swearing to childish banter to the ways in which they spend their free time, it does not feel forced. The dialogue didn't seem out of place. Another aspect i liked were the child actors. Usually child actors are garbage but i really liked the child actors. The last thing i have to talk about is Pennywise. Good god what an amazing performance. Pennywise is played by Swedish actor Bill skarsgård, and boy does he knock it out of the ball park. When the previous character of pennywise was played so perfectly by Tim Curry you have some serious shoes to fill . But Skarsgård nails this role. I haven't seen such an unsettling, eerie, creepy and downright scary villain in a movie since Heath ledger did the Joker in the Dark knight. Every time pennywise is on screen you just want him to go away because of how scary he is. Things i don't like. However, the film isn't perfect. For example, even though i loved the child actors, one of the child actors felt a bit bland and not interesting. I kind of got annoyed by the character, all he ever did (at least to my experience) was stand around, cry or moan. Another thing i didn't like, and this stems back to the original book ,is the decision georgie makes when he reaches down the sewer to get the paper boat back. Picture this, if you were a 7 year old and all of a sudden a clown appeared in the sewer right in front of you, my guess is you wouldn't want to spend much time with him. So i don't understand why georgie went to get the paper boat off of him. My final criticism is that there is a weird thing between the chubby kid and the girl. Throughout the movie, the chubby kid has a crush on this girl, but she ends up kissing Billie instead, even when the chubby kid saves the girl from being paralyzed, they just re enact a poem the both like. I thought this relationship was a bit unnecessary. Overall if you want a genuinely scary, genuinely unnerving film that will make you scared of clowns IT is the film for you",It

With that said, this overlong piece of crap (what's with all the films now being over two hours long, anyway?) employs every horror cliché present since the beginning of cinematography. Boring, predictable, unoriginal, even pathetic when attempting to be humorous, with the cast consisted of politically correct crew, this latest cash-grabbing snore-fest from dried-out Stephen King solely consists of nostalgia that's supposed to bring back old fans while, at the same time, introduces itself to the new blood (as it is always the purpose and the pattern when it comes to remakes). Don't let them bait you. Let's have Hollywood work for their money for a change.",It
1179,storm-of-bt,A spectacular adaptation,9,5 May 2018,"Stephen King doesn't really translate well to the big screen. Too much surrealism, too much locked into the head of characters (including important plot points). To sum it up, too much creativity required to adapt his writing to film. This movie has all the creativity, and it's a true delight.The best novel adaptations can keep the merits of their source material, yet surprise even those who read the original novel. I have read It at least five times, but this movie was able to surprise even me with some really clever choices.
Rewritten character backgrounds (Henry Bowers, Beverly Marsh and Mike Hanlon)The main characters search for the missing kids instead of playing randomly around the townMain plot points changed, sometimes completely (the death of Patrick Hockstetter, the addition of the extra scary projector scene)Skip of the silver bullet. Thank you. It may have worked in 1986, but in 2017, after Underworld and Ginger Snaps, it would have ruined the entire movie.Although the adaptation process, I have to admit it, did damage the overall story a bit. The change of focus on the main characters resulted in Mike and Stan ending up completely forgettable characters. Ben being a really smart kid also got skipped with the omission of the dam building scene from the book, where he shined his talent of mechanics and architecture (also with leaving the silver bullet stuff out completely). Beverly and Eddie profit the most from the changes (especially Beverly, with the greatly increased tragedy factor in her backstory). The most damage comes to Richie. This Richie Tozier feels really out of place, like edited in from a separate movie. No matter how good chemistry he has with the rest of the Losers, especially with Eddie, not even this can save the likeability he had in the novel (and in the previous film). Writing him as such a coward doesn't help either, especially with a hypochondriac kid standing next to him.Some changes in the plot also backfire near the end. Most changes work (like skipping the Ritual of Chud, which is impossible to visualize in a way it makes any sense), but the kidnap of Bev feels cheap and illogical from the part of Pennywise. The wake-up kiss and the cliche 'let's argue and split up before reuniting with the climax' scene are also like from a much worse flick. I'm also curious about the thoughts behind the famous Pennywise dance.What works in this movie, however, works perfectly. The writing is supported by excellent acting from everyone (especially Bill Skarsgard, but all the kids are also doing really professional jobs, with Sophia Lillis and Nicholas Hamilton as my number one favorites). The only issue is with the music, which is too loud for the scary scenes, and other times doesn't really fit the events we see ('80s cheery song when cleaning a bathroom totally painted with blood? Really?). The visuals are, however, top notch material, the movie is a treasure to see, except for some short moments of lesser quality CGI in the climax. Pennywise has a perfect design, and the scares are visually very creative, especially the painted woman and the transformations of It in the final fight. The use of the balloons as tools of revealing something really messed up is also a really smart idea.I'm curious about Chapter 2, as it will need some huge changes as well (with the death of Henry Bowers, although he felt quite forced in the original, and Mike, who will be prominent, being so forgettable). As the 'Adults' storyline is also weaker in the book, it will be a much greater challenge, the Stand By Me recipe won't work for that one. This, however, is a crew I feel I can trust after this movie, so I'm positive to the end about the sequel.Overall, it's a top quality flick, giving back some much needed dignity to King adaptations which they mostly lost after The Shining. It omits some key elements (like the power of a child's imagination used as a weapon), but adds a much needed boost to both King films and the horror genre in general, by perfectly grasping the truly fearsome aspects behind the concept of It.If you like horror movies, you should watch it.

1183,ixel_the_ix,What the Heck is with these Reviews?,7,6 November 2020,"TL;DR
Most of the low reviews didn't read the book, had unrealistic expectations, didn't pay attention to the movie, and in general were unnecessarily harsh on the movie.So I'm that person. I read, a lot. Stephen King is, as most of us know, an amazing writer who has this innate ability to take you back to childhood and recall all of the good (and bad) things about childhood, for both genders. I am also that person that expects the movie/tv show to be on point (within reason) compared to the book. I walked out of Harry Potter because the movies were so absolutely horrific in their adaptation.Now, half of these reviews seem to not have read the book or know anything about the book or previous film adaptation and based on what I can tell, they just decided that they weren't going to pay attention to the movie and then write a review. The other half appear to be hardcore fans who don't understand the limitations of feature length films (come on folks, did you really think they were going to put every word of an over 1,000 page book in the movie?) and ALSO DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE MOVIE.It took me exactly one watch of the trailer to understand that they were breaking the book into two distinct parts: the kids and the adults. The book does much the same, it bounces back and forth between the town as the characters experienced it in their childhood and how the Losers are now dealing with having to come back and finish IT off. Still, people are on here complaining that ""none of the main kids died"" and ""Mike Hanlon basically isn't in the film"" and ""There were NO Deadlights"". Yes they do, yes he is, and yes their are (I have NO IDEA how people actually MISSED the Deadlights.) Mike's main part of the book comes when they are all adults, up to that point he literally has exactly as much page time as each of the other kids aside from Bill. NONE OF THE LOSERS CLUB DIED WHEN THEY WERE KIDS IN THE BOOK EITHER.Yes, they changed things. I wasn't wild about the 1980s set up, but if I'm being honest, I can't say that I think as many people would have related to the kids in the movie if they had maintained the 1950s setting. That's just realistic. I was a little upset about the IT encounter changes they made, but they kept others to help balance it. The moving pictures were a large sub-point in the book and I understand why they removed it, that would have been at least half of the movie right there. The people complaining about how IT taunts the kids, but doesn't do anything and the ones saying that it's ridiculous that IT seems to be everywhere at once clearly have no idea what IT is actually about. IT survives solely on fear and particularly prefers children because our fears when we're young are plain and easy to duplicate in physical form. Adult fears tend to be more complex and less physical in nature (medical bills, anxiety, relationships, etc.). Some kids scare easier than others, those kids die immediately. The Losers were each special in their own way, they were meant to defeat IT, so obviously they aren't going to be as susceptible to IT's tactics. They aren't scared >they don't exude fear>IT is forced to look for other sources. It isn't complicated and it's mentioned in both the book and the movie several times.This adaptation isn't perfect, they never are, but it does hit all the right points. IT isn't just about the horrors of a small town in a small state. IT is about the experiences and bonds we develop as kids. And those bonds, because of the nature of children, don't take years and years to form and grow. When you're a kid and you find another kid that you like, that's it. You're friends. Fin. The conversations the Losers have in the movie are very close and occasionally word-for-word what is in the book. They're 11 year old boys. I was an 11 year old girl, but all the boys I knew at that age talked exactly like that. My step-son talked exactly like that when he was 11. (To the person who said that this movie was trying to appeal to 12 year olds with ""horror for kids"": don't be thick. It was specifically intended to remind you of your childhood. If you missed that, that's on you). Bottom line, this wasn't the worst adaptation of a book and I was pleasantly surprised having had very low expectations going in.*Spoiler Alert*I had equally low expectations for the 2nd part and those were sadly right on point. 2nd movie is not a great adaptation of the book.",It
1184,Stoker48,Why hate this movie? I loved it!,9,22 December 2017,"In short:
Was it a good movie?
Yes, yes it was. (I personally loved it)Was it scary?
No, not really. But I knew what to expect and it delivered it, so I had no problem of not jumping out of my seat every 2 minutes but wahtching a bunch of kids battle a clown-monster-thing while facing their own fears...
Any problems with it?
Well, the CGI looked like CGI a lot (in fact most) of the times. But thankfully it wasn't just CGI, so I can let that one slip. That is why this movie is no a perfect 10 in my book, but just a solid 9.
Anything outstanding?
Oh my yes. The acting. These kids were so great I was amazed. And I really have to point out that Sophia Lillis was just so great in the non-scary scenarios. I'm really looking forward seeing her in other films. Anyways back to the movie and why others migh not like it as much as I did...((Now comes the part with the spoilers))
Was it supposed to be the the book on the big screen?
To answer this I have to say, that I've seen the miniseries as a child (probably the reason why I never really like clowns). But only read the book a few years ago as an adult. And when I heard a new IT movie is in the making I watched the old one again.
Now the miniseries was supposed to be the book on the big screen. And it mostly was. And that is why I didn't like that one... It was a really good adaptation of a good book that I hated the ending of. Seriously.. a giant siperlike thing? In the sequence with the kids there were no spider-monster... and when you are an adult.. you have to face a huge ass spider? why not the same old clown with like a chainsaw or I dunno... anything else..
anyways the 2017 IT movie got it right. It took the STRONG part of the story and made it a stand-alone version of it. AND IT WORKS! Now it has an AWESOME ENDING!! This is not the book on the big screen. BUT IT NEVER WAS SUPPOSED TO! The moive is BASED ON THE NOVEL. (that is what's written at the lower left corner of the screen at 5:16) You all know what ""based on"" means right? It means it's not the novel! If you want that, you go ahead and read it. It is a great reading (up until the end, but that's my opinion only).
((End of spoilers))Was it a good idea the change the setting so much?
It's 2017. Back in the late 80s when the book came out (or in 90 when the miniseries did) it was supposed to be set in the 50s and in the ""present time"". Now it's a good thing that the ""kids sequence"" is set in the late 80s when we were kids (well I was born in the late 80s, but still. The whole setting just felt a lot like my childhood). So to answer my question. Yes, it was a good idea, that the setting was changed (so much).Well I could probably go on for hours, but I won't. What I will say is:
Watch it with an open mind and think of all the things you were so afraid of back when you were a kid. I know I did. And I enjoyed (almost) every minute of this movie. (And thank you for reading my review.)
And one last thing: did I mention how good Sophia Lillis is?",It

Here the comedy is too juvenile for adults and the horror too much for children. So who is this movie for? Pretentious hipsters...I mean film critics. Don't get me wrong I love the 80s and don't mind homages but when every film starts doing it, eats up so much run time, and lacks any subtlety it's a marketing formula not an homage.",It
1187,firefox-45945,Amazing adaptation that had me jumping in my seat!,10,11 September 2017,"I have been awaiting the premier of IT not so patiently ever since I saw they were remaking my favorite Stephen King book and movie. Before I saw this adaptation, I read the reviews from it's opening night. I was surprised at the many 1 reviews I saw. It was as though people absolutely loved it or absolutely hated it. Many said it was essentially a comedy, not a horror movie. I love horror movies and was eagerly awaiting IT, hoping to finally find the movie that could not only startle me with jump scares, but actually scare me. After reading so many negative reviews I was skeptical. So after seeing IT on the Grand Screen at my local theater, I am extremely pleased ( and rather ashamed) to report that IT made me, for the first time in my life, actually yell out in fear! I actually girl screamed (not actually a scream, but close enough) for the first time ever at a horror movie! The humor that was spoken of in reviews I felt was actually appropriate humor for the age of the kids and what they were dealing with. It felt authentic to how kids would talk to each other. There were many jump scares, including the big one that made me shamefully yell, lol. Bill Skarsgard did an amazing job as Pennywise. I was originally disappointed when Will Poulter was unable to continue in the role, and was uncertain of Skarsgard, but man, he blew me away. He is utterly creepy, and you can see how he can lure kids (when he first talks to Georgie), while at the same time he exudes a confident, almost lazy evil its so natural, that appears to be unstoppable. The casting of the kids was well done. And unlike the TV version, they try to use an actual weapon, instead of two earrings and a slingshot, which always seemed completely far-fetched and a total underestimation of Pennywise. Finn Wolfhard is great as Richie, I loved Jack Dylan's take on Eddie, making him a little more brave and witty. Nicholas Hamilton is a great Henry, making you hate him, then make you understand where all his rage comes from.I do wish they had included the werewolf and mummy scenes from the original, but understand it was cut by the studio for budgetary reasons. ?? And we didn't get much of a backstory for Ben Hanscomb. All in all though, I was thrilled with this installment and cannot wait for Chapter Two! Amazing job!",It

The performances of all the kid actors were supreme. This adaption certainly outruns the original 1990 mini-series just through the inclusion of the historical context of the Derry threat,Pennywise the clown.

Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry, and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favorite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it was a great film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances",It

They feed to much information to the audience while the child actor and actress in this movie, in my opinion, cannot bring any suspense to me (well, except for the sewer scene).

The movie is not bad, however, it lacks the spirit. May god have mercy on the soul of the Special FX team, as it certainly looks cartoonish most of the time. At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Goosebumps on 90's Nickelodeon. The acting and re-encarnation of the book's characters is ON POINT.

I feel like the plot moved along at a nice pace and kept you wondering what would happen next although most of us viewers have seen the original and read the book. 
My main problem was with the dancing clown scene, it was SO dumb. It ruined the fear that the rest of the movie had built up to that point, made me start laughing and I unfortunately abandoned all interest after that. They should have left more to the imagination, drawn that out longer, then showed more of the clown. ""It"" became silly.",It

The movie is not scary unless you are not used to watch horror movies or you are younger than 15 years old . Anyway , most of the jumpscares were shown in the trailer of the movie so it's not much of a surprise in the movie . They didn't add a lot of parts from the book into the movie and i didn't really liked that either . 
Now , the acting of the kids is good , but i really liked Bill's acting . He was giving a more creepy vibe to pennywise than Tim did . Actually , he was giving another vibe to the clown , more exactly . 
I would rather recommend the original movie to someone than this one . This one is not as good as people hoped it would be . And again , that abuse of CG is scratching my Brain",It

The kids are all very likable and the best parts of the movie are the bonding scenes between them. The whole evil clown part, which is kind of the point of the film, is a step down. The first scene with Pennywise is pretty creepy, but Bill Skarsgård's performance (which is excellent in that scene) is wasted for the rest of the film. Nothing else that Pennywise does is scary. It's all jump scares and random other monsters that aren't nearly as scary as Pennywise.

1214,pecinqa,"""It"" shows flare, but needs to have more confidence in it's ability to scare.",6,11 September 2017,"""It"" is a mostly successful horror film that, unlike it's peers, manages to easily surpass the quality of it's predecessor (although it did have a slight luxury in being a remake of a TV film). Surprisingly enough, the film's biggest issue arises in the confidence of the film to allow itself to scare the audience.Fortunately the film manages to stay standing in spite of itself. A large part of this is due to the casting of the child actors and the antagonist, Pennywise. For the most part these kids are believable in their roles even when they have to read through some clunky King dialogue. Only a few times do their performances feel hammy, the most notable being a painful but short exchange between Ben and Bev during the third act. The kids also play the comic relief of the film well in their dialogue. Although the film does push the comedic limit sometimes, especially a bit that referenced 'New Kids on the Block' that felt like it belonged in a tripe PG-13 comedy. Otherwise the only other shortcoming in the characters is the criminally underwritten role of Mike. I feel for Chosen Jacobs who did really well with what sparse material they gave that character.I can't really add anything about Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, it's everything that it's been built up to be. I also appreciated that the film had some cinematic shots as well. Too often directors in horror forget how crucial framing a shot can be. Fortunately ""It"" does not forget this and I actually remembered a few specific shots the day after watching the film. One particular shot I enjoyed was a dutch angle shot from the perspective of a painting, the character in the frame straightens the literal frame and by extension the actual shot as well.While I praise the film for those shots, I have to acknowledge the gigantic pitfall of the film.Obnoxiously loud stings during every single scare.""It"" is filled with many disturbing and scary visuals. However, the film insults your intelligence by fishing for a jump scares with abhorrent sound cues. So much more could've been accomplished with appropriate ambient music, or sounds to really let the fear and unease creep into the audience instead of essentially yelling ""Boo!"". This was very unfortunate as even in a theatre with a full audience, only once did a single person scream during the entire film.Jump scares aren't uncommon in horror, but this film was strong enough to stand on it's own without resorting to such trite measures.As a result the film finds itself being just good, instead of great.",It

Seconds of all the movie it quite scary but it's mainly a Sci-fi horror because it's of a clown.I think this movie is the right age rating 15 but there are a few scenes that are very violent there's a scene where Georgie's arm gets bit of by the clown penny wise and another's scene where the bully Henry bowers kills his father and lots of blood was spitting out.The ending is a bit confusing and scary because the losers club fight penny wise and don't know if they kill him.What recently came out was IT CHAPTER 2 where some people on IGN have said is scarier and that had jumped them quite a few timesHope you liked my review and tell everyone you know about this review,It

People expect it to be over-the-top scary, but if you've read the book, you can relate to the 'lack of horror'. I think it's more about children's fantasy, their deep-rooted fears (I mean, as a kid you're basically afraid of everything), the struggle as an outsider, Derry's background and the craziness of it's people.
Always admired Stephen King's style in developing his characters. The plot doesn't evolve because of scary clowns and faces, its just like an extra topping to portray a disturbed and cruel nd exaggerated reality.So whenever it's an adaption, I don't try to compare it to the first ('original') version, neither to the book, except it's from the same author/director. It's impossible to put thousand of pages into a two-hours movie. It's the default that ruins every movie. See it as an own/individual piece.To sum it up: i fell in love with Bill's love for his little brother, as much as for Pennywise. Great acting, great visuals.

Tim Curry does a far better job as Pennywise too... like there's any other thing that needs to matter in the movie.The acting is fine, but the direction and everything else is pointless; just like this remake.

I enjoyed each frame of the movie, particularly it's cast, their act and the loser club's sense of humour. When it comes to the horror scenes and Bill's acting as Pennywise, he nailed the character with ease. Overall, the perfect horror film in 2017.",It

Scary, it is not. I've seen more horror at at child's party. The tea-cup ride at your local fair ground will give you more of a thrill.Talk about the cliché central. A slow, plot holed, far fetched, continuity riddled farce. CGI was cheap and out of place. This is NOT a horror, or even a b-movie horror. This is more akin to a comedy at best. Of course you'll get the odd 'jump factor' thrown in for good measure - even these are predictable and poorly scripted. Sad to say, Scary Movie would deserve an Oscar pitted against this mess.The only saving grace was the make-up department did a great job and the acting wasn't completely off.The hype surrounding this film was very well done - I congratulate the marketing and PR companies spin for a complete piece of trash. Please, please please - do not franchise this. No more!It's not worthy of the big screen cinema. Save your money, wait for the DVD/Bluray release to turn up in your local penny shop.",It
1244,soldier-of-arendelle,Surprisingly Bad,4,22 September 2017,"I love classic Stephen King and ""It"" is one of my all time favorites. I just rewatched the old TV mini-series and found it holds up very well after all these years. So, imagine my surprise when I discovered a 27 year old t.v. movie did ""It"" better than a 2017 big budget film.I had so many issues with ""It"". First off, the pacing was terrible. A horror movie should build up to its intense scenes, but these scenes were popping up left and right without any setup. The story is rushed and seems like a half-hearted attempt at a plot to justify the horror scenes. The characters are underdeveloped and many of the scenes and dialogue are cringe-worthy. The casting of Pennywise was a big disappointment and I didn't like the actor's performance at all. The CGI scenes of Pennywise were much better.""It"" was such a big disappointment for me, I'm sorry to say.",It
1245,gabiirrs,"We all float down here. Yes, we do!",10,14 September 2017,"I enjoyed every bit of this movie. Although I haven't read the book I think the movie explores a different angle that the one we saw in the miniseries released in the 90's. It renovates the story by exploiting the fears that each kid has, giving a little more strength to their characters individually. The CGI at some point might seem like a little too much but it helps to create the ambiance and drives the story right where it needs to go.The best part of this movie, by far, is the performance of everyone involved. The kids play their part beautifully, but Bill Skarsgård is the crème de la crème; he reinvents Pennywise in a very darker and violent way. Skarsgård does not try to fill Tim Curry's shoes, cause that'd be practically impossible, he goes in a different direction creating something new, assuming the role of Pennywise as his own and not some role he has to surpass, which he achieves amazingly.It's not the typical horror movie and this exact reason is why, at least in my opinion, it's refreshing and scary in a unique way. Hands down one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years.They intended to make something different, a movie that had its own essence and not just a plain imitation, and they succeeded wonderfully.",It
1246,smmrshaon,"An adventure, not just a horror movie!",9,23 September 2017,I love the 80's setting of Stephen King. This movie reminds me of Stranger Things. I am not a big horror movie fan but this one is actually one of the top movies of my 2017 list.

1248,mccavaco,I have seen better...,6,6 November 2017,"We always need to be careful before seeing a movie because of the publicity created around it. In this particular case, I think that all the hype creates high expectations in the audience and sometimes that could ruin a possibly good movie. It was the horror movie most watched in several countries, and even dubbed ""one of the best horror movies ever"". The reviews were almost all nice and the public extremely soft and good when criticizing it. But come on! I have seen better. For me, all the expectations created ruined my opinion of it. The story is not that original and exciting. I think that it is predictable, not well explained, and fragmented. The clown, which is the main star of the movie, does not appear that much and all the good scenes can be watched in the trailers. I can even say that the best scene of the entire movie took part at the beginning of the movie. It was intense and enlightening. From that, disappointment Horror scenes were meager and not even enough scary jumps were included. One of the good things is the messages behind the movie. I believe that they were one of the best parts. For me, they are two. 1. Do not let your fears rule your life! Face them, or they will kill you and eat you. 2. One person alone does not seem much, but a group of people can do almost everything. Overall, it is an OK movie, but not the best horror movie ever. Not even close! Perhaps the hype around It killed the movie for me, but I think that it lacks some good stuff.",It
1249,Envasahans,"Highly anticipated, deeply disappointed",4,19 September 2017,"IT is one of the few movies I actually looked forward to. The trailers looked great and the first reviews were very good. Nothing could go wrong, right? Uhm... no not exactly.The first 10 minutes of the movie (the Georgie meets IT part) were utterly brilliant and caused the first WTF moment. Things were looking good for IT.But it would be my last WTF moment because after that scene everything falls apart in IT.PROBLEM 1 the storytelling If you read the book or/and saw the miniseries you'll know that the story switches between past and present day. In the new IT you'll only get the past (guessing that the present day wil be in the sequel). This pretty much destroys the buildup and intensity of the story.PROBLEM 2 Pennywise Don get me wrong: Bill Skarsgard does an excellent job of portraying a terrifying clown but that's the problem right there. Pennywise in the new IT is only terrifying while the book describes Pennywise as a clown who appeals to children in a pleasant way and becomes terrifying when the victim is in grasp. It's the contrast between funny clown and horrific monster that makes the original Pennywise (book and miniserie) really terrifying.PROBLEM 3 CGI Never thought I would actually complain about CGI in a movie because I usually complain about the people complaining about CGI. But in IT the CGI really got on my nerves. Somehow it completely kills the eighties vibe. PROBLEM 4 Young Richie Toszier I like the dude in Stranger Things but in IT I had an instant disliking to his version of Richie Toszier. I don't know why but it just didn't feel like Richie....Maybe it's the fact that I grew up with the miniseries that I don't dig this version of IT but I tried. I really did and I really wanted to like it but I simply can't. I didn't feel it, I didn't feel the tensity of the book, I didn't feel the dark hidden secret of Derry...

1255,folon2008-100-319305,What a let down!,2,2 January 2018,"First of all, a piece of advice to people having watched all serious horror films starting from the beginning of seventies, onward. Don't waste two hours of your remaining precious time. It's graphic. It's like a museum of horror film cliches boosted to achieve maximum reflexive reactions, leaving you with nothing at the end, apart from the marketing message that sequels will follow. Worse, not only does it have, practically, no serious plot, being a shuffle of typical scenario patterns of teenage-targeting movies but also becomes pathetically naive and schematic when attempting to attach a symbolic meaning in the representation and endurance of evil. I expect from a good horror film to lead my mind into unexplored trails of the psyche searching for and revealing the age-old animal that is always on alert due to its survival instinct and thus phobic of and proportionally reactive to any situation diverting from the normal. I expect from a good horror film to keep the feeling of my encounter with this animal imprinted in my senses long after the lights of the theater go out. In that sense, this film is a poor to completely naked production, possibly unfair to the original Steven King's underlying work, though I am not aware of it (but of others, I am and admire).It is clear to me that the film is targeting the teenager spectators and for this reason it is really very sad to realize how low the standard has been set for advertising it as big time, especially when I inevitably have to compare it with counterparts I have watched during my teens such as The Thing, Carrie, Poltergeist, the Exorcist and so on, movies that live in ones mind for decades after exiting the theater.",It

All we have here is a CGI clown terrorising some kids. There is no depth to the story of his origins.

From the first trailer, I was hooked. It is the CLASSIC horror flick revamped beautifully by Andrés Muschietti! I know and love the story of Pennywise and think the film covered his haunting backstory well. The young teen team up was hilarious to watch interact and conquer. That is where the HEART came in. I thought the movie was structured more like a coming of age film. I actually enjoyed the real-life terror of the town's seduction to Pennywise more than the audio queued jump scares. The C or D story about how the adults of the town live in a fog due to Pennywise's historic rule was my favorite aspect of the film. Still thinking that over. From one ""scaredy-cat"" to the next -- if you can handle the first crazy horror moment you are golden. Great theater movie. Enjoy!",It

The direction was also top notch. However, the kids in this movies are just awesome and I mean it in the old fashion. You cannot feel yourself in awe how they nailed every joke, every speech (Bill's are the best, given he has this stuttering). Looking forward to seeing each one's next project.

1262,scorpiotd,"Very Memorable Film. ""You'll float, too.""",8,25 September 2017,"I was actually expecting this movie to be bad, but it exceeded my expectations and gave us a very terrifying story of a creature that appears every 27 years in the form of a clown to feed off the fears of children. It was well done, and Alexander Skarsgard gave an amazing performance as Pennywise, and in my opinion, he was better than Tim Curry. In the original miniseries, during Georgie's death scene, it is only implied that Pennywise ate him but showing a still frame of Tom Curry revealing his sharp teeth, but in this version, we're given a much more dark approach as Pennywise is shown biting off Georgie's arm, who then crawls out into the street, crying out to his brother, before being dragged into the sewer. Chilling. The film had its suspenseful moments, like when one of the bullies wanders into a cave with a blowtorch and is chased by zombies. Another moment comes up where a Losers Club member is locked in a room with a bunch of clowns. Which would could be Pennywise??? was the thought that ran through everyone's head in the theater. Even though moments like these existed, the film relied on mostly jump scares which isn't really true terror.Other than that, I thought 'It' had great acting and great Cinematography/camera movements. The story was enjoyable and definitely an improvement on the original, but the romance felt off. Billy and Ben both have the hots for Beverly, but Ben was the first to meet her and he wrote her a poem, eventually kissing her to break a spell. All Billy did was stare at her the whole movie and it ended with them making out. This romance between Beverly and Billy could been done so much better. Anyway, I really liked It. I thought it was good. I look forward to seeing its sequel in chapter two.",It

As a fan of Stephen King's novel ""IT"" I must say that i was extremely impressed by the movie. Firstly, the WHOLE cast and creative team behind the movie were perfectly chosen. Bill Skarsgard nails the role of Pennywise in way that you kind of sympathize the character. I was never expecting to like a child eater! All of the Losers Club have done an amazing job on maintaining their character in the correct way! Unlike all the other horror movies in the industry, IT delivers a humorous factor to the audience that breaks the horror part of the movie. In result, it really makes the movie more enjoyable. It also has a very sensitive factor. The fact that Bill is dedicated to find his brother Georgie because he thinks that he is the one to be blamed for his death is amazingly well put in the movie.There are still some changes from the book, but lets not forget that a book to a movie adaption is not always the same.

1264,swordlord-32993,See It to believe It,9,14 September 2017,"I'm truly surprised by some of the negative reviews for this movie. Honestly the 1 star ratings are absolute nonsense and to be fair, anything below a 6 rating is questionable at best. Is this a perfect rendition of the novel...? Of course not. Of all the books I've read that made it to film, I cannot think of a single one that was spot on.That being said, I've been a horror movie fan for over 30 years and to say I've seen a ton of horror films in that time is putting it mildly. There's no way that you can go into this with an open mind and come out saying it (IT) was a 1 star movie. It has genuinely creepy moments and some solid jump scares. And the CGI that everyone is whining about was rendered very well. Let's face it, practical FX are cool, but you can certainly tell it's rubber a lot of times so yes, sometimes CGI is obvious as well. But this movie has some of the best CGI I've seen aside from the massive budget super hero movies of late.So if you are going to see this thinking it will be an exact telling of the novel,you'll be disappointed as you would with any film churned from a best selling novel. If you go in thinking it's going to be a remake of the TV series (which thankfully it's not because the only good thing about that was Tim Curry's performance, which could have been even better on the big screen)well you'll be disappointed as well.

Bottom line - this was probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen. What audience is this ""horror"" movie made for... 13 year olds?

IBS(Irritable Bowell Syndrome) makes the possessors bowels terribly sensitive, and that possessor in this case, was me. Lets just say that I had to miss a good amount of this incredible film do to my before mentioned IBS(Irritable Bowel Syndrome.) But for the parts that I did get to check out, boy, am I excited to tell you all about it.When IT was announced, the same thought came into many of our minds, how could this possibly compare to Tim Curry's performance of the Clown from Stephen Kings horrible horror filmed Macroverse? Gladly though, this was not the same approach as the lovable mini series, but an entirely different approach all together. Not only did Bill Skarsgards performance of Pennywise the Dancing Clown hold up spectacularly well on the modern silver screen, but the children each held their own incredible performance, as well. Each character had their own personal battles that IT of course fed upon, and they did not disappoint on their reactions and overall performance. When it comes to today's Superhero filled theaters, a well written script usually fall by the way side as budgets on visual effect sky rocket. I was so happy to be taken on this ride of not only amazing Visual and Special Effects, but incredible writing, as well.Speaking of Effects, I would like to go further into detail on how beautiful the cinematography was in this film. Now, I sadly have to go back to when I mentioned I have IBS(Irritable Bowel Syndrome), leading me to have to remind you that this had me out of the theater multiple times during the overall film. But whenever I did enter back into the clean movie theater, matching my clean hands, I almost had to stop in awe at the screen, slowing me from finding my chair. No matter if the movie was currently focusing on a character development scene, a moment of pure horror or even just a funny breather(which there were many that made me giggle, thanks Mike) Andy Muschietti's direction of the camera never left an eye sore, but instead always complimented a characters action, always driving the eye and pleasing the brain.I don't see many horror films due to, again, my before mentioned IBS(Irritable Bowel Syndrome(You can imagine how this may be a problem for films of the horror genre.))

The scares devolve into these music driven boring fear fests that get shoved down the viewers throat that need to happen to every character. Another problem is that this film is plot driven ad opposed to character driven. Some characters are just there for comic relief and others exist to make Pennywises ""death"" more believable. And every character acts like nothing happened directly after a scare. If real people were in this situation they wouldn't charge in head first to attack a demon clown because their friends brother died, no one is that brave and because of this plot driven story few characters have half decent motivations. The end of the movie devolved into an action thriller, with the kids going to attack pennywise, yes kids kill a clown demon...believable right?

Everything about the film from the script to the actors and special effects is perfect. What is great about this movie is that it takes time to develop the characters and still save a lot of fright for the movie. There is an equal amount of everything, nothing is saved towards the end and nothing is only in the beginning. The horror happens throughout. Director Andy Muschietti worked with the best child actors I've seen in a long time, and especially with Bill Skarsgàrd who absolutely nailed and embodied the role as Pennywise. This clown is the most frightening clown I have seen. The only thing i did not like very much about the film was the language. I'm glad that there was bad language in it, making the movie and the kids more relatable and funny but this is 1989. Nobody, especially 12 and 13 year olds cursed this much back then. the f word was used sometimes but in the movie its just full. Its like 21st century cursing. I don't think it is wise to walk in this movie and compare it with the 1990s version because this film received its well deserved R rating from an explicit Stephen King novel and the Tim Curry version was aired on television where there was a limit to how much they could show.

Plus the movie is very different from the book. I understood that they wanted to make it more current in the time periods but doing that and making changes to the characters really takes away from what made the novel so great. Don't like that they made Ben like the town historian and Mike a farmer ( like what the heck). And then with Henry dying ( or at least that's what we're lead to believe). Idk, I just don't understand the new concept for the movie and how they plan to do the sequel. Lots of questionable things for me as a fan.

1277,iNathanJagger,Perfect remake for the modern-age,10,16 September 2017,"I watched the original but didn't take the notice I should of when watching to compare both movies, but then again I don't need to - this movie is its own perfect thing without being judged with the old TV Movie. It might be a remake (ish) but it is own thing completely, even though it's a remake! So watch this with or without the knowledge of the original. I originally thought they were going to show the young child being taken without any blood, but when watching it I thought it was setting the scene throughout the whole movie and showing the blood like they did was perfect, and kind of shockingly good, and the time they took on the same scene was amazingly longer than the last one. I loved how they showed each character ion their home place and struggles without having each person there to join along, because we needed to see them and how they react and work with their struggles after being through them for a while, and that is without pennywise being involved. Then bringing them all together to find out, 'wait we are going through the same thing'. This happens very shortly into the movie, sooner than I thought but made it fit in perfectly. And they gave them enough time to go through all the hard times as a group to break up and get back together to make it in good time for the end of the movie. And the ending wasn't fast, it had its own phase and took its time to make everything fit in and make sense, which makes sense it did perfectly. They also made it perfectly to put in - chapter 2, which the only thing you will wish for in chapter 2 is they explain where IT came from for this movie franchise and not go the extreme like the book/Stephen King does. As much as this is a remake they make it perfect for the 21 century so I hope they do the same thing with Pennywise's background but make it not too extreme and understandable",It

The way the scenes are handled is almost with perfection. Truly Artistic. The sound system is amazing, truly well woven with the visuals.What i feel is important to try to come across is the fact that this horror movie, Really doesn't feel like the last 50 horror movies you've watched, IT doesn't throw you into a dark environment with shadows slipping in and out, making you squint through the whole movie, No this movie does not shy away from some light, Btw excellent lighting. IT takes you to their home and makes it their own. It really does dance across the line of what is deemed acceptable it does, But with an open mind it really does get away with it.Be ready if it looks silly at times and give it the slack on the leash it needs. IT has very scary scenes no doubt, but its enjoy-ability as a whole really needs to be highlighted.I hope i have convinced you to give this movie a GO....you really cant regret it..",It

1281,sergiotavares,Movie of the year!,10,8 September 2017,"Saw this movie yesterday, and more than 24 hours later, I'm still blown away. I couldn't possibly imagine how someone could find the right balance between comedy and horror, like this. When it needs to be funny, it does perfectly well. When it needs to scare you, it'll make you look for a bed to dive under.The kids are a wonder on their own. They fit together as nothing we've seen since ""Stand By Me"" or ""The Goonies"". I can easily say, despite of being a horror movie, this is one of the most well written pieces I've seen in the past years. The dialogues between the Loser's Club will get you by your heart, right into the first 15 minutes of screening. This is a horror movie, but these kids got me laughing harder than any comedy, recently.On the other side, Mr. Bill Skarsgård is brilliant as Pennywise. He was born to this part. This is a HEAVY movie when it comes to the mature parts. When you're felling too light, the movie comes down and crush you with a moment so intense, it'll make you doubt they even had the guts to put that on screen.We have a masterpiece being made right in front of our eyes. One of the best movies of the past decade is right here. After King being so disrespected with recent adaptations like The Mist TV series and The Dark Tower, Mr Mercedes and IT came along and showed us this genius called Stephen, can still give us unforgettable moments. Jump in, you'll float too.",It
1282,rtlknd,Two hours of basically nothing.,3,21 January 2018,"I really wanted to like this movie, I heard a lot of great reviews about ""It"" and a lot of people seem to love this movie. After watching it today, I am really asking myself why.Let's start with the good things, the child actors were amazing, they gave a great performance and played their characters very naturally. 
The cinematography is gorgeous, it's a really good looking film.
But like, that's it.I think my biggest problem is that there are just too many characters, six alone in the main group of friends. I did care about maybe one of them. There just wasn't enough time to give all of them a complex and interesting character arc and I can't feel empathy for any of them, I am just sitting her trying really hard to remember their namens. I personally think this movie would work better if there was a group of two or three people, so everyone would get more 
screentime and I as a viewer would get the chance to care for them.Besides the flat and boring characters, the plot it just _fine_. Normally I am easily scared and don't watch horror movies at all, but this is just a joke. I wasn't scared once. Pennywise has potential to be scary, but the film couldn't manage to build up suspense so the ""scary"" parts are just happening in front of my face and I don't know how I should react to them.Another thing for me is the kind of forced relationship between Beverly and Bill/Ben, it's just pointless. Why is it there. I have no problem with a movie build around a group of young children, but WHY does there have to be some kind of love subplot? It's irritating and unnecessary. But maybe I just didn't get it, I don't know.I just couldn't stop comparing this movie to Stranger Things. This isn't the movies fault or the casts fault, but there are just _so_ many similarities that I wasn't able to ignore it. I bet you could cut out a scene of this movie and put it in Stranger Things and nearly nobody would notice.I don't wanna sound too harsh because clearly a lot of hard work and time went into this movie and it isn't the worst thing ever, but for me it was just mediocre at best. 
If you liked Stranger Things a lot you might also like this, if you're searching for a scary horror film with an interesting plot you are wrong here.",It
1283,bkruegerja,Negative reviews are right,2,17 September 2017,"All the negative reviews are correct. I'm sorry I spent the money to see this crap.

1284,elainetaft,"The trailer looked great, the film is not",3,12 October 2017,"I am very surprised that this film got such a high ranking. I enjoy the books, films and TV shows of Stephen King but found that this film fell way too short. The trailer looks great and Pennywise the clown looks terrifying so I was really looking forward to seeing this, but after watching this film which is over 2 hours long I could not wait for it to finish,I was waiting for it to get better but it does not - there was no scare factor whatsoever I just found it a bit boring and such a let down.

1285,codycowdell,Comedy movie with very little fright scenes involved,5,8 September 2017,"The trailer made the movie look like it was going to be a horror film when in reality it turned out to be more of a comedy. The cinematography, lighting, and the majority of character actors were well played and this movie is very much an adaptation of Stephen King's Novel IT. When I say adaptation, I mean: line for line, straight out of the book! The movie is filled with humor, potty jokes (that kids should not know), cheesy fight scenes, and a few hilarious punch-lines. You will probably be disappointed if you see this movie while comparing it to the first one, but overall a decent movie if you watch it with a fresh perspective. Cheesy movie that was set-up by amateurs. 5/10",It
1286,aubreylonergan,Very conflicted,4,4 November 2017,"I was wholeheartedly expecting to love this movie. I expected this adaption to live up to the original, and incorporate the technology we have today to really make this story come to life. Instead I continuously asked myself if what I just saw on screen legitimately happened. The plot was all over the place. Rather than a clown simply terrorizing a town, it was also a coming of age film. A group of friends are experiencing their summer, while Pennywise the clown is periodically flying around town. I really did not understand how it was supposed to be a scary movie when the clown could also be seen as a comic- dancing and fooling around, in scenes that held so much potential to scare viewers. I felt I had watched another movie than the one all my friends had praised. On the contrary, I did think the kids were genius. They were genuinely funny, I just thought their personalities didn't fit with where I had interpreted this film to go.",It

Every special effect, make up and costume were the dogs..... Unfortunately the rest was let down by the child's story book plot. The movie had more jokes than scares, this is meant to be the horror film of the year? Really? I think the director and everyone else except the writer should do the next conjuring or insidious movie. That would be awesome as I was really impressed with what I could see visually. In a nutshell this is a horror movie wrote by kids containing kids with some jokes chucked in.",It

IT was one of the very first books I read and one of the first horror movies I watched. I actually watched the original before going to the cinema to see the new one and I was not disappointed to see that they had kept very much to the original story and even surprised me when they stayed in the original era rather than modernising it. However, call me nostalgic, but it was just not the same without Tim Curry and that's why I can't give it 10/10. Silly to some, maybe but I'm sure there's other 'elders' like me who felt the same. Other than that, the kids acting was 10/10, storyline 10/10, dialogue 10/10, clown acting 8/10, it was just a bit too much at times but overall it has left me anxiously anticipating the final chapter.",It

I was very disappointed by everything this movie had I only saw it because I am a huge bill skarsgard fan ""Hemlock Grove"" and his acting in this film was disappointing.

I had a hard enough time with the TV series back in the day with the amazing Tim Curry but I have to say Bill Skarsgård will haunt my nightmares from here on out. The acting int the film is exceptional as is every other element of the movie. They truly went out of their way to place you back in the 80's midsummer. I felt as if I was a child watching a scary movie for the first time as I sat there in the theater trembling... I have mixed opinions on how to answer the question of if I like this movie, a large part of me screams NO but solely the fear of clowns, while the rest of my bellows YES from the tops of my lungs. I would recommend the film to anyone who might be looking for a masterfully made scary movie or anyone in love with Stephen Kings works... because this won't let you down, even if they all float.

It is by far better than the original, but quite frankly, it does not hold a candle to some of the better horrors out there. It relies a lot on jump scares and fails to create any sort of ambiance. On a plus side the acting was top notch and the cast was pretty well chosen.Its worth a watch once just for the sake of watching it, but it will not go down in history as a must watch horror flick.",It
1293,nannilulic,This isn't a horror movie!!,6,8 December 2017,"Good special effects and good use of soundtracks: especially in the first sequence which, alone, is worth the price of the ticket.HOWEVER! The editing is something terrible, mistakes over mistakes. Plot holes every twenty minutes. Why is Mike introduced after 5 minutes and then disappears from the screenplay for 1 hour or more? Plus, all the scary scenes generate from the same situations over and over again which makes them so predictable and irritable at the same time. Finally, I don't think this can be defined as a horror movie: there is no horror atmosphere at all. Muschietti's film is only made out of jump scares (predictable as well) and there are continuous mood swings that do not contribute to the (attempt of) creation of the terrifying atmosphere we are looking for. You can't make a horror movie only out of jump scares, it just doesn't work like that.",It

1295,ifantasticat,Not as bad as they say,8,5 June 2018,"I was a bit antsy when I went into the theater on opening night, I was so excited when I first watched, I was mad that it wasn't what I had hoped it'd been. My main problem was that the cgi was not good, but going back and rewatching It, it wasn't that bad. I also didn't like the look of Pennywise. In the book, he was supposed to look like an actual clown, to lure children into the sewers, not look like a demon. Now this movie is based later than in the book and miniseries, and post John Wayne Gacy. So I guess clowns wouldn't really lure anyone anywhere, so they went with the very scary, demon vibe. The plot, the losers, and It, are very accurate to the book (excluding the Pennywise form, and the mythology backstory). So... it's not a perfect film, but yeah, I'd recommend 'It' (2017) it's not spot on, tit for tat like the book, but I understand the changes and reasoning.",It
1296,Backtoblack11,A new horror classic,10,4 September 2020,"It is one of the most well put together horror movies that I have seen in a while. While not being one of those scare-you-straight-out-of-your-pants movies, it's also not supposed to be. It has a good number of jump scares, as well as plenty of suspenseful scenes, but does not scare you non-stop, which is an element that many people appreciate. The movie has some gore, some suspense, and even some comedy, so there's something to love for all types of horror movie lovers out there. The aspect of It that I appreciate the most is that It not only tells a story about a killer clown, but it also tells a story about friendship and compassion. The movie shows that no matter how young you are, or what walk of life that you're in, you can beat your monsters. The actors do a spectacular job in connecting with their audience and I could understand everything that all seven kids we're going through. It is truly a bone-chilling movie if you can connect to the storyline and the characters, simply because It can and will be, whatever you are most afraid of. It's not always Pennywise, or a germ-infested zombie, or past traumas coming back to haunt you, but it's always what you're most afraid of, which makes it extremely easy for someone just watching the movie to put themselves in the characters shoes and be truly, utterly terrified.",It

They made some improvements over the 1990 series, but also screwed up some of the good things from the 1990 series. The acting was good but the story was bland and I never felt the closeness the losers were supposed to have in the story. The 1990 film, while corny to today's standards, did a much better job with the kids' back stories and you knew why Henry Bowers hated them so much. This movie just felt rushed and thrown together haphazardly. Moving the film to the 80's really backed them into a corner as far as how the story would play out relative to the source material. The apocalyptic rock fight was anything but dramatic and they actually made it humorous which is 180 degrees the wrong direction. It wouldn't have been bad as a stand-alone film but calling it Stephen King's IT is not really accurate. 6 of 10 because the acting was done well.",It

There is not really anything scary in this movie or perhaps there is if you are 10 years old. Only some cheap jumpscares and brutality but compared to something like The Shining this is a not scary, boring and cheap film. And sadly this is the case with many horror films today.

There were moments that were better than others, but there were scenes that I believed were intended to be scary but ended up being unintentionally funny. Some CGI scenes were just laughable, for example: when Beverly was in the sewer after being taken away by Pennywise, the clown starts dancing on a stage with music in the background. The acting in this movie is very good, Finn Wolfhard and Sophia Lillis standing out the most, but it is more entertaining as a comedy. I still enjoyed it though",It

1307,getdss,So disappointed,2,11 April 2019,"My problem with this new adaptation of ""It"" is that it's addled with CGI and jump scares, neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal. At the risk of sounding like a film snob, if you're trying to make a film set decades before this era, you don't use CGI at all if you can avoid it, unless you really know how to camouflage it. The constant profanity did nothing for the story either, it only gave the false illusion of being edgy. Yes, the book had profanity, but King knew where to draw the line and keep the perfect balance of immature vulgarity and true friendship. The sheer level of nerdiness here made me cringe, unlike the TV movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love and joy amidst the horror, just like King's novel. Did one of those boys seriously just say ""Get me my bifocals, I hid them in my second fanny pack""? What the hell kind of child wears bifocals? Why not just rename him Poindexter while they're at it? The kids in the book and the miniseries were never this obnoxiously dorky. And what's with all this New Kids on the Block stuff? There was a scene in which for no apparent reason all these close-ups of NKOTB posters pop up on-screen. Why? Just because earlier in the film a kid had been listening to that music? It made no sense! We get loads of terrible one liners from Richie comparing the blood in the sewers to ""period blood"" (lovely, eh?) and trust me, no way does any thirteen-year-old talk like this. All kids at that age swear and tell fart jokes and stuff, but even they have their limits.",It

So with this disappointing outcome of the movie, I decided to watch it again at home with my nephew, keep in mind that this film was rated a 15 and he was 10, he also didn't find it scary.

1327,garofan,"Absolute Worst Movie of 2017, Beating The Emoji Movie By A Landslide.",1,8 March 2021,"I remember all the hype and media coverage surrounding this movie four years ago, and I honestly can't see why. That said, let's dive into the plot...So on one rainy day, Bill, who I will get into later, is pretending to be sick in bed, while making his little brother, Georgie, a paper boat. Then, still keeping the lie going, he sends Georgie on his own, where he could potentially run into danger. And of course, he does. From within a storm drain, when trying to get his boat back, It, the eponymous creature, bites his arm off and drags him into his doom. Yes, this scene does depict a 7 year old kid getting his arm torn off by a monster, but to quote Jurassic World (which is way better than this heap of garbage, in spite of its own flaws), ""monster"" is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.Then later that summer, we meet Mike, a black kid whose parents died in a crack den fire, now forced to kill sheep for his grandfather, one assumes to make him desensitized to killing living creatures so he can kill It in the future. As school lets out, we also meet Bill's freinds, Richie, Eddie, and Stan, as well as Beverly, a girl who is hated throughout the entire school because she kissed Bill in a school play once, and Ben, a fat kid who harbours a crush on her largely because they're in the same class. But in the meantime, It is on the hunt.And even though they're just 8-12 year old kids and it's summer, you know, when they should be having fun, Bill, who is convinced Georgie somehow survived having his arm torn off by It (granted, he didn't witness it for himself), but as an earlier scene shows, even Bill's dad (who presumably also didn't see It tear Georgie's arm off) knows full-well Georgie is dead, decides to go off and kill the creature. Of course, none of it goes according to plan, perhaps because there wasn't one; Ben gets clawed, while Eddie gets his arm broken. And as a result, Bill gets into a quarrel with Richie over his dead brother, and alienates his ""friends"" for a week. And during this period, It finds Beverly, who has just killed (or at least knocked out) her dad, who is implied to sexually abuse her because she looks a lot like her mom who killed herself, and abducts her, so only now does Bill get his ""friends"" back together.They make a climb down into the sewers, and they reach a a cavernous room wherein It has built its nest, to save Beverly -- rendered unconscious in by It. They find her, but she won't wake up, so Ben has to kiss her. Without her consent. Look, I know, it's supposed to be romantic and fairy tale-esque, but it just comes off as creepy and forced. Once Beverly is woken up, It attacks the group and grabs ahold of Bill, while Richie explains to Bill why he dislikes him, because he's done nothing but put their lives on the line this whole summer. During this scene, I actually thought they were going to leave Bill behind to become It munchies, but out of nowhere, Richie instantly forgives Bill like it was nothing, and they do battle with It, hitting the creature with random objects they found lying around its nest, then it escapes by crawling into a hole. Not long afterward, they make a promise to return if It does and part ways. The end.I don't get why people like this, it's not an ""amazing movie,"" it's terrible, it's juvenile, Bill, the ""hero,"" is literally just Trump as an 8-12 year old kid, as he has the position of the ""leader,"" despite that he does a poor job of leading his party, he lies (a lot), he whines and complains like a petulant toddler, add to all that, he doesn't care about anyone but himself, and not to mention all those F-bombs (which are perhaps the true reason behind its R rating; It's otherwise relatively tame). And from one interview with the Muschiettis, the two to blame for this abomination of a movie, they insist that if they aimed for a PG-13 movie, they would've had nothing at the end, but that's not true. If Jurassic World could do a lot with a PG-13 rating, so could this, but the Muschiettis didn't want to, even though their moral compasses told them they should've. Thank you for reading my review.But wait there's more! This movie had a (redundant) sequel...",It
1328,coochiemama,"Overrated, but not bad.",7,9 March 2021,"IT is supposed to be a ""horror"" movie, but it isn't even scary. If you watch horror movies because you want to be scared after you finish the movie, then this is definitely NOT the right movie for you. Believe it or not, I watched this first when I was 11, and was I scared one bit? No. In fact, I was very disappointed. But then I had a phase where I re-watched the movie and LOVED IT. Like, a LOT. I joined the ""IT fandom"" too for a while, but that only lasted for a few months before I found something else. Anyways, I remember after I told my friends that I watched IT for the first time, they were all like: ""...Isn't it rated R?"" ""Bro you're gonna have nightmares for YEARS!"" ""I don't believe you."" And that's probably because everyone who hasn't watched it has feared to watch it because it's so overrated, and made to be like a horrible movie that's ""so traumatizing"" and ""ruined me"", at least what I've heard. I re-watched the movie again the other day, and then went onto this website where parents reviewed movies, and...OH MY GOD. The parents on the reviews were like ""This was a horrible movie. Scarred me. Little kids shouldn't be watching it. My 18 year old son was scared for months. Movie should be banned."" when in reality, it's not a bad movie.

By giving the characters great chemistry. Really funny Dialogue and an easily recognizable villain with an evil motive of eating kids. The first part of the movie is masterful. Showing how dangerous Pennywise can be by eating a little kid. That's right. No plot armor, just...dead. Then we know what the hero's will be up against we see what they are, bullied losers. This makes us lose hope on fighting the clown but makes it so much better when they beat him. It feels very earned. These characters are funny at the start and have great lines, and they really look like friends. Almost like they aren't acting. We get a few scares making the kids aware of Pennywise and trying to defeat him. The second half isn't also good because it's kind of slow but it shows that Pennywise is being a lot more sneaky than before. Once we get to end, we feel for these characters and get scared when one of them is close to dying. At then relief once they beat the clown. Did I mention this movie is hilarious. Richies jokes aren't for everyone but they are fore me. The humor really helped me watch through this entire movie and I would have hated it if this movie was serious. Whose Idea is to make kids serious, they're KIDS! So I'm happy that they made the kids funny and rude. Overall, not the best horror movie but still a banger.",It

1332,EndeAbgrunds,"Not so much a movie, as IT is an intangible collection of scenes.",5,8 September 2017,"IT truly is the scariest movie of all time... If you're 10 years old or younger, maybe.I honestly am shocked by all the positive reviews and high rotten tomatoes score. Did I see a completely different movie? IT starts off very well with a genuinely good opening scene. Great cinematography, atmosphere, lighting, a likable child whom you connect with easily, and an interesting encounter takes place between this kid and a very creepy clown. The dialogue is good, there is an eerie sense of dread, and a moment where IT aka Pennywise goes from being a friendly-ish clown to a terrifying villain in an instant through a very well placed awkward stare. It was a moment I wasn't expecting and gave me hope for the rest of the film, then... It's all downhill from there, after an almost laughable use of CG. This movie has big issues. IT isn't scary. IT's story is weak, if you can even call it a story. IT has too many underdeveloped characters. And IT is a counterproductive villain with no concrete rules for what IT can or can not do.The overuse of CG ruined any sense of tension or fear and Pennywise's tactics didn't make sense. If he feeds off fear, why reveal himself to each of the kids within a close time period? Why not concentrate on each child individually, causing far more mental torment and making them an easier kill? Pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere at anytime, and disappears randomly. I don't find it scary when the antagonist manifests itself, attacks a character and right before doing damage IT vanishes..The story is a mess and there are far too many characters. I swear the first 40 minutes is the longest montage in film history. A montage of each child's development and exposure to Pennywise. It was predictable and monotonous. As for the story, I don't know what to say, besides there really isn't one. Character motivations are weak, Bill is the only one who makes sense. Where were the parents at? Not a single parent seemed to care about their missing children. The few on screen parents there were, came off as caricatures. And there were a few scenes that felt completely pointless within context of the story. The school bully and his dad, being the oddest.So in closing, IT is an uneven movie or more accurately a collection of scenes that don't flow well in a tangible story. There are some good laughs, and a few entertaining scenes. But all in all it's just an average movie. Which should've been an evident sign, when the original attached director Cary Fukunaga jumped ship.",It

Between the dead eyes and voice you can't help but feeling the tension build as he gives you a chilling blood fiend of a laugh. I got the sense this actor came with absolute respect for the role and put in everything to make his portrayal something to remember for a whole new generation.The kids in the movie did a great job considering this was an 80s era piece, it did however rely a little to much on swearing being the punchline of the joke , when it came to the 4-5th time i was a little disappointed they couldn't find anything other than that to give the audience a laugh. All the kids did a great job in portraying the emotions of the scenes and hitting all the notes when needed with all having their chance to come up against ""it"" and not giving off anything but terror and keeping to the tones of the scenes, really liked there performances.I myself didn't feel as if it was scary, it was more creepy with a lot of tension building (not that the tension didn't play out to nothing, it left me with more of a thrill as opposed to fright, which was still really satisfying to see with the amazing special effects playing out)Overall this movie left me wanting that part 2!!",It

1338,lantosahim,If It was not a horror.,6,24 September 2017,"In the past years, since I watch films not just for fun, but as a piece of cultural marvel and I simply didn't feel the originality to write anything.And I feel the same with some genres, where the creators does not will, can, able to find anything new – and profitable at the same time. It was a nicely shot, well directed (after the first terrible hour) and really really well played movie. I don't want to argue about the raison d'etre of horror, but even my mother tongue is not English, the first thing flashed in my mind is the word: pointless.This movie has a first and second Act, that is trying to push the standard horror clichés, like the strange camera angles, raising music tones and sharp, choppy cuts. This made me a bit angry, but it also spotlighted the biggest problem of the whole industrialized movie making. They have to make money, and just like any other undertaking, the studios have to position their products for the customers. So we sometimes get this fragmented kind of ""product"".On the other hand, I think this movie worked pretty well, when it (or It – ha ha :) ) didn't try scare the sh*t out of the audience with jump scare or with the previously mentioned aggressive method. And here comes the pointless side of the ""horror"".I have no problem with the fear. But it must be a tool not a goal. You rarely can get a great dramatic play and an amusement center in the same room. But when it is used as a tool, to settle the whole story and its own Universe with its own rules, then it could work.The lighting was good, the child actors were great, the cinematography was okay, the music I don't remember. At the end of the day did I like the movie? Yes. But not because it was a well- mad-piece-of-art, but because I had some really great moments and a great story behind all the ""effort"" of making this great mystery drama to a horror movie.",It
1339,rohit317,Really well made !,8,17 September 2017,"The current trend of horror movies usually involve sudden 'in-your-face' movements which are pretty scary. Having seen many such movies, it is hard to shock the audience. This movie is based on Stephen King's book which was written back in 1986. As such, it follows the trend of those times - good storyline, interesting characters, good chemistry between them, good acting & slow psychological buildup of scary scenes rather than sudden movements. Its a refreshing change to see such a movie. Bill Skarsgård has done a splendid job as Pennywise the shapeshifting demon. His wicked smile remains with you even after the movie. There are plenty of hidden scary parts in the scenes which remain in the background (eg : the library scene). Highly recommend watching it on the big screen.",It

The only scene very scary and horrifying is within the first 15 min. All the rest is comedy, piece of shit, bullshit, absolutely NOT scary at all !!!The scene you all saw with the face of the clown inside a sewer is very frightening. I was so happy to watch a 2 hours horror movie. I was so happy to be scared to death. But except this very small scene, it is almost a comedy movie. You laugh rather than shivering.Also it looks like the goonies version 2017. The girl, the fat boy, the skinny one, the intelligent, the talker, the one easily scared, the courageous, etc...Of course you have the usual stupid behaviour where people split in one direction and others in another oninstead to stay all together.You have also a kind of fantastic at the end, stuff floating. Well, not really credible with an everyday world. Well ok the clown stuff is not really credible too if you think about it but lets say it is ok. The floating stuff what is that? It seems we are now in a sci-fi movie.Also this town has a rate of 4 or 6 times the usual kiilings in the country, all that discovered by the fat boy. I mean in this town children disappear at a higher rate than anywhere in the country and NOBODY cares, no journalist or police investigate. NO ONE !!! But suddenly, the little fat boy who has no friend, go to the library, read abstracts from newspapers and make the discovery. He discover every 27 years, something happens. But no adult can do that.Well the more you watch the movie, the more bored you become. I thought many times to stop to watch it. It is really rare I want to stop watching a movie, but it is so NOT an horror movie.The goonies is a fucking good movie. Comedy and comedy mixed with a bit of funny horror. But when you expect and get thrilled by a so called horrible horror movie, a scary movie and you end up with a remake of the goonies, yes I've been deceived. An horror movie where I'm not scared? Boring, lenghty.So people please forget it: except if you are under 10, you won't be scared at all.

1342,egp10990,Not as Good as the Original,7,9 September 2017,"I am a gigantic fan of the original ""It"" miniseries, and this latest version pales in comparison. First and foremost there is a complete over abundance of CGI. This made the film so much less scary than the practical effects of the original because so many things just looked fake. Secondly the clown is overshadowed by the brilliance of Tim Curry in the original. The appeal of his Pennywise was that he wasn't overly creepy looking. You could see his clown showing up at a birthday party and not be too hesitant to get a balloon from him. 2017 Pennywise is just your typical creepy clown. No child I know would want to want to go near him. I also found it odd that this version took place in the late 80's. I understand why they did that but it just didn't ring true to the book. I also appreciated the kids in the original more. They were more fleshed out and likable. All these critiques being said, I will say that the film kept me entertained the whole time. The kids were pretty endearing and funny. Ritchie was particularly entertaining. There were some scary parts that weren't done by computer, and there's a nice little homage to Tim Curry's Pennywise in the film. It's worth a watch.",It

Tim Curry was ingrained in our brains as Pennywise. This one is a lot better. Skarsgard is a fantastic Pennywise, the child actors are convincing and for the most part the cinematic changes are more than acceptable, at the least understandable. However the final face off decides to go ""off book"" and leads into the classic cinematic horror film tropes, which doesn't work with the build up, leaving you incredulous on behalf of the 'tweens'. I found it tense, a few jumps (much to my surprise) and I enjoyed it. I won't say more. It could have been perfect, in the end it's just a bit of a let down for ten minutes. 8/10 (would have been a 9).",It
1344,Neilcross-50-542836,I think I saw a different IT (2017) to everyone else...,2,16 September 2017,"...either that or most people submitting early reviews, off the back of attending the premiere, got carried away with the occasion, because this was truly an absolute toilet of a movie.Let's start with this. I don't care how popular your history or franchise is. If you require that I do homework first, by either reading a massive book or watching the original film before spending £20 in a cinema in order to understand what the Jeff is going on, then you've immediately failed and made a bad movie. And that is exactly what happened here.There was absolutely no character introductions, no back story, no descriptive narrative to who the kids in this movie are, who the clown is, what the clown is, why it happens, why anything happens, there was nothing! But nevertheless, the movie immediately expected you to care about the characters. One minute it was like watching a cheap budget teen comedy, then all of a sudden - I say all of a sudden, it was a good 30 minutes before any 'action' happened, suddenly these paranormal day of the dead CGI zombies began crawling out of paintings and killer hair coming out of plug holes! Then 2 minutes later, the kids where cracking on with life like none of this happened... like this is somehow something you forget to mention in conversation with your close friends! It was truly bizarre and genuinely confusing. Confusion and apathy are the main emotions I felt during this movie. I was so thrown off by how little I cared about the characters, and by how little narrative was given to place context around the events unfolding, that it was impossible to find anything terrifying and scary. I found myself shaking my head in despair at scenes which you could tell the audience should have been in suspense over, but it just wasn't holding up.Thankfully it wasn't just me either. The cinema was crammed with at least 500 people in the Odeon. You know what people are like especially in public, exaggerating and being eccentric, during IT though... silence. No gasps, no screams, no sighs and humphs... silence, a few people even walked out early.Visually the movie was a mixed bag. The CGI was certainly impressive, but that left me even more confused. As the clown morphed and deformed itself into alien looking terror, I was sat there thinking just what the Jeff is going on here... someone has clearly put a lot of effort into this CGI but I don't know why, I don't know what this is, is it a human? Is it some sort of ghost? A figment of imagination? There was literally no introduction to describe the history of this clown which was essential for those who simply haven't indulged this franchise before. It was really off putting and distracting.Secondly, the film is far too dark. Probably to emphasise the horror feel but it was really difficult to see what was happening in many scenes, at times it felt like it was too dark to hide bad props and lazy CGI moments. Either way, one of the most infuriating repetitive annoyances was the characters insistence on carrying torches and pointing them at the damn camera lens!! Oh my god I wanted to brutally dismember them myself for that! Given the the movie is so dark, your eyes adjust to that and then BOOM a blinding bright torch flashes into the lens causing you to squint and look away... again, and again, and again, of course this was happening towards the end which by that point you've already had enough so it was all the more enraging.So whilst trying to not give out any spoilers, that'll do it. It was up there with the worst films I've ever had to sit through. I honestly can't think of a single positive to this movie. I'm happy to be in the minority on this one too, fans of the franchise I'm sure will love it, people like me who are brand new to this will be left wondering what else they could and should have spent that bloated ticket price on.",It

1350,Mr_Bill_Chambers_DeLarge,An Interesting and Modern Take on a Familiar Story,8,8 September 2017,"""It"" is one of those books that is nearly impossible to translate to visual media. Aside from the number of pages and attention to detail, the book is filled with symbolism and metaphors that will either got lost in translation or come across as ludicrous. I give a lot of credit to the 1990's mini series since it captured the overall essence of the book in what was considered a relatively short running time (still a 3 hr series!). What is interesting about this take on ""It"" is while a very good and entertaining movie, it misses to showcase exactly what make the book so terrifying. Having said that, I still enjoy the movie as to me it is, in my humble opinion a well made horror movie. Furthermore, while I disagree with many of the creative changes, I understand them from a broader appeal to the story in the interest of making profit.The decision to change the childhood timeline from the 50's to the 80's is probably my biggest issue. Yes, from a commercial perspective, it makes sense. We are living in an age where the new hip thing is to throwback to the 80's a la Stranger Things. I appreciate a good 80's nostalgic piece, but it does not work well for this particular story.Contrary to what the director and producer seem to believe, It is not merely a story about a killer clown. Granted, most people remember it as being that and truth be told, Pennywise is the reason we all gravitate towards this story, but what Pennywise and the town of Derry represents is much more sinister. I believe ""It"" ultimately tries to demonstrate the facade of the all american town and how its citizens go out of their way to ignore issues and sweep them under the rug. This is why the 50's setting worked so well with the story. Around this decade the fights for civil rights had begun and racial tensions were reaching their peak. Homosexuality was more than just taboo. We were just recovering from WW2. There are so many factors which add to the actions and behaviors of the characters.Therefore, switching the setting to the 80's, while cool in theory, it completely detracts from the idea of destroying this fake 50's image of perfect all-Americana. In addition, the 80's was a decade represented by sex, drugs and rock and roll. While I'm not condoning those as necessarily bad things, they do represent a shift from the norm of what was considered ""good.""The movie as a whole works well. The entire cast was excellent, which to be honest I had my doubts since the entire child cast in the original was phenomenal. This new cast manages to show some degree of familiarity with their overall dynamics, yet they retain true to creating their own characters. While Tim Curry's performance is difficult to top, Bill Skarsgard deliver a completely different take on Pennywise who comes across as a mentally unstable high school bully.I'm still waiting for a faithful adaptation of the book.

I don't see a point in all that because each of them presents a different view of the novel (if you want something to compare, compare the film adaptation with the book).The 1990 film provides a mysterious aspect of the situation. It was a wonderful and traumatizing story, while the 2017 version just released the horror. Each of them had different intentions. As for the clowns, Tim Curry did an excellent job with offering us a character that perfectly mixed the fun, jokes and games with an equal amount of psychosis, while Bill Skarsgård did the hungry for fear and mad creature which was intended for this horrific (in a good way) film.Nevertheless, each of them had their goods and bads, and I consider them equal over all. I just hope that Chapter two (of the 2017 film) will not ruin this.",It

I'm not going to get into too much detail about the film but I will say what I think needs to be said. I watched the 90's mini series about 7-8 times over the years, and I recently read the book! So I was definitely really excited for this film! IT wasn't perfect, but it was pretty darn good. You could pick it apart like some people have done and argue that maybe it was over CGI-ed, or one review I read said the plot was rushed, or maybe there was a tad too much humor. It was too magical or not ""true horror"". Not a lot like the novel. Bulls**t! It was good. Not perfect, but really good! Do I wish it were scarier and more violent with less CGI? Yeah. Would I have personally liked it better if it were identical to the novel? Sure, but I still enjoyed the film.The acting was very well done by all; Skarsgard does quite well with his own take of the sadistic clown! Some of the kids are actually quite funny and it works well I think. It's Decently scary (or perhaps really scary for some folks)! Some great surprises and jump-scares in there. It's quite disturbing, creepy, and funny! Also, amazing timing on the release of this film (27 years later).If you're a fan of horror, clowns, the TV mini series, the book, or Stephen King... check IT out!! 8.5/10",It

While Annablle focus is giving us a bunch of scares, building up a dark atmosphere that compensates the lack of neutral dialogues, the movie It perfectly combines scary-creepy elements with comedy ones, and God, how did it blend so well. I read the book a few months ago, but I can recall of everything important, and I believe I saw at least 80% of the first half in the screenplay. It felt just good to point a scene out and shout ""OMG, it's exactly like this on the book!"". when I left the theater I was in awe.

Instead of only cheap jump scares to completely make up it's run time, even though there are some, this film mainly has a creepy and suspenseful tone that lasts the entire film. Also the film gets you to care with all of the main characters and show off the great acting talent that the leads possess before diving deep into the clown mayhem. The leads all show great range, switching from dramatic to comedic scenes with ease. Pennywise is incredible in this film and the actor completely sells the creepy factor that will keep you on your toes. He made me wanting more.

IT was a pretty good movie. I thought it was very well crafted and payed good attention to detail in a few parts. I haven't read the book but others who I know that have read it say it is pretty faithful to the source material. It seemed to be a very nice blend of the new age of horror with jump scares and horrific imagery and a more suspenseful type of horror seen in the old days. The characters, acting and locations were very well done and the cinematography was fairly good with the exception of some scenes that seemed too dark. I appreciated that they choose practical effects for some of the scenes and didn't just go full CG with all of it. Some of the CG was a bit weird but for the most part it was well done. They didn't restrict Skarsgard's acting when it came to intense scenes and it was quite refreshing. Lastly, it may just have been me, but a majority of the ""scary parts"" didn't get me simply because they were either predictable or generic jump scares that I've developed somewhat of an immunity to. So, in all, I thought IT was a pretty good movie that was able to effectively mix together multiple genres and tell a good story.",It

Not saying it cannot be done successfully but like this one it is more than likely going to fail. This film is not scary and the acting is very similar to a b rated film and in my opinion it does not give it a right to try and beat a a rated mini TV series, that has grown to fame throughout the years from the amazing actors that we now respect and admire. Pennywise is not convincing is the point of modernize classics to get young adults into horror movies by making them almost word for word renditions of the originals.

1362,BakedSweetPotatoe,Maybe there are books that should never be touched,7,28 September 2017,"I am one of those who read the book several times and listened to the audio book as well a couple of weeks in my life. I tried to keep my expectations low though I was really excited when I watched IT in the preview show.When I left the cinema it was like 'Uhm did Stand by me meet Alien meet The Ring meet Flatliners? The 80's? Really? Well.....do we have to expect cellphones then 27 years later? If anyone of the Losers runs around with an iPhone in the second part I swear I will leave the cinema.First: Why, why, why did Georgie have to disappear? It's such an important key fact of the entire story and they make him disappear? For real? I loved the first 5 minutes but from that moment onwards when Pennywise took him with him everything went downhill. The motivation for Bill and the Losers Club is simply not accountable onwards.Then: I understand you have to cut a few side stories but do you REALLY have to change so many things? Mikes parent's dead? Where is Beverly's mum? Henry Bowers dad is a police man?? Ben just moved to Derry and finds out as the only person (and kid) about the history of Derry? And (in my opinion) the worst: why was it Bill cutting the hands and not Stan? It's another so important key fact especially for the character development and they ruined it finally with this scene for me.The Losers Club: Why did Richie have to be such a....teenager with over boarding hormones? He is actually my favourite character in the book for his sharp tongue and intelligence and the movie made him not look very good. I was annoyed. And the 'your mama' jokes were not very funny either imo.I really liked Eddie though, and was surprised how well he was casted so he will replace 'my' Eddie from the book because I was really pleased. Beverly is without a doubt very pretty and did well, but in general the entire group was not very well developed. The scene with the projector however was good with Pennywise appearing on the screen, when he jumped into the room though I wanted to facepalm myself though. The best moments were definitely those with the entire Losers Club on-screen.Pennywise: Is it just me or is he way too handsome for Pennywise? The cheeks - gorgeous! I am not sure you are supposed to have a crush on Pennywise what I find strange myself, but they didn't hide the handsomeness of Bill Skarsgård very well. Girlie note aside, there was never a moment where the full potential of Pennywise was exposed. He is not only a scary shapeshifter who likes to scare and eat kids and bother to give them nightmares but so much more! The last scene really offended me where the Losers Club was beating him up. It's too common, as if he was any other guy. What about Eds asthma spray for example? The actor did a really good job though trying to act with all the unnecessary effects trying to steal his show. My favourite scene was him catching Beverly in the bathroom where IT clearly showed that less is more and I wish they would have respected this fact more.There was one thing I noticed about the portrait of women in this movie. There is Beverly, the crazy mum of Eds and the librarian, so either the teenage girl discovering her sexuality and women who are out of it and obviously the entire opposite. You have as well nasty teenage girls, but besides there is absolutely no woman involved and only men and fathers around that are no better. Very bewildering, in the book itself it was not so black-white.The movie gets 7 from me because of the book by Stephen King and for all the small details like the turtle reference, Eddies T-Shirt with Christine on it and so on. I might as well be too overcritical because 'I heart IT' and think it's a book you simply can't make a movie out of it. A series maybe, but no movie would do the book ever, ever justice.If you have never touched the book and no idea about the background you might enjoy the movie for what it is, but you will have a completely wrong idea about the depth of the entire story. I will watch IT (no pun intended) again and maybe I will like it more, but right now some disappointment is creeping up inside me. No floating so far.",It

The characters had a certain integrity, the ignorance of adults in the movie capture the eerie hive-mind ignorance of the town of Derry in the book. This is what I imagined it to be like, when I read the book. It was also a good call to focus just on the children's story, and leave out the 27 years later, that is intertwined in the storytelling in the original. It makes it easier to track, and helps focus on the story. And leaves them an option to do It 2 when and if they want to. Having the kid from Stranger Things play Richie Tozier was also a nice touch. You can also find references to Tim Curry in the clown room. Not a scarier horror than most, but a better film than most horrors.",It

1365,em-lundberg,This is It,9,18 September 2017,"As a big fan of Stephen King, and in love with the original series, I had high expectations when I saw this movie yesterday. When Pennywise said Hello down from the sewers, I was stuck! I've read that some people thought the movie boring, and not scary enough. But I was just glad that they mostly skipped jump scares, because IT is more then cheap scares. And this remake really captured the true nature of Pennywise the Dancing clown! This movie stayed true to the original and to Stephen King, and made sure that the characters was well played. Also, the actors did a fantastic job! And even if Tim Curry was my first Pennywise, Bill Skarsgård makes a bloody brilliant version. So, if you've not seen the original series, read the book, don't know of how Stephen King works and just want jump scares then this might not be for you. But this movie is really good, and you'll float to if you just give it a chance.",It

I've never left the theater feeling this way about a horror movie. It was able to blend disturbing elements, dark humor, and creepy material almost seamlessly and it never did so without purpose for the story.There were moments where I felt the scene only happened for the sake of making a scare, but the plot made its connections effectively.The movie had a lot of genuinely amusing dialogue in it, which is what made it funny at times. The cast was fantastic and the characters were very well-developed and enjoyable; a rare element for films of this theme.There were hair-raising moments of terror in the film as well as a few uniquely effective old-school jumps scares, and these moments were spread throughout the film evenly.The character-driven narrative was easily one of the best I've scene in the genre and was fairly emotional at times.Overall it played as a fun and focused horror film with laughing, crying and screaming mixed together nicely.

I have watched almost every scary movie in the past 10 years and they are a few that come close to this movie overall. Penny wise is impactful but not overbearing. This movie reminds me of when I was a tennager and how we would go on adventures to cemetery's and old abandoned houses looking for something to happen. This live has a great backstory and it makes you really care about the characters. Like you are rooting for them to survive against penny wise.

1369,prettydeadalready,One of few heavily modified book adaptations worthy of the source material. I wish it had been longer - but if that's my only complaint...,10,7 September 2017,"I was not disappointed. It was a lot truer to the spirit of the book than the 1990's miniseries. It didn't shy away from the violence or horror, the kids were allowed swear, and Skarsgård's Pennywise puts Tim Curry's performance to shame.There was actually a lot changed from the book, but all of it was for the better - most of it, apparently, for the sake of taking advantage of the film's opportunities for better visuals, where it succeeds wildly. It's the first film I've seen with genuinely disturbing moments/visuals since Enter the Void. A few plot points are also changed, but that ended up being a plus, since you don't know what's going to happen even if you've read the book, and it's all done well.My only complaint is that a lot was omitted - some of it, probably, because it wouldn't have translated as well to the silver screen (like the scene with Mike in the field with the bird), some of it because it was, almost certainly, unfilmable (like the infamous scene with Beverly), and most of it because of time constraints. The upside to this is that it's action-packed and much faster-paced than the book, but I would have liked if the movie had been allowed a longer runtime. Might have worked better as a trilogy than a two- parter, actually.But if my main complaint is that it was so good it left me wanting more, there's really nothing to complain about at all. Excellent film, can't wait for the sequel.",It
1370,greenblueglee,Don't rate a helicopter as if you were hoping for a bicycle,10,7 October 2017,"I am a Stephen King fan. Not everything by him equally, but I really like most of his stories - the creepy ones, the magically-real ones, and especially all of those even remotely related to the world and characters he created for The Dark Tower novels. This adaptation of ""It"" is, in my opinion, the best one that could be done while keeping as true to the story as possible. I don't mind that they moved the setting into the future, or that they changed a few things to make the story less horrible (Yes, folks. Less horrible. Read the book and you'll see why). I see that some viewers are disappointed by the lack of ""scares"" in the film. Most people equate being scared by a film with how often they are startled. Jump scares are an easy way to get an audience to react, and to give them a sense that they've enjoyed a film. As with ""The Babadook,"" most viewers miss the point of horror. What frightens us as humans are the deep, primal things that really good authors and filmmakers are able to tap into. If you have children, the thought of them being taken from you is horror. If you are a child, the thought of being abandoned, lost, or betrayed by those you trust is horror. The point of a good monster movie isn't the monster, but the humans - how they react to the monster, what the monster wants from them, how they conquer the monster (if they do). I guess if you go to a ""horror"" film expecting non-stop gushing and squirting blood or those pop-out moments that make you jump in your seat, you will always be disappointed by films that go a little deeper than those cheap tactics. I'm sorry to see poor ratings based on generic expectations of a genre that has (for the most part) surrendered to mindless formulas.",It

Movie started with a scene which terrified me to my very soul. I was actually afraid and that scene just raised my bar of expectations. What happened afterwards was clearly not what I expected. As the trailer suggests, it's about a town where children keep going missing from time to time. First half focuses on this very concept and a bunch of children (who call themselves losers) keep seeing this clown who tries to scare the hell out of them.Second half gets slower where Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his friends tried to find the missing kids. At the end of the second half, you might feel that a lot could have been done with the movie's ending but the directors/writers didn't try that hard. I kept loosing interest as the movie reaches the last 20 minutes.It's not like one of those traditional horror movies which relates to ghosts or super-natural powers. Though I loved the new concept, I still believe that movie is definitely not worth the hype that it is getting.As somebody in the reviews section said: ""IT truly is the scariest movie of all time...

At no point did I shush the speculative whispering behind me or throw my box of popcorn over the squad to me left (apparently they got a lot of the film's humour I kept missing As teenager of the 80's I loved Stephen King although IT was never a particular fave. The book felt like Stand By Me with a killer clown and got very dodgy near the end. I've tried twice to make it through the mini-series, both when it came out and recently to no avail. I think the problem is clowns don't scare me. That aside I love a good horror film and the trailer for IT 2017 sold me. Don't watch the trailer though, just get along and see IT.If you enjoyed the book, you'll love IT. If you haven't viewed the trailer, you'll love IT even more as the movie's most effective sequence is somewhat spoiled by the trailer, shame too as it's truly a frighting thrill ride moment of the film that like a roller coaster, leaves you out of breath and clapping at the end.My only gripe with the film is it lacks patience and strives to key up feelings of terror too soon by way of every sound/trailer trope in the book: WHHHoooosh...booom. screeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH *sudden silence* BBBBBOOOOOMMM THUMP... They even used the 'ringing ears/everything sounds muffled for 10 seconds' bit usually reserved for war movies. Meanwhile on screen, nothing is really happening yet but oh boy, the soundtrack is almost unrelenting. I felt like screaming ""Okay, I get it!

The acting and location are good, but what isn't good follows.I read the book and must've skipped a lot of it, which is usually the case when King spends countless pages reliving his youth and boring the reader to death. The movie follows the book, except for the kiddie porn scene at the end of the book and hairy spider. After a terrifying opening in the book, I threw the book across the room from the lame ending. The movie ending isn't much better, nor is the rest of the movie.The movie isn't scary one bit. It contains trailer trash parents, incest, overtones of pedophilia, the kids use the EF word every other word, and the personification of King as the kid with glasses and stupendous package made me laugh out loud. Bad language doesn't bother me, but these actors are kids and the potty humor grew old fast, and honestly watching 11 year olds talk about sex and be molested isn't entertainment.WANT A REALLY GOOD HORROR FLICK?

1380,luttrellhenshawsam,Fantastic! Horror movies are finally starting to get good again,9,18 October 2017,"Horror movies this decade have been rather mediocre and unoriginal. Even good horror films are, most of the time, still quite forgettable. 2017, however, is proving to be an excellent year for horror. With Get Out receiving a 10/10 in my previous review.Now here's a film that I've been excited for since I first heard of it. Despite the fact that I've never read the book (though I certainly will at some point) this film was simply amazing and covers everything I love about horror movies.Personally, I don't consider the original It movie to be any good. Just average. Pennywise was fun, but more comedic than scary, and the writing, acting and particularly the effects were not very good. I give the original It a 5/10.Luckily, however, this film SIGNIFICANTLY improved upon the original film. Like Get Out, it was a perfect balance of comedy and horror. All of the characters were not only likable and interesting, but relatable. You might not think that children swearing and telling rude jokes would be a good idea, but it worked. The bullies also had interesting backstories, even though they were completely PSYCHOTIC.Pennywise was as scary as ever and the filmmakers were not afraid to be as gruesome and horrific as possible, especially with Georgie's death at the beginning and the reencounter at the end. I was creeped out the whole time and afterwards as well. He has the blend of a sweet, childish, yet creepy voice to a raging killer that is just pure evil every sense.I adored this movie, but it's one that I encourage people to see themselves. There's not much else to say, apart from the fact that it truly is a horror masterpiece: creepy, fun, incredible. Go see it! While I don't consider it 10/10 worthy, it is most certainly the next best thing. A 9/10 is all you need to tell that you are going to see an amazing movie.",It

I'm not a horror film aficionado; slasher and saw movies don't pique my interest, but the original It novel was an important entree in my youth, and the TV screenplay adaptation was weak sauce. TV censors would never have allowed the novel's horror to come through; nor would they have allowed the important youthful love and bonding of the novel to come through as written by King, ergo, the screenwriter just left it out.Bill Skarsgård is excellent. What Pennywise delivers to the characters and we the viewers is nothing short of terror. Makeup and CGI contribute, true, but it is Skarsgård who delivers the real deal, with his facial and vocal presentation.This story is in part, a coming-of-age tale, the juxtaposition of a child's ability to see and combat evil, and an adult's compromising weakness when faced with the same thing. When published in 1987, there was a coming-of-age portion of the novel that was clearly not acceptable in 2017 morality. SPOILER> In the 1990 miniseries, this concept was merely left out, obviously NSFW, and thereby failed to integrate the coming-of-age idea with the two story lines. In the 2017 movie, the screenwriter does a simply phenomenal job of capturing the concept in a way which does not offend modern sensibilities. None will be disappointed.",It

His voice alone made the clown creepy as hell. I went to see the remake and as soon as the clown opened his mouth I put my head in my hands and was like are you serious. This actor actually tried to sound like Tim Curry instead of making ""IT"" his own. He came across sounding like he had a mental disability. At this point in the movie, which was pretty much the beginning, I knew it was going to be bad! It's like when they made a nightmare on elm st. without using Robert Englund. That guy is Freddy Krueger ! When you think of Freddy you see his face and hear his voice.Maybe I'm completely desensitized but it was not scary at all. There was way too much CGI which I hate. I think it's better to not use it so much which is what made the first one so great. If you watch something like Demon Knight or the Descent and then watch this you'll see the difference. There was one part where the clown says beep beep Richie. Now in the original there was a reason for it. Richie's friends would say that when they wanted him to stop joking around. In the remake his friends never say that to him so it doesn't make sense for the clown to say it at all. I really think they should have made a sequel as opposed to a remake. Don't remake something if you can't make it better than the originalLong story short, it was thrown together and they could have done a way better job. I have no idea why it's getting such high ratings.. I think the reason I don't like it is because I've seen the original way too many times and went in there with high expectation : ( Now a friend of mine offered to take me to see it again for FREE because they didn't see it. I said absolutely not. I'm not wasting another 2 hours of my life.",It
1386,vichextall,Not bad,7,1 November 2017,"A good attempt at a remake. Not creepy enough really, too many jump scares attempted and the clown ""wobbling"" up to the camera wasn't great; it felt a bit cheesy. I think the clown showed too much of himself too early on.A lot of good stuff though, worth watching.",It
1387,martys-86448,"Horror Movie, but not IT",3,15 September 2017,"I have had high hopes for this film for several years now. When I first read that it was being remade again I thought, ""Finally!!! A new version of IT that will have to be better than that '90's TV debauchery with John Boy starring as Bill Denbrough."" Now I will give Tim Curry HIGH praise for his performance in the TV miniseries version. Frankenfurter really nailed Pennywise perfectly. Also, the child actors in the TV version were fairly competent as well, and pretty much carried the movie, however, the adult, TV, so-called actors were abysmal at best. It was like; all the way through the movie I kept waiting for Richard Thomas to say, ""Good night Maryellen, Good night Mama. . . "" and then have Pennywise pop up and scream, ""OH ROCKY!!!"" The TV version has been tolerable to IT fans for many years because it has been all that there was. Finally, there was going to be a, much anticipated, and much desired, new feature film version.The Steven King book, ""IT"" is an extremely well thought out, well developed, touching, tear jerking, interesting, scary, supernatural, epic of the lives of the seven losers in the story. It is probably tied with ""11-22-63,"" and, ""The Stand"" as the best books he has ever written. (Also give honorable mention to ""Dr. Sleep."" It is incredible!) The reason that fantastic works of written fiction endure, and are still read many years later is simple; THEY""RE GOOD!!! That is the reason that they still want to make movies from the books. That is the reason that they still sell copies of it in the book stores, and have new dramatized audio book versions released. If only someone could do a movie and follow the book a bit more closely, then the movie would also be just as fantastic.With all of this said, The 2017 Version of IT is fair at best. It seemed to me that they made a list of all the events that occurred in the children's lives in the book, Then moved it forward 27 years from the book, then kept those basic ideas and forgot about everything in the book and started a new story kinda sorta loosely biased on the book, then changed everything again to achieve a shallower, disjointed, CGI laden, jump-scare movie, about on par with some of the other mediocre horror movies that pop up every 15 minutes or so these days. They totally changed many of the characters into more stereotypical cookie cutter personas, and either changed, forgot, or ignored the significance of the characters to the story line. They also combined, cluttered, or ignored many of the significant points in the story line that were crucial to the plot, or development, or the reason the kids would ever embark on such an undertaking. So many details were left out or glossed over that were essential to the development of the story as a whole. If they had called the movie, ""The Derry School Kids and the Killer Clown,"" that would have been fine. It would have been a more accurate title for what the movie actually is, and I would probably give it a better review now. BUT, if you are going to take an epic work like IT and put that same title on a movie, and purport to have the movie be based on the book, you'd better make sure you live up to the story.If you have never read the book, ""IT,"" then this will be a fairly middle of the road decent horror movie. If you HAVE read the book, then I can only say that the only thing the movie shares with the book is the TITLE.",It
1388,jonwake-22302,"Well-made adaptation, a fun horror film with good character development.",8,12 September 2017,"It is a really good adaption of the book (minus the orgy thing of course). However, what a lot of reviewers seems to misunderstand, is that this isn't a horror movie as we've come to know them in recent years. It's not Saw or Insidious. It's not designed to keep you afraid and disturbed for the entire run time. This is a monster movie...It's a coming-of-age thriller with supernatural elements, like Goonies and Poltergeist combined. The purpose of the scares isn't to scare you, but to cater to the fears of each individual kid in the losers club. I know people complain that it's not scary, Babadook wasn't scary and had a good story, also It follows, etcWith that being said, there are some genuinely unnerving scenes in the movie, but it has it's focus on the characters themselves, where the focus should be, In similarity to The Babadook, where the focus is on the distressed mother and her troubled son.As for Pennywise, it's hard to compare Curry and Skarsgaard, as they depict two wildly different variants of the infamous clown. Curry was the creepy child molester (keep in mind he based it on a serial killer) type and Skarsgaard is just plain frightening.The kids are easily the part in this movie they show drama, comedy, and some heart warming moments. Capturing a similar style to classic 80s adventure that we hold dear, that being this isn't a stranger things rip off, Stranger Things came in 2016, the It book came in 1986...The movie has great cinematography and a good flow line of time, as well as great dialogue and acting. The one thing that may be slightly annoying for some, is that some of the scene to scene scares, doesn't always seem to stick with the kids.",It
1389,EvP304,Goosebumps,7,30 August 2018,"STORY: 7 Predictable, yet Foundational.
The story is predictable. Pennywise comes, terrorizes the kids, takes one hostage, the rest have to save her and ""kill"" or ""banish"" Pennywise. It's a story that many predicted, including myself. But I still invested in it, there is no doubt about that. It unraveled each child's greatest fear well and in proper increasing horror. It was the classic IT that we know and love, but brought to more life and a realistic approach.VISUALS: 7 Pennywise stole the Show.
There is no doubt, visually, that most of the makeup crew were put directly on Bill Skarsgård. Pennywise is the backbone of this film, and they needed his transformation to be seamless and clean. The CGI was subpar at some parts, especially when Stanley Uris' greatest fear personified out of the painting. The worst was when Pennywise came out the projector screen as a giant version of himself, man that was bad. The rest of the makeup seemed rushed, especially Eddie Kaspbrak's fear in the zombie being. Pennywise was impressive though, I liked his transformation to the screen. It was scary, it was something haunting. SOUND: 7 Build the moment.
I love horror thrillers that create suspense with an eery toned soundtrack. IT definitely brought that. With a basis of piano and stringed instruments playing a big role in the more innocent and slow-moving scenes, the larger scenes contained blasts of trumpets and flutes with hints of kid's toys layered at certain places. The places in the soundtrack that really did it for me, was the incorporation of voices in the music itself. Mostly children, you hear them singing songs and saying phrases that only add to the creepiness that this movie brings. It sets the scene for what this movie is all about, children. It takes turns going from happy to frightening, but continually keeps that eery feel in the back. It never goes away, just like Pennywise never leaves you alone. CHARACTER: 5 Lacking development.
I watch movies hoping to engage fully. I want to feel like I am there with the characters and they are people I feel like I have known for my whole life. This movie lacked in doing that for me. I felt empathy for some of the characters, primarily Bill, solely for the reason that he lost his brother Georgie. It was an empathetic device used in the movie to create that connection with the characters. But, that was where it came to a hurtling stop. I felt almost no other connection to the other members of the Losers Club. The humor that Eddie brought, and the remarks made by characters such as Richie made me recall times with my friends where we acted so similar to them. But I didn't get a lot of the backstory of the characters, better yet who they are as a person. I feel that the biggest problem that brought this disconnection with the characters was the packed story. There was so much they had set out to accomplish in a span of less than 2 hours. Pennywise's character should have been approached with more of a backstory, I think. Why does he do this? Where was he created? That sort of thing. But that might not have been what the director wanted, and I can respect that. Not knowing a lot about Pennywise in particular does bring an unsettling nature to the character. Overall, not great but enough.ENJOYMENT: 6 Goosebumps.
It was creepy. Not super scary. The narrative aspect helped with that part of the movie. I didn't get jumped scared at all, but the creepiness still stuck with me after the film. I enjoyed it, especially the fact that it was a horror movie but still had a concrete story. Bill Skarsgård did a fantastic job as Pennywise. He was the scariest part of this movie, and every little mannerism looked on point at all times. This is my perfect horror movie, along with another narrative horror The Quiet Place. Gave me goosebumps, which is what I was looking for going into this movie.",It
1390,labbe-35319,Painfully boring,2,16 September 2017,"Oh my god I was so bored, I would've walked out if I was alone. I think the biggest problem was that I just did not care about the characters at all. It makes me appreciate feeling so bad for the main character in Mother! Movies that make you feel bad are good in that way. I just could not bring myself to care about the characters. Their slow-scene dialogue was cringeworthy, often didn't sound natural. The scares were decent. I certainly appreciate the movie not being made up of 100% jumpscares, but again, just decent, and the impact was lessened by the strange artistic choice of pacing - cut from dark creepy scare to bright sunny calm scene. The combination of all of this left me very restless in my seat. Like The Witch, it feels a lot longer than it is. Towards what i thought was the end of the runtime I said ""I'm surprised they're not gonna wrap this up"" but I was surprised to see it was only 90 minutes in. I suppose it's a dense movie, they pack a lot in - not that that's a bad thing, but the content doesn't inspire any emotions other than restlessness, impatience. If you feel you must experience it, go alone so you have the option of walking out.",It
1391,jackbmeyer,A Solid Horror Film Devalued by Jump Scares,7,14 September 2017,"It is a solid piece of horror fiction that does justice to its source as well as its 1990 counterpart. As in many Stephen King stories, the location of small town New England provides a perfect setting for what is an atmospheric and engaging horror film. The characters match the settings and the actors do a good job blending with the aesthetic of their surroundings as well as providing charm and charisma. The plot was engaging and the much anticipated Pennywise played by Bill Skaarsgard is a compelling antagonist, however the one way in which the film fell short was its cheap over use of jump scares. Throughout the film jump scares are scattered, starting off startling but by the end just annoying. Rather than building constant tension and stakes through the story, the constant jack in the box nature of Pennywise's appearances create a detachment in the otherwise smooth flow of the film.",It
1392,conceitedkidss,Blew my mind,8,6 September 2017,"I am not really a fan of horror movies but I was really excited about IT because of Bill Skarsgård. I've been a fan of his since Hemlock Grove. And boy, am I glad I went to see IT. It's not a typical horror movie, it has some hilarious parts and those parts make you forget for a moment that you're watching a film about a crazy killer clown trying to eat kids. But just as you forget, something happens and scares the life out of you. Bill was just creepy enough. The voice, the laugh and the fact he made it seem as if Pennywise was constantly having so much fun playing with his meal. 10/10 would recommend. It's more than a horror movie, it's a brilliantly told story.",It
1393,liam_glass,We all float,7,15 May 2019,"Re watching the movie after reading a majority of the book I have to say I rather enjoyed this film, compared to its previous TV 2 part mini movie. The film is within it's right to be it's own thing or different, whilst also paying homage to the book.Characters are played very well some have their character over played to their description in the book but yet that can be brushed off. The late 80s vibes to the film is nostalgic and yet it also feels modern.
The acting and effects that go into Bill's pennywise is phenomenal and extremely entertaining.Some effects are choppy and some main/important points from the book are missing along the film.
Yeah the film has its flaws and weak points and may too feel rushed but it works, not all films or moments will scare you and that's just you but this film needs to people to move on from the 1990s film and understand that not all films which is 100% true to the original source material will work or is best.
Cant wait for chapter 2.",It
1394,mikelovell,An Imperfect Circus,6,26 September 2017,"IT, is a meaty book with no pun intended. There are lots of chapters, sub-plots, back stories and seemingly unrelated pieces of information that the reader has to absorb during their journey - so much so, that it requires multiple reads to really get to grips with all its nuances and clever sleight-of-hands.IT, the movie, is a perfectly well manufactured, formulated attempt at emulating a story that - if I'm completely honest - never really lent itself to the big screen (or the little one for that matter) and here's why I think that is.The story itself is far too rich and layered to be condensed into a film with a run time of 2 hours something. Paradoxically, it's too direct and concise to be elongated into a series of films. The net result is a standalone that, even if you've read the book, won't answer any of the questions you're likely to have as the credits roll - so here are a number of things that I think would have helped its cause.Firstly, this film shouldn't have been given a 15 cert. With the exception of a couple of scenes it could have been passed as a 12A, opening it up to a younger audience who I think would enjoy this movie a great deal, in the same way that Stranger Things has managed to appeal - but unfortunately, the producers and accountants have sat on the fence with this; choosing to market IT to an older audience for fear of softening the reputation of the book and therefore putting 'grown-ups' off altogether.Secondly, the cap-tipping to projects such as Stranger Things and The Goonies is all too obvious to see here. It could be argued that this version wouldn't have even been made without the inspiration of the aforementioned, but that didn't give the creators licence to plagiarise in such an overt fashion - and sadly, that's exactly what has happened. While the whole 80's renaissance is welcome, the approach taken here now looks hackneyed in comparison.That said, it's not a BAD movie - it's just a movie you've seen before. The jumps are where the jumps should be, the screams are where the screams should be. It attempts to please all the people, all the time; and as such it's not a GREAT movie. The Goonies was a GREAT movie, Stranger Things is a GREAT series; IT is still waiting to be adapted in a way that really resonates with the book; this version however, doesn't do that despite I'm sure, the sincerest of efforts. There will be a sequel; or perhaps a set of sequels - whether or not they're needed, remains to be seen.6.3/10.",It

It really felt like cheap and intimidatingly boring movie that can not be compared to any good horror film. Me and my group of friends were really close to actually leaving the room, there was constant laugh about the predictability and cliché moments. The whole time was happening so much but still nothing actually happened. And I wouldn't call it scary but disgusting. There was no actual built tension but just one big WTF. The kids were fun at some moments of the movie, and the story definitely has a good ground but it was terribly adapted into the movie.

There are so many layers in this movie, so many nods and references aimed at the readers. At the same time, a person who has not read the book, will get so much more than a simple horror movie. This movie succeeds at getting so many genres enveloped in each other, with horror being the overarching genre. As a grown up person, I found it to actually be scary and unpredictable. Furthermore, this movie has so many unique and memorable scenes that will simply stay in your memory for a long time after watching it. Definitely the best movie of 2017.",It

Part 1 of IT the remake is only covering half the original book like original mini-series but this film in comparison to the first part of the mini series is much closer and conveys more of the character development and background that the mini-series missed. Although there may be some artistic licence employed throughout transposing book to motion picture I believe this film shits all over the mini-series and is a homage and tribute to what is an incredible horror story still thrilling readers today (i know this is a remake and it inspired me to read the book and watch original mini-series and its the first book in my life to make me check my plug hole in the sink at night and think twice before spending time with clowns.P.S No offence to Tim Curry as Pennywise in the original you set the bar but new film is the one ;-),It

King stories are about friendship and basic humanity against the odds whether it be against shape shifting monsters in the drains eating kids or against world wiping plagues or ghosts he is a storyteller that sets the bar and hollywood realises this as he will be living off royalties from their remakes for the rest of his life.

Considering I love Stephen King, and how the book gave me nightmares every time I read it, I had very high expectations for this movie. Also, the Tim Curry version scared the crap out of me as a kid, so I could only imagine how scary the new adaptation would be. However, halfway through the movie, sitting in the theater, I couldn't think of anything else except how I wasted $10 on this movie. It wasn't absolutely terrible, being that the kid actors were the most redeeming quality. I was never once scared and found this movie more funny than anything. The number one reason though, that I didn't like it, was the CGI they used for EVERYTHING. I couldn't even be scared because I was laughing at how fake the ""scary"" parts were.

1403,mistermoviereview,It (2017) - Mister Movie,8,15 September 2017,"When a movie is hyped up this much the first question after a viewing is whether it will merit all the attention it earned.The movie is definitely a blast from start to finish and while it was marketed, and looked like, as what would be one of the scariest movies in recent years, it was a lot more fun than terrorizing. This is in no way a flaw in the film as it is quite clear that the movie makers didn't intent for the viewers to just be scared silly but rather offer us a picture with meaning and depth.This is also not to say that the movie didn't have shocks or pure creepiness, it was filled with them, but after the hype around the film and Pennywise (Skarsgård) specifically, you welcome the scary stuff with open arms as you find yourself greatly entertained by the dancing clown and all his other personas (forms). Having said that, the movie does dive into other troubling and distressing situations, sometimes not related to Pennywise and his doing, and those are the situations that are truly scary.Additionally, the Losers Club does a fine job with great chemistry among them and banter that provides a number of unexpected laughs, sometimes in the most unexpected moments. While most of the praise is justifiably aimed towards the group of unlikely protagonists and their attempt to band together and fight the evil taking over their town, it is also Skarsgård who deserves just as much praise as the evil, twisted, balloon loving clown, who really just wants you to float with him.To end this review, the film is a fun ride from start to finish. The Losers Club is great, the clown just as much, and a 'It' is filled with enough creepy stuff to keep you locked in, though rather than make you shake your boots, you instead find yourself enjoying the repeated times Pennywise jumps on screen.Rating: Medium WellMister Movie",It

I felt super conflicted with this movie because the acting was amazing by the entire cast, however there was way too much 'comic relief'. This is a horror movie. I wanted to feel terrified because I was stuck in terror just about the whole movie. I should have left the theater sore because of being too tense. This did not happen at all. There was only one scene in the entire movie that felt like this and it was the bathroom scene with Beverly. That was literally it (no pun intended). The clown was so cliché when it comes to cheap horror movie antics of the 2,000's. It has the retractable teeth like every new zombie movie since the Umbrella Corporation and It moves all jumpy like every ghost movie that has been out since The Ring. Absolutely NOTHING scary about the clown. If Tim Curry weren't in a wheel chair I would have rather had him come back and take the place of Penny Wise without ANY CGI. All of the CGI made this movie pure CRAP. The script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushed through the works entirely too fast. Each kids fear was super cheesy and AGAIN, nothing but CGI on the tackiest scale they could have ever done. It felt like this movie had SO much potential but it was all thrown away because they were too afraid to make it 'actually scary'.

Their acting is worse than the 1990 mini-series. The plot, which is never fleshed out thanks to being based on America's worst living author, is a mix of disjointed fears brought to life with the most fake blood ever used in a movie. I swear the ketchup my brother and I used when trying to shock mom was more realistic. The cinematography was awful as the lenses used and lighting were sophomoric at best. The CGI used was nothing great and was merely on the level of John Carpenter's The Thing from the early eighties. The Pennywise actor did his best Tim Curry impersonation but missed it by a few very large shoes to fill.

The original costuming and other visual bits released to tease had me convinced that this film would be nothing short of spectacular. I don't think I've ever been so wrong.The child cast is wonderful. They're splendid actors who take to their roles as if they born for them. The story, familiar to all those who braved the original, runs just about the same course as it did in the original series (straying from the book in the areas you know where too taboo to be addressed). No complaint there.The violence, broadcast in tenuous CGI, isn't alarming in the sense the film-makers intended. It's alarming that the original, showing much much less and leaving more to our imaginations, accomplished far greater scares. The bloodiest bits look more like a made-for-TV effect reel than a major release. Pennywise, the titular being meant to make clowns scary for not just those with coulrophobia, comes off like a dime store version of Tim Curry's rendition. Oafish and at many times grossly and strangely over-acted, I found myself shaking my head in disdain more than fear. It gets so bad at points that I found myself wondering if I should even finish the film.Overall, I'm greatly disappointed.",It
1409,fgagnerot,Too many jump-scares kill the jump-scare,5,25 September 2017,"Well, watching this movie reminded me of two things: - first, I will never ever go again to the movie theater to watch a horror/thriller movie. The crowd is generally bad (I agree it may depend on the location), very noisy and ruins entirely the experience. Word of advice: if you want to experience immersive fear, stay home and watch it there. - second, new does not mean better. The movie is almost entirely composed of jump-scares, some more efficient than others. The heavily creepy atmosphere from the old 1990 movie and from the books has sadly been obliterated to favor cheap thrills every minute; the annoying and omnipresent jokes of the kids kill all attempts to set up a dark and oppressing environment. With the presence of Richie (Finn Wolfhard), we get the ""Stranger Things"" feeling of kids versus the unknown and the movie is precisely that: a kid movie versus an evil villain. Not a horror movie with an unspoken and unnamed abomination that feeds of your fear, eat children, get into your nightmares and is virtually immortal. From the second half of the movie, no one on screen is really scared and I heard move laughter in the theater than I heard screams. SPOILER: the final scene with the kiss achieve to ruin everything: it is not needed, bring an element of romance that breaks even further the horror part of the movie. Also, FYI: in the books, to get out of the sewers, Beverly has sex with all the other boys for them to overcome their fears and find their way out (yes, it is really written in the books). This is obviously difficult to broadcast that but still: we are far away from the kiss to the hero last scene (I honestly do not remember if that kiss is written in the books but still, of all passages to keep, this one could have been replaced easily). The very clown does not stand the comparison with the old one. It looks evil all right but precisely the fear from the clown comes from the fact that it looks initially normal, not Satan's spawn at first sight. I missed the utterly, profoundly disturbing feeling of the original. In a nutshell, I would not say it was a boring movie but definitely not the best I have seen, definitely not up to the old movie and to the books.",It
1410,vinjsaciolo,This is how a novel-to-film adaptation should be.,8,2 October 2017,"Before I begin, I would like to state that the book is a masterpiece in nearly every sense. As disappointing as it was to not see certain aspects from the novel such as the Smoke Hole and Mike's bird at the Ironworks, and so on, I have for the most part come to terms with the fact that some things just cannot be translated well into film. I understand that adaptations and changes must be made in order to make a film work with a general audience. Because of this, I will choose not to complain about things absent in the movie. With that in mind, I believe the movie works very well. The acting is obviously superb with amazing performances all around. Personally, I believe it far surpasses the original in everything but corniness. I saw the original 1990 ""It"" when I was young, and never once was I intimidated or frightened, or even impressed. Some people say this version relies too heavily on ""jumpscares"", but I disagree. A cheap jumpscare would be when there isn't a buildup. An obvious setup for a jumpscare is often seen as cheap and predictable, but then these same people would complain about a jumpscare with no buildup. I did not think any of the jumpscares felt forced or cheap. Another major complaint from most people is the CGI, and while I can't argue with anyone about how much CGI can ruin an experience for them, but expecting practical effects in movies nowadays just seems futile to me. I've accepted CGI at this point, and it never really took me out of the film, but I can definitely see that it could be an issue to some. But overall the characters were likable and funny, the plot worked, and I went out of the movie happily anticipating a sequel.",It
1411,sojofranklin,An excellent film that combines comedy with terror in a very effective way.,10,26 September 2017,"A movie full of creativity on the part of its director as part of the cast, very good scenes, the scene of the house where Pennywise comes out of the fridge in front of Eddie is one of the best for me. very poignant moments, this film never distances itself from the drama that reaches you right in the heart, something that I liked very much in this film. The bad reviews they make towards the movie really do not understand them. If any doubt the movie exceeded my expectations.",It
1412,lbrah88709,You almost feel bad it's marketed as a horror movie!,10,15 October 2017,"Oh my God a horror movie with a good/great/awesome story!Disclaimer: I didn't read IT which means that as I proceed with professionally criticizing some plot holes I'll have no idea whether it's Stephen or Andy who screwed it up (that's just because I know there are some experts on the book (who never read it anyway) and I'm sure they won't like me hate on the story given the fact I didn't read the book). Let's start with an obvious statement that going to the theater I had absolutely no idea what IT would be which allowed me to enjoy IT without having a list of strict rules how IT had to be like in order for me to like IT. The opening scene was scary and by scary I don't mean a high decibel jump-scare or synonym for ""gross"". It's scary on an emotional level - we're introduced Bill and Georgie, the two happy brothers. Then all of a sudden we are ""unintroduced"" Georgie and reintroduced Bill who's not happy anymore. What an introduction! After that, we get to know a few other troubled kids who then all become part of The Losers' Club. Now although I'd absolutely love to tell you something cool about each of them, I'm not going to be able to do that since I only got like 750 words to go so I gotta be careful (and I'm afraid I forgot some of their names too huh..). What follows next is a really impressive loop of ""(making friends, bonding)/friendly/funny"", ""(investigating, learning more about Pennywise's wrath)/thrilling"", and ""(boo boo, I'll make you jump)/scary"" scenes up until the finale. which is not that impressive. I mean compared to all other horror movie finales it's still a terrific one no doubt about that. But relative to the movie it sucks. IT starts as a heck of a scary/thrilling/touching movie by brutally killing off an 8-year-old boy (on camera!!!) and it ends with a ridiculous fight that could easily be found in a comedy/parody. Don't get me wrong, the moment when Bill found Georgie's raincoat DID make me feel sad but it could've been much more than that had there been a proper setup. Finally I've been saving the part where I specifically talk about Skarsgard's Pennywise for the very end of my review cause I bet 80% of you are only here to read yet another person saying how out of this world his performance was and I wanted you to read the rest of my awkward impressions on IT as well. Bill Skarsgard did a really great job - I agree (shame he was only there for like 10% of the run-time :(). He is the reason why IT was so great - I disagree - he is one of the reasons why IT was so great but not necessarily the main one. He is really scary as Pennywise - I disagree (but I'm not afraid of clowns so this one doesn't count (actually you could say this whole review doesn't count but whatever)) - I sometimes found him to be funny (but isn't that something clowns should be? Even scary ones?).IT is marketed as a horror movie. That's fairly surprising given the fact that they often follow this exact formula: ""Here you got a bunch of uninteresting characters you won't give a crap about. Here you got a ridiculous ghost/demon/entity that's supposed to be scary. Every now and then it's gonna give your ears a jump-scare. During the movie, the retarded characters you don't give a crap about are unsuccessfully trying to say a line that'd make at least a tiny amount of sense. At the end most/all of them die which is supposed to make you feel scared/bad/sad/emotional but you still don't give a crap."" What's interesting is that this movie does not and you almost feel bad it's marketed as a horror movie. Acting - The Losers' Club - ROCKS (yeah and there's also a scene with rocks), Pennywise - playn' wise, the rest is above average. Writing - There are some memorable lines (which you'll remember) and some very not memorable lines (which you'll also remember because of how not memorable they are). Overall, what the characters say and how they s-s-say it m-m-makes s-s-sense, some moments will break your heart, some will make your stomach hurt from laughing. Soundtrack - captures emotions (I mean most of the horror movie soundtracks often capture that very rigid ""I want my ears back"" emotion - fortunately, it's not the case here). Benjamin Wallfisch is a Ballsy Outstanding Score Supercomposer!!! On top of it all let's see how I'd answer these questions:Did I like IT? --- No! I loved it!!! Why did I love IT? --- Take your average horror movie, remove from it everything that it does bad (pretty much everything!) and replace it with a bunch of terrific actors, great story, sympathetic characters, bad-ass villain and an above average finale and you got all the reasons together. Is there anything I didn't like about the movie? --- More ""hahahaha"" scenes than ""sniff sniff"" scenes especially toward the end when it was not exactly appreciated (at least not by me I'm a much better ""sniff sniff""er than ""hahaha""er) Would I watch it again? --- I already did. And yes! IT has a good point, a good story-line, a love triangle, and a rectangle that looks more like a circle (shapes are cool aren't they?).",It

The clown appears far less than he does in the original, and when he does, it's like he's not even trying to be either scary or morbidly humorous. It's mostly CGI that is relied upon.Outside of the horror aspect, it's nothing more than your standard Hollywood propaganda about white people.

It 's mix of adventure, comedy and horror. I like the environment in which it is placed. Small city in late 1980s. Also characters are well played and built. Its 1988. Bill Denbrough is sick at home. But his younger brother (Georgie) wants to play outside even though its raining. Bill makes a paper boat for his little brother. He will go outside, but never return home. The main story starts a year after Georgie disappeared. Bill and his friends will soon find out that Georgie was not the only missing child.I like this movie. It was surprisingly funny and surprisingly Scary. There is also a bit of romance, that didn't screw up the movie. Characters is what make this movie so good. Each one has a story which is slowly coming to us. Also everyone has his own fears. At the end everyone will stand against his own. It's a Boyhood story with R-rating. It doesn't need a night to induce the Horror atmosphere, and when it gets dark, it's even better.For me it's 8/10. I think it's good movie, no matter the mood you're in.",It

Same with Mike, he didn't have many lines and was only important for pushing Henry down the well, but other than that I loved the movie. The scene where the kids are floating looked pretty good.

this movie would only be entertaining and amazing if seen in a cinema
watch this movie alone on your laptop or television you will be disappointed 
overhyped movie not realistic in the slightest
 at least stranger things even though obviously fake makes you feel its real 
the acting mehhh the characters had no development barely any dialogue other than talking about this clown 
i only laughed once and i don't even remember what it was
stranger things has funnier jokes
end of story if you want to watch an actual good thriller just watch stranger things its far better
however what I will say is that at least this so called ""horror"" film is original 
This film didn't scare me at all and I'm the scariest person 
but also i knew i wouldn't be scared because i don't find clowns scary
anyone who thinks this movie is scary is a child
This movie did keep my attention but only because i was desperately waiting for something to unravel I thought the plot would be much more developed 
Nothing made sense like why would this clown feed off fear? Where did he come from? Why this town? Why did the parents and adults of this town not seem to be too involved/worried or concerned with all the missing kids? literally this movie is just the kids?

And to get things straight, I don't usually care about changes a lot of movies make from book to movie. Everyone else was complaining about the changes in Pet Sematary, but I thought they were refreshing, and I understood why they made those changes. And in IT, I understood some of the changes, like the Turtle, the Spider, and Chud, because that would make the movie TOO weird. It was just the little things, like Mike's bird, the clubhouse, Hi-yo Silver, away, the smokehouse, the mummy, everything with the standpipe, the photo album(s), and stuff like that. What makes IT an amazing book is not the horror aspect (even though that part was amazing too) but it was the times in between the horror where the character development took place and you got to know and love all of the characters. In this, I felt like I knew about 3 things about each of the characters, and that's about IT. I do want to say that I am pointing out negatives in this, but there were so many positives as well. Pennywise himself is amazing in this film, not to mention all the acting. It was a solid film (and I loved the homage to the turtle -- try to spot it when you watch the movie) and the only reason I didn't like it was because it didn't make me feel the love for the characters that it did in the book.

So i cant blame the miniseries to be dull because of all these restrictions.Talking about the actors (it 2017), they did great, I really have to appreciate Bill Skarsgard on acting as Pennywise, he was creepy and disturbing.If anyone asks a good movie to watch i would definitely recommend it.",It

I'm not scared of clowns so Pennywise seemed to more goofy to me. The kids all did a good job with their acting but with all the swearing and joking around with each other, there was just so much humour, it totally outweighed the scary parts. I didn't feel even a tingle of fear through whole movie, although Stan's creepy painting lady almost did it. To sum up, for me the movie was a collection of a hilarious moments with a some gross stuff to look at. And yes, I will watch the second one, probably for the same reasons I watched this one.

Whether it be the strong and admirable friendship between the Losers club that had be longing for a friend-group like this, or the detailed backstories of every character. Subtle hints of homosexuality between Richie and Eddie (balloons organised in triangles, though this theme was mainly explored in Chapter 2).
The chemistry between the seven main actors was clear to see as they so beautifully portrayed the seven best friends- I can do nothing but praise these talented kids.
After watching nine times through I can confidently say that in my eyes, IT is so much more than a movie about a killer clown, it explores an entire made-up town that somehow captivates and interests me and so many little stories of the destruction Pennywise has caused to so many people in Derry.
I have nothing but praise for my favourite film in the world !",It

I understand that that's the point-It's feeding off of childish fears-but they could have used that to their advantage instead of vouching for realism and failing.Nonetheless, I loved this movie. It's no Conjuring or even close to the Insidious franchise on scare factors. But the real thing that kept me watching was the character development and the acting.Acting in horror movies can be-um, cringy,(case 31, I'm looking at you) but this movie had so much emotional background and such talented child actors that ""It"" filled in all character plot holes that could have been there. As an author, this was thoroughly satisfying. I knew from the first scene with all of the kids that it was going to be an amazing movie.There were 3D characters and a surprisingly heartfelt theme. Pretty much ""loser kids beat bullies, face their fears, and save the world"". This was a unique look on horror, especially with the comedic underlay.

I even re-watched it with my wife to set up for this remake (maybe don't! Whilst it was useful to remind myself of the characters and story, the acting all round was awful and it hasn't stood the test of time well IMO).I did enjoy this movie, but it didn't blow me away as I had hoped.The good stuff; Pennywise was great. Fair play getting away from the more comedic original but without losing that eeriness. Loved the first scene.Bill and Bev I thought were excellent! Really, really well played. Bill was very genuine and relatable and had just the right balance of vulnerability yet toughness when it was called upon. Bev was perfect as the girl of their dreams with the complex home life. Eddie, Stanley and Ben pretty good in that order. Although for me Ben was just a little younger and softer than how I liked him in the original. I think they could have explored the backstory of Eddie's medical misuse more as I barely saw him have a wheeze on his inhaler until far into the film. I'd have liked him to have started much more as the sickly victim before breaking free from it.Finally I thought they navigated the hardest part well which was exposing IT as a bit more than a clown at the end, with out it coming off as ridiculous (that terrible spider in the original anyone!?).The not so good stuff.Richie. Clearly from the reviews I have read I am in the minority, but I didn't like him! Even weirder considering I loved the actor in stranger things. I thought he swore WAY too much, which just cheapened everything he said. He made jokes in really inappropriate places which made me question his actual basic morals (which you certainly don't do with the losers club).Mike. A total non event. In the original he was great, here, a total shadow. I kept looking at him and thinking 'you don't fit in at all' and he never did much apart from being pretty handy at the end. His backstory was not really explained at all unless I missed something. Even the rock throwing scene where they saved him and met him for the first time wasn't as powerful as the original.The group as a whole. Don't get me wrong, there was rapport between them, but I guess the issues I have with the 2/3 characters (if you include Ben) just spoiled it a bit for me.Lastly, I just didn't feel they acted scared enough when being exposed to some horrendous visions. Bev certainly did during the sink blood scene, and Stanley with that weird picture lady, but with a few other scenes (Ben in the library) I just didn't buy it. I'd have literally been weeping as I ran and a quivering wreck! Maybe it's the limitation of child actors and I'm expecting too much?

2. When kids don't act like kids, it's stupid.
3. doesn't even have a proper story-line -- loosely bound with a lot of no common sense stuff.Except for looking good with graphics, all the time we keep praying that there would be some thread that would tie all this nonsense together to make us feel better in the end -- but it's flat nonsense.
I'd personally prefer Jeepers Creepers over this, even the no graphic Conjuring 1 and 2 fare very well before this one. This over-hyped movie is a sheer disappointment.
It hurts even more to know that this is just 'Chapter 1' of the nonsense. If there are anymore sequels past this, it would most definitely be a cumulative garbage of sorts since the main story holds no foundation of any sorts.",It

The movie is also about 2 hours long and I found my interest dragging in-and-out. It was hard to keep entertained or enthralled.

He lives in the sewers, but that doesn't stop him from appearing in a slaughter house or out of a TV, just because it makes a good jump scare. He apparently feeds on people's fear, but that doesn't mean he can't bite your hand off if he is really hungry. All the kids are bullied, by older kids, by their parents, every-one of them has a bad-ass parent! The effects are cheesy, jump scares and blood are everywhere.

1472,Diego-Nash,"It, the success of marketing",8,25 October 2017,"Let's face the truth, It's a good product beyond the limits imposed by Warner most likely looking for a product with a certain impact on the audience but let's go calmly. The Denry by Andres Muschietti, able to alternate very intimate moments with functional Jump Scare, was designed and resumed by highlighting the point of view of the kids who are protagonists of this distressing story. The mastery of faded and dreary atmospheres, coordinated by a clean and rigorous direction, has allowed a very unreal and sometimes alienating realization of the town whose inhabitants seem distant and disinterested in the problem that infects Denry, or IT. This characterization allows the actors, sumptuous in this film, to express themselves in the best rivalry even in the excellence of a Bill Skarsgard that attracts towards the attentions of the whole audience. The developed stories are powerful and profound, as if they were torn from the ingenious mind of Stephen King and created a growing empathy towards the group of Boys (the Loser) who are dragged or dragged into a macabre and often disturbing adventure. Compared to the TV series of the 1990s, IT is much more active and effective, and it is appreciated, in fact, as it has underlined its danger, in addition to its great dowry of metamorphosis (which in the 1990s with that budget was certainly difficult to realize). If some stories of this adventure are developed a lot, and very well, others are simply sketched and left aside, as if they had forgotten about them. This lack of ""courage"" is also noticed in IT incursions and especially in the crudity of some of the factors closely related to the city and the racist story narrating in the book. This brings with it a slowing down of narrative time shortly after the first act that fortunately rises in the middle of the second to end in the third. I did not appreciate, however, the final part, where it seems that you wanted to put a ""Point"" without dragging too much. Final Summary IT is a valuable piece of work that staged one of the most beloved Horror films of such genres, surely becoming the second best film taken from a book by Stephen King after Shining. The film, however, is in some respects a lack of ""editorial courage"" that has not allowed the film to become an eternal masterpiece, waiting for the future to be trembling.",It

Now putting aside Stephen King's statement, I knew I needed to watch it for the stake of my obsession with watching ALL and ANY remakes, reboots and originals of movies and tv shows that I have watched.The remake on its own is a fine horror movie but agree with some it feels as though it is missing some heart and soul. There were some parts that felt empty and a little stupid. Others were very detailed and even a little heart wrenching. The biggest plot hole of the whole movie is, one, the kids wandering off way too much and at times that don't make sense.

Part I HATED: the zombies when Henry Bowers' buddy goes in the sewer looking for Ben because it just felt soo stupid.Overall, I have very strong feelings for this movie.

1477,simian26,A cliché-ridden torture of a movie,4,7 September 2017,"Warning: Personal opinion ahead. If you love this movie, good for you.I'm not sure if I was in a bad mood, or if I had too high of an expectation, but I utterly despised this movie. I should get this out of the way - I have not read the book, but even if I have, I would judge this movie purely on its own. Doesn't matter if it stuck closely to the source. Books and movies are very different medium. Hence, a carbon copy of the book doesn't guarantee a good movie.Credits where credits are due, the cinematography and production design were pretty impressive. The kids' performances were great too. Aside from those things though, I couldn't find much to praise about this movie. And the few good things about this movie were not nearly enough to save it.Also, there are far too many characters for us to get attached to in such a short amount of time. As a result, we don't care much about any of them. And for the same reason, any kind of character development felt unnatural and sudden. I'm aware of the moments of character development, but the movie's quick pacing doesn't allow the emotions of these moments to sink in. Instead, the movie opted for an overly obvious score that forced its audience to feel these emotions. As a human being, I'd much rather be able to feel these emotions myself, rather than being told to feel them.While I'm on the soundtrack, I can say the same for the ""horror"" portion of this movie. I had hoped this movie would scare us with an eerie and haunting atmosphere. Disappointingly, whenever a moment felt remotely eerie, it was interrupted by an annoyingly obvious soundtrack and a cheap jump scare that's as satisfying as finding out there will be a sequel to this movie. Many moments could have been excellent if there was no score at all, or if it was more subtle. Apart from the soundtrack, the sound effects were also very distracting. I understand that sound effects can help make the clown and other monsters feel more terrifying. But, I think it's just cheap and lazy to add low-pitched swooshing sound when we were first introduced to Beverly's father. Might as well turn it into a Kung-Fu movie while they were at it!Generally, I thought it was filled with clichés and cringe-worthy moments - things like the fat kid looking up crucial information in the library, the kids repeatedly splitting up after stressing the importance of staying together, the ""we don't fear you, you're the one who should fear us"" moment, the general lack of common sense we expect from horror movie characters, and beloved jump scares. Normally, in movies like these, we'd have to suspend disbelief, but in this movie, you'd have to suspend insanity. I find it very unlikely that some kids were capable of taking on a monster clown, if it was truly as powerful as we were told.Did I mention how cheesy the movie felt whenever the clown or other monsters came on screen, or how the action scenes were over-cut? If I thought the clown was terrifying, it was because of how painfully cheesy it was, and the immense agony I felt witnessing said cheesiness. If they cut out all action scenes, scenes with monsters, and scenes with the clown, and leave only the human scenes in the movie, we would have a movie that's at the very least good. Of course, it wouldn't be ""It"" then.There are a lot of simple and easily fixable issues that makes me angry about this movie. For instance, there was a scene when the kids were checking out their town's old map with a projector, before the clown started appearing on the image and climbed out of it. The projector's light coming on and off was a pretty interesting effect. Unfortunately, instead of holding each shot for a few seconds longer, creating a cool disorienting effect, the movie decided to cut it like a movie trailer, which was painful to watch!Then there was the final battle. I'd have given this movie an 8 or a 9 if the kids actually left Bill behind. Instead, one of them, whose name I can't recall, pretended he was really going to leave him, right before he picked up a baseball bat and hit the clown with it. And of course, the clown did not see that coming, because a supernatural, omniscient being like him is clueless when it comes to movie clichés. And guess what this scene reminded me of? It made me think of Suicide Squad's ending, which I believe was not intentional. Honestly though, I'm still angry that they all survive. This is as infuriating as seeing the human protagonists in Transformers 5 repeatedly surviving decidedly lethal falls.Don't even mention the ending scene. It would have been moving to see them hold hands in a circle if the movie gave us any reason to care so deeply about them. And moving it was, as it provided me a lot of motivation to write this review. This movie was 2 hours and 15 minutes long, but it felt like 3 hours long. I could be remembering something wrong because I had given up on the movie after the first hour. At that point, I was only enduring whatever insanity the movie decided to throw at us, and I stopped caring. The moment when the movie was trying to set up a sequel, was among the many moments when I visibly face-palmed and shook my head. I really thought this could have been a great movie.

1485,Boni-The-Sock,The Stephen King adaptation we were waiting for,10,7 September 2017,"It's been 23 years since we had - probably - the best adaptation based on Stephen King's work to date: The Shawshank Redemption. After so many failures like Dreamcatcher, Desperation and - sadly and more recently - The Dark Tower, we finally got IT!The adaptation of IT was surrounded by high expectations. That because Andy Muschietti - the director - showed through social media and interviews how much he loved and respected the source material. Pretty much like Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings (but not with The Hobbit), the argentine filmmaker directed and made this movie with LOVE. The result could not be any different: it's an outstanding interpretation.The movie has a few flaws. I wasn't very fond of the narrative at beginning. The movie shows the kids separated and being scared by IT in a series of scenes that have no bridges between them, there's not much plot until the path of the seven kids finally converge. Another point was the special effects, some were great, but some weren't, and that might harm some vital scenes. Finally, although not a problem (but it could have been a massive one) the director used too much humour. Don't get me wrong, Stephen King is a hilarious guy when he wants to be, but Andy was too dangerously close to turn this movie into an adventure-comedy-with- horror elements (like The Goonies and Monster Squad), instead of a coming-to-age-horror-story. Nonetheless, I feel like he averted that at last second. Finn Wolfhard as Richie is funny as hell and Jack Grazer as Eddie also delivers his share of hilarity.Speaking of the kids, I was impressed and couldn't believe how EACH ONE OF THEM is awesome. I'm not exaggerating, the seven kids are great actors. Kudos to Jaeden Lieberher as Bill and Sophia Lillis as Bev, who had the most dramatic arches of them all and did a wonderful job. It's a pleasure to see this gang together and how the chemistry flows naturally.Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is superb. We all have Tim Curry forever in our hearts, but Bill was capable of giving the Dancing Clown his own persona, and it's also great. You can clearly see that IT is having a hell of fun, but to the kids and the audience, there's nothing fun or funny about it, and that's what Pennywise is all about. The character was disgusting, horrendous and terrifying - like IT needs to be. I was so satisfied that Andy got IT's essence.Finally, I want to give congratulations to Andy himself. His love for the details was clear. Of course he couldn't adapt every single page of that behemoth of a book, and had to cut some really silly moments that only our dear Stephen King could give us (like killing the monster with a sling and the orgy scene - that no matter what King says to justify it, it will always be an unnecessary and disgusting part of the book to me). I loved the directing and the cinematography. To me the changes were great. Although I think that ACT I was too fast paced, ACT II and ACT III ran perfectly. This is the Stephen King adaptation that we have been waiting for since The Shawshank Redemption, guys, so don't waste any time and go see it on theaters - I somehow suspect that the movie may lose a part of its strength on DVD or Blu-Ray, so don't waste your chance!Special mention to Nicholas Hamilton as Henry Bowers. Great kid!Can't wait for Chapter Two - probably in 2019.",It

1487,benmccarthy1990,A Very Gratifying Horror Adventure,8,30 September 2017,"2017 has been an indifferent year for Stephen King. He's had to witness the creative and box office disappointment of franchise non-starter ""The Dark Tower"" but his books appear to be bouncing back – according to pre-release hype – with Netflix produced ""Gerald's Game"" and ""1922"". There wasn't a adaptation for the filmmakers and studio to get right that ITthis year. The novel, written in 1986, was adapted into a beloved TV miniseries in 1990, as the Loser's Club battling Tim Curry's imperious Pennywise. Nightmares of dancing clowns were forever singed into the minds of children and mimicked over the past 27 years.Could 2017 version of IT live up to the hype? With I.T. Trailer recording breaking YouTube views and brilliantly executed marketing campaign, the film was under the fans and critics microscope. According to the studio so far, the film has financially delivered on all fronts ($480 million worldwide and counting) and most importantly, IT has delivered creatively; it's a wonderful 1980s tribute carnival which believes characters, not set-pieces and scares, take centre stage. This is a very delicious horror adventure with a sense of real jeopardy. Using the Spielberg 1980s playbook, director Andy Muschietti and writers Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga & Gary Dauberman have done a effective job personifying the characteristics of the classic 1980s adventure story with the demands of modern horror; jump scares and individual set- pieces are vividly and ravishingly staged, despite becoming gradually less effective as we reach closer to the film's climax.IT has a lot fun with standard horror clichés and 1980s iconographies; Gremlins posters are on walls, cinemas are showing Lethal Weapon 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street, teenagers riding bicycles through streets and fields, swearing and throwing mindless insults (the chemistry between the cast is perfect), hanging out in natures surroundings and avoiding the local bullies at all costs. The actions made against the Loser's Club by the bullies is just as horrific as Pennywise manipulations.It's great to see a film embracing and going beyond its influences to have bravery and capacity uncover darker themes, amidst the crowd-pleasing spectacle. I was fascinated at how the filmmakers weren't afraid to dissect the loss of innocence between the Loser's Club. They want to preserve their naivety, they want to have a normal summer to act like kids, they want to believe Derry's missing children can and will come back to their families to continue to live a normal life; Pennywise is teaching them to live, but could he be teaching them how to die when they become adults?The actions of parents are not ignored either or lack of action from them; parents are either abusive, manipulative or passive; Loser's Club are victims of their apathetic parents and leering Derry townspeople. These kids are neglected, acting out as if they perversely believe fighting off an evil force is a better way of their spending time than with their family.Andy Muschietti – along with cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung – showcase a delightful, macabre, surrealist edge to mayhem calling back to Kubrick's Shining, work of Tim Burton and Park-Chan Wook; not many mainstream horror films would embrace the paintings of Amedo Modigliani. This didn't hide my slight frustration as the visual effects became more prevalent as the film progressed, I realised I cared more about the characters than the scares; that's where the true success IT lies. With Chapter 2 arriving in September 2019 and the current, enormous box office success, I really hope the creators don't lose the chemistry between the Loser's Club amongst the visual effects; it was the invaluable ingredient that made IT a gratifying, kinetic, carnival ride.",It

Much critics and reviews were talking about how good it has adapted, remaining the original spirit from the novel, etc. I haven't read a word from the book, I will just discuss how the film looks like to me.""It"" has done a great job doing a great horror film by not making it ""just for frightening"". After so much of the sequel and prequel of ""The Conjuring"" came out, ""It"" remains its true purpose of making a great film, by making a good protagonist (in fact a bunch of good protagonists) with interesting background story and conflicts, which made antagonist Pennywise so much attractive than Annabelle, The Nun or any others. However, last year Netflix brought up TV series ""Stranger Things"" with great old-school visual ingredients has made a new sight on horror genre. The series make it not only a horror film series, but also a great teenagers-growing film, that's why the series is successful. ""It"" looked so much like ""Stranger Things"", in fact very much like it, making it not even new nor fresh.But overall, it's a great film, well done to the team!",It

I've watched my fair share of horror movies (believe me the list is HUGE) but from what I could sum up IT Movie might very well be the best of the best. Can't believe I'm saying this but I think IT is far better than even The Conjuring and most other renowned horror masterpieces - brilliant cinematography and CGI, beautiful blend of humor and horror, the horror sequences (more like the terror sequences) are more atmospheric and artsy rather than cheap 'jump scares'. The best part is, Pennywise is the second clown ever to get under my skin since Heath Ledger's Joker. This movie is not for faint-hearted people and most-definitely not for people with Coulrophobia (fear of clowns). If you are a true horror fan then read no more and go watch IT.",It
1491,skyblazeeterno,a visual treat but ultimately lacking,3,13 January 2019,This seems like it was the Idiots Guide To It...the cinematography is great as it looks almost arty in places...but that's possibly the only good part of this adaptation.

1492,biancapdiaz,A Great Adaptation of an Iconic Novel,8,11 September 2019,"IT by Stephen King has to be one of my favorite books; with King being my favorite author/person. With that being said, if you go into this movie (or any movie based off of a book) and expect it to be exactly like the book, then don't bother watching it.
King's novel is gorey, messy, all over the place, and downright horrifying. That's what makes it so great. It's more than a story, it's an experience; you get lost in it. Carrying that over into film, it won't work. Andy Muschietti took his resource, dissected it carefully, and pulled out important pieces. While also giving little easter eggs throughout the film. He created a Pennywise that would intrigue us, scare us. Bill Skarsgard gave us a performance to remember, considering the shoes he had to fill after Tim Curry's portrayal of Pennywise. It is unfair to compare the two. Tim Curry is a horror icon as Pennywise; while Bill Skarsgard held his own in this adaptation.
IT is more than just a horror story. It's a coming of age story. It's a story about love, friendship, overcoming fears, etc. The young cast were amazing as the portrayals of the Losers. The chemistry is unmatched and should be praised for it.",It

I have never seen the original miniseries so I have nothing to compare it to, so this was really my first killer clown experience. This film is absolutely amazing, and presents not only terrifying scares, but also a surprising amount of both heart and humour. The cast of children exhibited stellar performances, and Bill Skarsgård's portrayal of Pennywise sent shivers down my spine. Tension is captured excellently, through both the music and screen, and the gore adds to a very disturbing yet somehow enjoyable experience. All characters are explored to a great depth, and even the less focused on characters had stand out moments. I am glad I saw this on opening day, and will definitely be added to my Blu-Ray collection. This may possibly be one of my favourite films ever! Absolutely outstanding!",It
1494,bugsy_cline,"poor script, cliché jump scares re-writing of the great story :(",5,7 September 2017,"I read this book back in the 80's. Tonight I saw yet another film adaption of the same book. Once again they miss the mark with yet another Stephen King Classic. I'm not going to say it was a terrible flick. Because it wasn't. It had some redeeming qualities. The humor of Richie ""the mouth"" Tozziur was, in fact, the only thing that actually ""Floated"" down here. The biggest drawback was the rewriting of the story to suit the uncultured minds of millennials and others who have never read a Stephen King Book. They took what was one of the most imaginative scary stories of the last 50 years and turned it all into a Hollywood cliché. complete with non-stop Jump Scares that scare no one but teenagers. The casting was world class, but the script falls short and turns great dialog into nothing more than a group of kids insulting each other for 2 hours. And the strongest character in the movie ended up being ""The Denzel in distress"" routine. AGH so typical.... So boring. so cliché, SO Predictable... Then There's the worst part.... Pennywise actually manages to capture the members of the losers club and yet... HE LETS THEM ALL GO... MORE THAN ONCE... WTF???? It's so cliché and brain dead in this aspect that the more I ponder how ridiculous it was, the more I begin disliking this movie. It lived in the sewers, the reason it comes out of the sewers is because it is a hunter. It hunts because it's hungry. It doesn't hunt for the thrill of scaring little children. It hunts because it is hungry and loves the taste of blood. Predators don't capture and release their prey if they are hungry, They kill them and eat them. But what I will never under stand is the role reversal of some of the main characters. WTF? Am I the only person on this earth who has bothered to read these books? My only guess in switching the love interest from Ben and Bev, to Bill and Bev is because America's obsession with hating overweight people could never accept the fact that the ""Fat Kid"" could be the main character and the ""hero"" who gets the girl.Then There's Mike's character... They sure didn't want to give the black guy too much screen time. and then they also switched his character with Ben... WTF? Ben was not the Town History buff... Guess they just want to make Ben the biggest loser by making him the one who stays behind in the town? Is it too much for the millennial mind set of ""Survival of the cutest"" to grasp that people who aren't ""pretty"" are also people of value too?Who knows? But why rewrite the god damned story? There's a reason why Stephen King sold millions of copies of this book:Because he's a great story teller and is considered to be one of the finest of the last 50 years.... so what ego driven Hollywood executive decided the script writers of this adaptation had better vision than the already tried and true hit making story?Out of five stars, I reluctantly give it 3. However, it does not deserve 3 stars. it deserves 2 out of 5. I only rate it three because of the humor of Richie and because the parts that did stick with the story looked great, the casting was great and the Clown was a million freaking times scarier than that stupid Tim Curry that was laughable at best from the 90's adaption.",It

The script was too infantile and the scary scenes were boring. Annabelle and The Conjuring brought the current horror movies to the another level and ""It"" just followed some old rules. I don't want to write spoilers but there is an important thing to say: all the children suffered prejudice but nothing compared to the fat boy.

The setting, the way it's shot, the bikes, the clothes, the group dynamics, it's all identical but less scary.The acting is good, but the story is boring and painfully slow; it shows the friends all hanging out and fighting bullies etc. but with little value to the overall feel or movie. The special effects are quite good; only one of the monsters (the painting woman with the flute) is poor quality (probably to look like a painting) and isn't frightening at all. The music was brilliant, and the opening scene was good, but after that it lost me entirely, and it was super long.Any parts where you think the main characters are in peril, they're not; they avoid being killed continuously even though apparently lots of other kids couldn't. They do stupid stuff that children who have already experienced a child eating clown would not be doing in that situation. Parents are no where to be seen. The jokes are odd; one of the young lads continuously making sex references and things, with the rest of the group rolling their eyes. Not a believable dynamic and lazy humour most of the time.Not worth a watch at all.

1500,Tireesewood13,"people obviously don't get the meaning of it, please read",8,15 September 2017,"Just for some clarification i have never gone out of my way to write a review for a film but after seeing everyone's views on ""it"" it has just confused me as to why this movie is being put down a lot. so I wanted to actually put some knowledge into viewers heads before they write reviews on here or watch the movie itself. (only a few spoilers) All I'm seeing on reviews is that the film isn't actually ""scary"" and is one of the main reasons why the film Is getting negative opinions and views. The whole point of the movie is about fear, and how the characters on screen interact with the audience to overcome the fear of pennywise. The film portrays such a clever aspect that most horror films these days struggle to do, but most general audiences just aren't getting it . The first few parts of the movie is the most scary parts for the audience and for the actors on screen too , but throughout the movie the kids start to become fearless of the clown and that gave such a big effect on the audience as we did too.Not only was it full of suspense it was also exciting unlike horror movies that depend on jump scares to attract audiences aka ""paranormal activity"" The way the clown actually sounds dopey to make the kids thinks he is a silly clown is such a good feature, rather than clowns that sound evil which is a big give away .People are also forgetting that pennywise is a mastermind and can control peoples minds with illusions and can control how people can think. for example when Georgie was screaming in the street trying the crawl away from the creature, how do people know that pennywise didn't controlled everyone else's mind to ignore what was happening so people didn't realise what was actually going on or couldn't hear the commotion?.(reach into your imagination rather than judge) I hate it when people say this film wasn't scary, because if that's all you want to watch it for then maybe you should look at horror movies with no real meaning or portrayal that actually makes a film more exciting than others. Every appearance that pennywise made was amazing and throughout the film you saw more and more in places less expected to see him , which created so much suspense for the film people are also forgetting what was actually in the book of ""it"" had all the sexual and other stupid scenes that could've been made in the movie which would've spoilt the film completely making it more of a mockery.also one of my favourite things about this movie is that it was more realistic than people think. The bullies were extremely violent to the losers which was a lot better than other bullies in films that just give the old nudge and push which fails to be realistic and believable.The adults too for me were the biggest bullies of all, as adults don't tend to believe what their kids say or tell them and therefore completely ignore everything going on around them. However I think that the adults have had similar experience when they were children and pennywise has manipulated their minds to not look back at their memories so that he cant be stopped,(and this is why people shouldn't judge things before they actually realise how clever the movie is and how much it makes you think). Therefore adults gave more of a sense of realism to the film which adds to a mountain of good things in this movie.This movie makes you have more of an imagination to what is going on as the book did too, which is a comparison most people are missing. If you think about it ,most things in the movie portray ordinary lives rather than killer clown that most people complained about. for example this involves, friendship, bullying, overcoming fear, childhood compared to adulthood and the list goes on...The relationships between characters on screen were brilliant and actually made you feel for most of them because of the bond that they portrayed to the audience. For me this was mostly expected and hopefully for many others too, and was far better than the mini series despite tim currys amazing performance. However this modern version is more than what people think and is not any other ordinary horror movie which I think people should appreciate more these days.as a movie as whole, some places that some cgi lacked a bit and more of the creatures it transformed into could've had a lot more potential however here I am just nip picking. The film was long enough and I believe nothing else could've been thrown in to make this movie better than it already was.in conclusion if you want to go see a mindless, gore fest movie or a jump scare movie maybe ""jigsaw "" is more of match for you, but if you want to see a film with a lot more sense and excitement spend your money on ""it"".",It
1501,ElliottGEdwards,"Solid film, if you excuse the reliance on digital effects for generic horror.",6,11 April 2019,"I found IT (2017) to be a film lacking in any real horror, but full already iconic cinematic ideas and images with memorable performances and solid writing. However an over reliance on effects and a disregard for keeping the more mythical elements of the story secret till the third act ended up ruining this otherwise very solid film directed by Andrés Muschietti (who has very few prior credits to his name and did an excellent job leading this $35,000,000 franchise studio feature!).I find it difficult to talk about IT without talking about pre-title scenes. I was watching it and rolling my eyes due to it's generic setup. Lighting storm, Young boy has to walk down to the basement as creepy music plays. Thinks he sees something in the shadows, just a reflection...The scene outside with the paper boat is now iconic, and Pennywise in the drain is suitably creepy until giant teeth come out and eat the boy's arm. This ruins too much too soon in my opinion, knowing that this creepy clown is a monster and basically a creature from another dimension removed the tension. I'd much rather have a movie full of children confronting creepy scenes and the odd smiling clown rather than knowing that he could just bight your hand off. The more fantastical elements only come into play as the children go into the sewer and discover it for themselves, I would have must rather discovered the multi-dimensional fear feeding monster elements with them, rather than introducing it in the opening.Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was captivating and I just had a smile over my face every time he jumped out of the shadows. His performance shows so much effort, sheer talent and charisma and along side the excellent practical prosthetic face mask by Alec Gilles and Tom Woodruff Jr. with the beautifully creepy costume created by Janie Bryant makes for one of my personal favourite cinematic characters. However, 90% of the time when he did it his performance was covered by some special effects magic that totally ruined what he brought to the part. Drawing over Skargard's performance in this way is like putting a plastic bag over Heath Ledger in The Dark Night or an Snapchat dog filter over Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. I wish whoever behind this movie pushed forwards the VFX usage (be it director, studio or screenwriters) would have trusted Skargard's ability to creep an audience without.In regards to the actual horror, it felt very generic and bland due to, again, many effects shots that just did not work for tension. Sophia Lillis' performance along side Stephen Bogaert playing her sexually abusive father was without a doubt the stand out chills in the film feeling much more real and grounded with both delivering incredible performances. There were only three other times I felt scared in the movie. Pennywise in the drain, burning hands reaching out from behind the door and one VERY SIMPLE jump cut from a headless man into Pennywise. I guess that just shows how effective a good edit and performance is over spectacle.Other than those complaints (keeping in mind, the actual horror takes up a suprisingly small part of the film) the creepy scenes the children encounter are very imaginative, the performances are fantastic from all involved, excellent period costume and set design with high school bullies and drama that kept me hooked between the digital horror attempts. Beautifully lit and shot by Chung-hoon Chung with very well paced and motivated editing by Jason Ballantine. The child actors were fantastic across the board and their performances, reminiscent in dynamic of 80s classics like the goonies, is the main reason to see this movie other than Pennywise's portrayal.Overall, I suggest seeing this movie if you like crazy concepts and are looking for a good drama with some fantasy elements and a captivating villain.

See what I did there: ""clown"" and ""It."" Even though the name of the clown is Pennywise, the group of kids always call it, ""It.""""It"" gets so many aspects of a good horror movie correct, utilizing the power and fear of the characters, translating it to the audience. Speaking of the characters, everyone does a fantastic job portraying the types of characters they were assigned. ""The Losers,"" a group of 13-year-old high school buddies are your typical (at least when I was in high school, not too long ago) teenagers. They swear, make offensive jokes, and I absolutely love that the experiences of fear they go through, are not mellowed down. This allows for each individual member of ""The Losers"" to shine, showcasing their full potential while facing Pennywise.Pennywise, aka ""It,"" is the star of the show. Bill Skarsgård does a tremendous job at being terrifying. He utilizes various tones when expressing verbal dialogue and different facial expressions, especially that smile of his (when Pennywise first sets his eyes on Georgie), making everyone freak. Even though this movie, not including Bill Skarsgård, has a terrific cast, without him, ""It"" would feel incomplete.So far, everything that is mentioned here is all positive. That is because ""It"" is pretty much a perfect movie. There were a couple of scenes that could have been shorter or cut from the movie because it does not contribute to the end goal. Also, there was this one character trait change in the movie that does not make any sense and it will disappoint many who have read Stephen King's novel that this movie was based on. Overall, ""It"" is a movie everyone should go see.

1512,bentaycanada,Horror is rarely this well made!,9,8 September 2017,"In the early 90's when I started reading King, I was not allowed to read 'IT', for many reasons that would become clear later on. In fact I saw the TV-movie version before I ended up getting my hands on a copy of the book.'IT' 1990 was everything I could have asked for; scary, charming, horrific, and perfect for a boy of my age. The film has a great blend of coming of age mixed with intense themes of horror and great foreboding atmosphere. One thing that was immediately clear was the overall fear of The Losers Club played a much bigger part of the story that the Pennywise clown character. The town of Derry and the individual problems of each character is what is scary about the story, and Pennwise is merely a physical form of the creature they call 'IT'. In many ways this is lost on most audiences. When you bring up 'IT', the clown and Tim Curry are almost always the chosen subject, where-as the story goes much deeper than that. Something that would prove to be true with the novella.Very much a product of its time, 'IT' 1990 has a great cast of both child and adult actors of that era. But it's also limited by the very same elements. Its budgetary restraints are clear. The cast largely makes up for this, which adds to why they are so memorable. There is also an uneven feel between the two parts, something the director later admitted himself, saying he couldn't get the same on screen chemistry between the adults, as he had with the children. This aside, 'IT' will always be held dear to many horror or King fans as the stronger of his TV adaptions.Fast forward to today, and after a long spate of pre-production hell 'IT' 2017 was finally announced later last year, and the hype from the teaser trailer that followed was huge. I dare say fans or King himself could have expected such a large response from the movie going public, after so many years. Throughout this period, I tended to stay away from any news about the production as the teaser trailer did little to interest me. My worry was it would fall into the trappings of modern horror, with jump scares galore and overly loud bangs in place of an actual score.With that I'm happy to say this film is everything you could ask for in a Stephen King adaption. The setting (i.e. Derry), the atmosphere, the characters, pacing and plot are all spot on. It's nearly flawless in its presentation. The director has included all the necessary plot elements that keep the story moving, while never losing the over-arching fear that controls the story. Like the 1990 TV version, this film captures both the coming of age and horror elements that are essential to the plot. The child actors (inc. Henry Bowers gang) are all wonderfully cast, and each hold their performance as their own. The Losers Club in this story are not easily portrayed, each has their own distinct traits and emotional baggage. It's how they are as separate individuals and how they come together against the great evil surrounding them that is so important.Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise is for lack of a better word 'perfect'. He has admitted early on that he knows he could not out do Tim Curry's memorable role, so he went for something more true to the source material. His stature and build really helped set him aside from any real comparison to Curry, let alone his performance. With the help of the production crew, this version of the monster is far more supernatural than before. Bill went for contortion lessons, which although fairly minor in screen time, greatly helped how he perceived. He is not just a killer clown, he is a hidden creature that happens to inhabit a clowns body. Along with the local scenery he also feels like he is genuinely part of Derry, part of the local furniture. This is so important to the look of the film, he like the town of Derry feels old and as though it has roots that predate our characters in The Losers Club.It's rare that horror film are this well made, character development is generally where this genre falls short, and in this case, the director nailed it to the wall. I was left speechless throughout, and walked away knowing that they had pulled off many things I thought impossible from this story.The director and production team will have their work cut out for them to re-create this kind of magic with Part 2. At this point there is only speculation as to if and when this will happen. The current chapter is set to break records for horror films released in September, so we'll just have to wait and see. Though one thing is clear, if this does as well as current estimates predict, we will be seeing a renewed interest in Stephen King's work coming back to the big screen, and more revisions of his work to come.",It
1513,alvarobdc,"are It ratings as inflated as the ""famous"" red balloons?",7,13 September 2017,"To be fair, this It (2017) remake is better than the original one (1990), I think there is no doubt here. It is also an entertaining movie, so you can spend your money on watching it in movie theaters, it is OK.But being critic, I will call this film ""clichIt"", for obvious reasons. Creating a scary atmosphere is hard, but that does not mean that you have to turn everything into the ""scarier version"" of it, f.e. ruined house with scratchy doors, things that move themselves for no reason, etc., it really is a large list of ""scary items"" that are too used in this movie.When I watched the movie, I had a good time, but I was not scared at all, maybe some Pennywhise appearances in screen made me fright. But this movie made me laugh more than scare, mainly thanks to Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard) jokes.An horror movie that makes you laugh more than panic? Not what I expected for sure.",It
1514,masonbrewer,A very well done horror film as well as a unique lesson in adaptations.,8,20 September 2017,"As the opening credits appeared across the bottom corners of the screen, displaying many talented names and some that were soon to be judged, a sort of symbol faded in along with them. A symbol formed within the lettering of the name of ""Stephen King"". This symbol for films can transform itself, as the titular shape-shifting being, into an omen or a blessing, all depending on the celluloid that bears it's name. From thrilling classics such as ""The Shining"" and ""Carrie"" to laugh- out-loud blunders such as ""The Langoliers"" and ""Maximum Overdrive"", it's become clear that when given the task of bringing the ""better how he wrote it"" stories of the master Stephen King to life, screenwriters and directors tend to either hit it right out of the park or miss completely and comically. I am pleased to report that thanks to a wide array of talent from a well developed screenplay, delightfully charming performances, and brilliant direction, Stephen King's most iconic horror story has been brought to life in a big way. One of the main issues often had when any film's main cast consists of children is that the heroes never feel entirely vulnerable. Their age tends to limit what the monster can do to them beyond just popping out and giving them a quick fright. This film overcomes this problem by establishing very quickly with it's expertly crafted opening scene that these kids are in some serious danger and, without spoiling too much, are incredibly open to bodily dismemberment as well as psychological damage. The film earns it's R rating as well as the stakes and obstacles that it sets for it's protagonists all in one fantastic scene. But at the end of the day, a story is only as good as it's characters. Without liking and identifying with these kids we don't feel as scared because we aren't really that concerned with seeing them live if we don't like them. Thanks to both the performances of very talented Hollywood youngsters and Andy Muschietti's direction of them, we have some of the most enjoyable horror protagonists in a long time. The standouts for me include the wise-ass trash talker of the group Richie Tozier, played by Finn Wolfhard of ""Stranger Things"" fame, and the equally funny, double fanny pack sporting, hypochondriac Eddie Kaspbrak, portrayed by Jack Dylan Grazer. The group of children, who call themselves the ""Losers Club"", bond throughout the film and feel very genuine in their interactions with one another, making the audience care for them when they face the everyday horrors of life, their deepest fears physically manifested, and a certain dancing clown. Now let's talk about that clown for a moment. Pennywise, as many from the 90s know him, will always be Tim Curry from the Mini- Series. The prospect of taking over such an acclaimed performance can be a daunting one, and for this I have a massive amount of respect for Bill Skarsgard. He brings something completely original to this character. He's funny and does a lot of laughing but there's still something just a little off about him. With one or sometimes both of his eyes looking off in different directions and drool pouring down his mouth like he's been sitting in a buffet line for hours, Pennywise the Dancing Clown is easily the best part of the movie. I won't bother comparing the two portrayals here because they're both completely different, in the same vein as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's Joker. It all comes down to opinion and I feel that Bill Skarsgard did a fantastic job here. Where this film truly succeeds is in being a truly unique adaptation. If you've read the book, as I have, you may feel that you know all that the film will throw at you already and not feel so threatened. This film understands the basic DNA of the novel, but doesn't directly adapt it page to screen. It throws new things at you and doesn't hold back from being ambitious in some of it's scares. As for the flaws, I feel they mostly lie within some of the pacing elements and the final act. If you were to come across some truly terrifying and scarring imagery, why wouldn't you tell your friends immediately?! They attempt to use the ""you would have thought I was crazy"" excuse but aside from one scene it doesn't really work here. The final act is well done and has some of the best moments from the kids and Pennywise, but it falls into a very common trap that horror films can't seem to learn from: The longer you show the monster, the less scary it becomes. With the monster in this film, there are endless possibilities of what It could become but they just linger on the clown for so long that, while the performance is still great, the scare factor is very much toned down by the end. Also, with so many kids in the group, I would be lying if I said I got attached to every single one of them. Some definitely got more focus than others. Overall, this is a great film. Not without it's flaws but when the characters are so like-able and the filmmaking displayed so good, how could you not enjoy it? Grab some friends and join the Dancing Clown.",It
1515,diedraarthur,More like Sh!t...,4,16 September 2017,"I am typing this, while watching the original TV movie. I was excited and nervous to watch the new version..I finally saw it a few days ago and boy I was impressed! I was impressed at how directors, writers and editors can really miss the mark and destroy a film. In my opinion this movie,if you want to call it that, was a mess.The pacing was off and rushed.I did like the first few minutes. The build up was nice, but after that it was overwrought with laughable CGI, and characters I didn't really ""get"". These kids were supposed to be ""losers"" and band together to conquer Pennywise. The film failed to reach down and give us an in depth look at fear and how each of these kids were tormented. Pennywise was only creepy in the beginning when he was talking to Georgie in the sewer..There was no CGI and Skarsgard nailed the scene with subtlety. After that they CGI'd him to death which made his scenes laughably bad. How they came together and confronted IT was not executed in the right way. There were some good moments, but the bad outweighed the good, in my opinion. If you are fan of CGI in horror movies,underdeveloped characters and a hodge podge of scenes that destroy the story, then you will love this.",It
1516,soumyauk-31887,Good but over-hyped,6,21 September 2017,"Went to see this movie amid much hype and talk. In that sense was disappointed. However, the acting of the protagonists is superb. The ""it"" is scary in the beginning, but the tremendous amount of gore that was shown, I think, made the movie at par with ordinary horror movies. The clown deserves praise, even though it really had to go overboard sometimes to scare anyone. I would rate Conjuring quite higher compared to this.",It
1517,tue-56162,Too many balls to juggle,5,6 February 2018,"The movie IT uses lonely children's vulnerability, in order to scare the audience through them. The character Pennywise uses the children worst fears in order to catch them, and does it when they are most vulnerable, when they are lonely, but the movie ends with the children sticking together in order to overcome their fears, which is also the main theme. The movie can easily be compared to the first episode of the Tv-series Stranger things, although Stranger things doesn't deal with loneliness nearly as much, but sticking together is also a main theme here. It's also a group of children trying to take matters into their own hands, in order to help their friend or friends. Both Stranger things and IT sets up the characters very well, by using the different characters differences to establish their personalities quickly, and both does it very well, even though there is a lot of characters to deal with. Stranger things have plenty of time to do this in the first episode, as there still are nine episodes afterwards, but IT only have 3 hours, and with all the characters to introduce, while juggling with a lot of other balls, it quickly becomes a mess. Often the scenes donesn't seem to move the story anywhere, just repeats things that were already told to the audience. It fails to dive deeper into the subjects of the movie, as the surface of the subject is just told over and over again, not creating anything exciting or gripping. Pennywise doesn't work either. Already from the start we see what he is fully capable of, and get what he is all about, ruining everything mysterious about him. People are afraid of the unfamiliar, but Pennywise is familiar already from the start. He is also very predictable, as he always appears in creepy places, and doesn't break your expectations by appearing in unexpected situations. The only thing that wakes curiosity about him, is the line he keeps repeating about floating, and the different well-designed forms he can take. Though he is very well integrated in the theme, the theme isn't very well integrated in the movie, as it is thrown at your face in any given situation. Themes work when it is expressed between the lines. IT manages to have most of the scenes work towards the theme, but there isn't anything hidden or mysterious about the theme, like in other popular horror movies with a good theme, such as the sixth the sense, which also deals with loneliness and vulnerability. 
In short, the thing IT does the best, is the characters and their relations, but falls short in other areas.",It
1518,connerpodpora,Very well-made horror movie with horrifyingly excellent visuals,8,8 September 2017,"Just got back from my viewing of It, and thought I'd give my 2 cents while the movie is fresh in my mind. First off, the movie kept me very entertained throughout. It is a very fun viewing experience, mostly due to the excellent visuals. Modern technology in film can help make horror classics great again, and sometimes worse. In this case it was executed perfectly, making Pennywise seem to be a terrifying antagonist.The movie is very well-made and the actors and actresses give mostly good performances. I've been a huge horror fan my whole life and find many horror movies that people find to be very good to be bad, and vice versa. In this case the movie is definitely good, but not as good as it's hyped up to be.The cons that are nagging at me is that the movie does paint some horrifying scenarios for your eyes to see, and it definitely is fun to see. But what makes great horror movies amazing is having an eerie or terrifying atmosphere to go with it. In It, you love what you see but it doesn't provide a creepy atmosphere with it. I never felt on the edge of my seat or wanting to cover my eyes because I'm scared of what's about to happen. For many this won't be a problem, but a lot of what I love in horror movies is the feeling of adrenaline and fear the good ones provoke.Along with that my only other complaint is the ending, SPOILERS AHEAD. It felt very clichéd (especially one completely laughable scene reminding me of Snow White) and tried too hard to give a heartwarming ending. The movie built Pennywise to be this terrifying and formidable monster who can play with your mind and seemingly take your life at any moment, only to make him seem like a little wimp at the climax. This horrible monster apparently is defeated fairly easily by a couple kids with poles, and without much of a fight to be honest.Overall, visually horrifying and very well put together. Nightmare scenarios somehow aren't accompanied with any scary atmosphere and without provoking real fear. A fantastic build up only to be let down by a subpar-at-best climax and ending. Very entertaining film, but leaves you feeling like it was missing something small to give it some real oomph that makes it stay with you and linger in your mind like all the best horror movies do. It came very close, It had all the tools, but came just inches short from the endzone that would've made it one of the most terrifying movies in recent years.",It
1519,viktoreeckhout,Suspenseful horror of the highest class,8,12 September 2017,"I went to see it with a friend yesterday. Normally, horror isn't really my genre, but since the good reviews It has been getting, I thought I'd give it a shot.I went into the movie very skeptical. I was a bad mood, because the person in front of me was really annoying, but when I thought about the movie later, it turned out to be pretty great. I wouldn't recommend the movie if you're easily scared. If you like the thrill of being frightened, you're in for a real treath.From the first scene to the last, the movie is entertaining, really well acted and surprisingly funny. It's a great picture to get introduced to the horror genre and the movie is incredibly suspenseful.Now, for the part I didn't like. I wouldn't say 'bad part' because it's my personal opinion. First of all, I prefer the psychological horror movies such as Psycho, where everything is explained and the story could take place in the real world. The second thing I didn't like is *SPOILER ALERT*: at the end of the movie, the title card says: 'It, Chapter One' But we'll see about how a franchise works when the probable second movie comes out.In the end, It is a great horror film. The kind of which we haven't seen in a long time. I recommend all fans of the genre to see the movie. I certainly would have enjoyed it, if the audience was less annoying.",It
1520,murillom-19671,IT- A Good Movie but a bit Disappointed,9,9 September 2017,"Overall, it was still a good movie but this disappointed me just a bit. I think a lot of my disappointment is that it takes place in the 80s and not the 50s. First, I commend the kids for their acting performances as they did a terrific job all-around; specifically ""Stuttering Big Bill,"" Eddie Kasprak, Beverly Marsh and Richie ""Trashmouth"" Tozier (great comedic performance). It was very realistic how boys act at that age, but I didn't care for Ben Hanscom, Mike Hanlon or Stan Uris' characters. Not bad acting, but rather what the writers gave them to work with. Ben Hanscom is supposed to be the brainiac of the Losers Club, but no one would know it from watching this movie. No one would also know that Big Bill was a gifted story-teller that would later become a world- renown author. I was glad they included the House on Neibolt Street, which they left out of the 1990s movie and was a significant part of the story. The ""Apocalyptic rock fight"" could have been a lot better and I was disappointed that there weren't more scenes of the kids playing in The Barrens. This would have been a great opportunity to illustrate how intelligent Ben is by informing the other Losers how to properly build the dam that would later flood the Barrens.Henry Bowers was not nearly as evil or racist as he was in the book or even the first movie. I'll chalk that up to the Hollywood Liberals avoiding an unpleasant time in our country's past. (Henry would incessantly belittle Mike for being Black. They could have shown a flashback of The Black Spot and how IT murdered all of those patrons; but I think they avoided this too b/c it's a racial topic). I was glad that Patrick Hockstetter was included this time, but he had a very minor role. No mention that he was even crazier than Henry, and that he murdered his baby brother when he was 6. They could have made more of a story of how Henry, Belch, Victor and Patrick terrorized the Losers Club. Along with the Black Spot, I thought it would have been cool if there were flashbacks of what happened at the Ironworks factory on Easter Day, but it was only merely mentioned. AND TO ALL THE PERVS THAT READ THE BOOK, Beverly does not SLEEP with all of the boys as she does in the book. Patrick also doesn't have his homosexual experience with Henry either. Hahahaha, gross. King could be a whack-job.",It
1521,1Phase1,Simply not scary. Not bad either though,5,28 October 2017,"The absolute best I can say about this is that it's average. I honestly don't understand all the good reviews and high IMDb rating: it's really not scary. Creepy, yes, but not scary. It started out exceptionally well, but really went downhill from there. The constant throwing of jump scares at the viewers really wears down the scare factor of the movie. I will honestly say the only time I was legitimately scared was toward the very end of the movie, but even then it was only really a moderate scare, lasting a second. Other than that, I didn't find it scary at all. In fact, some scenes actually made me laugh, which I don't exactly think was the intended point of those scenes. Maybe it's the overuse of the CG, or the overuse of the jump scares (or maybe the jump scares are just low quality) but this wasn't terrifying at all really. As for the rest of the movie's scenes, it seemed very jumbled. I won't say I was bored, or that the story was bad, because it was good, it was just...average. Not bad, but not good.The ending seemed to be saying that there would be a second movie, but I really don't have high hopes for it. Not if it goes on the same path as this one.",It

The first encounter with Pennywise (Bill Skasgard) itself gives you a strong,tense and dark sensation where the remaining movie is going .The small details being so clear seems like we have put into a world of Clown fear and mystery of all the children that are going missing under chaotic circumstances .Creepiness at it utter most Bill Skasgard delivers an excellent ,astonishing performance as Pennywise the shape- shifting Children eating Clown of Derry,Maine. Maybe even as iconic as Tim curry who did appear as the same character in the previous IT MINI SERIES(1990). His sinister face with that large forehead , child like face, tight old clown outfit and weirdest set of eyes making it almost the weirdest character ever done. Its going to be a haunted memory as that's all i can say .Jump scares 9/10 gives you the chills and the story ,the atmosphere damn and how it immerses the audience into this small town and the mysteries of it is amazing .Lots of GORE AND BLOOD making it an R rated Package for a spooky ride . King itself being impressed with the movie Andy Muschietti taking a huge risk of a remake has done a great work pulling together this greatly awaited trauma filled movie .Cast is excellent .8/10 Makeup too good 8.8/10 .Totally Everyone one has done a good job .Great Angles giving it a vintage touch, CGI has gone to a new level where we are put deep down into penny-wises tricks and gory kinda funny acts.To say if it has done justice to the book or not .. you can say it has and it hasn't .its like 60/40. Some scenes have been made different but its good as far i see it. Leaving this treat be, the climax as not in the book due to some reasons says king fits with the time line and giving it a small gap through for the second part which is dated to release in 2019 .Overall Great flick i would recommend everybody to watch it from the theater itself .

1524,tuckerconstable-07055,"Intense, Creepy and Disturbing",8,11 September 2017,"The story of Stephen King's ""It"" is pretty well known, so I'll make this short. ""It"" follows seven children who are being haunted by visions of an unseen evil, who takes the form of a clown known as Pennywise. The children find out that Pennywise is also responsible for the multiple children who are turning up missing in their town. So, they eventually decide to defeat ""It"", but in the process they only temporarily injure it. Twenty seven years later, It comes back to haunt them all and they are forced to defeat him once and for all. However, this adaptation of ""It"" solely focuses on the main characters as children. To say the most recent adaptation of ""It"" is intense, creepy and disturbing would all be an understatement. Bill Skarsgard's version of Pennywise brings an ominous presence to the screen that Tim Curry barely touched upon. Whenever Skarsrsgard is on screen, expect some genuine scares. The child actors are also incredibly talented, particularly Sophia Lillis and Jaeden Lieberher. Their performances are surprisingly realistic and they have genuine feeling behind every line.The only real complaint with ""It"" is that it relies slightly too much on the stock big scary music reaches a crescendo to jump scare the audience. It's a very cheap move for such classy source material. But, excusing that, ""It"" is a surprising hit this year. It's full of well acted performances, genuine scares (including that freaking leper person thing) and great direction. Here's hoping ""It: Chapter Two"" is just as good.",It

I love Tim Currys take on Pennywise to death. But my oh my - from this day forward Skarsgård IS Pennywise. He steals every scene his in with his Joker-done-good-ish voice and maniac look.

1530,ariadnasomers,Deeply disappointed,5,1 November 2017,"I won't give this movie a lower rating because I don't think it deserves it as a movie. As an adaptation, it would get a -5 at best. First of all, the kids. They are NOT amazing. They have no real chemistry, plus the unconditional friendship factor is absent. You never get the feel that they're supposed to be together to beat It. They fight and they're petty. They changed them so much, and quite unnecessarily. Bill is weak, Eddie is unbearable, Stan is hardly there at all. Why steal Mike's glory? He's supposed to be the history oriented one, not Ben. Why kill off his parents and make him kill livestock? He's barely in the movie. Why make Ben, a kid who has been in Derry for a month, the knowledgeable one? Just because he likes the library? Ugh. All the kids are different than what they're supposed to be. Also, no Barrens, no dam, no clubhouse. Stop comparing this to Stranger Things. That shows the camaraderie in 10 minutes, while this fails to show these kids as a unit. The bullies failed too. Except for the father killing scene, Henry Bowers was pathetic. The movie fails to show his descent into madness at It's hands completely. Pennywise is decent, but there's too much of it. You may have noticed the movie is called ""It"", not ""Pennywise"". Far gone are all the things that scare the kids, there's only this clown and a leper that looks more like a zombie. WHY SAY GEORGIE WAS MISSING???? He was dead. His body was recovered. Actually, many children's bodies were recovered. The scene with them all floating was dumb. And don't get me started on Bev being kidnapped. That takes from the kids' courage to go and kill It, which they did by choice, and reduces it to a rescue mission that nobody wanted to take part of. The change to the 80's was terrible. Awful use of music and sound. They could learn a thing or two from Stranger Things in that department. Edition is terrible too. They could have earned the R rating with awesome death scenes, but they chose to waste it on language. If I have to mention positives, I'll say the CGI is far from being as terrible as they say. It works. Also, the initial Georgie scene is good. All the movie should have had that tone. If you've never read the book, the movie is average, thus the 5 stars. I really hope the adult part makes up for this, but I doubt it. There are many more things I could say, but I'd never finish. I'll just close with this: the miniseries was infinitely more faithful to the book than this.",It

This film is scary, but does not overload you with jump scare after jump scare. Instead the makers took the right path and built up tension throughout the first act with downright terrifying imagery like something Stephen King would have come up with even if not all of it was accurate to the book because in some cases, if it was, that would have disrupted the flow of the movie. And to balance this, they added the good-natured light child-hood summer atmosphere to ease the audience with a Stand By Me (or rather it!) feel to it. One complaint i have is that the movie should of either had more dialogue from Pennywise or less of him because i feel that some of the other monsters should have gotten more screen time to shine. To conclude, to a normal movie goer, you will enjoy this film for it's tense atmosphere, it's jokes, it's smooth story-telling and Richie! To a movie goer wanting a Stephen King movie, you will enjoy all that, the casting and the care gone into making it have the heart and soul of childhood memories that the book had. I recommend this film to all.",It

In a movie genre where production companies push for sequels and cheap plots I am amazed over how people can give this movie bad reviews. I get that some may not like the movie, and the hype got so intense that it wasn't at all what they imagined, but giving this movie a 1, 2, 3 or 4 out of 10? That is pure madness. Complaining about ""bad CGI? "" I do not know what movies that you saw, but this was state of the art production value. I have a suggestion for Hollywood, or whatever gathering of production companies that pull the strings in the wasteland that is the horror genre today; Invest in a good plot, script, screenplay and cast and you will probably generate more money compared to of pushing sequels that everybody will eventually grow to hate. I was hyped for this movie, but I went in with a ""expect nothing, and you won't get let down "" This is also, in a sense; a sequel. I was happy to learn that not only was the plot good, the excellent choice of cast did a convincing job of displaying the fear that Pennywise the clown craved. Speaking of the clown himself, Bill Skarsgård did a tremendous job of portraying the devilish inter dimensional hell spawn that is Pennywise. The CGI also did the clown a favor in making him even more unpleasant than his predecessor Tim Curry was. I do not want to say to much, but basically everybody applauded during the ending credits on the movie premiere I and many others attended, that speaks for itself. See the damn movie and do this movie genre a big favor, put the money where it belongs!",It

In fact, the scariest scene in the entire movie might be Beverly's abusive dad chasing her and trying to hurt her. You know a supernatural horror movie isn't doing a great job when the scariest part has a human villain. Actually, more than scary, it was gory and bloody.I am currently reading the book and it is way better than the film, it's scarier, written better, the characters are more human, round and relatable and it's got a feel I honestly don't think any cast, writer, producer or director could ever capture.Overall, it's not a must-watch and I don't warmly recommend it. Watch it if you want to, don't watch if you don't. It's not a classic and it's definitely not awful. It's just fine, utterly mediocre.",It

An attempt to incorporate humor was foolish. I didn't find it funny, but annoying. I went on my own to see this and expected it to be at least frightening but it was not frightening to me at all. I found it boring, kept on looking at my watch and wanting it to be over. The story lines made no sense. Pennywise was OK. I found the original Pennywise to be far more creepy and scary, both in appearance and voice. I have to say I prefer the original series, although I thought that ending was stupid. Overall, I was disappointed and wish I had waited until it came out on television to see it. This film started off good but dropped after that. It has so much potential. Oh well.",It

Basically the movie revolves around a group of 13 year old kids terrorized by an evil, shape-shifting clown. They then outsmart him and beat him to a pulp with rusty iron rods. One of the weakest ""monsters"" you'd ever see in a horror film, he did not even manage to kill any of the kids (except for Georgie right at the start of the film). What a weak, non-scary, idiotic clown.

The shock of watching IT was high enough that going in the theater gave me chills. I have to say, after watching this film, i gained a newfound respect for Stephen King. The movie stayed faithful (I guess) to the source material (without the infamous orgy scene). The atmosphere and tension and lighting makes every scene burst with personality and it makes it feel more emotionally powerful.You can really feel the dread in every scene as the way the film plays out is kind of unpredictable. In one moment, you have a peaceful scene, 3 minutes later and that scene becomes a spine- chilling thriller. The variety of forms IT can assume really adds a layer of diversity to the movie as it's not just a killer clown but it can also be headless children, lepers, creepy paintings coming to life, zombie children. The performances in this movie are amazing. The way the actors portrayed The Loser's Club really brings the characters from the pages of the book to the screen. My personal favorite being Finn Wolfhard as Richie Tozier.Overall, this movie is relentlessly scary, gives out great performances, and is a funny summer horror movie that you should really watch with your friends.",It

So hear me out and follow me because I will tell you a story of my own. (no spoilers included). Concealed beneath all of this I've just previously stated there's more than reaches the eye, It tells us about how society is blind to its own fear and hatred, things we sometimes ignore, shows us we should be more aware of these things going on around us, in this movie this fear and hatred takes the form of an evil clown, but these are very real things and I believe this is what inspired Stephen King (if this remake was indeed written by him, that I do not know), but what I do know is the message it brings out, it teaches us to take up arms and face our fears and challenges, together, and face all evil that oppose us, because the worst of all modern evil comes from our own minds, nothing to fear but fear itself. The ""you'll float too"" thing kinda passed me by as I did not quite understand the meaning behind that, maybe more about it in a sequel (?). Great movie, even better message I took from it, hope you can all relate and felt inspired by this great work of art.",It

1548,united_soksek,"If you are looking for horror, this one is not for you.",4,11 October 2017,"BAD : 1. This is not a horror movie, well at least for adults, it isn't. As most people, I went to watch this piece with expectation to be horrified, in a positive way I mean as in other famous horror movies (e.g The Conjuring, Insidious, Lights Out etc). But I was disappointed that the horror level was well below par. 2. If you want to have good watching experience, AVOID watching the trailers before watching full movie!! The trailers itself are spoilers of the movies, as most if not all scenes that was supposed to cause suspense and fear was already revealed in the trailers. So when you watch the movie you already know what will happen thus really 'potong stim'/defeats the purpose of the scary scenes as the scenes becomes not scary anymore. GOOD : I laughed in the theatre more than I was scared. And that is the only good thing about this movie. In between the 'horror' scenes (which is not at all scary, hence the '---' for the word horror), the movie is filled with the comedy, or more accurately, sarcasm of the kids. And that is the worth the 4stars out of the 0star 'horror movie'.SPOILERRSSSS: (skip if you don't want to know yet)--------------- - the scary scenes was about the thing that the kids fear most, which is different for each of the 5 or 6 kids in this movie. So for me, it wasn't scary as each time the scary thing changes. For one of them, her deepest fear was blood and she was disturbed by the ghost by having a bloodbath in the toilet. That scene is more gross rather than scary.SPOILERS OVER----------------------------------------------------FINAL VERDICT: So, if you want to watch this for comedy you'll end up satisfied, but if you want horror, you'll end up disappointed. As a horror flick lover, you won't miss anything if you chose not to watch this. :)",It

There is no real story line. ABSOLUTELY NO backstories on the characters, just an utter mess. So much was left out that I feel it's an injustice for this film to even be called Stephen Kings IT.
Placing the time period in the 80s instead of the 50s REALLY bothers me.

1552,miawannop,Fear.,10,8 September 2017,"Wow, I went into this film knowing that so far it has had very good reviews and I have to say that I was not in the least bit disappointed. In fact I was very impressed by this film for how close it was to the book.Now going into this film I had previously read the book about two weeks prior so it was still fresh in my mind and the book is an absolute masterpiece! Now I never expected a 1000 page book to ever get every detail put into a film because that is nearly impossible but this film handled the job very well and for that I commend it.Now the film of course starts off with Georgie and his yellow slicker, I didn't know what to expect from this scene where we are first introduced to Pennywise in the drain with the boat but I have to say it was bloody terrifying! This was how I knew that the film was not going to stray far from the books gruesome details as Pennywise was immediately opened by ripping Georgie's arm right from its socket. This was petrifying, especially in an extremely dark cinema.Now perhaps there were maybe a few too many jump scares as the film didn't really need to add them for effect as it was extremely scary without because of Pennywise. Bill Skarsgard is the perfect Pennywise, there is absolutely no doubt about that and he is what really makes this film amazing. But also the kids who were played so so well and fit the characters so so well. Honestly this film is one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life!Did it include all of the details from the book? No, but did you really expect it to, King is a very in depth writer and the film was handled absolutely perfectly in my opinion with just the right amount of humour and more than enough terror.",It
1553,johnnyholman,Disappointing,5,18 September 2017,"Im a huge fan of the original clown Pennywise played by Tim Curry. He was delightfully playful, yet cynical and creepy. The film used to scare the crap outta me when I was a kid. and will forever hold a space in my movie collection.That being said, this film will NOT!I had high expectations for ""It"". Eagerly awaiting its release for months. I wanted to see the Clown Pennywise with visual effects that the 80's could not produce. Much like the ""Nightmare on elm street"" made in 2010, changes were made to modernize which, filmmakers hoped, would make the film more interesting but had the opposite affect. Pennywise himself...wow, horrible. I'll give you a quick example: There's Michael Keaton's Batman(amazing), and then there's Christian Bale....yeah, its like that. Why change a good thing? The way I see it, keep things simple, don't veer too far off from an already great story or fans of the original will rip you a new one. Its worth a red box rental, bout it.",It
1554,ceced-73825,Comparisons galore!,8,10 September 2017,"Never having written a review before, I find myself feeling a bit out of water but I have to talk about this film! More so the similarities and differences from the miniseries and the book. The film is beautifully shot as is the miniseries. The cast is amazing namely the kids that play Beverly, Richie and Eddie.. Ben is adorable but I've always had a soft spot for the Ben of the miniseries. Speaking of which, I don't like that mike's role of historian was given to BenIt was a story line shared with his father, who in the books, is the only sane adult! He was my favourite character from the book and now he's dead and Mike lives with his grandfather! Wtf? Their relationship was beautiful! He taught him to be strong and smart in the face of racism. Ben had his story line. He crushes on bev and he and his mother have moved to derry because his father died and they now rely on his aunt. Where is all that?? He's been reduced to ""just some fat kid"" Being honest, I preferred the kids from the miniseries but maybe that's because they padded their stories better and they spent more time showing them bonding. There's hardly any of that in the new movie. Skarsgard gives us a different pennywise and he does it well. He's creepy, childlike and hungry. I did LOL a couple of times. But I think I was meant to. The abusive undertones of Beverly and her father's relationship are there and they are done well. As in the book, he hasn't started abusing her yet but she knows that, like herself, he can see that she is becoming a woman. And the fear of something happening can be just as frightening as the actual act. It gets under your skin and you're rooting for her when she does exactly what you want to climb into the screen and do. What was scary about the book and mini series was the contribution or ignorance to the violence from the adults that are meant to be children's safety. This movie doesn't even scratch the surface of that. Tbh, the scariest parts with IT in the book weren't even with the losers club. It was with the bullies and other children. The bullies aren't given anything here. Except for Henry but it feels out of nowhere. There are things that pay homage to the book that I liked. The use of a fridge was good. People are complaining about CGI. And that's just crap. Ignore that complaint completely. It's a shapeshifting monster for crying out loud! No orgy but a nice little homage in a blood oath and on Eddies cast. I will never understand why people freak out about the orgy but are totally fine with child murder. Overall, it's a good film. It's well worth a watch, even if like me, it's just to see what they done and didn't do with the source material. But let's not ruin it for ourselves. Take the miniseries and this film as 2 completely different things. What one lacks, the other provides.. But do yourself a favour and go to the big screen and enjoy it with the electricity that a crowd will provide.",It
1555,jackwalsh-31519,"A heart-pounding, white-knuckle horror extravaganza",10,9 September 2017,"Thoughts on It: One of my top 10 horror films of all time. I went into the theater with high expectations, and my expectations were more than satisfied. This one blows the silly 1990 version out of the water. If you're looking for safe, sanitized, watered down made-for-TV stuff, look elsewhere.Perhaps most impressive of all was how much story they were able to pack into just 2 hours and fifteen minutes. It didn't feel like they were cutting any corners or needlessly jettisoning content to keep the length reasonable. There was enough story to fill a 4 hour movie, but this one never felt over-saturated. The pacing was excellent.Is it faithful to the book? Yes and no. It's substantially different - and I mean very substantially - but it captures the essence of the book perfectly. The characters are all spot-on, well written and superbly cast. Obviously, Bill Skarsgård steals the show as Pennywise, but the others are great, too. Again, excellent casting all around. The characters all look and act just like their novel counterparts, and their physical likenesses are spot-on. Of the child actors, my favorites were Finn Wolfhard as Richie and Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie.Purists might whine about all the changes, but a lot of them were I think necessary. If the movie had been a carbon copy of the book, it would have been totally predictable, and that would have killed any suspense the movie would have generated. And it IS suspenseful. Tim Curry's Pennywise was all right, but he never felt particularly threatening. Skarsgård's Pennywise is vicious, relentless, bloodthirsty, and menacing. Some of his lines are blackly humorous, but he's not a figure of fun the way Curry's Pennywise was. This Pennywise is a genuine monster. Imagine if Heath Ledger's Joker and Freddy Krueger had a baby, and you wouldn't be too far off the mark.There was plenty of creepiness and suspense, as befitting a horror movie, but there was a lot of refreshing - and extremely funny - humor, particularly from Wolfhard's Richie. Not many movies have made me laugh as hard, or as many times, as this one did. There were also a lot of touching moments, made all the more effective by the genuine chemistry shared by the actors.A few minor caveats: The film is sometimes a bit too reliant on jump scares and loud music. Some of the parts that are meant to be frightening are a bit (unintentionally) humorous. Bowers and his gang felt a bit under-used and undeveloped. But these are quibbles. It excels in just about every way, more than making up for its few small flaws.This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a solid 10.",It

Pros: -the design and feel of the movie are amazing -this is super well shot, every single scene can be a wallpaper -Acting is top notch -The main villain is one of the greatest of all time, he was made to play this role. He is funny, scary, and really manages to get you invested in this film. Cons: -1st part feels like a montage. I think this is the way the got to do character development, but it breaks the mood as it feels like you're watching ""kid 1 scene"" and ""kid 2 scene"" -I didn't really like some CGI, it didn't look funny or scary, just weird and like it didn't belongOverall, I found this movie really enjoyable, if you start to lose interest midway, keep watching as it Is totally worth it.

1560,marioqpineda,Really good horror film and adaptation although not great.,7,17 September 2017,"IT could've have been great if it had had a darker tone.Using the character's psychological aspect and making the antagonist use those vulnerabilities against them while putting a touch of horror with a dark sadistic humor for him to work with kind of reminds you of child's play, nightmare on elm street (original) or the new series from Netflix's stranger things which is great. It has creepy scenes nevertheless but it's not going to scare you to death.The movie makes you care about the characters whether it is in the horror dark humor kind like IT was or the awesome friendship between the losers club where each had their own time to show bravery in addition to their great acting.Some use of jumpscares were bothersome and unnecessary because there were scenes that didn't need it since they already had horror shots there with an eerie atmosphere without the use of those types of sounds. Some creature designs (two at the most if memory doesn't fail me) were not scary and although the ending was really good, there might've been a way for them to have made it more creepy and horrific given the place they had at their disposal.This movie is really a 7.5 but here you can leave only closed ratings which is why I'm giving it a 7.

It really was about time.I had high expectations of the film, but knew I'd be left disappointed because I'd already heard from some other friends who'd seen special previews way before the release. I wanted a complete horror that made it to my number one and made me go ""Yes, that's it (excuse the pun). That's the pinnacle"". Alas, I didn't get to that point.It was funny in parts, it was scary in parts and it was heartwarming too. I found myself connecting with the characters more so than the original TV episodes from 1990, particularly that of Beverley Marsh.Some have said the comedy was too much - I disagree. The comedy was about right, but the problem I had was that it seemed drawn out with not enough horror and gore to go along with everything else.I'm still debating whether or not Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise was scarier than Tim Curry's. It was different, as you would expect, yet the former didn't strike a chord with me like the latter. However, I feel (I hope!) there will be more from him as this was Chapter One after all.If you've never seen ""It"" in any incarnation, watch the 1990 mini-series first.Is it worth going to the cinema to see this?

1562,rosshumble,About As Subtle And Composed As A Brick To The Face,1,24 November 2017,"This film is just appalling terrible. The fact that it sits at (currently) above 7 makes me shocked and appalled at audiences today. This is not It. This isn't even close to It. This is a collection of awful and generic chase sequences each with a small gimmick. The subtlety and the idea of mental torture is completely cast aside for cheap and generic horror film cliche's. Pennywise (in my opinion) was portrayed near perfectly in the original TV production by Tim Curry, Pennywise has charisma, a twisted sense of humour and a way of manipulation that is truly frightening. This rendition of Pennywise is pathetic. A good example would be the famous drain scene. In the original; Pennywise uses his charm and puts on a friendly face and tone to lure Georgie in, he makes sure to always stay in a position where he doesn't appear scary in any way, this makes Georgie let his guard down so Pennywise can go in for the kill. In this film however... throughout the scene Pennywise is sat in the darkness with bright evil eyes, drooling and speaking as creepily and pedophile-like as possible. In no universe would this ever work on a child, he looks like an evil monster living in the sewer, this completely destroys the idea of Pennywise being a charismatic killer who draws kids in with jokes and an almost self mocking persona, not unlike what a pedophile would do.Pennywise is not a stupid monster who chases children every other scene just attempting to be creepy in any way. He mocks people from a distance, messes with their minds when they are alone and vulnerable (without jump scares or chase sequences). The horror moments, if you could even call them that, are pathetic, generic and predictable. The only enjoyable quality of this film are the children, well some of the children... particularly Finn Wolfhards character who just steals every scene he is in and kept me from walking out on this piece of crap film.",It

They used CGI for pennywise because there is no way some of those effects could be done practically .Pennywise actor Bill skarsgard could roll his eyes and move them without CGI as stated in interviews!

This is a movie i was (of course) waiting for quite some time to be honest. It is overall a very OK shot movie, with some takes and planes that really stood out. The cinematography wasn't something particularly different from other films of the genre, but i allow myself to say that it was pretty decent and i really can't complain. One of the things this movie will probably be most remembered for are the casting choices and the lead children's performances. It is hands down the best feature of the film. Seeing how every single kid gave and amazing performance was not only the base of the idea this movie was intending for, but a pretty refreshing situation that i was really enjoying watching at the big screen. I have hardly no complaints regarding the kids except for maybe one or two brief moments that it drop down a little. However, have that being said it wasn't a flawless movie. I do have some issues with one of the antagonistic forces of the films known as 'the bully' Henry Bowers. He isn't actually mentioned once as a ""bully"" but the reality is that his character is so poorly fleshed out that calling him ""the main bully"" basically summons up his entirely personality. The movie tried to give a compelling backstory to make the audience care for him but it really didn't do much.My last point that i want to explain is that even though the performance of Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise was very good and fit his character perfectly, the decisions made regarding the approach of how the film was going to deal with the character ultimately made a good antagonist but it sacrificed the Horror theme of the movie almost completely. Overall a film that when i finish watching i was eager to see again, and i will rate this one a 7.5/10",It
1565,steeleamy,It was okay but miniseries is better,5,17 September 2017,"Even though it's dated and the ending is cheesy, I like the 1990 miniseries much better. This adaptation is okay, but that's about it. The acting is fine and so is the cinematography. I thought it relied too much on jump scares and CGI in my opinion. Bill Skarsgard is a decent Pennywise, but the heavy use of CGI ruined the character. Tim Curry's Pennywise was funny, cynical, and scary all at the same time. I may be biased here because I'm a fan of Curry. To be honest, the scenes with Bev and her father made me way more uncomfortable than any of the Pennywise scenes. I won't go into detail because I don't want to give out any spoilers. I know a lot of people are complaining about the use of profanity by the kids, but that didn't bother me. A lot of people are complaining about the overuse of jump scares and CGI. That didn't bother me as much as it did others. It just left me disappointed. What bothered me the most was the sexualization of Bev. I know people are going to call me a ""femenazi"" or a ""snowflake"" for saying this, but it's how I feel. In the miniseries, Bev was an average geeky child. You could tell the boys were interested in her and it didn't require her to be in her underwear. I'm sorry but it just made me feel icky. No disrespect to the actress, but I hate how she was portrayed in this version of IT. Also, the comments I'm seeing about her looks just adds to the ick factor for me. All in all, 2017 IT isn't terrible, but it's not great either. I'll just stick to the original 1990 miniseries.",It
1566,danrodwalker,More then just a horror movie.,10,4 November 2017,Every once in a while a horror movie comes out which actually got me more interested and invested in the characters more than the actual horror. Each one of this child predominate cast receives there own show time in this movie so you get more invested and become hooked to what you are watching. Unlike the first IT this movie is graphic and isn't afraid to show kids getting murdered which is kind of refreshing as in most movies they are usually put in a shell made of titanium and nothing can even get close to hurting them. In summary this movie was a masterpiece which will become a classic and deserves it.,It
1567,markrickert,A fresh take on a movie who's genre is over saturated with cliché scares and awful plots.,9,27 September 2017,"It's very good. As I watched this movie I obviously tried comparing it to the original IT film. I was both surprised and shocked by the similarities and differences between the two films. Is it scary? Yes and no. This isn't your run of the mill cliché horror movie filled with constant jump scares and a predictable plot. This movie is what I would consider a very well done reboot of an older movie. The characters in this film were expertly picked and perfectly played and portrayed. The reason I gave this movie a 4 and a half out of five stars is because its not very scary at all. That's not to say it wasn't suspenseful. it was filled with tension and suspense. There were very few jump scares but it is still scary. Another reason I am giving it 4 and a half out of five stars is because the movie will be split into 2 parts. the original IT movie was almost 3 hours if I can remember correctly. The movie covered the story of Pennywise the clown terrorizing the town of Derry when the characters were both children and adults. The new IT movie covers only the events that occurred during the lives of the characters when they were children. Now granted, the new film is absolutely terrific, but I am a little nervous to see how they will do the sequel to the newest IT film. I hope they don't drag it out and fill it with reboot/sequel crap. Overall, IT (2017) is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend it. 4.5/5 stars. Must Watch!",It

Heard that it was a real horror movie, with scary parts in it, unfortunately it wasn't. The thing I like about IT was the role of Pennywise played by Bill Skarsgård. This, for me, unknown actor showed some great acting skills. Think we will hear about him in the future! Because of the acting skills of Bill Skarsgård and the feeling from the old IT I gave a 6. If I needed to give it stars only for the script and production I would give it a 5.",It
1572,tonyscelentano,Nearly perfect with minor drawbacks,8,21 October 2017,"As a big Stephen King fan who knows that his books are often poorly represented on the screen, I was pleasantly surprised by this film.It wasn't perfect - they could have included more source material in the film, but the child actors nailed their roles. There's a few moments where you might think ""My god, Richie ruining another serious scene with his wisecracks, why did they write so many childish jokes into dramatic scenes?"", but that's how Richie acted in the books as well.Bill Skarsgard did an excellent job as Pennywise - it was sort of obvious that Skarsgard drew influence from Heath Ledger's Joker, more than Tim Curry's Pennywise. Skarsgard's mannerisms and way of speaking as Pennywise, was very much Heath Ledger as the Joker - not identical, as Skarsgard had his own unique performance, but the influence was certainly palpable.The movie itself wasn't very scary - there were a few creepy scenes and minor jump-scares, but it wasn't as terrifying as The Conjuring films, for example. But that's okay, because my biggest fear for this film was that they would turn it into a horror-movie about a scary clown. And they almost did that, disappointingly, but they didn't make the entire movie revolve around this killer-clown eating little children. They did manage to capture the childhood fears and isolation the children felt from the adults of Derry, that was more prominent in the books.Overall, its a good film - if you've read the book, don't expect too much. They changed a lot of the source material while keeping the most important parts. But its enjoyable enough.",It
1573,margaridamgrusso,Most satisfying horror movie,9,21 October 2017,"*beware of mild spoilers*I'm not a cinema expert. Let's just take that out of the way.I'll start by saying that the way we analyze movies usually boils down to our initial expectations of the movie vs what the movie turned out to be.There are aspects that I won't cover much here as I don't have enough knowledge to evaluate them.I classify horror movies by good or bad according to: 1. How many times I was ""jump scared"" 2. How the horror lingers after the movie finishes3. The type of horror/scares the movie provides 4. The plot/ the coherence of the story5. The meaning the movie conveysLet's start then!1. Not many - and I didn't have to pretend I had some important message to read on my phone during a tension building scene. The scares are predictable for the most part. The true horror of the movie lies deeper.2. The way the movie ends cleans up the majority of those nasty images. They take us on a journey with the characters and we feel quite empowered in the end. I only had one nightmare. Okay, two.3. The first horror scene is absolutely traumatizing for me. It made me feel so sick to see such innocence being corrupted. We're talking about a bunch of kids here, with whom we immediately relate and connect to. To see them suffer in such a vile way is disturbing. My favorite type of horror movie is not the thousand-jumpscares-per- minute type of movie. If you hear a loud sound or see something move in the dark, you get scared because - well, obviously, years of running in the wild from all kinds of predators have imprinted that in our brains. So using that too much on a movie is taking the easy way. Now, creating something that terrifies you after you process it in your very advanced brain - now that is true mastery in horror for me.4. The plot seemed convincing to me. There was a little of underdevelopment in Pennywise's background but I assume they will cover that in the next movie, as this is only chapter I. The kids all have their own context, some were more developed than others but you only get so much screen time. In the end, some questions remained but I felt they gave us enough to want to see more. The movie also had a good pace and they center the story on each of the kids' fears, their friendship, and the growing menace of Pennywise.5. This is my favorite part. The movie has a good balance between metaphors and obviousness. They tell us that Pennywise is the representation of the kids' fears, and you can see him emerge every time the kids are put in situations that make them afraid. With a few exceptions of course. Bill was obsessed about his brother, and this was his own mourning journey. His friends were struggling too but Bill seemed to be the only one who actually was ready to let go. By chasing that hope of being at peace, he dragged his friends to face their own fears.Conclusion: The cast is amazingly good. I never cringed during the movie, everything flows very well. It scared me at times and some of the scenes terrified me by their underlying meaning. In the end, it was very satisfying to see how they manage to overcome their fears. I'm not afraid to give a 10 to a movie and I'd certainly watch it again. Is it a masterpiece of horror? Again, it all boils down to what you expect from a movie. This one ticked all my boxes, so I'm giving It a 10 ;)",It

But an accident sets fire on the entire hall room. It burns everything, all the people, all the cute laughing faces of the children. But the dancing clown of the show who had heavy paint all over his face and baggy cloths on him, manages to escape the fire. Out of the hall he jumps into a sewer to put the fire of his body. Later, instead of showing up above, he stays down the sewer. Cos he realizes it was he who was responsible for the fire. He could not show his face to anybody cos what he had done. Neither could he forgive himself.The clown never forgot the melting face of the children. Which he never wanted. He wanted to all the children smile and laugh. That was his fantasy, that's what he still wants. But he could not come above ! Because the above world reminds him of that horrible event.So being a vigilante he starts kidnaping kids one by one using his charisma. He takes them down the sewer and looks them up in a cage. He tells them jokes, serves them nice food and cloths, dances in front of them. Just for one reason ! he wants to see them smiling and laughing. He succeds for first few times but then the kids starts getting desperate to go home. The clown insists. He would do anything, bring them anything but they can't leave him. He want's them to SMILE. The kids soon realizes they are in deep trouble.The clown plans to bring some more kids into his show. But this time he makes a 
 little mistake. He tries to lure a kid whose brother was already captivated by him. The kid was too smart and realized what happened to his brother. He runs back to home.He tries to explain this to his and all the children's parents but no one believes him. So he decides to rescue his brother on his own. Down the sewer, the three captivated kids also tries to trick the clown in different way to escape form. But the clown is super smart (and scary). He is not easy to be fooled. So, this time the kids takes a different approach. They asks the clown to bring them strange things for them, like cartoon dvds, toys, video games, carrots etc. Their plan was to keep the clown busy so they can find way escape.

As for reasons for why, this movie got 1 out of 10 star rating is because; there were to many characters to keep track on (where most of the time I couldn't remember which kid was which). 
The romantic use of the movie was to young and forced, when you think about the kids age. 
The movie took hours (literally), to be finished and by the time it was over, I was left thinking ""why the fuck did I waste 2 hours of my time for this shit?"" (which is not a good thought to have for a movie that was higly raved about. 
And lastly, the more 'Pennywise' was shown in the movie, the more used I got to see him as a fucked up character, than a 'paranormal' beeing (WHICH IS NOT THE POINT OF A HORROR MOVIE!).

1598,miroslavtrcak,A King's masterpiece came to life,10,1 June 2019,"I remember the time when I watched IT TV-series, somewhere in the 90s, back then, as a child, I was not so scared. There were some scary scenes but on the top, I didn't find Tim Curry's Pennywise scary. He was more of a clown than some evil entity.
But this one.... This one represents the pure masterpiece regardind the scares and the fact that it really creates that kind of ""childish scare atmosphere"" and dives into our maybe long forgotten childish fears.
Andy Muschietti did an excellent job with this remake. The directing was beyond great. All the children are real professionals in this, beside that, they really were afraid while shooting some of the scenes.
And regarding the Pennywise character, Bill Skarsgård was the best choice for this role. He's young and athletic, he was able to execute some of the scenes without any CGI. His appearance, lip trick, his physicality and his ""lazy eye"" brought so much into the character that can be seen and can be forgotten.Regarding the spoilers, I really don't know why making the fuss about it. Every King's fan had read the book and he knows what's gonna happen or at least they watched TV-series. It must be different because Andy and Bill are unique.

1600,ajlingen,"Not flawless, but still an enjoyable thrill ride",8,10 September 2020,"(I have a pretty high tolerance to horror, so I wrote this review assuming you can handle something like Paranormal Activity (2007)) Here's my biggest complaint about this movie: I feel that It (2017) could have been scarier.To me, this movie tries WAY too hard to be scary, and you can tell. For example: this movie relies too heavily on jumpscares, so after you've memorized all of them, the film isn't really scary anymore. They also added creepy children voices singing a nursery rhyme in the background every now and then in an attempt to build up the atmosphere (which I feel could have been executed a little better).There is 1 scene at the beginning of the movie that I thought was scary, and that was Georgie's death. I know I said I have a pretty high tolerance to horror, but the death of innocent people under the age of 20 (in movies) always disturbs me. The build up was brilliant, even though Georgie's reaction to seeing Pennywise wasn't very realistic (realistic as in a 6 year old probably would've been sprinting away in fear in real life, so I'm not saying the acting was bad). But even this scene wasn't flawless; if I had my arm bitten off, I would probably have a more severe reaction than Georgie.Putting all that aside, I would say this is a good gateway horror movie for anyone wanting to get into horror. And I would even recommend this movie to horror fans (even though there are several horror movies WAAAY scarier than this).Overall, I like this movie. The story is entertaining, the acting is great and convincing (98.8% of the time), the special effects and the soundtrack are good, and the main characters are likable and sympathetic (to me at least).Final Score: 7.75/10",It

Kudos to Benjamin Wallfisch for an excellent score!When I watch a movie, one gauge is how often I say, ""THAT wouldn't happen!"" or ""Why would he do THAT?"" or ""REALLY??"" When the believability suffers, the whole movie suffers.At most, the new IT had one small moment like that, but it was very small. Overall, I give it an A! 🎈",It

1610,LVK279,BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!,10,15 May 2019,"If I could give this movie more than 10 stars, I would. I love this movie to death. I honestly watch it every single night (no joke) and I'll never get sick of it. It's incredible to me how much you feel for the characters and how fast you fall in love with them in just two hours. I've watched a lot of movies and never felt so connected to the characters as much as I did with the film. Even though it's a horror movie, the movie focuses on friendship and teaches the audience that when you stick together, you can overcome any evil.This movie is not like your average horror movie where there are pointless jump scares every 5 minutes that take away from the plot. In most horror movies, there is a monster and towards the end, the characters defeat it and that's that. There isn't anything you take away after watching those movies and there isn't really any theme or point to it other than the fact that you were scared. This film however, is different. IT has a story behind it and Andy Muschietti (the director) portrays that beautifully. It's about the loss of innocence and childhood and the harsh reality of growing older. It's a story of love and the power of friendship. The kids are stronger when they are united. The kids were all together while fighting Pennywise and that's why they survived. The film has heart and that's something that you don't see a lot in horror movies especially nowadays. The Loser's Club have a bond unlike any other. The relationship between the kids does not feel forced like a lot of movies and you can tell they're best friends off screen too.Many horror movies I've watched take place in a house and that gets kind of boring to see. A lot of horror movies don't pay much attention to landscapes, visuals and don't give enough attention to location & the cities where they were filmed. This isn't the case in this movie. You can really see how beautiful the cinematography and visuals are (the quarry, the barrens, etc).If someone doesn't like this film, they say it is because it wasn't scary enough. If the film were scarier and had more jump scares, it would've lost a lot of its heart and wouldn't have connected with audiences as much. I think the film does a perfect job at being scary and it even made me laugh a lot which made it even better. It had a great balance to it. The humor was genuinely funny and didn't feel forced. It also very accurately portrayed how a group of friends act with one another in real life.I remember crying in the theater when Bill sees Georgie's rain coat and finally accepts the fact that he lost his little brother. His friends come together to hug and comfort him. That was so beautiful. When Stan is being attacked by Pennywise in the shape of the woman from the painting, the kids rescue him, and he says ""you left me alone, you're not my friends."" All the kids start crying and those were real tears as said in the director's commentary. The kids love and care for each other and they are a lot weaker when they are left all alone. That made the movie so much more meaningful for me.I cant even begin to express how amazing the cast was. Bill Skarsgård does a phenomenal job as Pennywise. Many people complained that he wasn't acting scary enough and acting childish. What people don't understand is that he has to have that childlike quality. That childlike quality is what he uses to lure the kids in. Pennywise has become my favorite movie character and they couldn't have found a more perfect person to play him. The Loser's Club all gave excellent performances and you could tell they really formed a bond on screen and off.The attention to detail and the little easter eggs throughout the film is truly remarkable. Throughout the movie, there are little hints that Pennywise is always watching the kids. When Ben is flipping through the book on the history of Derry, you can see Pennywsie in the back left in one of the pictures. When the boys are helping Ben with his wounds, you can see a drawing of Pennywise on the wall towards the end of that scene.This movie is truly incredible!",It
1611,dhilouothman,You think that it is horror film but you should be deep to understand it,10,13 June 2019,It is not a horror film it is a science fiction film but in the picture of an horror film it gives you an idea about how those people that you think that they're stupid and they can't do anything someday they could save your life (losers club) so before you judge something you should think one more time and change your vision,It
1612,nicksmith-31110,Great movie with some flaws,8,29 June 2019,"This movie is an amazing horror movie compared to the original mini series which relied on the viewers imagination with the gore and violence, not to say that the original is bad because of that reason its just a different boat when it comes to horror its a transition from old to new. The flaws in this movie are quite obvious to most viewers and by the reviews iv seen its not hard for fans to not turn a blind eye because it doesn't follow the book. But i think this is a flaw argument and here's why, do we all remember the shining. A classic book from stephen king which was adapted by stanley kubrick to make one of the best pieces of cinema arguably ever and it was nothing like the book. The hotel didnt burn down, there was no hedge maze and not only that there was no redeemable qualities to jack in the movie, but its littered in the book. My point is sometimes media needs to be adapted into its own thing otherwise it becomes stale and you'll just realise oh iv seen this before in the book iv read so why see it again in cinema. Originality is key to success if your doing what everyone expects, it's going to disappoint plus did you really want scenes of child orgys i didnt think so. Let's talk about the CGI some of the worst CGI iv seen in a movie maybe not as bad as babadook but that was a very indie low budget movie but it also doesn't matter for that movie because its a great movie it just ruins the suspense build up and thats about it the story still goes on the story telling still works and so who cares if your suspense Boner was blown for a split second you can't just say its bad because of that one bit seriously these were the only issues i could pull up and thats why its 8/10 for me because 2 flaws with some many things going right deserves to reflect that in the rating everyone saying the movies bad because it doesn't resemble the book have no idea about cinema and never will stick to your books they're better in your eyes anyway.",It
1613,rickbaijens,Well i'm sad,10,30 June 2019,"Wow wow wow, don't judge by the title! This movie... I can't even think of the perfect word for how great It: Chapter one is! Some of you guys won't believe me: I watched it 11 times. I got a lot of Funko Pop's from It, even the 3 'limited Chase editions', I got 3 Neca Replica's and I've made some things, like fan-art, myself. But there is one problem. I'm only 14 years old. When chapter one came out I was 12. So I can't watch the movie in the cinema! Welp, I can't change it I guess. One of the biggest fans in The Netherlands gotta wait. I mean, I can deal waiting for Annabelle coming home or Chucky playing with childs. But a clown who turns into *SPOILER*?! C'mon, I've also read the book! By the way, you guys delivered good work Andy and Barbara Muschietti!",It
1614,peterdtguy,In name only,1,7 July 2019,"The original source material was let down by verbosity and a poor ending but the heart of the story remains solid, one of King's best. What was required was a suitable medium to play out the backstory of these characters, to get to the real heart of the novel. Surely a miniseries would have been the way to go? Ramming everything into two hours, the filmmakers made only token reference to the novel and then made the rest up as they went along. The result is a movie played for jump scares and characters so rushed and faceless, it's hard to tell who is who. Another issue is switching the timeline from the late fifties to the late eighties. What, people nowadays wouldn't be able to reference the fifties? Or is this a sop to the Stranger Things demographic? Everything I enjoyed in the book: the sense of time and place, the dialogue, Mike's relationship with his father, the underground clubhouse and smoke ritual, hell, nearly all the activities that bonded the kids together... all that was jettisoned. What's left is just a so-so jump scares horror movie for people with either an aversion to plot or with attention deficit disorder. So for anyone who read the book beforehand, you are gonna be disappointed. Terrible stuff and worse, profitable. This will probably lead others to take a similar approach, sadly enough.",It

The movie did not make sense at all, there were random scenes here and there and the most interesting one of all is the opening scene.

1626,bridalavega,Not so scary,7,10 March 2021,"As a suspense film it is good, it is not my style of film, but as it was being much talked about at the time and I wanted to watch more of Stephen King's works, I decided to see it. The quality of the effects, script and performance are really undeniable, but I didn't find it as scary as I heard so much saying, in fact I laughed more during the film than anything else, mainly because of the constant mistakes made by the children, who in a moment they said to do such a thing and seconds later they did another ... Actor Bill Skarsgård was great as 'IT', he understood and represented the character very well. Even children, have a great future as actors, because they also knew how to give themselves to each character. But I expected something much more frightening, which did not happen, so, for me, it is more of a tension and suspense film than of horror. In Game of Thrones there were scenes that disturbed me a lot more ... I never got to read the book, but based on what I've already read from Stephen King, surely the mistake of this adaptation, as of all others, is the lack of sensitivity when trying to translate the internal tensions, feelings and conflicts that each character goes through and that gives the whole tone of his stories, because when trying to adapt them, this always seems to be forgotten, they focus too much on trying to put frightening external elements, that jump to each scene, instead of showing what is really scary in King's stories, which are the internal demons that each character discovers about theirselves and how it affects them, with and despite the monsters around them. For those who like this style of film, they will certainly like it, but for those who are interested in reading the books before, watch without waiting too much, just as another film to be distracted.",It

Mick:We are going to review, ""IT"" (heavy echo on ""IT"").
Kurt: It scares me when you do that.
M: Yeah, As well should.
K: About a group of kids who refer to themselves as the losers.
M: No, Losers?
K: Yeah, they are being bullied. They form this bond because they're a bunch of kids that are being picked on by bullies. In the meantime, kids disappearing because this entity or the spirit, how to really put it, this monster is after them.
M: We don't know what's after them, could be a disease. It could be a re-education program... free college.
K: This a Stephen King book. For those who don't know or haven't really been paying attention.
M: Did you really have to bring it up, Stephen King? What isn't?
K: Also. In 1990, they did a version of this. That was on TV.
M: Tim Curry, yeah.
K: Tim Curry was awesome. He was very he was very woman like and funny, I think, in the movie.
M: Here is a question for you. What was this voice like?
K: It was like the joker, the more modern Joker.
M: TV? Oh, not TV
K: More like Heath Ledger
M: I can go with that.
K: Tim Curry was more, Rocky Horror Picture Show.
M: Of course. I was more theatrical.
M: This one was a little bit heeheehee (mick does funny joker laugh).
K: Also, they didn't show anybody dying in the first one. They didn't show any blood. They didn't show anything. It was very clean.
M: They didn't show any blood in this one either. None. I couldn't believe it. How did they get away with that?
K: Still worked.
M: Yeah, it's still worked. That's it. I was terrified. It was like a haunted house. It was Nightmare on Elm Street 3. There was a huge homage all the way along. I mean, I must say that I did appreciate that. I had an homage to ME, one of my favorite sets that I built actually did show up again in this one. So, you know..
K: I was a little concerned that you were going to storm out of the movie at one point,
M: I'm like that. You know what? I was like Oh My God, you ripped me off
K: Why am I thinking about Nightmare on Elm Street 3, oh right, because it looks like it.
M: Oh, that looks exactly like that. That's right. And the story is going that way.
K: Even the tunnels look like uh
M: yeah and we're in tunnels that are hallways.
K: They're running through a house. Yeah.
M: They were running... Did we need the house and the tunnels is the question?
K: No,.
M: No, I didn't think so. I you know, I really thought to myself that the House didn't need to be there?
K: Well, that's interesting you say that..
M: Ancillary..
K: In the 1990 version, the clean version, the less scary,.
M: The less Scary version.
K: The reason I say that is because it's the tone was just very light. This one was a little more dark, which matches the look.
M: It was incredibly dark. There was maybe a lot of blood used here.
K: You mentioned the house, though. I want to go back to that real quick. They should have just been in the sewer the whole time. They're already playing by the river, why didn't they go into the sewer?
M: Well you see, and the thing that kind of bothered me is that the house was THE overdone, a haunted house, it was waaaay overdone. You were you were actually expecting Scooby Doo to come out. You know, it was like.
K: Zoiks!
M: Zoiks! Exactly. You're expecting to see a dog in the front yard try and run five different ways only stuck together by its tail. I thought that a lot of the rest of the we were trying to make the 80s look like the 60s.
K: Because it was originally in the 60s.
M: Possibly. It was an homage to the 60s. You don't homage a decade. You just don't do that.
K: They showed a certain object that has wheels on it was in the book and it was also a the 1990 version.
M: Oh, it was?
K: SFX ""High Ho Silver""
M: Oh, geez. Why was why was that there three times? Here's the thing, when we saw third time I expected it to burst into flames. I didn't know what the hell was going on. Let's go back to just in encapsulating the feel that this film got. I I definitely had this Stranger Things vibe going on, Stand by me, smashed together with Nightmare on Elm Street 3. Very little humor.
K: It basically had everything we'd seen before.
M: Exactly! They threw it all in.
K: There weren't a lot of surprises, but the tone was awesome it was a very dark tone
M: the tone was dark in the very beginning, the way that we were being hit. You know, every five minutes, boom, boom, boom, we were hit with a scare. It was building up to a bigger story in the end. In that way, reminded me of the Nightmare on Elm Streets, just because we had this big problem to solve. I'm not going to say what problem was. But we had this big problem. There is going to be this huge culminating place. I was asking myself, what is the place that we're going to see this all come together, you know? Where is Freddy's hell?
K: I watched the TV series from 1990 two days before we watched this one. Probably not a good idea.
M: I'm an ""IT"" Virgin.
K: I was disappointed, it was flat, but also that there wasn't a lot of character development. This one had a lot of good dialogue with the kids. It was natural.
M: It was Stand by Me.
K: Which was based on a Stephen King book by the way, called ""The Body"".
M: You don't have to throw that at me. There's no reason I need to know that.
K: It was a story, wasn't really book... In this one... I feel like they're using a lot of old tricks, like blood for example.
M: There was a strong practicality all to all the effects. I love that that we're playing with gravity we're playing with blood A lot, you know, blood is running up, blood is running sideways.
K: Reminded me of some series that I've seen before. What was that? Where I saw a lot of blood dripping up?..oh Nightmare on Elm Street!
M: I see a theme running through all this. Blood was doing everything. It was messing with gravity. It was going out to the stores picking up some milk. See, you didn't think I could bring that one back around, did you?
K: Wow!, you just blew my mind. What did you think of Bill Skarsgård?
M: He did poorly. I was put off by his voice at the beginning. And I and I still by the time I was done. I kept thinking to myself that he was huffing on helium around the corner.
K: Well, he was a clown.
M: Well, Yeah.
K: Tim Burton had even more affect on his voice.
M: Yeah.
K: Not Tim Burton, what did I just say?
M: Tim. Tim Burton. You mean Tim Curry.
M: Tim Curry had quite an affect on his voice.
K: If Tim Burton played Pennywise, that would be really interesting.
M: That would be.
K: Actually, that might work.
M: Yeah. You have to understand that we're both looking each other. We both looked at each other and said that might have worked.
K: One problem with the movie that drove me crazy a little bit. There's a character in this one where, he's not really there for the whole movie. More than half of the way in he becomes part of the group. He's the African-American kid. I'm thinking in a Trump society, why did they push the black man out? Because in the 1990 version, he was in there from the very beginning. He was always the one that was into the history of the town and help drive the story.
M: This is this is the trouble with trying to make a story. Trying to film a very complicated book. You can't, it goes many different ways. You have a very limited amount time to tell that story. The problem is, is it they tend to leave little tendrils in that you start cutting off, you know, and you can't get rid of all of it. So you rearrange it the best you can and then you film it.
K: Of course, my solution in my head was like, well, if they're going to cut him out for the first half of the part of the movie, they can just get him out, the whole movie. But then obviously, being the only African-American kid.
M: Yeah.
K: That could be troublesome.
M: I'm agreeing with you.
K: I do love the character development. I think we very talked about how the dialogue was great.
M: The dialogue was great. The action was amazing. The practical effects were amazing. I think that they actually had that mindset where they were using practical effects, before they were using any other effects.
M: Let's sum this sucker up. We both loved the film. I had a feeling that the movement, as you move into it in the very beginning, is like scare, scare, scare. Then we get together and we tell a hell of a story. That's the way I like my movies.
K: The scare, scare, scare was a little bit drawn out a little bit more because you had a tone that made you a little uncomfortable. The whole movie, I thought.
M: There was a lot of tension there built up that the acting was incredible all the way through. The film looked great. Other than the Haunted House.
K: It was like the other character that shouldn't have been there was the haunted house.
M: The fact that they did copy me for the scene where we had the big final. What can I say? Thumbs up all the way around.
K: Andy Muschietti
M: Directing was great.
K: Photography?
M: DP? Absolutely flawless. He got a very he got together, a very stylish look that moved into the horror look seamlessly. We didn't have daylight scenes weren't so bright and that they would blow you away and stuff and I really appreciate the cohesive look of everything.
K: For a Stephen King movie, it's one of my top 3s. I might even maybe well it could even be top 2 it was really good. I was surprised.
M: I'm going to say the same.
K: Overall, I think it's worth seeing for everybody even. Well, even people who are normally in to horror movies might appreciate it.
M: That is one thing for sure. I think that this should have a very broad of a broad appeal.
K: If you like Stand By Me. This is a Stand By Me with quite a twist.
M: Yeah, there you go

Stephan King, known best for being a novelist, made his name in horror andfantasy genres with books like The Shining, Carrie. Horror movies have beenaround for a long time, but is approached differently from the man, Stephan King.King became a famous writer in film history. Movies he made became classics suchas The Shawshank Redemption, and The Dark Tower. In the film IT, by King,viewers of the film enjoy horror and humor being presented by the cast. Heautomatically hooks the attention of viewers by using kids as the cast, changing whatothers have done in the past. He uses a clown as the main villain named penny wiseto draw out the phobia many have for clowns during Halloween. In the moviecharacters Bill and his little brother Georgie are first introduced. Living in Maine, notthinking anything out of the ordinary would happen on a gloomy and rainy day,Georgie makes a paper boat, and follows it down the stream to the gutter. This sceneis where we meet the famous Penny wise. King uses weather to help set the moodthat something terrible is about to come and incorporates it with music which leadsthe audience to infer that something important is going to happen. Georgie is the firstof many kids to be a victim taken by penny wise. The scene transitions over to nextsummer of Bill meeting up with his friends still morning about his brothersdisappearance and wanting to know what had happened to little Georgie. In Billsfriend group the Losers, we have a boy named Eddie who is very cautious andoverprotective. Stan the man the guy who is a huge germaphobe. The new kid Benwho loves Beverly. Richie who thinks he knows everything and Mike thehomeschooled farm kid. Beverly is new to the town of Derry, Maine. She meets Benand Bill after encountering with the bully's who have been falsely spreading rumorsabout her over town. She feels a connection with the group and becomes a ""loser"".The kids begin to have these scary hallucinations of their fears, making themquestion why, and figuring out how it's connected to Georgie. They go after pennywise and are always interrupted by Henry Bowers the bully who wants blood.
This movie set in the 80s, brings the same vibe seen in Strangers things that I enjoy.One thing that makes me enjoy this movie is because it reminds me of times myfriends and I wanted to discover things in the summer, always traveling from oneplace to another on bikes. Making me feel I was unstoppable, like the kids at the endof the movie. Also 80s seemed like a cool time to be around as a kid not having asmany restrictions kids nowadays have during that time. One thing that does upset meabout the film is how they weren't able to kill Pennywise in the first movie. Eventhough the 2nd IT film is entertaining, it doesn't compare to the original. Also I thinkthe reason why IT the original is better that the 2nd is because, he captures thescenes with different angles. One thing that makes me not get bored from watchingthis film are the angles used in different scenes. He makes every scene alwayslook different, by using using low angle lighting, high angle shots and tilts high helpsmake the scenes of the kids visioning their fears from pennywise more dramatic.",It

1636,adammidderigh,I expected more from the great I.T,6,30 March 2020,"--No spoilers here--Granted I'm very late to the party , but having heard a lot about 'I.T' for several years and seen it become a common connotation to the term 'horror film' I was expecting great things when I finally got round to watching. For me personally I now consider the movie to be a bit overrated , but not all bad...I wouldnt call it a terrible or even a bad movie; the acting is pretty great all round, creepy and well executed villain, well shot and nice setting. For me the issue was simply the lack of basic fear factor. In my opinion all good horror movies excel by keeping the source of fear/conflict unknown for a substantial time, these movies build gradual suspense for often nearly half the run time and then take a well paced run up to an adrenaline pumping final quarter. I.T however travels a different path by introducing the source of fear factor very early on, therefore my criticism lies with the fact that in my opinion, this fear did not build or evolve in any way throughout the 2nd half of the movie.My conclusion would be that despite great acting and many staples of a good horror movie, I.T simply isnt really that scary. Worth a watch, but falls short of being a truly scary watch.",It

1638,Tenderbranson01,Competent but Overrated,5,19 December 2017,"For a horror film with so much love, it's really hard not to expect more. The 90's made for tv version starring Tim Curry is remembered fondly by many. While that love isn't totally misplaced, in large part due to Curry, this was a film I really didn't mind having remade and updated for a more savvy audience. This 2017 version really drops the ball in terms of scares. They really had an opportunity to build the mythos of Pennywise, filling his scenes with a real sense of dread and the terror of the unknown. What we wind of getting are scenes that feel shot for a trailer, which are then truncated with a cheap scare, using loud noises and CGI frenzy in place of real atmosphere. This is in no way to undercut the performance of Skarsgard, who seemed to show up with a real character and menace in mind. The film really underserves his ability to frighten. We can't spend any time anticipating what evils might be unleashed, as the studio seems to think the audience is getting bored. 
One of the most frustrating scenes is when we see IT in the basement, coming up out of the water. Just as I'm acquainting myself with the scene and getting into the atmosphere and enjoying the Skarsgard performance, they feel the need to resort to loud bangs, CGI, and then cut to a different scene. They turn a novel idea, (pardon the pun) into a run of the mill, fresh off the assembly line modern horror movie.
The child actors all do a pretty fantastic job, but the streamlined straight forward approach that deviates from the novel does little to allow us to invest in these characters as much as we want. We get all the character beats we should, but they feel rushed, almost like Cliff's notes of what happens to each character. Most of their scenes feel more obligatory than a coming-of-age tale. 
I recognize books and film as two different arts, and I don't hate a movie choice just because it isn't in the source material. They SHOULD differ, as they're two modes of telling a story. But what they did with the story feels a lot more like a studio product than a story anyone cared to tell.
If this is what they had in mind all along, I understand why Cary Fukunaga stepped aside. And after his masterful work in the first season of True Detective, that should throw up some red flags.",It

1640,o-98275,Not as scary as the original,5,30 April 2020,"This was a decent movie, but it wasn't as scary or realistic as the original in my opinion. In the original movie Pennywise becomes what you're afraid of, but in this version he is mostly himself, clown, and barely the things that scare the Loser Club. They seem as if they are trying too hard to make this movie scary. Also the actors seem like they're trying too hard to make their characters seem realistic. We don't connect as easily with the characters as we can with the original movie. In this movie we can already tell what's going to happen next there is no real surprise element in this movie. We could already tell that Billy's motives were to find his brother and simply that. And with Richie he seemed to be really obnoxious and he was really annoying. In the original movie the Loser Club seemed to be closer together than in this movie. It didn't seem as if they had each other's backs as much and like they were more conserved. I feel like the well house was unnecessary and was too much. It didn't add that creep affect as it should have. In my opinion it just made it obvious as to where Pennywise was.",It

She passed before she could see it. RIP Nikkigirlfriday!Nikki disliked the 80's miniseries 2 parter where as I saw it as a instant classic. Her reasoning was it didn't follow the book. I can respect that but it won't change my mind of the joy it feels sitting down and watching the original IT. Then the movie finally came out and I had no clue what to expect.Having Nikki in mind the film started. I would have liked to of seen more technology and ""of the times"" decore and demeanor. Thats one of the things that made the original so charming. Its set choices and designs. The feel of being right there downtown in a small town. The new IT couldn't capture that and I felt it took away from the experience. You have to buy into the idea its a cursed town, not just a monster in a town. That being said, it was entertaining. It just didn't hold the capture ability the original had. Nikki I think would have enjoyed it.Thanks for reading, Peace!",It

The overall plot was excellent, each character developed well, there was a love triangle, there were good examples of true friendship, they showed us fear and showed us the feeling of brotherly love. The good performances of all were spectacular, each character acted quite well, like Pennywise, his performance was spectacular and Bowers' too, as he freaked out at the end of the film was sublime.

1655,byk-86,Why are the Muschietti's allowed to make movies? NO!,7,22 October 2017,"Alright, because Andy Muschietti made a 3 minute short film a few years ago automatically qualifies him as someone who has the knowledge and wits to create a horror film? Are you kidding me? This was a horrible attempt at something that had amazing potential. When you put a liberal- feminist sibling duo as the lead creatives to a beloved novel that for so long has waited for a true adaptation you're going to get nothing but complete horse sh*t. And that's what you got with 'IT. Although some visuals were, I have to admit, breathtaking (extreme wide shots, establishing shots, the detail within the environment, cinematography... etc.), sadly many points in the characteristics of the Loser's Club were unfortunately missed or briefly mentioned (or not even) -- (Bill being a creative type (stories), Mike's interest in Derry (hardly given the light) that would open the door to him staying in Derry as an adult, Eddie's full-blown medical dependence and what happens when he lacks of it, building something together (dam) to form trust and metaphorically establish a sense of unity in accomplishing something when they work together... etc.). I understand that the dam building would have been a little outdated (haha), but the filmmakers could have created something else to fit within that 80s time period -- which was probably the poor attempt at cleaning Bev's blood splattered bathroom as a group (excluding Mike/Richie). The acting was good -- you can really tell the super experienced kid actors to the rookie ones -- the dialogue was perfect and the kiddos did a fantastic job giving that close/comfortable feel within the group (to some extent)-- but witnessing them come together I really didn't feel all that much. They just were. There wasn't that 'Stand By Me' or coming of age feel as advertised - that would have been perfect if the 'dam' aspect was put in. They just happen and because of that you don't see the care and love they have for one another -- that build up. Bill mostly just orders around rather than have the group feel compassion/remorse for what he's dealing with and therefore wanting to stand together and help. The characters also fail to see how special they are as a group and how bonding together can really do damage to the antagonist. They just happen to go and kick Pennywise's ass without really understanding their importance, their transition. Anyone can say 'I'm not scared of you' and that's that -- but make me FEEL it first! The 'loser' aspect of 'The Loser's Club' was a total miss. They all seemed a little too cool to be losers and outcasts. So what if they get bullied? Everyone does, but there is no big sense of being total castaways. Henry and the Bowers gang needed more screen time to really establish themselves as true sadistic antagonists -- pushing kids around just doesn't do that. Skarsgard did a remarkable job as Pennywise and because of that they, the Muschietti's, should have let him do what he does best -- instead the 'filmmakers' attempted to add an extra layer to his performance with CGI, which was dreadful, comical, and extremely damaging to the character.Unfortunately the R-Rating wasn't because of the horror/gore of the film, which really wasn't that special and all that much, but rather the language (f*cks, dick, mama jokes) ultimately contributed in the MPAA decision in giving it an R -- disappointing. The pacing of the story wasn't executed well -- it's all 'scare'-after-'scare' without any time to absorb its effect on the characters and the story. Each scene just goes one to the other without having any emotional impact. All and all -- it could have been darker, taken a little more seriously, and gotten a lot further into the psychological state (which Tim Curry did brilliantly). Cancel any upcoming contracts that both Barbara and Andy Muschietti have lined up because we're going to witness a lot more wasted screen time and upcoming BS from these two unworthy amateurs.",It

The scenes with IT are way over the top. To me 'not knowing/having to fill in some of the horror yourself' is what makes a horror movie stand out. In the first IT films, you knew the names of the characters. With this production I was still guessing who was who at the end of the movie.Verdict: I was entertained by the movie.

1659,wcyee26,The Temptation of Red Balloon,8,28 September 2017,"Not a fan of horror film, but seeing that there are a lot of good reviews on IT, so I decided to take an adventure ride on IT.IT is the concept of darkness and fear. IT might look happy on the outside, just like a clown. Clown is supposed to be a role that cheers you up and makes you forget about your worried mind. Yes, IT has basically fulfilled your need. But, here's a catch, there's a price to be paid.In the film, kids are the representation of innocent and less- polluted-mind. You can say that they know what to do and don't know what to do at the same time. Each of them has their own fear of something, it's a reflection of our lives, some might be afraid of ghost, domestic violence, bullies, weird looking dolls and etc.The film uses many visual representations that only the kids (the awaken one) can be able to SEE the truth of darkness, especially the scene where the bathroom is full of blood. In the opposite, the adults can't SEE. It's not that they can't SEE, they decided not to SEE by ignoring the facts. It's basically trying to convey the meaning that, they are blinded by their numbness. They decided to be selfish and succumb to the darkness, as long as they are not the ""lamb of god"". Adults are the representation of selfishness in this film.Just when you're in the weak position, IT comes in. Here comes the Red Balloon. I personally like how they use the Red Balloon to represent the element of temptation. Red is the colour that draws your attention, and red is also the sign of DANGER. Balloon is the sign of hopes and dreams, indeed, Red Balloon = Dangerous Dream. Every time you see the Red Balloon on screen, you know that something bad is about to happen.Red Balloon is the bridge of temptation between the innocent and the devil. IT will tell you all sort of sweet things. ""You'll float too, you'll float too."", IT said. It's basically like the devil telling you. ""Come to me and I will give you fortune and fame"". But IT didn't tell you, ""You are gonna be my slave."". IT shows the sign of satisfaction when IT conquered you.There are many scenes showing that bad things only happen when you are alone. It's basically saying, you are weak, when you are alone. You must stay together, to stay strong. That's the only way to defeat IT.IT has done a very good job in conveying the educative messages through the medium of visual representations. The use of horror elements is very much appropriate and in place. It's not some B-movies to scare the audience for the sake of scaring. To be honest, I almost floated in the cinema not because of the jump scares from the screen, more likely the scream of audience. And yes, you'll float too.",It

I didn't care what happened to them. The black kid, the fat kid and the girl just kinda join the group. There is no development of the friendship or any kind of emotional bond. *boom* and they're friends. There is no story. It's one jump scare after another interlaced with a ""story"". I put that in quotes because after the story segments we're often left more confused than before. Now to the ""horror"". This wasn't scary. Not even remotely. There was this one dude in the cinema that jumped at every ""scary"" scene, but he was hardly someone that could be considered a normal person. The effects are mostly done with CGI and are HORRIBLE. They're so bad they border on the point of COMEDIC and yes, I did laugh out loud several times during the movie. Most of the scares are either done with loud music and fast sudden movement to startle you or ""scary"" disfigured corpses that look like wax dolls made in a kindergarten class.That's all it is.

One of my favorite scene was when they were throwing rocks at Bowers and his buddies while that loud metal music was playing. Such a thrill!The reason I gave this movie 9/10 and not 10/10 was just because Ben(the chubby one) got really hurt during his adventures in Derry and he was perfectly okay.

But IT goes way beyond. In the 90's version Tim Curry scared the hell out of me, so after I read a comment by King on twitter expected it to be way scarier. Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise is visually terrifying there is no denying. Those eyes and voice, but the scary factor for me was too obvious. Despite this I can honestly say is a great movie. Loved how horror and fun got mixed well, and all of those references. There are some differences between this film and Stephen King's novel, but nothing that would affect the development of the story. No I didn't miss the sex scene, It worked great without it.

1681,Jenkins12349,A clown molested by CGI does not a good reboot make.,5,22 September 2017,"Seldom do I feel the need to review a film but for IT I make the exception. After an extreme amount of hype from critics and friends alike I went in somewhat hopeful, alas it appears the bell grade is based on nostalgia in this bleak age of remakes and not merit. The film starts strongly enough ,let's poor one out for poor Georgie. Unfortunately the films somber tone doesn't carry on at least in terms of horror. While pennywise is frightening enough when kept to the shadows it's when he's truly revealed that the dread falls flat, not because of the score or the actor which are both fantastic, but because of the films need to superimpose his movements through CGI, yes the film makers went for a gamble in making his movements less than human, but instead of relying on Bill's obvious talent to do so himself, employed computer graphics instead, which made his appearance somewhat laughable. The films strength lies in its coming of age tale, and in this it truly does thrive, leaving very few of it's core cast to the side line ,though there's always one, oh Stan you whiny bastard, why couldn't you have just died. From bullying, isolation and parental abuse/neglect, the film covers all bases and it does it well. A mash of the two genres which should glue together but in this instance doesn't. It's unfortunate because the possibility for a great film was there. But the reliance of jump scares leaves little to the imagination.",It

1700,jessloseby,Watch it.,9,19 October 2021,"Q: How do get a person in a weird clown suit to be scary?A : Find out, then understand why so many people fear clowns and use it to scare everyone!This is a fantastic film and a brilliant interpretation of the book . - I loved Tom Curry as Pennywise in the older version but Bill Skarsgard's puts 110% into the slightest body movement and so his multifaceted performance comes together and creates truly scary predator.All the kids are simply awesome actors - believable, funny and heart wrenching. Even so, I think four young actors stand out although it's not fair to say which, as it's the group as a whole is what makes them mesmerising. I think they are even better than the kids in 'stand by me ', the excellent film interpretation of 'The Body', a SK short story and that's always set the bar for a group of young actors for me.I started stealing my older brothers stephen king books when I must have been around ten - and was blown away again and again by the way SK understands people - particularly kids - and as such why and how they come to fear (or how something causes them to fear). Horror , I think , is the extreme version of that fear. As I got older, time and time again i watched, mortified As 50% of film or TV adaptations of SK stories messed up. In the ones that succeeded usually the horror was not what would be traditionally thought of as such ( e.g the horror of being falsely imprisoned for life or the child's exciting fear of seeing a dead body at a time of life when mortality is seems as unreal as a fairy story- and its horrible reality .I think so many of adaptations failed because they treated all sk stories as horror stories and not about the people who had fears (which either by horrific circumstances or their own horror lurking in their dark half leads to horror- it doesn't come first) - Carrie (the original version only!) being one of few exceptions for a long time* .My advice for getting the most out of both this film and for chapter 2 is : try and watch it opened minded but most of all , before you watch it remember what scared you as a kid - particularly the things you were scared that now seem a bit silly - but still you were scared anyway - e.g . Like buttons that looked like eyes, or a kid's show that others seemed to like but that gave you the creeps anyway , the painted face of what was just innocuous doll or the gap on an escalator that was far too thin to pull you in but still ...
For many people the film will take you back to that feeling just by allowing it to - but if not, if some bits seem silly - try and remember it and the watch it again. Once you remember the bits some critics have suggested as 'hammy ' will scare you just as much as Pennywise's drooling mouth and changing eyes ....*Even though I adore Kubricks version of The Shining I understand why SK wasn't a fan . Kubrick got the ghost story iconically right - but not the basic, growing human fear that lead to horror...",It

Most of the child actors are OK but there is way too much CGI and cheap jump scares that are not actually all that scary...there is a total lack of psychological terror..which is what made the original so legendary... so my final conclusion: too much CGI, weak dialogue, too much reliance on cheap jump scares and an clown that is not a patch on the original mean that this film ...as much as its box office is ...will never truly test the time... if people keep hyping such bad films Hollywood will only continue its creative decline...the original TV movie was way better!",It

1706,nels782,Writer and Director CLEARLY NEVER READ THE BOOK,1,16 September 2017,"It has become ritual for me to read the novel ""It"" once a year every year since it was released in 1986. The story is more than a gore-fest, it's a story about love and hope and friendship that is still meaningful to me to this day.The only thing this movie has in common with the beloved book, is its name and the characters names. IT is a literal disaster and a slap in the face to anyone who actually read and cherishes the book. There are NO character backstories, nor character development at all. You are literally thrust into the movie expecting to know everything about everyone and why they are the way they are. IE: Henry Bowers and why he hates the ""Losers Club"" - He LITERALLY starts the movie trying to kill them. This is sad, because a large portion of the novel was meticulously spent doing quite the opposite and made you relate to and fall in love with the characters.Editing? What editing? This is the worst edited movie I've ever seen in my life and I've seen a lot in 41 years. It was literally like the film makers shot 100 scenes, put the film in a hat, and took out said scenes and spliced them together at total random. I can't describe it any other way than saying, at one point, one of the characters (I can't tell who, because they all share the EXACT same personality) says, ""I banged your mom last night"", or something similar, and before the audience can even react, the scene changes to a jump scare happening in ANOTHER PART OF TOWN INSTANTLY and with no rhyme or reason. You don't have time to laugh at jokes, because they aren't funny (unlike Stephen King's jokes in the book) - and you don't have time to be scared, because you're still trying to process the dick joke that was still being told when the scene abruptly ended.While the filming location for the town of Derry was suitable, having the movie take place in the 1980's instead of the 1950's JUST TO APPEASE the ""Stranger Things"" crowd was simply a terrible decision. The 1950's were a totally different time, and much of the characters' reasoning and mannerisms that you need to make this movie work are lost to a time and cultural difference. These guys call themselves ""THE LOSERS SQUAD"" in this movie for god's sake! Kids didn't start calling themselves a ""squad"" until the 1980's (IE ""The Monster Squad) So, you love the book like me and are still reading? Thank you! Now let me list just SOME things that we both LOVE about the book that you will NOT find anywhere in this movie: The Deadlights, The Ritual of CHUD, The Mummy and the bridge, The Loser's Club Dam in the Barrens, the moving picture book (now its a slide machine), The Smokehouse, ""This is battery acid"", The Werewolf, Making the silver bullet after a game of monopoly, The stand pipe, Bower's hair turning white, ""beep beep Richie"", the giant bird, the 50's racism against Mike (actually Mike Hanlon himself is missing. The writers just made arguably the most important character an afterthought in this movie), character backstories, ""Hi Ho Silver-AWAY!"", Haystack... I could go on and on and on.With god awful editing, absolutely no character backstories, cheap teen jump scares, not being faithful to the book, and too much CGI usage: Simply put - if you want to know how this movie is like the book, read the first 10 pages of ""IT"", and burn the other 1077 pages because that is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortion.",It

1710,mayberry1307,About as Good as I Expected IT to be...,6,7 January 2018,"I'll start by saying that I'm an avid horror fan and it takes quite a lot for me to truly dislike a scary movie. I'm an easy person to scare and even the dumbest movies can usually get me to jump if they are aiming to do so. Also, horror is probably the easiest genre for film makers to screw up - which they do more often than not. There are very few ""great"" horror movies that have been released over the past 10 years so my expectations are never very high when I go in to see any horror movie. The ones that are overly hyped with huge budgets are usually the worst. Pair that with the fact that this movie is a remake.. Ingredients for disaster. Examples of these failures would be films such as: Poltergeist, Rob Zombies Halloween (both disasters but particularly the sequel), A Nightmare on Elm St, Carrie, Evil Dead.. I could go on and on. So I already predicted that it would bomb even though I had never seen the trailer and had no idea who the cast would be (except for Bill Skarsgard from an article I read) before walking into the movie theater.With all of that in mind, the movie was actually not as terrible as I thought it would be. It was still far from great.. but IT had its moments and I found myself to be fairly entertained throughout the whole thing. I'll be honest, it took me two tries to actually watch the whole movie. If you're a huge fan of the book (I've never read it) then you will probably hate this because it does skip out on a ton of details and you don't get nearly as much backstory as you do in the original miniseries. I've actually heard that the book is really bizarre with a ridiculous amount of twists and turns that make no sense and give nothing to the story. Many people describe the book as too silly and that making a movie directly from it would be impossible because of all the weird details (turtles, gang-bangs and Paul Bunyan statues coming to life according to one reviewer lol). So I'm happy I have no book to compare this to. ***SPOILERS***The first scene in the movie plays out really well. I was creeped out by Pennywise during his conversation with Georgie and the first two kids that were introduced (Georgie & Bill) were adorable and had great chemistry together. Then all of the sudden Pennywise turned into this insanely terrible CGI monster who looked like Megan Fox from ""Jennifers Body"" on steroids and I couldn't watch another second of it. I watched it again because I wanted to see if the movie had any redeeming qualities and thought it deserved a fair chance. I'm not sad I watched it but what is the deal with all the CGI? It completely ruined the movie for me. Pennywise already looked like a cartoon character to begin with and all of the unnecessary special effects just made him even less scary. Bill Skarsgard did an alright job playing him and had a few really great creepy moments, but all in all Pennywise was a letdown.I know the miniseries is well loved by a lot of people and I can respect that, but I personally think the original was pretty ridiculous and I like the updated vibe this version gives. They changed the decade from the 1950's to the 1980's and thank god for that because the 50s were dull. Many people are upset about this and say they changed it to cater to the ""Stranger Things"" crowd and they're probably right. I love Stranger Things and I think the writers made a good choice. The cast of kids were mostly great and I loved the comedy that was happening between them. Sofia Lillis, who plays Beverly, did a good job but I thought she looked too old for her age in the film. I liked Chosen Jacobs but the writers did a terrible job with Mike Hanlons character. They made him seem like an afterthought and his backstory was weird and out of left field. Jaeden Lieberher and Jeremy Ray Taylor were both PERFECT casting choices for their roles as Bill & Ben I thought the portrayal of Henry Bowers was also pretty spot on. The stand out's for me for sure though are Finn Wolfhard (Richie) & Jack Dylan Grazer (Eddie). I thought they were both hilarious and their scenes were my favorites in the movie. All in all, the movie is a decent watch but it's not winning any awards.",It

Not really ever you feel like they are in serious trouble. And the people around these kids feel so futile. You don't really ever care about anyone or what happens to them in this movie. The first 15 minutes was really nice. But after that it's all downhill. One thing I don't get how people praise the performance by Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise. What did he actually do? Eyes moving in different directions, that's it? It was so obvious that his lines was ADR or post-sync (what ever you call it). Surely by himself, I don't deny that.

At one point, the girl in the group strikes up a particularly stomach-turningly cringeworthy conversation with the fat kid and their conversation goes something like this:Girl: ""Aren't we in the same social studies class?"" Fat kid: ""Yeah, my name is Ben, but most people around here just call me..."" Girl: ""...the new kid, yeah, I know.""Most of the lines spoken between the young protagonists are just as unrealistic, unoriginal and on-the-nose.Which brings us to the next of the film's major shortcomings: Every character is like a template cutout, everything about the so-called losers' friendship as forced and contrived as the dialogue between them. For some unapparent reason, the scriptwriters, who seem unable to even pretend to know the meanings of words like 'subtlety' and 'nuance' felt it necessary to assign each of the misfits who comprise the 'losers' squad' with a particular trait that sets them apart from other kids and makes them targets of the (likewise horribly caricatured) school bullies: One stutters, one is fat, one is Jewish, the son of a Rabbi, one is rumored to be slutty, one is black and homeschooled and I honestly don't know if I just forgot about one or two of them, that's how forgettable the whole thing wasCardboard characters and wooden script aside, isn't the movie praiseworthy for its acting and cinematography, you might ask. Well, the actors did do a decent job, but only compared to your average child actor, and I guess the cinematography was above average (I remember two very effective birds-eye shots at intense moments). But It is by no means a style-over-substance tour-de-force substituting interesting dialogue with visual prowess, like, say, Suspiria (1977), another 20th century horror classic soon to be revisited, and thus, there is ultimately nothing to make up for its horrendous script and story. Regarding Bill Skarsgaard's much-touted performance as the eponymous clown, well, it really isn't something special and by no means a good reason to go see the movie anyway.But wouldn't all this be irrelevant if It at least delivers what you'd expect from a horror movie; a good scare? Maybe, but It falls short in the scariness department, too, essentially playing like a non-stop jumpscare prank: I'm not one to look down on a good jumpscare but at a rate of approximately one every three or four minutes, my guess is that most adult viewers after half an hour or so, would be desensitized to and ultimately annoyed by them.It's a complete waste of time.",It
1718,jackpearce2,Rather be ejected into space.,6,17 September 2017,"I rarely write reviews..But this film just triggered it. I am so sick to death of Hollywood corrupting these films with unnecessary and completely horrific CGI. It totally an utterly ruins the effect any of the scares have on the audience.The opening scene with the kid and the clown in the drain was brilliant. It was eerie, ominous and creepy. The detail of Pennywise's voice and his pronunciation of every syllable was perfect. The fact you couldn't see too much but knew exactly what was in there was terrifying and mysterious.Everything after that scene was a disgusting embarrassing mess. As soon as that clown opened its mouth to a plethora of about four thousand teeth in an array of special effects I knew this film would be overdone. This film has so much potential to be creepy and genuinely scary but it wasn't. The town should of had a general darker atmosphere.The clown should of made less abrupt and obvious appearancesThe ridiculous scene where the clown tarts dancing for 2 minutes is just a joke to the filming industry. I mean COME ON.When the spirit or whatever inside decides to take the form of the demonic sister of Mona Lisa and start eating the faces of little Jewish kids. actually suck the Jewish kids face then run off back to the sewers. Thats when I knew I would rather be ejected into space then watch this.don't get me started when we discover an underground layer with hundreds of flying dead kidsThe only way its getting a 4 is because it showed great promise early onThis film has been totally saturated in CGI and is a complete waste of time.

1720,galateia_7,New season of Stranger Things started good,7,1 October 2017,"Well the movie is quite good overall.Great acting , scenes ans music. It's a great remake of the classic. What threw me off was the fact that it looks so much as the series Stranger Things.For some unknown reason directors decided to include way too much ''funny lines'' and jokes to the point yo forget you are watching a horror movie.Nothing like the original IT unsettling atmosphere. This along with how the whole town didn't giving a tiny rats ass about kids being bullied to death literally makes 2 big problems for me. In the theater i swear there were more laughs than scares. Less jokes and less Stranger Things atmosphere would be better for me.",It
1721,gabsmax81,Probably in need of a director's cut,8,15 September 2017,"I liked the movie. It was what I thought it would be: a blend between a Nightmare on Elm Street and the Goonies.It is not excellent. But it's a good watch. The most anticipated scene which sees Georgie's death didn't let me down. Here and there, there were good ideas that caught me mumbling: ""wow that's so cool... man that was so creepy...""Of course the movie edges away a bit from the book. At times it will even feel rushed. I would guess a couple of scenes didn't make it to the final cut, leading to a few issues.For instance, the kids' characters are not fully developed (not all of them at least) and a little more backstory or screen time would help.It would also help to develop further the story of Derry, which should be an incredibly gloomy background for the characters. So far, what we know about the town is mainly what the kids mention when they chitchat. But it's something we need to feel and see for ourselves.And we need much more presence from Henry Bowers and his sidekicks, as well as more reasonable explanations as for why he is such a dangerous bully.The movie lacks tension, I would say, and the now famous trailer made me feel much more uncomfortable than the whole flick.Overall, the movie should make us feel unsafe wherever we go: Pennywise, Derry, the adults, Henry Bowers... there should be no escaping. Instead, we get a little bit of each, and never really feel that threatened.It feels like they used from the book strictly what they deemed absolutely essential to the movie, discarding minors points that could actually help build tension or develop characters and situations.Regarding Pennywise, I am not sure. I guess the more you see It, the less afraid of It you get. If Pennywise were less present, or if It were some kinda of a silent, lurking shadow, it may work a bit better in terms of fear and tension factor. But It still is a good horror movie clown and with Bill Skarsgård's acting, It often wavers between a clown-dressed maniac and a primal creature who's got a stomach where It should have a brain.Having said that, it's a movie you want to like before seeing it, and I would happily see it again: the cast acts wonderfully well (special accolade to Ben Hanscom, Beverly Marsh and Georgie Denbrough). The 80s twist will make us, 80s kids, feel quite nostalgic with the whole familiar atmosphere.Again, a good movie, not a masterpiece but a movie that hopefully will feel more complete with a possible director's cut, and with flaws that will help make its adult-focused second part perfect.",It

1723,aviad-klein,Great scenery and art but not an excellent film,7,28 January 2018,"The movie was quite predictable, child is alone + room is dark/going down the basement = scary thing gonna happen, very predictable.

I wouldn't say I did not enjoy it, but it was very deep or even realistic in the sense that when a kid sees such horrors, he doesn't just go on with his life...

1732,onimusha19,Fight Through Your Fears,10,16 September 2017,"To preface this, I have read the book AND I am terrified of clowns. That being said, if you are expecting a shot for shot recreation of the book, you will be let down. However, do not let that deter you from watching what I can only describe as not just a movie, but an experience. I truly believe that Muschietti directed a perfect screen adaptation of the book.""IT"" revolves around the mystery of the township of Derry, Maine where every 27 years since its founding, fatal accidents occur and people go missing. It is now 1989 and kids are disappearing once again. It is up to one group of kids to face their nightmares and fend off the evil responsible for the tragedies, Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Again, if you have read the book, then you know that these group of kids will face off against Pennywise again in their adulthood. However, the way the filmmakers have gone about creating this is to split the story into two chapters with the first one being what we have now: childhood. For this installment, I cannot see another cast in place for the children that were in this film. You get to see all personalities in this group of misfits and the actors portraying them really made their characters individually stand out in their own unique way. And this was a KEY aspect to the overall flow of this film. Bill Skarsgård's representation of Pennywise is also incredibly masterful and is key to the atmosphere this film sets up.For all of you Goonies fans out there, this movie will really have you reminiscing. IT is advertised as a horror film, and it definitely is (trust me, I screamed several times but again, I'm terrified of clowns so your mileage may vary). However, I think many people who come in expecting to get full on scare factor are missing the whole point of this adaptation. Growing up is scary and everyone has fears. Some people, like me, are scared of clowns. Others may have lived through (or currently are living through) traumatizing experiences and those memories haunt them. Whatever your fears may be, at some point or another, you will have to face them - and that is EXACTLY what happens in this film.The way the cinematography is paced is a perfect representation of the whole concept of facing your fears and working through them in the company of support and people you trust. In the first hour of the film, you are pummeled with what feels like a montage of scary scenes. You have no idea what you will be expecting to see, but you know something is coming due to the ominous camera work and the eerie music that kicks in. And every single time, you get worked up and anxious about what is going to happen. Then, as the movie goes on and everyone's fears are peaking, an extremely climactic scare happens just as everyone in the film is most vulnerable. All the characters have just had to face their biggest fears once. They are all getting together to discuss what happened and an absolute nightmare of a scare happens. Now, a decision needs to be made: the kids can run from their fears or face them head on.Without adding too many other spoilers, I will just give my cents on some big lessons this film keeps simmering under the guise of horror. First of all, if you choose to run away from your fears, they will still exist and will keep coming back. Once you start facing them, you can start to empower yourself to continue to fight. Second of all, when you do face your fears, you might not win the first time (or the second, or third, etc.). What is important is that you realize there is an end goal that can be reached if you don't stop fighting. And lastly, it's that sometimes, your fears and demons may require some help - and that is okay! With the true support of those you trust, you can start to gain ground on the problem and work towards a goal....Okay one last spoiler (just because this was the main factor why I thought the movie was more of an experience than a simple film). When you watch IT, keep track of how scared you are at the beginning versus at the end. With other horror films, I have found myself in fear and anxiety almost constantly throughout the entire film. However, with this film, I noticed that as it went on, certain things became less scary as they were happening. Interestingly enough, the children in the film were also in the midst of fighting their fears and were becoming less scared. I'm not sure if this was just a sole experience for me, but regardless, I think this was intentionally done with what is incredible writing, acting, and filming all combined.To conclude, if you loved Stranger Things, The Goonies, or Stand By Me, you will love IT. If you are on the fence about watching this film because you ""don't do scary movies"", do not let that prevent you from watching IT. The horror is very tolerable (and I am a very timid person). You should go for what is a really well put together plot and expression of it.",It

1735,chasebart,CGI clown terrorizes Derry,5,7 September 2017,"I had high hopes for this movie. In fact, you could say this was one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime. I was psychologically tormented by Tim Curry at the age of 10, and it took several years to get over the weekly nightmares. Although aspects of the trailers made me concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that you stop taking seriously by the midpoint, the overwhelmingly positive reviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had me optimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go see it. Unfortunately, I can't do that after seeing IT.The first 10 minutes of the film were perfect. Ultimately what I was most looking forward to from IT was a new take on Pennywise. I wanted to see what a different actor could do with him, particularly his ability to be psychologically creepy and disturbing. And I felt like I got that in the first scene, and that was pretty much it. After the Georgie scene it seemed like anything Skarsgård did was masked by CGI, overblown audio, and distracting cinematography in 80-90% of his remaining screen time. What's sad is I think the mainstream audience will still eat this style up. The same people who will call this Pennywise scarier than the last are the people who said the Star Wars prequels were better because they had more LIGHT SABERS in them. OK.Sure, I enjoyed the crude Richie and Eddie humor, and thought it was well-cast for the most part. But by the end I was almost yawning through the Pennywise scenes. I just got out of the film and am alone in a dark basement right now and am not scared in the slightest. There is something wrong with that.",It

It is a random sequence of bad scenes that have no logical sense whatsoever. Not ONE of the scenes in that movie is actually correct and the only resemblance to the original story is the name and the character's names. No backstory, no character development and nothing at all that explains any of the happenings. Mike Hanlon was degraded to a unnecessary side character and his character got a whole new and unnecessary story.We mixed book and miniseries content (like Ben being new here, too) without actually accomplishing any of it. I have no idea which one they tried to remake, but it is simultaneously both and neither!!!There was just soo much missing, don't even get me started on that list, but somehow the writers decided to compensate this with giving us stupid and unnecessary new content.

Go and watch IT if you want to watch a competently made film with decent actors and good set design, but if you are expecting a scary atmospheric film that genuinely frightens you with genuine tension rather than telling you when to be scared then you are in for a big disappointment.

1747,jamesfproductions,A remake done right,9,11 September 2017,"'It' has been by far the most hyped for horror movie of this year and it's clear to see why with the movie already breaking box office records. Going into the movie having watched the original, I didn't know what to expect. After watching the movie it is safe to say that the box office records are for good reason. The main cast of the children in the ""losers club"" feel as natural and relatable to actual millennial children, due to the fact that they are played by actual children and not younger looking actors in their twenties. The main cast also bring a very good performance, showcasing their young talent, but the movie itself also takes a focus on making these characters feel as if they serve a purpose, unlike most horror movies. The kids all have different backgrounds and personalities, making it feel like a true group of friends and not some perfect movie group of friends where they all bond over the same stuff. Pennywise's portrayal by Bill Skarsgård, also is very good which was one of the actors I didn't know much about prior to this movie, however, I feel the need to go and visit his work because of this performance. The facial expressions and way he makes Pennywise sound, looks and sounds clownish, but also traumatic. Due to not wanting to include spoilers on the movie, I don't want to dive into talking about moments that make this movie as good as I say it is, because most if not every moment of the movie feels connected and needed in shaping what the story turns out to be. The only thing I would say negatively about this movie, is for a very hyped movie in the horror genre, it is not that scary in my opinion. Needless to say, there are moments where you will jump out of your seat and depending on your fear of clowns maybe even look away, but that isn't a constant feeling in this movie which most people had expected. Although not being that scary, I don't take that as a bad thing, purely due to the fact that it told a very good story and gave me a connection to the characters in the movie. Overall, a very well made horror movie and movie in general, but the authenticity of the main cast's characters and dialogue between them, will have you laughing more than closing your eyes in fear.",It

1749,cameron-l-225-313888,Why IT is one of the most genre defining Horror movies of our generation.,10,13 September 2017,"Before I start this review I do want to state that I've watched the original Mini TV series with Tim Curry as Pennywise and I thought that it was amazing (apart from the last half an hour). This gave Andy Muschetti's IT in my eyes and many other people's eyes big boots to fill and personally I think he nailed it. This is because of several different horror aspects and comedy aspects that he used in just the right way to entice the audience into wanting more and allowing the audience to really connect with the Losers Club as people felt when they watched the original version. From the opening scene of the movie you can already feel that it is a hit as soon as you see the first interaction of Pennywise and Georgie. This scene for me set the tone of the movie as they took a classic scene from the original and somehow improved on it and made me as a viewer genuinely terrified of the fear hungry entity. This didn't just happen once though, time and time again throughout the film they took scenes from the original and combined them with the new way of making horror movies without losing that old horror movie feeling where you would actually get scared due to tension that's built up through amazing acting from the lead (Bill Skarsgard) and the music that they used throughout the entire film. Combine this with amazing visuals, horror inducing visions of the losers clubs worst nightmares and the amazing acting from the younger actors made for a timeless horror classic which I think will hold up for many years to come.A lot of people have said this movie shouldn't be in the horror genre due to many reasons such as clowns not being scary, the comedy and the goofiness of Pennywise. To me I believe the comedy gives it a heightened aspect of fear and makes it stand out from some of the horror classics from the past few years such as the Conjuring Series because they are just plain horror films that follow the same basic story line, IT is something unique and special and in this adaption they nailed it.",It

As a fan of Stephen King,the IT book and the 1990 adaptation, i was very excited to see how this film would compare.Having read that Stephen King had said the film was much more like the book than the 1990 mini series, i was so excited to see the new one. But BOY it was shocking. Now i understand that this film obviously would not be the exact same as the book, but some really major parts were cut and some frankly awful parts were put in their place. Things wrong: 1) After the opening sequence, the film feels like a series of sequences that have been thrown together, meaning that it doesn't all really make sense. 2) The entrance to the sewers is in the basement of the 'creepy' House on Neilbolt street. Um, why? It makes the film feel like a cliché 'scary house' movie, which it is not supposed to be... That and the house isn't really creepy at all.3) The lack of original monsters. Mainly the Werewolf, without the Werewolf they couldn't 'kill' IT in the same way as both the film and book. Which then meant they were able to fight Pennywise with very normal objects.4) Backstories. Where are they? They cut so much out so that the kids' bond doesn't feel as strong as it should be. 5)The laughable CGI. Can we just remember how awful it was when 'IT' comes out of the projector and is massive.And the monster from the painting, is shockingly bad.6) CUTTING EDDIES BEST LINE: ''This is battery acid. Now, you disappear!'' 7) Bill is supposed to be the strongest of the group, i feel that the film didn't demonstrate this.8) The lack of character development, Henry Bowers' is such a big part in the book, but his character isn't in the film enough.I did however think that the opening sequence featuring Georgie and Pennywise was brilliant, and i'm glad they used the same death as in the book.The Kid actors were brilliant, i didn't feel that they were too cheesy.

Bill gave an incredible performance as pennywise that i hope terrorizes the kids of this generation the way the original movie has plagued me throughout my life.",It
1754,cmprazen,It is now my favorite movie,10,22 September 2017,"I was super excited when I saw the first teaser for this film and was not disappointed when I went to go see it for the first time. The movie is creepy and a bit disturbing, but not ultra scary, and it really doesn't need to be super scary to be a great movie. There's lots of hilarious dialogue mostly by Eddie and Richie throughout the movie and interesting things going on to keep the movie from getting dull. Bill Skarsgård did a great job playing Pennywise and gave him some creepy features (Its creepy smile, the way its eyes move, the way it talks) that make Bills Pennywise different from Tim Curry's. It does a good job of getting the main theme (Facing your fears) throughout the movie, and as the Losers Club gets less afraid of Pennywise, so do you. I loved all of the kids performances in the movie, especially from Finn Wolfhard (Richie Tozier) and Jack Dylan Grazer(Eddie Kaspbrak). Andy Muschietti did a very good job at directing the movie, and I could not be more pleased with the way it turned out. The movie also has a great OST by Benjamin Wallfisch that sets a gloomy and tense mood. This has become my favorite movie of all time and I cannot recommend IT enough.",It

I'll say some good things about it: The cast is great. The group of kids is perfectly selected, with good acting and parts through out the movie. Some really hilarious lines made Finn Wolfhard stand out as the best in the movie. The clown created by Bill Skarsgård is delightfully scary, at least in the scenes where CGI is left out (And they are not a lot). Direction is good too. Now, bad things: all the rest. all of the teenagers ""visions"" are a great mix up of horror films clichés. where CGI usually takes a leading role. Basement doors and sounds, abandoned houses, Zombies (leper, i know but let's be honest), blood bath (that hair and blood scene followed by the clean up WTF), and many more. When everybody knows what they have to do to finish IT, movie goes on for another 50 minutes with many scenes that could've been left out. The ending is far from scary, but a mix up of CGI'S, randomness and humor. I only stayed until the end because i have never left a movie before it, but believe me, i felt like it Many times.",It

I felt it captured more emotion than its predecessor and albeit the graphics are better but that's to be expected as CGI has come a long way. I loved Bill as Pennywise too I thought he did a great job - it has the odd silly bit which is why I didn't give it a 10 but overall I think it's a good movie well worth watching,It

The story it tells is from the perspective of a group of kids, some might even call them ""losers."" It is a narrative of courage, friendship, and good verses evil. Eddie was my favorite, but all the kids killed it. Pennywise was creepy, a brilliant performance by Bill Skarsgard. It was definitely worth my money.",It
1759,mwfuller-42973,An Engrossing Horror Movie,8,8 September 2017,"You can enjoy ""IT"" without having been aware of the earlier mini-series or Stephen King's original lengthy novel. The real strength of the film is due to the convincing performances of the child actors, as each character is thoroughly fleshed out, and the bonds of friendship among these unique personalities rings true as well.Pennywise is a truly powerful villain, and eerily child-like in his mannerisms. The bullies and parental figures only add to the general dread which surrounds the fictional town of Derry, Maine.The cinematography is really incredible, and CGI effects are used sparingly, I'm happy to report. The use of music fits the mood of the movie perfectly, and is not overdone. Of course, since this is a 1980's period piece, the use of Pop music from the era is very effective as well.You'll want to see this at the movies at least once, and for a movie that is over two hours in length, time really flies. This is a contemporary horror film with heart, and one that does not manipulate its audience with cheap scares or shock value. And I haven't really anything negative to say about the film, it's like you're right there with the characters. I only hope that the second chapter of the film is equally as powerful. Go see ""IT"".",It

This film as so many great aspects with honestly very few, if any down falls. Pennywise is terrifying not only from the great acting and CGI, but also the atmosphere and shadowing used to make the scenes so tense and terrifying. Compared to the 1990 IT, this film walks the line of horror quite a bit more but still has lighter moments to bring relief from all the intensity. Unlike most other horror movies, the story line in this movie is well developed and ties in nicely with the story of Pennywise. Great movie, glad I saw it in theaters.",It

1762,nadinederst,When childhood fears grow up,10,3 October 2017,It is a movie that's scary in another way. It's not plain scares that won't let you sleep at night; it's more a reminder of growing fear. The movie shows a line of irrational fears children have - and it leads you to a conclusion what happens when you don't overcome your fear yourself. When I was sitting in the movie I was expecting a lot of scars but found myself wondering about my own irrational childhood fears and that some of them grew with me. It's a very deep movie that shows the power of fear.,It

1768,dorismassengill-00447,You'll float too,10,23 September 2017,"It begins with Georgie and the boat that his brother makes for him. Floating along the side of the road, it catches the current from the rain and starts to speed past Georgie, Looking down, Georgie bumps his head. He runs and misses the boat, as it falls down the sewer. Looking down there, he sees only darkness, and out comes Pennywise the clown, he devours the poor boys arm. This seen was better than the original, and the mouth of pennywise is much more sinister compared to the original jagged teeth. The plot of the film seems to be that of overcoming fear. Georgie went for the boat, because he knew his brother would be mad. Stanley is afraid of the picture that is in his father's office. Bill is afraid after the death of his brother. Beverly is afraid of losing his purity, and becoming a woman. Richie is afraid of clowns (which honestly he didn't seem to afraid). Eddie is afraid of being sick/disease. Mike is afraid of his families death. Last Ben was afraid of the headless boy, that he saw in the book. Each of them must overcome their fears to become stronger than Pennywise, and towards the end of the film, they do. The theme seems to show this throughout, as they become stronger each time they see Pennywise, by being a team, and being unafraid of anything Pennywise throws at them. Compared to the miniseries, the acting is a lot better. Everything about this movie shows us exactly why this movie is very highly rated on each review.",It

1770,michaelrmunro,A missed opportunity,5,10 September 2017,"This is a brief review without spoilers.""It"" has serious narrative problems. The story of corrupted childhood and unresolved adolescent trauma with an analogous terrorising clown is a strong bedrock on which to build character and story but something went wrong with this film. Was it the script or the editing? Perhaps both but regardless the narrative structure is disjointed and jarring. The opening of the film is strong and places character at the fore, where it belongs (for both the children and Pennywise the clown) but that soon gives way to episodic, fragmented and at times illogical storytelling.The children's life experiences shape their fears but too often these are unexplored or are seen much later in the film loosing a linear structure which is vital to build psychological suspense. Pennywise is pretty much reduced to being the scary clown who literally chases the kids.There are some positives; the performances are good, there are some good visual touches e.g. Pennywise climbing out of the fridge and the lighting and cinematography are good. However, all in all, it feels like a missed opportunity to produce an intelligent, psychologically disturbing and relatable horror classic.",It

It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favourite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it (no pun intended) was a great thriller film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances.",It

From seeing the trailer, I was expecting another average remake but this is far from such. IT truly captures a good balance of fear, humor, and a major creep factor. From the beginning when Georgie is devoured near the sewers after being tempted into reaching his arm to Pennywise's terrifying teeth, all the way to the intense final battle to Pennywise's ultimate demise, I found myself laughing, jumping, shaking, and biting my fingernails all in the duration of the film. You certainly rarely feel the 2 hour 15 minute run time, except for a few times when I felt the movie was sort of dragging on, but even the slower scenes were an important part of character development. I found myself devoured with the amazing job of Pennywise. The clown truly was insanely creepy, parts where he nearly grabbed the children had me lurching forward in my seat, sweating with anticipation. There's not much bad one can say about this movie, even the immature jokes made me giggle like a small child. One really finds them self rooting for the kids and cheering them on as they fight Pennywise and their own inner demons and fears. Overall, this was a great movie and I found my money well spent.

Although the movie did have a LOT of jump-scares, which wasn't, but a lot, of the horror involved, there were tense scenes, incredible psychologically confusing and horrifying moments, and the cast of characters were very well picked. The actors for Richie, Pennywise, Beverly, Bill, Eddie, Stanley, Mike, Patrick, Henry, Georgie, and the other characters were incredibly well picked, all looking identical to the original cast. Honestly, I was more fixated on the characters than the horror, mainly because the scary scenes were more fixed on surprises. In the beginning, Pennywise literally bites a child's arm off. That's shocking and horrifying, when the little kid is being attacked by a clown with monster-like teeth. That's just the beginning, which sets the tone for a great horror movie.

1788,anthonystonelake,"Killer Clown, Killer Film.",8,14 September 2017,"The horror film of the year?Going into the 2017 adaptation of one of the best horror books of all time, I knew what to expect; A creepy-ass clown and the death of children. To say the least, I was not disappointed. Bill Skarsgård's turn as the diabolical clown, Pennywise was absolutely genius and completely refreshing in a genre that has largely grown stale over the last few years. The clown that feeds on the fear of children comes off as genuinely scary at times and wholesomely unsettling. Despite singing it's praises during that opening paragraph, IT (2017) is not without it's faults, there are some very cringe-worthy moments throughout the film and one sub-plot in particular turned my stomach, but not in the traditional way a horror film should.The film sets the tone very early on, with suspense and dread being the biggest things instilled on the audience. The lead character, played by Jaeden Lieberher, speaks with a stutter. This kind of disposition is very hard to pull off in movies, with most takes on the speech impediment coming off as sarcastic and goofy. Jaeden, however, masters this in the role of Bill, who is the main driving force behind the movie's plot. Basically, without him, nothing would have gotten accomplished. This all stems from the events that transpire during the opening sequence of the film. The entire cast bounced off each-other extremely well, with the entire group of teens being able to show a building sense of camaraderie throughout the film, with the initial divide between the cast diminishing as the film progresses. This is extremely impressive, especially for those who are still, in fact, teens.The film has a gargantuan run time of 135 minutes, and despite this run time, it manages to be enjoyable throughout, with something happening at every turn, whether it be an encounter with the evil Pennywise, who haunts the town of Derry every 27 years, or an encounter with the local bullies, who get a surprisingly full character arc during the film.There is a lot of gore throughout, as to be expected with contemporary horror films. This is coupled with a few well placed jump scares and some genuinely creepy and unsettling atmospheres to give the audience a sense of newness in the horror genre. This is not the most innovative film ever, but it does just enough to make itself feel completely fresh when stacked up against those with similar target audiences and themes.At the end of the day, IT (2017) is more a coming of age thriller than a traditional horror, and I think it works all the better for it, I won't discuss what happens during the ending sequence, but it's quite heartwarming for a film that prefers the rough dark story-telling perspective.After the film ends, and this is the one thing that I will spoil, the IT (2017) logo comes up on the screen, which is then changed. (SHOCK HORROR) to reveal the fact that it is but IT: Chapter One. This leaves me with some many questions of how they will work in a sequel to the mix with the already established characters and whether or not they will include them at all.Verdict:I've sung the praises of IT (2017)/Chapter One, throughout this review and it did thoroughly impress me through the entire run-time, which is something that genuinely surprised me. Skarsgård's Pennywise was genius and utterly terrifying and the kids all acted superbly. IT, pun intended, leaves little to be desired in the horror and entertainment department, plus with the little dashes of comedy thrown in, which is just enough to stop you from losing your mind, this is one not to miss. If you're over 15 of course. 8/10.https://hashtagfilm.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/film-review-it-2017/",It

The book is my absolute favorite read of all time reading it cover to cover three times since 1990 (try to break long enough between readings so I forget something). The book is just incredible and I could not recommend it enough.Onto the movie ... I know that I really liked it but wasn't sure how much after watching It. Totally skirting around spoilers (or being as ambiguous as possible) the stuff I didn't like as much as I had hoped: - so many key scenes were not in the movie that were in the kids' section of the book. This is expected in a movie adaptation but I mean key ones like the Loser Club individual interactions with It that helped them bond. On a personal level, there were some scenes from the kids' part of the book I was DYING to see on screen and a lot weren't in the film (I am looking at you, standpipe). - I haven't seen this mentioned in other reviews yet but the motivator for the 'final showdown' between the Losers Club and Pennywise is unique to the movie. The decision to face Pennywise is more 'forced' than in the book. - I am still scratching my head over the 'death' of one of the central (and more interesting) characters of the adult section of the book but we will see what's up with that ;)From where I was sitting the CGI looked quite good and remember that It/Pennywise is meant to be a horrific entity that would be VERY difficult (if not impossible) to capture with practical effects. I had no issue with the very good CGI.The good stuff: - I can't stress enough that the acting from ALL of the kids was terrific (let's not forget to include young Georgie). Too many horror movies have dumb-ass teenagers with one dimension (save the customary sole survivor(s)) that I couldn't care less if they die or live. This is not the case with It. Even though some of the kids are more focused on than others (i.e. Beverly and Bill, not enough Mike or Richie) I could say that I did care if they lived or died ;) - Skarsgård as Pennywise ... Curry is GOLD as Pennywise and I scoffed at the idea that Skarsgård could lace his clown shoes. I will eat crow. Skarsgård was excellent and his performance was dissimilar enough from Curry's take on Pennywise. I may agree with some that he didn't get enough screen time but really chewed it up when he did. - The theme and mood of the book (menacing and cruel, not held back for a TV movie audience) was captured excellently.Although I may be biased (based on my adoration for the book), this is the best horror film that I have seen in years. Can't wait for Part 2!",It

The only way I can describe this movie is smash mouth in your face no holds barred clown terror with an absurd amount of humour. Great movie, great acting, great feel.

A good balance of mood and atmosphere, predictable and unpredictable outcomes, as well as balanced pacing. A nonlinear narrative that feels unpredictable and engaging at all times.It might not be a very scary movie, but it is all about what scary is. You're seeing scary from a kid's perspective. You're seeing them grow and become confident. That's what makes it a good horror movie. In a way it makes you question what horror really is, and that is what makes it special.",It

1800,guilttrip-50804,"Great performances, heartfelt narrative",8,17 September 2017,"The lead-up to this film was so full of anticipation and excitement, and as a massive Stephen King fan myself I was looking forward to seeing how the film adaptation would compare to the infamous 1986 horror novel. Following IT's release, the most popular question on everyone's lips was, ""Is Pennywise the Dancing Clown scary?"". In short, yes. Bill Skarsgard does an exceptional job in portraying the demonic and downright evil clown who feeds on children and their fears. The makeup and CGI combined is highly efficient and well edited, and not at all overdone or obvious to the viewer, making him both intriguing and utterly terrifying simultaneously. Director Andy Muschietti has done an excellent job of creating tense and beautifully shot moments. During the duration of the run time, I found myself consistently resisting the urge to cover my eyes and ears for fear of being caught off guard. However, by a long stretch the highlight of the film, for me at least, is the kids. Each character is unique and intriguing and brings something to the group. Because these children are mostly left to fight for themselves given that the adults around them are completely oblivious to the evil lurking in the sewers, it gives the film an underdog feel and as a viewer you feel connected to the characters. This movie is also inherently funny, and I found myself laughing out loud at the numerous wisecracks and one-liners from the get-go. It's always tough to harshly judge young child actors on their abilities, and luckily I won't need to here due to high quality, raw performances from every young actor in this movie. Particular standout performances are from lead Jaeden Lieberher (The Book of Henry) and Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things), whose comedic timing is second to none. Watching this also brought me a sense of nostalgia for my childhood, and the feeling you get when great friends surround you on a big adventure. As a fan of the novel, I was not disappointed and can agree with critics in saying that this film both pays tribute to the book and cleverly omits unnecessary portions of the narrative to make for better viewing. I highly recommend checking this movie out if you haven't already and am looking forward to seeing what the director does next (IT - Chapter Two?).",It
1801,tmoorelacrosse,"Prepare for a confusing, aimless, shallow romp through insanity",2,10 September 2019,"I never saw the original and never read the book. So I must be missing something. No character development outside of basic necessities in which I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like the characters or not. Bev was by far the most interesting character, followed by the bully. Pennywise was fantastic in the first scene (2 stars just for that). I got excited about the potential scenes of him toying with characters. Should they trust him or fear him? Will he outsmart them or will they escape? SO MUCH FOR THAT.
The rest of the movie is him appearing and disappearing, a monster, then a smiling harmless clown.
There is no plot. There's no arc. It just kinda meanders around the characters then jumps ahead a few months for the climax. REALLY? Nothing happens between June and August that would help build the suspense? Maybe give them a false sense of security?
They clearly knew there would be a chapter 2, so why didn't they focus on making you like the characters? Why didn't they plan the first movie around an escalation to Chapter 2?
If you want a high school thriller with a kid in a yellow slicker and dark tunnels that hinges on events every couple of decades, go watch Dark on Netflix. 1 MILLION times better than this.",It

Having said that, this adaptation has been a let-down since the release of the first part with the kids.
One of the things that I love about the novel is the time jumps, i.e. past with the kids, present with the adults, back and forth. Having two separate movies, one with the kids time line and one for the adults just doesn't work to preserve this feature.
Secondly, the changes from the novel detract from my enjoyment.
Sorry... nice try, but it just doesn't make the cut. The TV mini-series is light years better than this version.

It stayed close to the TV mini-series from 1990 but made it more accurate to the time line because the actors were acting like the kids in the book and the kids of that era. (the TV mini-series could not do that because of the 1990 prime time FCC rules of language).Some people don't like the CGI but those people should have read the 1000 plus page hard book version that Stephan King wrote decades ago and then watch the TV mini series and then realize this is how King would want the movie to be.Since the announcement is out, there is a chapter two for IT. I found this out after seeing this movie and after watching at least 90 minutes. There is no way this awesome movie could be made in 2 hours and 15 minutes. At least to do it justice.Right before the movie was to display the credits it put IT on the screen in the scary type-style an the CHAPTER ONE appeared. I CANNOT WAIT. There is not even anything on IMDb.COM about this until the movie was out or a full week. This movie made genre records for opening weekend.I know it is the time for creepy and horror movies but this is different. Not the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies.

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!PROS : The Loser's Club is the best and i love all of them, The casting and the acting of each character is really on point and the bullies are really evil and brutal which is true to the novel. The story is great and there's no boring part at all, every scene felt like it has a purpose. The cinematography and directing is great too. Last but not least... BILL SKARSGARD AS PENNYWISE IS TERRIFYING! If you thought Pennywise in the trailers were creepy, oh man... You haven't seen anything yet. If i have to describe Bill's performance as Pennywise it would be terrifying and unexpected.CONS : The only thing that makes me kinda sad is I wish there is more screen time for Pennywise. I'm not saying that Pennywise rarely show up but a few more minutes of him would have made this movie perfect.IT is one of the best, if not the best horror movie i've seen in my life.

When SK himself approved of the film before I had the privilege of watching it, I was ecstatic because that could mean it raised the bar. When we talk about Pennywise, we all have that idea of how great Tim Curry's portrayal was, but with this film, there's absolutely no use in comparing Skarsgard's portrayal with Tim's because Bill's unpredictable version of Pennywise was undoubtedly perfect! He just has something that makes him alluring but at the same time you're just infatuated by his creepiness as Pennywise.It was scary but there were laughs in the audience because it had this perfect balance with laughter, scares and the way the movie was filmed and written. If you've read the book there were definitely important stuff that were emphasized in this film. Everything was just greatly polished and the madness and unpredictability of it just left me in awe.

I've been a fan of Stephen King since I read the Dead Zone 30 years ago, and this version of It is among the very best cinematic adaptations of his work, right up there with Stand By Me and Carrie. i think it speaks volumes that King himself was not prepared for how good the film would be and saw it twice when it was first released. Yes, there are major differences from the book and this is the first of two films, but it captures well the feel of the original novel, and the relationships between the young characters are nicely developed. The film is terrifying at times, but many of the scary scenes have an underlying sadness that gives them extra depth. One of my favourite scary movies, without a doubt.",It

There was even a comedy aspect at times, really not expecting that! I guess it was a bit long as my main criticism but I stuck with it because I really wanted to see how it all ended.

It reminded me more of a film with the three question marks, as the main characters are children with bicycles and flashlights that want to chase the monster or the clown out of the city. The story as well as many scenes make no sense at all. In addition, many scenes can be anticipated in advance. So all in the cinema (in Germany) were disappointed by the movie tonight. I think for people who know the old movie, the remake is a nice movie that tells the old movie in a new way. For all the others the movie is unfortunately only a big disappointment.

All of the child actors do an amazing job of embodying these characters and Bill Skarsgard does a beautiful job of making Pennywise his own.

I actually spent some time looking around how can I leave a review.The only reason I gave it 2* is because the story surrounding the kids and their acting. That was pretty much everything about this movie that was interesting. Whenever some ""scary"" scene or that moronic clown showed up, I felt nothing more but ultimate boredom and dullness. This movie would have been MUCH better if it didn't involve a futile trying to be a horror movie. Instead, it should have gone with kid's stuff, mutual relations in that age, their adventures during the summer break and stuff like that. The title would be something like ""Summer of Billy and his gang"" for a start.
In this ""It"" version, this movie is 2+ hours of waiting the movie to end already and waiting for a moronic clown to disappear and spare us the continuing torture.I saw at the end that this is only a first chapter. I can say for 99% certainty that I won't see the next chapter, but if that 1% wins over, I will wait for the movie to be available in stores and then fast-forwarding all clown scenes because they ridiculously suck.",It

1824,Risner-King,Y'know.... enh.,5,10 September 2017,"The Shining was the only Stephen King story that worked for me. Everything else has always been a let down. Including this. It was so hyped. From the looks of it, it looked like it was going to be a solid horror film that did it different. To me, it was very formulaic and actually kind of cliché. It may just be me but everyone talked it up so much that I thought I was going to be blown away but no. There is no psychological horror. The film consists of jump scares. There is nothing else. It doesn't stick. The teenagers in the auditorium stood up and clapped but I just didn't get it. The movie is not terrible. The kids were actually very great in their roles and added a lot of humor to the movie but if you're looking for scares this really isn't it. The movie relies on gross out makeup and jump scares to keep it moving and doesn't deliver. The special effects are not bad but there are points in the film where a should-be terrifying moment was actually very silly and laughable. Pretty much all of it was given away in the trailer. The best scene is when Pennywise comes out of the water in the cellar but you already saw that. It definitely won't scare you on DVD if it doesn't scare you in the theaters. The movie isn't bad but it leaves a little more to be desired. Don't expect too much. 6/10",It

The saving-kiss moment is so cliche I think that was the actual reason why people left the theaters. I'm not even against it, but why? Why was it needed? Why did it work? This question generalizes to the movie because we never get to know in depth who the clown is, why does it exist? Why does it do what it does? Why every 27 years?

1830,bosslevelnz,Appalling.,3,7 September 2017,"This contains spoilers.I am definitely no film critic but I do love horror films. 'IT' was not a horror film.I may as well have been watching The Goonies/Stand By Me/Stranger Things. Certain songs in the soundtrack really did not fit the scenes. The Score was just WAY TOO MAGICAL for a horror movie. Scenes would have benefited from no music at all i.e. Father/Daughter scene in the house. This would have given the movie a gripping sense of realism which I just could not find ANYWHERE.I could not get attached to the characters in this film as they just kept attaching themselves to the party like leeches. How many characters are there in the end? 7 or 8? Way too many. The acting was okay. The kid with the glasses didn't really fit the 'Obnoxious bad boy' role and ended up just being annoying where the chubby kid looked literally 3 years younger than the main girl...They were meant to be in the same class weren't they? The main bully was probably the scariest character in the entire film including the clown but I will get to that in a minute. The main bully was literally a psychopath! Who is not scared of a psychopath? I mean, the part where he used the switchblade to carve his name into the chubby kids stomach and the chase scene which ensues was a highlight of the 'horror' film. This was one of the more realistic scenes. It's way over the top, but was one of the very few sadistic horror aspects of this film. The kids were also way too brave and ultimately very quickly ended up not being afraid of the clown at all.I'll keep it short and sharp with the clown. It's voice was not even the least bit scary throughout the film. Yes there were semi unnerving scenes, i.e. the drain scene at the start where the clown was talking to the boy. This was more of what I wanted to see as a horror fan, it's creepy demeanor and sick tendencies/intentions though speech alone. However this was then followed by a ridiculous scene where it shows a bunch of razor sharp teeth and proceeds to bite the boys hand then cutting to the whole arm missing. Really?I often caught myself throwing my hands up in the air in disbelief and thinking to myself, How did this get classed as a horror movie.We ended up walking out early as we just couldn't take it anymore.

1834,ryanmbangs,A good adaptation and a great remake,8,7 September 2017,"This movie does a nice job of adapting the original material into a story that can be told in two hours. The structure of the original novel is lovely but if they were to follow the books events exactly this movie would have been very long. They manage to tell the story of the losers coming together in a way that feels natural and isn't rushed. They change the events enough to keep things fresh and keep the story moving along but they keep enough of the original events in to keep the fans of the book pleased. A lot of the stuff in the film has to do with Derry's interesting past and how the monster has control over the town and it's people. You really get a feeling of something larger being at work, roots wriggling beneath the surface. The portrayal of the clown was very interesting and creepy. Think Dark Knight's Joker. Nobody could have expected Heath Ledger to act the way he did in that film, and the same rings true for Skarsgard in this movie. The acting is very well done. His voice will linger in your head. He sounds like a monster trying to mimic human speech, it's very unnerving. His movement is also very wrong. Human beings don't move like that. But monsters trying to act like human beings do. The scares in the movie felt like ones that would be in a Stephen King novel. Scares that unnerve you and get under your skin.Things that make you think about how terrifying it would be if you were there experiencing them. The kids were great. Stand outs include Richie Tozier and Eddie Kasprak. Mike Hanlon and Henry Bowers were also well done. The only qualm I have is with Beverly. The actress just doesn't look very young. She looks and acts too much like a woman and it makes her performance very unbelievable, she looks like an actor playing a role. After all is said and done, this was a nice adaptation and a great remake. With all the cash-grab remakes coming out these days it's nice to see a movie that obviously has some love for the source material. I would recommend seeing this one in theaters. Audience reaction and screen size along with sound quality really make this a fun theater movie. 8/10",It
1835,jessicajevans,Let Bill Skarsgard do his thing,6,7 September 2017,"So,there is so much potential with this adaptation. Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise could be so good. He is dark and haunting, and everything I want from Pennywise. When he is allowed to inhabit Pennywise, I think he outshines Curry. That said, the CGI in this movie is distracting to the point of absurdity. The truly unsettling parts are when either Bill has his few moments to actually act Pennywise, or when the children are dealing with their societal issues (which, of course, is central to the story). Pennywise, in his hyper-CGI'd manifestation, however, is farcical which does a massive disservice to the depth and darkness Skarsgard brings to his character. The CGI also does a disservice to the real horrors the children in this story face. The scariest things are those closest to our realm - whether that is the complexities of growing up, abuse, and bullying, or fu#*ing terrifying clowns.",It

Here goes..What is going on with all the CGI in this film? Computer animated graphics have never scared me and this movie is littered with seemingly terrible and unimpressive visual effects. I had a feeling this was going to happen after watching the directors previous film ""Mama"" Anytime something was seemingly scary, or anytime I thought ""Hey, this movie might redeem itself"" it was almost instantaneously followed by some cheap jump scare with a villain who was computer animated to look scary. The human eye is easy to detect how fake CGI can be and folks, let me tell you, this movie relies INCREDIBLY HEAVILY on computer animated effects. No incredible monster movie effects from the 80s here. The sad part about it is that the movie takes place in the 80s (instead of the 50s like the book). What better way to write a beautiful love letter to the time period than to get some natural, realistic, and horrifying movie effects? The 70s had The Exorcist. Top notch REAL effects. Do you remember The Thing from the 1980s? ThHOSE PRACTICAL EFFECTS STILL HOLD UP TO THIS DAY. Its truly sad to see computer programs taking the forefront to create scares. Anyway, I'm rambling...For all of you fans of the book out there.. Spoiler alert again..You WILL be disappointed. It only uses the book as a small guideline for the story they decided to craft here. There is no Ritual of Chud. There is no Mummy, Werewolf, or drowned children in the Standpipe. Everything is rushed. This film is just a complete mess and it pains me to say so. If you haven't read the book, maybe you'll have a decent time if you can handle CGI. I for one thought IT was extremely disappointing, confusing, and ultimately boring and cliché. God, I wish this could have gone a different way.If you are truly interested in seeing IT... Please...please.... Save your money and go see something else. Or at the very least, wait to rent it.",It
1837,starstrukkstars,Not Worth the Money,5,8 September 2017,"As someone who had high hopes for this movie, I can honestly say I am monumentally disappointed. In an attempt to make a more visually stimulating remake of the classic It, this movie ending up looking more like a Salvador Dali painting, if Dali were extremely tacky. The fear factor was taken out and replaced with jump scares and unnecessary gore. And I LOVE gore. Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise seemed more like a mentally incapacitated pedophile than an embodiment of fear. The only salvageable parts of this movie were due to the outstanding child actors and Finn Wolfhard's admittedly immature, yet hilarious wise cracks. I had hoped that because of this the relationship between the 7 friends would be properly represented, however, the introduction of certain characters and their back stories were extremely rushed or completely skipped over despite the fact that this movie was about 2.5 hours long and focused only on the childhood of the It characters. The only new thing introduced to this movie, that was actually worth watching was the scene with Bill and Georgie near the end. It might be a fun movie to watch with your friends and laugh at, but don't pay money to watch it.",It

I had really high expectation's for this one and went into it with not much hope for it being able to have the same effect on kids like the original did to me as a kid. I'm glad I'm not a kid right now after seeing the new one, it did not disappoint me now at 37 one bit!! I took my 14 year son to see IT at the IMAX theater, the enormous screen and ridiculously load sound system intensified his fear that much more for this movie I think. I was laughing pretty hard a couple times when my son and at least half of the other people watching jumped back in there seats while letting out a scream. IT is a must for any fan of the original I promise you won't be even slightly disappointed, and the same for pretty much anyone else unless you scare easily!!

I knew this movie was going to be good going into it but I was blown away by how much more it exceeded my expectations and then some.I left the theater in shock, morbidly disturbed in a sense which has never really happened to me with a movie. I can't seem to shake how messed up this movie is and how they managed to capture the essence of creepiness. Hands down the best horror movie I have ever seen. They stuck to the elements that worked in the first adaptation in the 1990s and expanded from there creating a more intricate universe.

I am literally telling anyone who will listen - don't do it, it's a waste of time. It's a slow starter which is unnecessarily dragged out. I honestly laughed more than I was scared which is not what you want from a highly anticipated horror film. I was honestly so let down by the heavy CGI and awful jump scares (of which there are very few). I was expecting to walk out frozen solid with fear, instead I was fighting the urge to fall asleep.

1848,leslieakelly-50709,Went for Horror not Heart,5,10 September 2017,"IT was...meh. I am sure part of my problem with this movie is that I am such a King addict, and IT is one of my favorites. The book had some problems, for sure, and the movie did a couple of things that I thought were an improvement. But for the most part, this new movie wasn't a wonderful story about friendships and grief and terror and strength and survival, which made the book so good and memorable. It was just a horror movie with little character development, and cheap tricks. And that was a major disappointmentSpecific problems I had:1) There was NO reason to change it from 1958 to 1985, other than to capitalize on Stranger Things. IT lost a lot with that change. The 1980's were far less innocent. Some of the stuff from the 50's just didn't translate to what kids would do in the 80's (paper boats with parafin wax??? What house had parafin in the 80's?) And with that loss of innocence it makes far less sense that the kids would even see IT in all its guises. The whole point is that only small children who are still basically afraid of the boogeyman can even see him.2) Tying in with that--the kids were aged from 11ish to 14ish. Kids just finishing fifth grade? Yes, you can believe they'd still be afraid of scary clowns, mummies and lepers. Kids who just finished their first year of high school? In the 80's? No. (Somebody said they weren't in high school--check Ben's yearbook. And classmate-- Henry's friend is driving.)3) This Pennywise was almost too dark. Yes, he's a monster, but there's also this manic charm that he can use to lure kids. Skaarsgard is very good, but he's just terrifying. Little kids would be scared to death of him; they'd run away from him on sight, not be kinda interested. Tim Curry handled that brilliantly.4) The casting of the kids was atrocious! Bev and Mike look like they're 17. Eddie looks 10. They do not in any way look like contemporaries. Bev was far too mature for the sweet romance to work and Mike was big enough to beat Henry up himself. Also, his backstory was just so weird with his parents being dead and the sheep killing. He didn't work at all, and he was such an important character--the lightkeeper.5) They cut a lot of the kids' backstories and connection/friendship moments in favor of cheap thrills. And the special effects went the ""jerky"" horror movie route and looked really fake and dumb for a big-budget movie.6) I hated what they did to Stanley's character. You won't have much empathy for him for the choice he makes as an adult because he's so unlikable as a kid.7) Why on earth would the entrance to the sewers be underneath the Niebolt Street house? Just because the filmmakers needed a shortcut to include the spooky house? (Oy and talk about cheesy CGI--that house looked like a graphic you'd use in a Halloween party invitation!) And the way the kids acted in the house--getting separated twice--was just such lazy writing and was really dumb. (But the clown room was wicked cool!)8) OMG they cut Eddie's most important line?! (battery acid) Does that mean adult Eddie doesn't get to reprise that moment?Okay, there were a couple of things I really DID like:The scenes with Bev and her father were horrifying and so tense I was clenching my fists. He was the most terrifying monster in the film.The ""floating"" (we all float) was finally done in a way that looked amazing and made the repeated threat make perfect sense.All the actors were very good! I just didn't like the choices the writers/directors made with them.Out of curiosity, I did just rewatch the IT miniseries. Yes, it's very dated. The soundtrack isn't great, the graphics are very miniseries-ish, and the special effects are laughable. And the adult portions were just okay--TV actors reunion. Yes, they were fine, but not standouts.The kids, however, were standouts, and all the kids' sections were really good. Really good actors, amazing chemistry, age and era appropriate, they all looked the parts, looked the same age. Really, everything about the kids parts of the miniseries was superior to the new film if you look at it as just a really solid movie and not a ""horror flick."" It didn't have the scares, but it had the story, and the heart. It's very possible the IT-2, adult part will be better. But despite its age, its cheesiness and its eye-rolling special effects, I think the 1st half of the miniseries was superior to the new movie.",It
1849,jfurjoanne-42709,Disappointing,4,10 September 2017,"The kids are great actors. The visual effects are obviously impressive at times. However:The film lacks narrative; just jumped from one dramatic scene to another, relentlessly. This meant there was no opportunity to build tension, or to show off any kind of writing.Poor script. The film tries to hang off its CGI Pennywise, over-use of comedic jerky monster-movements and loud stand-alone scenes. Too much talking from Pennywise.Missed opportunities for the whole town and adults to succumb to the pervading sense of evil that I would expect from ITI was more scared talking about a memory of a good horror film on the way home. Laughable. It's like eating a whole bag of pick and mix for your dinner thinking it will satisfy you.",It
1850,kpm-85559,Spielberg-Like Mess,4,10 September 2017,"I had to force myself to give this four stars. The book by King is set in the 1960s but for whatever reason, maybe for nostalgia, maybe to make the milieu more recognizable, the movie takes us back to the eighties and pokes fun at some of the more lamentable icons of that decade. I couldn't help feeling through all the jokes about New Kids on the Block, Detroit gas-guzzlers and fanny packs that somehow we were supposed to bring to mind some of the kid-centered movies of that time. Groups of kids trying to find pirate treasure, helping E.T. get home and generous splashes of all the traits that make being a kid and/or teenager such a grueling experience for most people a la John Hughes. IT doesn't feel like a horror movie. The book it is based on is deeply flawed anyway, written at a time when King was going through a rough period in his personal life. By the mid-eighties the author was losing his powers of persuasion and this book shows it. If you haven't read it I leave it up to you to read the book to find out what I mean. For those of you who have read it, you know what I'm talking about. His earlier work was far superior; Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Bachman Books but I'm getting off the subject. There are some bright spots in this film. Bill Skarsgard does an excellent job as Pennywise while Sophia Lillis is incredible as Beverly Marsh and I have a distinct feeling that we'll be seeing a lot more of the actress in the future. There are some effective jumps to scare the audience and the special effects are on target but, I say it again, it doesn't feel like a horror movie. It's like someone took a crash course on Steven Spielberg tropes and was trying to prove to the much lauded director that they too could direct a movie that would harken back to some of his more impressive work. Finally, I have to say the story was softened, toned down and restrained so that the widest possible audience could see it and not be completely horrified and turned away. It was not made for horror fans; it was made for that great crowd in the middle who think they like horror and were willing to sit through this and suffer through its shocks and surprises in order to prove to themselves that they indeed had a horrific experience. I know I did.",It

What even story line did it even have?! There was so many characters I couldn't even keep track. All penny wise even did was just scream and things came out of his mouth. This movie does not deserve an 8.2 what so ever. I hope people realize how bad this movie actually is. I'm the type to usually jump at scenes even if I know someone's about to jump out.

In my eyes this movies success came solely from good marketing, because the movie's true foundation is filled with: poor acting, shotty scrips and really unthoughtful horror. To me the movie IT is only a 3 out of 10 star movie, making it a strong ""below meh"" 😕 Like always the only way to find out the quality of a movie is to go out and see it for yourself. Enjoy!

1855,divadolls,A truly great scary movie. But not for all.,9,11 September 2017,"""IT"" was so well put together fro many reasons. The first thing I noticed about the movie was the character development. Sometimes movie skip that and you feel nothing for the characters when something happened. The on screen chemistry between the actors made the movie amazing. The real trust that the actors had with each other could not be faked and be believable. Without that ""IT"" wouldn't be nearly as great as it is. The cinematography is one of the major factors that made the movie great. The camera angles changed and never failed to impress me, they used them as ways to make the movie interesting and keep your attention. One of the main factors that made the movie amazing was the amount of fear and scare they added. Some movies jump in with jump scares and do it so the audience doesn't get bored. During this movie, I was never once uncomfortable because they knew when to stop. each and every scary seen was nearly perfectly executed. They used humor in the scariest scenes to lighten the mood and make you forget why you were scared. I went with two friends to see this movie, they were both expecting a jump scare movie. I talked to them after and they said they didn't like how long it took to get to the scary parts. That's what made the movie amazing, I felt for the characters when their fears came to them. I knew their kind of humor. I don't think I have been this obsessed with a movie in a long time.",It

I felt the potential of its scary premise. And what do I get when I sit my ass down in the movie theatre? A massive frikin disappointment. But let's talk about the redeemable qualities of this piece of crap film first. The opening shots were sexy as hell. The cinematography throughout the rest of the movie was great as well. The child actors were really good at portraying their characters, and made their relationships feel real. Other than that there is no other redeemable quality. :)IT relies 98.9% on jump-scares. And i'm not talking about good jump-scares. You can always predict what'll happen and clearly identify the director's formula of ""horror"" after the 58th tHAT'S RIGHT FIFTY EIGHTH jump-scare. To be fair, the most disturbing part is the film's over-reliance on gross CG whose sole purpose is just to make you feel grossed out. It substitutes the time it takes to build up true horror by just smacking some CG accompanied by a sharp violin sound in your face. To sum it up, it looks scary but isn't scary. I also felt that the movie doesn't know what it wants to be. An example of this is the first arch where the scene is so serene and peaceful, oh look its even raining outside how cozy! Then less than 2 minutes later its like the film suddenly realized ""oh yeah lol i'm a horror"" and almost completely, without any warning or build up whatsoever, every element of the scene just suddenly transitions into this dark, fearsome and overbearing experience. It just feels forced, repetitive and inauthentic. The characters were very likable, yes, but also incredibly stupid according to the overused stereotypes of the just-plain-asking-for-it-you're-not-even-trying-bro horror film characters. Honestly, save your time and don't watch this in theatres. If you're really curious just wait for the hype to die down and then watch it online. I know I personally regret the 2.5 hours i've spent on this terrible excuse of a horror film.",It
1862,ianparr-41165,A successful transition to the big screen,9,14 September 2017,This was a very good horror film which captures the darkness of the book by Stephen King and transfers very well to big screen. The acting was very good with Bill Skarsgard delivering a convincing and fantastically unhinged performance as Penny Wise (shades of Heath Ledger's Joker) and in my opinion a better performance than Tim Curry's portrayal of the same character in the previous version.

I liked the way the movie stood up for the kids that where suppressed, which is something I find very important. But in this movie, reality was so far away, that we were just laughing about it..

1865,bienkowk,Insulted,1,14 September 2017,"Wow, I honestly can't believe these reviews. I made an IMDb account just to write a review. I love the original and have seen it many times. This movie was horrible! I feel insulted by the directors. It wasn't scary at all. Any potential ""scary"" scene was downplayed by jokes so forcefully inserted into the script. There are multiple, major holes in the story line as well. Hole 1: the group of bullies never once said anything about their buddy missing.Hole 2: the girl is pulled down from ""floating"" and brought back to life. Doesn't that mean that the hundreds of kids that come down from floating at the end come back to life too? Or do their rotting corpses fill up the sewers for 27 years? Does Georgie come back to life too?Hole 3: the girl can't decide which boy she loves. She took the poem from the pudgy kids room (I have to assume because she randomly ends up with it in her bedroom) but then she thinks that Bill wrote the poem somehow. The pudgy kid kisses her, bringing her back to life (true love brings back the dead girl like Princess & the Frog or something) but she winds up with Bill. Every cheesy, horror film jump scene was witnessed in this film. The acting was good, but I can't see how this is touted as a horror film. I felt like I was watching a Disney movie by the end of it.",It
1866,rogerbrown-78984,Completely misses the boat on what a genuine horror movie should be,1,16 September 2017,"Not sure what to say about this particular box-office hit that's smashing records in the horror genre. But after having watched a late night showing and going in with a lot of hope and positive thoughts, it seems this movie relied on the clichéd jump-scare style of horror film-making and an over use of CGI which I feared would happen. It's unfortunate that it completely lost an incredible opportunity to be a truly nerve-wracking and genuinely scary flick. From the looks of it, it's been targeted more so towards very young people in the 12-16 range despite the rating being R.On the positives, what we have is amazing cinematography, some fairly skilled young actors, and an antagonist who happens to be a monster dressed as a clown that kills children. Basically all the ingredients to serve up something brilliant on screen. It misses the mark there completely which is a real shame.To compare like to like, the 1990 television-movie was a lot more frightening. Mainly because Tim Curry was brilliant in the role and the child-actors seemed a bit older and had more character development and more chemistry among each other as a group than these new young actors.The first 7-8 minutes is top notch from the introduction of Bill and Georgie up to the intro of the monster. It's done brilliantly but then flat lines and falls from there.One thing this movie doesn't rely on is silence at any time outside of the opening segment. There's an underlying score playing in almost every single scene. It might be more apparent when watching the movie in Ultra AVX Atmos surround sound but it goes against the powerful method of film making where sometimes less is more and damages the impact that silence can have during very intense scenes. Sort of like the use of almost no music during the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You can just feel the intensity and seriousness of the situation in many parts of that film and unfortunately that's spoiled here with far too much background score playing for no reason whatsoever. It's Hollywood's way to try to make things more epic and Hollywoodesque I suppose. Just way overdone which kills the mood and atmosphere. But that's just my personal gripe. Others may not care as much.Obviously I can't throw in spoilers but this is a movie you'd be better off watching on TV whenever it releases and saving your money and time. Whatever you're expecting from this, forget it. It's a huge disappointment unless you're 12-16 years of age and have seen very few to no horror films in the past.Too much CGI, too much unnecessary music overplaying to the point of ruining the atmosphere, too much reliance on jump scares that are overused in horror films nowadays, a clown that isn't all that scary, and a lack of character development overall.

But after seeing the new version, I am amazed, yet a little disappointed. On the plus side, I want to congratulate the whole cast, production team, and writers of the movie ""IT"" (2017). It has been a very long time since a movie gave me chills along my spine. I was very young when I saw the first movie, and it scared me a lot. This one made me remember why. The actors, were simply amazing. The kids are funny, inspiring, moving, and hateful. I mean every time pennywise would attack one of them, I could hear people go ""oh no! Not him"". My wife also cried at the end for little Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), in his last scene. I thought he was very moving. You also get to hate the two bad guys, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) and bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), the two make quite the pair of villains. Needless to say I had a laugh when the kids stood up to them both.I am nevertheless disappointed! As much as I enjoy a great horror movie. You don't show a little kid get mutilated! The first movie was based on the suggestion only,and it was still terrifying, in the same way Jaws or Alien. You just don't show a kid get brutally murdered like little Georgie. Sorry I'm very touchy about kids being hurt in movies. Just shouldn't exist, it ought to be outlawed. So big ""ugh"" to the production for that one! Let's get back on track here. Pennywise, the costume was a bit bland, clowns are very colorful, and in the first movie Tim Curry had a lot colors. So just a bit disappointed with that. The violence, I thought ""IT"" (2017) was very violent. I mean, the murders are one thing, but the violence of some characters like Beverlys dad (Stephen Bogaert) abusing his daughter, or Eddies mom (Molly Atkinson) who is a overprotective mom,and even the chemist who doesn't mind being led on by a very young girl... (there are too many violent scenes to enumerate them all). I thought it was a bit too much. Unlike the first movie that only suggested what happens in each other's lives, or the violence of the actions they go through. To conclude I think it a good movie. Seeing the kids team up and showing a lot of courage against their bullies, their fears, and a freak a*s monster clown, it was worth the wait. So congratulations to everyone, I hear the movie skyrocketed, but please to all producers, writers... etc stop showing little children being hurt or killed in movies.",It
1868,michael_flynn-97786,Not that good,3,15 September 2017,"I was expecting much more based on reviews I'd seen, most of the audience laughed all the way through. It wasn't scary but kinda funny. It was a huge let down for me as I was waiting for this film since last spring. Just an awful movie. I wish I had just waited for the film to come out on red box. It was a dumb movie. My wife fell asleep for a bit, that's not good for a horror movie. 1st 10 minutes had potential",It
1869,enkaboot,A good move. Worth the time and money,8,16 September 2017,"Stephen King's stories are always mysterious and interesting and this is no exception. I assumed this to be another novel-movie blunder but turns out it is a great movie. The acting is great, the clown is scary (not too much) and there are some fun moments. What more do you need? There were, however, some awkward moments and the story could have been more versatile in some places but overall, I think it is great.",It
1870,onlyvrzy,"Half true horror, half South Park",7,16 September 2017,"Pennywise himself was definitely terrifying, and the way his jerky, unpredictable movement was shot makes you feel very uncomfortable. I usually find it hard to relate to film experts' analysis on cinematography, but even a layman like me could tell this was well done - when he emerges from the water I physically wanted to run away. What's more, he featured a lot, which was pleasantly surprising. We go to horror movies to be scared, and there were plenty of moments which achieved this, without it becoming tiresome.The cast is solid and the kids' dialogue amusing. However, what many people much more knowledgeable than me have seemed to agree on is that this really does feel like 10 minutes of coming-of-age then a few minutes of horror back and forth. I found the tone of the film difficult to establish. Unfortunately the story was a little muddled and though this only the 'first chapter', the subplots felt underdeveloped. The child actors themselves are talented yet the story very unbelievable, even if it is fiction. If I was one of those kids I'd be running like Bolt and singing like BB King...Overall it was a fun experience, nonetheless, and that is for someone who rarely visits the cinema.",It

It's sending my children the wrong messages about clowns, black people and genders. It's wring to call the clown ""IT"" when we can clearly tell it's a male. Secondly, I don't want my kids to think clowns are killers. Clowns are suppose to give joy to kids, not molest and kill them. I payed $210.99 for a clown to come to my son's birthday party in two weeks, but now he is scared for his life. Lastly, this movie makes my kids thing black people are treated like non Homo sapiens who get treated like animals. This movie shouldn't been seen to children, let alone anyone.

1874,andyokun,Loved IT,8,17 September 2017,"This is the first time that I ever posted here on IMDb though I have valued this page for about 8 years now.I need to first start off saying that I never read the book. I never saw the 1990 mini series.Just returned from seeing IT (2017) about 5 minutes ago. I personally loved every minute of IT.I am seeing negative and positive reviews on this here on IMDb and on FB.This movie kept me glued to my seat all the way through. I left the movie just saying ""wow"" to myself over and over and over again. I agree that it had more CGI effects than needed. Personally I loved the sound. I think it helped startle the crowd. Everyone in the theater just jumped at all the parts where the surprises came.Don't want to give away or spoil IT. I am not a book reader of any kind. I do however would like to see the 1990 mini series version just to check IT out.I thought the story was held together quite nicely despite some obvious flaws in the filming (which is why I gave it an 8/10).Personally I do not have an issue with clowns. Those that do should probably not see this movie IMHO as you will have some gnarly nightmares.From what I am seeing there are a lot of folks that have experience from reading the book and watching the mini series. I am actually glad that I do not have experience with either. For me it was fresh and had enough gore but not too much gore. I thought that the actors/actresses played their parts well and totally added to the entertainment value of the presentation. Right from the beginning when Georgie was floating the paper boat down the stream and into the gutter I was already hooked (which is in the trailer, so no, not a spoiler). I am totally looking forward to seeing the next part.If you like a good thriller and you have no experience with the book or mini series I can honestly recommend seeing this flick.",It
1875,mattthehat-54453,Meh,4,17 September 2017,"Okay listen, it was okay. It wasn't amazing and I'm surprised with how many people think it is. But that's their opinion and I'll respect it. Personally I found this to be more of a comedy than anything and I did laugh at the one liners and that kind of thing but other than that and the cinematography I didn't like this movie very much. In all honesty I have a certain place in my heart for the original Pennywise and I do think this version of him was alright but didn't have the same charm. I also didn't like his design, mainly because it didn't look like an actual clown you'd see at a circus, which the original Pennywise did. The CG was horribly done, even laughable. One of my favorite shots in the movie though was the dead kids suspended in the air, that looked pretty cool. In summary, Beverlys dad was the creepiest character.",It

New Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) was so good. During the session you feel his presence.",It
1877,sadcanadianboyz,Another terrible boring remake,5,17 September 2017,"When I hear great things from a horror movie I expect it to be an original idea or an original take on a story that already exists. This version of it is not that. Despite trying to ignore it, the obvious reuse of shots used in the original movie are so obvious and frequent that I feel as though the director doesn't really know how to introduce a new scene, so he just copy's what he has already seen. This wouldn't be so bad if this was a total remake of the original it movie but it isn't, which means that he should have stayed away from this as much as possible. Not only that, the gore and swearing which gave this movie its R rating feel like they are there just to service the fans who wanted to see more gore, without any real meaning. Seeing a kid getting his arm ripped off is cool but is a lot more effective if it has purpose. The original didn't even have to show this gore and was just as efficient, if not more efficient than the scene used in the new It. Paired with so many jump scares that I lost track, this movie is filled with as many clichés as any other terrible horror movie that has 0 creativity. This movie is nothing but another Hollywood horror movie, filled with terrible horror movie clichés, used to service fans of Stephen King to make a lot of money. Despite having great actors and a great story to lead off of, this movie was nothing more than a disappointment that will definitely receive a sequel, due to its box office success and the fact that the studio has already decided to split the movies up to make more money.",It
1878,dolphinlovers-70154,Not scary...very disappointed,4,17 September 2017,"I am a huge fan of horror movies, and was anticipating seeing ""It"". But I was let down by the actual thrill of the movie. It was very predictable and not as scary as I would have hoped. I can see where it might have been frightening if you were terrified of clowns, but even my boyfriend, who is afraid of clowns, says he was unimpressed by the horror of the movie. I am easily scared and this movie was not scary at all for me. So much build up for a movie that just left me disappointed in the end.",It
1879,teepyrneh,No....,1,17 September 2017,"I'll start this review by addressing that I had no expectation for the movie. I am not a fan of the horror genre as it usually lacks the thought provoking aspects I look forward to in film, but the reviews were great and I thought I'd give it a shot.The films antagonist is a demon-clown, who can shape-shift and move through space in an instant as demonstrated during the film. IT abducts, kills and eats children, but can only do so if they are experiencing fear. In the finale fight scene of the movie Pennywise is unable to kill and eat Beverly because she is not afraid of IT but at the start of the movie he kills Georgie after having a 5 minutes conversation with him where they laugh and mingle, Georgie even reaches towards IT to grab his boat - Would he really be so scared of IT at that point or was Beverly so not scared of an actual demon holding her up by the neck?The films plot surrounds around a bunch of disasters that the kids find out seem to happen every 27 years. this information is found out by a 13 year old kid named Ben, and he figured this out by reading some articles in a library. So this entire town of people has not been able to figure this out? And he informs the rest of the gang that in Derry there are substantially more children going missing than anywhere else in the US - If that is the case who is doing the abducting of children when Pennywise is on ITs break?All of the disasters have happened near sewage drains, that's how the kids are able to figure out where IT lives, but at one point of the movie how was Pennywise able to appear in places that have no actual relation to the sewage? Pennywise appears and disappears in Bills garage and basement, Beverlys bathroom, in a building where Mikes parents died and in Stanleys dads office. If IT can appear anywhere why does he choose to murder and abduct near the drain if ITs only purpose is to feed upon the children as demonstrated in the final act of the film, he is willing to make a deal with the gang to keep Bill and let the rest of the children go as after eating Bill he would start his 27 year break again. Why would a killer demon clown not be willing to let these kids go anyways and just hunt the other kids in town to feed as these kids are obviously trying to kill him?Pennywise seems to have unfathomable power as in a scene IT is using hair from Beverlys sink to grab and pull her but in the final scene IT is having a fist fight with a bunch of children, couldn't IT control some sort of object found in the sewer instead to do the same? Why is IT choosing to not use ITs full power against people who are fighting back but use such powerful methods when just trying to scare somebody?The movie is riddled with cliche's about the bully having a really strict father, the plot point that the only way they can defeat the evil all-powerful shape-shifting demigod of a clown is to stick together and get over their fears! and of course the scene where the boys find Beverly levitating in mid-air while she is in a complete state of trance - a coma, and what brings her out of this is a kiss on the lips from one of the boys. before the movie ends Beverly is talking about this moment saying ""It was like being dead"" but when she comes out of her coma she without taking a breath starts quoting the poem one of the boys had sent her.The movie takes place during the three months of summer and ends with the start of September where the kids still look bruised and battered from their fight. So it's safe to assume it must have been like a week since it happened. What were the kids doing the rest of the summer as they started seeing the clown as soon as school was out? Were they just having terrifying hallucinations of a killer clown and then enjoying the rest of their summer at the beach before going out and hunting it down? The times-pan of events in the movie don't seem to reflect the time it actually took to accomplish them.This is the first time I have ever considered walking out of the cinema during a movie.",It
1880,krpfine-61301,"good movie, didn't feel the bond, issue with ending",8,17 September 2017,I have a few thoughts and 1 major problem with the ending.I'm not very eloquent so forgive me. I really liked the film. It was worth my time and money. i just think the kid part of the 90s miniseries did a better job showing how the kids came together and the bonds they shared. I thought the miniseries did a better job showing how insane Bowers actually was. I thought the epic rock fight was better in the miniseries. i think the kid part of the miniseries was very good. i just didn't get the same feelings of togetherness in this movie. i also didn't like how this movie never eluded to that feeling all the kids had that something was bringing them together and guiding them. I think that was really important and it just wasn't mentioned in this film at all.My problem with the ending is the way they defeated IT. they're not afraid of IT anymore? I know they were afraid during the movie but they conquered their fears to vanquish IT. That doesn't work for me b/c i don't see how they would be afraid when they are adults and start to remember In the book and miniseries they were all afraid until the very end both times they battled IT. When they were adults they all freaked out when they started remembering everything because they remembered how afraid they were and how afraid they still are.I enjoyed the movie. i don't think they did as good a job bringing the kids together as the book and miniseries did. I don't think the conquering your fear ending works as a lead in to the adult portion of the movie.,It
1881,joneshywelrhys,Struggling to find much enthusiasm.,4,18 September 2017,"I was quite looking forward to seeing IT after noticing how very highly it's been rated on IMDb and RT, but watching it objectively as someone who is not familiar with the original or the Stephen King novel I can only assume the movie is enjoying a honeymoon period with fans of the franchise and others are getting swept up with the hype.The movie is safely buckled into the ""Goonies/E.T nostalgia aesthetic"" bandwagon and feels almost exactly like the popular TV series Stranger Things. The interactions between the cast are generally amusing, but again... it feels like it's jacking it's style from elsewhere. The horror elements are poorly done, the scares are 100% predictable every time (except one - Beverly's abduction caught me a little off guard). The clown is not a scary character, the various other forms it takes are not scary - just amorphous blobs of 2007 video game level CGI wobbling around with voices pitched down an octave.The backstory is so, so weak.... there's just a shapeshifting animal that eats people, preferably scared children, living down a well. Presumably evidence of it's shenanigans can only be seen by children, but how ""it"" got there, or where it came from, or why adults don't seem to notice the huge number of disappearances, among other glaring gaps in the story I am expected to just accept. The information we are given on a plate during the ""research"" scenes is presented in a cheesy and patronising way.The romantic dynamic between Bill, Beverly and Ben was laughably confused and thin, and not in a believable teenagery way.The bully characters were unbelievably cartoonish and plain unbelievable.Mike as a character enjoyed absolutely no development or backstory at all, I hate to say it but he was the definition of a ""token black guy"".IT is the kind of film I expect to see on iTunes for 99p in a few years.",It
1882,lancestolztftp,Is IT the greatest horror movie of all time? Yes.,10,19 September 2017,"More than just a horror movie in the same way Pan's Labyrinth is. However, It breaks all the rules of slasher/monster flicks. IT gets away with revealing the source of evil in the first scene of the movie, and continuing to have scary encounters with the same source of evil, over and over. The character development of the ""losers"" is as good as it gets. Personally, I felt as if I was one of the children, living in the time period, and getting into all the shenanigans young teens get into. The connection between the viewer and the children is profound. The scary scenes possibly could be scarier, some might say, but I found them leaps and bounds over the typical scares of even good horror flicks. There are no cheap thrills. All scares are legitimate. No camera trick scares, like an innocuous character lurking behind a door and a big musical overture just to reveal nothing actually scary. The score of the movie was perfect. The music told you how you should be feeling but wasn't too hyperbolic at scary parts. There were some things that you had to overlook, like how the kids were finding murder evidence and not reporting it to the authorities, but that just added to the theme of childhood hubris. In the horror genre, typically, there are dozens of small things and inconsistencies the view must overlook. That isn't the case with IT. The directorial decisions of what to keep in the movie all flowed well. Everything made sense in the end, from the pennywise personalized scares for each of the ""Losers"", to the strong relationship and character building. Perfectly executed, and the movie's length is exactly what it should be. Any longer would be too long, and any shorter would leave out key moments critical to character/relationship development.I watched very few movies as a kid that absolutely scared the crap out of me, The Shining being one of them. I can't imagine watching IT as a 12 year old at home alone like I did with The Shining. IT is going to be giving children nightmares for decades to come.Without revealing too much, I will say that there are no movies in the genre of horror to compare this too, perhaps Pan's Labyrinth (as stated before), but that is a stretch. JUST WATCH ""IT"" ALREADY! Definitely a must to see in theaters.",It
1883,terryvh-44132,A Modern Day Classic,9,25 September 2017,"I had been watching updates over the past year on the evolution and development of this new version of Stephen King's IT. I had seen the Tim Curry version in 1990 and though I thoroughly enjoyed it, IT just does not stand up today and is quite cheesy by today standards. I was very nervous about how this 2017 version would be handled. Thankfully my worries were quickly washed away. Andy Muschietti delivers a film that just plows through the material at a breakneck pace, in a good way. He keeps the tension high but also delivers some real humor thanks in part to Richie Tozier, (Finn Wolfhard in a polar opposite role from his Stranger Things character) . I would not call this a horror movie though, more of a supernatural thriller. I recall Joe Hill calling IT one of the 5 scariest movies ever, which is certainly not the case, but what IT lacks in pure horror, IT more than makes up for which tension and atmosphere, Though the projector scene is certainly jump worthy. The kids that make up The Losers Club all do an awesome job and you can feel their camaraderie right from the start. Though I do wish Mike's character had received a little more depth, hopefully they do this in Chapter 2, and all indications are that they will. I am hoping that the blu ray release will extend the film a little, in fact I would dearly love a ""Lord Of The Rings"" type of extended cut for the film and IT's subsequent Chapter(s), as the novel is almost 1200 pages. IT has broken records left right and center and for good reason. This is an excellent film, yes with it's faults for sure, but the good WAY out weighs the bad here. With a running time of 135 minutes, IT literally felt to be about 90, great movies can do that. I am waiting with baited breath to see how Chapter 2 deals with the adult versions of the Losers 27 years later.",It
1884,lukejosefpedrosa,A OK film but a bad horror,5,19 September 2017,"Me and my friends were very excited to see this film because it would of been all of ours first Horror movie. The film started off OK with the opening scene starting the film off very well. The first scene made me think it was going to be a good horror film and would scare me, after that scene it was all down hill.To start off with all the jump scares are predictable and obvious when they are coming which takes away the effects of being scared by them. I feel like the film tried too hard to be scary with some of the scenes just being over done which in turn made a scary scene appear funny to me i spent most of the film laughing and it only made me jump once and that was at the beginning. The best part of seeing the film was watching my two friends sit in the corner scared for the first few jump scares after about the 5th jump scare they realized that it was not actually very scary and was over done, it was just before the halfway point of the film when they realized the new IT was not very scary at all.Overall the jump scares are way to predictable and over done which makes them not scary at all. I personally feel like the film had more funny moments than scary ones so if you are going into the film hoping for it to be a really scary horror. This is not the film for you.",It
1885,wildfox-37935,"Decent, but not great",6,19 September 2017,"Condensing several hundred long book into a movie, even if that movie has two parts, certainly isn't an easy task. It wouldn't be wise to compare movie with a book, as it simply not the same format. What a movie can do, is be true to the spirit of the source material. Stephen King's books always had that chilly, creeping threat that you could sense would culminate. What I think this movie lacks precisely that, sense of threat. The movie itself seems like a crossover between horror, coming of age film with hints of comedy. In that, it is true to the source material (which I didn't find comedic but o.k.) I am not sure what to think of the rest. Certainly, as we are to expect a second part, it's yet to be seen what that will have to offer. The whole picture might be different but, for now, we have to stick with what is presented to us. It's the horror part that I find lacking. The feeling of dread is certainly subjective and in that respect, I didn't find the film scary. It has jump scares, it has it's share of monsters, it has it's atmosphere but there is never a feeling of real dread. Early in the movie we are presented with a killing of young boy Georgie. But, in the context of the rest of the film, the gruesome scene of arm bitten off a youngster seems as unnecessary shock value. We are introduced to main characters, a group of unpopular kids who are bound together in their struggle against evil entity in the form of a clown, that feeds on children. In facing this entity, they are also struggling against their own fears, a real life type of fears like being bullied or being in a domestic abuse. What was a huge let down for me is that these kids never seem genuinely afraid. How can a movie, a horror movie, be scary if characters don't seem to be scared. Many reviews focused on children's characters cursing all the way through. While cursing is in fact usual in that age when kids think they are more grown than they are, it's quite naive to think that they would react with constant ""oh f***"" when facing their worst fears, and then simply shrug it off like almost nothing happened. I mean, they react all the time like they are in a hunted house in an amusement park. No matter how grown a kid of 12, 13 year might think he/she is, he/she would probably scream ""mommy"" and not ""f***"" when in mortal danger. The whole point of scariness of it should stem from an innocence being under attack, and how characters become adults. But in this movies it's like we already have adults in bodies of children. All in all, I don't fund fear factor to be convincing in this movie. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is really good, but the clown itself has little else to do than to be scary. The atmosphere of the movie is good, it's not a cliché. Good lightning, shadow play, the eighties feel are really great. The premise of a gang of children is not new but in this movie, it doesn't feel old. In that respect, as a coming of age movie, it does (no pun intended) reasonably well, but there are better King's adaptations in that respect (Stand by me for example, that has bigger emotional impact). I also find the way in which story unfolds to be a bit disconnected, one thing leads to another almost automatically and there is little space to get to know characters or their relationships to one another (which, in the end is crucial for their victory over Pennywise the dancing clown).All in all, how much you enjoy the movie depends on what you expect from it and how sensitive you are to being scared. My friend, whom I watched the movie with, found it pretty frightening. Anyway, my conclusion is that it is a good summer movie but certainly not masterpiece.",It

1894,verticalhorizon-41342,From now on my favorite Horror Movie,10,22 September 2017,"First of all to all those who rate such a movie with 1 star. That is absolutely a mystery to me, how such a movie can be rated that bad. There are a lot of B and C movies out there that really deserve a rating like that, but in times where something like a IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes rating has serious economic impact for filmmakers, producers, actors, future film projects, etc., it is a careless act to rate in such a way. Nobody has to like a movie, but everybody should rate with a common sense to keep portals like IMDb valuable.To the movie itself: I won't give you the 100.000 rating like a semi-pro critic. I will give you, who maybe hasn't seen the movie already, a short view of someone who really likes Horror movies and is bored the last years about the again and again and again produced ghost stories that just stopped thrilling me.IT is a movie I know from my childhood. It shocked me in the nineties and led to hating clowns until now. I was really pleased to hear, there will be a remake. But also I was afraid about the result, cause many remakes are just a bad copy of the original. Yesterday I saw the movie at the German Fantasy Filmfest in original English and man... I was deeply impressed afterwards!The movie kept my pulse high from the 1st minute till the last one. The beginning scene with Georgie is just brilliant. The cast is absolutely fabulous. The technical set of the movie is perfect in my eyes. CG is so good, that the director had the chance to put the shocking moments not only in the night, where light is pale, but also in the daylight. And the horror was there also at light! That is really not often to be seen in movies. Most of the time, horror plays with darkness, light keeps the audience in safe. But not in this movie. That was one of the facts that made the movie win my heart. Skargard as the clown was really a winning for this role. I never thought he would act worse than Tim Curry. In combination with technical chances you have many years after the original movie, it was just a lot of fun to watch. Very important: watch this movie in Dolby Atmos. The sound some people here describe as too loud, was in Atmos the perfect supporter of every horror scene. Not everybody loves jump scares, and the movie has a lot of jump scares, but for me it was the perfect way to realize this book as a movie and keep the horror at a high level. You can hardly realize the book with all detailed descriptions King made. It is leaned on the story and the creator did a great job in that. For all people who love the book and read it thousand times: Just keep the book as a story and the movie as a leaned on picture. Like Lord of the rings, a director can never create your personal imagination for 100%. He has to deliver entertainment for everybody out there. I like red. You maybe like blue. It isn't that simple...",It
1895,mullent-57752,"Good special effects, decent acting, TERRIBLE writing and directing.",1,22 September 2017,"A few weeks before this film was released, I started reading Stephen King's original novel for ""IT"". After dedicating several weeks to reading ""IT"", I was honestly blown away by how wonderfully detailed and immersive the setting, the plot, and the overarching journey was. But above all else, what I loved MOST about the novel, were the characters. I just want to say that the 2017 adaptation was not technically ""Bad"" objectively speaking, but it failed to capture that which was most precious in its source material; its CHARACTERS.I have a lot of love for each of these adorable little 11 year olds, so let me just say that I am incredibly biased toward the original novel. I recognize that. But I feel like I would being doing a great disservice to myself and the book if I didn't explain WHAT this film did wrong. One of the things the book did so well is to draw you into this homely setting of Derry by carefully introducing you to these misfit preteens who were still figuring out their place in the universe. It gives great care in introducing their personality, their quirks, their family life, and their interaction with other characters. However, now they all seem to be just randomly thrown together for no other reason than plot convenience.Bill Denbrough: His character is one shrouded in guilt over his baby brother's death. He believes that he unwittingly sent his brother toward his his own demise, that he should have gone with him, and that somehow he could have saved him. This frequently haunts him throughout the course of the story, but in the film, we see NONE of the hatred and shame he forces upon himself. Why? Because the film washes away any sort of finality to Georgie's death by making him go ""Missing"" instead of making him bleed out from having his arm ripped off like the wing off a fly. This leads bill down a path of hope and optimism that he may still be alive down in the sewers. Bill's hatred for the thing that killed him brother and divided his family is not portrayed at all.Ben Hanscom: Something the movie somewhat got right was Ben's introverted and bookish nature. Something I was hopeful to see more of. Unfortunately, his character is skimped over like most of the other characters in this movie. He only serves the purpose of being the ""Smart one"" and being the puppet of an unnecessary love triangle between Beverly and Bill. Beverly Marsh: There were many things the film did wrong to Bev's character. From the first moment we see her, she's being harassed by over the top ""Mean Girl"" stereotypes, calling her a ""Slut"" for no adequately explored reason. After she inexplicably makes friends with a total stranger (Ben Hanscom) she is personified by being the victim of sexual abuse by her father. What the film fails to recognize, is the reality that victims of domestic abuse, still tend to love their abuser. But instead of taking the realistic approach, the film turns her into this closeted bad ass who strips half naked in front of 6 boys, sunbathes in front of them, then cracks her father's skull open like a pinata. She overcame her struggles and is now a stronger person because of it, right? Then she's randomly abducted by Pennywise and turned into the stereotypical damsel in distress in need of saving. Richie Tozier: Not really much to say about him. The actor who played him was decent and recognizable, but all he seemed to do was shout out vulgarities and abandon his friends when they needed him most. Also he's scared of clowns for a reason the writers forgot to mention. Stanley Uris: He served no purpose in the film at all. In the book, he was the cold realist of the group who enjoyed bird watching and had a sound logical mind. In the film his only distinguishing characteristic is that he's a flat footed coward, and that he's Jewish. Something of which the film seems to bring a lot of attention to considering it has no significance to the plot. He now has unexplained daddy issues and is afraid of a weird painting. Eddie Kaspbrak: Probably the ONLY character in the movie that was fully developed by the end of the film. He is seen being coddled by his mother, forced to take heaps of medication, and is paranoid about practically everything that might make him sick. At the end, after discovering his medication wasn't real, and his mother absurdly sends his friends away, Eddie gets MAD. He tells her what he truly thinks, and throws away his ""Medicine"". The only thing that his development ignores is the fact that Eddie's brain physically believes that the ""Medicine"" works. That his body will literally go into withdraws and make him believe he's having an asthma attack. Something that stays with him for 27 years.Mike Hanlon: Mike was another missed opportunity. Mike was taught by his father that he would always face strife because of who he was, and that one day he would know the time to fight back. Mike fought back plenty in the film, but the original topics of racism were greatly watered down and were only subtly hinted at instead of being an integral part of his original character. All in all, the characters in this film did not meet my expectation and overall felt like they were cut and paste renditions of already established tropes. The bond that these seven children held in the original source material was non-existent in my eyes. From forced love triangles to uncharacteristic squabbling, I feel that IT (2017) did an extremely poor job of portraying Stephen King's beloved characters.",It
1896,epassmore-36113,Well...,1,23 September 2017,"Having just viewed this film I wish I could say that the four pounds I spent on the ticket was four pounds well spent, but I would be lying if I did.the films story line was average at best it would seem more effort was put into character development than making the film qualify for the horror genre. in my opinion the film should be re-branded as some kind of dark humour comedy, I believe it would suit the nature of the film much better.One of the only positive things I have to say about the film is in regard to the casting choices which I felt suited the characters very well. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Bill Skarsgård who's performance, in my eyes, was as good as or if not even better than the performance of Tim Curry back in 1990. He gave the impression that he belonged in the film in ways the other actors just didn't. I think the make up-artists and costume designers did an excellent job with Pennywise and all his other forms throughout the film. in my opinion it is a shame a great performance like that was overshadowed by a poor plot line and mediocre supporting roles from the other actors.",It

I wasn't scared one bit, BUT, great performance by Skarsgard, refreshing take on the book, much darker than the original It movie. Even though it's a two-hour venue, it has great pace, there' s always something going on, it doesn't get dull, not once. The characters are well developed. Yes, the movie does generously fall into those awful horror movie clichés pitfalls (but, then again, so does the book), in case you were expecting something innovative. IT's costume was truly on point, none of that flashy yellow Ronald McDonald crap, it was actually pretty classy, had a ""carnival of venice/ medieval buffoon"" thing to it, which made the whole thing just right. Again, not a horror movie, especially for hard core horror fans, but it is a great movie for popcorn night. Totally recommend it. Go see it.",It

1901,wrcarmi,One of the best!,10,13 November 2017,"We all know Hollywood's obsession with remaking old films for a current audience. While some have proved themselves worthy of standing with the original like The Thing, Dawn of the Dead, and The Ring; most have proved to be pieces of total garbage like A Nightmare On Elm Street,Halloween 2, Black Christmas, When a Stranger Calls, The Hitcher, and so on. However, when they announced the remake of IT, I wasn't sure what to expect. The film has gone through a type of development hell to the point that they changed directors and crew. Normally, both being a remake and being stuck in development hell is a bad sign for a film. So it failed and went to bargain bin, right? Wrong! IT 2017 is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen this year and a prime example on how to do both a remake and an adaptation correctly. For starters, every actor gives it their A-game in this movie. Very few times can you ever see so many good child actors in a film. In the original mini-series, the acting could be seen as a bit off. Here? Every character had a sense of realism that I could get behind. This movie also had one of those moments were I really wanted to cheer the cast on. Very few movies have gotten me to do that and this movie did it masterfully. Bill Skarsgard impressed me as Pennywise. While he isn't in the film too much, it is a role that I enjoyed.The cinematography itself is beautiful. This movie had so many shots that I just stare on in awe at it in enjoyment. IT 2017 is simply one of the better remakes and modern horror movies that I have seen lately, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good film.",It

I think that the character's were very well developed and were easy to get to know. I also think that Bill Skarsgård put a unique feeling to Pennywise that I thought was interesting and new.

1907,dr-m-12277,"I hate to say it, I was disappointed.",5,28 September 2017,"I want to clarify that I do believe IT (2017) is a good film, it just failed to meet my expectations. I also want to clarify that I avoid comparing the film to the book, but rather the original 1990 release, because we all know the book is always going to come out on top.IT (1990) is one of my favourite films. Naturally, when I heard the remake had released to a positive reception, I was extremely excited to see it. I had a glance at the IMDb page, noticed it ran for 2h 15mins and became even more excited, the original (kid half) was 1h 30mins, imagine how much depth this new version can have! Sadly, I was very wrong. The original (in less time) fleshed out these characters far more. I got to know each kid, what they were afraid of, watch their bond strengthen, and then together, how they managed to overcome their greatest fears. I just didn't feel that in this new film, I didn't feel like these kids had an unbreakable bond. Removing the scenes of the kids building a dam was a big mistake, it was here that we saw the kids bonding, coming together to overcome this challenge (before facing the real one, IT). It's actually a real shame, because it appears that these kids had some real acting skills, on average they were far superior to the original kids (minus Jonathan Brandis, he is in a league of his own).Then onto IT himself, it just didn't work for me. Where was the tension? Where was the atmosphere? Bill Skarsgård did a far better job than I expected, it's not his fault that IT (2017) just wasn't as scary/creepy as the original, but he actually has far too much screen time, far too much physical presence. The best way to sum this up is the ending scene, where the kids literally beat the crap out of IT. In the original film, they don't even physically take him on, IT tries to mentally break them down one by one, only through the kids extremely strong bond are they able to withstand his psychological attacks. Even Bill manages to fight off Georgie's illusion by himself in the new movie, where is the emphasis on the power of their friendship? I was waiting for the gang to jump in and help Bill, help him understand it's not real, turns out he didn't even need them. I can't even believe these kids will be afraid of IT returning, they'll be twice the size, twice the beat-down for IT.",It

I told him Ninjago since the kids I work with have been talking about it a bunch and he said, ""interesting choice. I think we will see it."" I parked the car while he bought the tickets so imagine my surprise when we walked into a theater playing It with a capital I, not Ninjago.

It's a person that gives little kids balloon, surprise you at your birthday and gives you a hug , entertained little children, giving them a great time and fun time. IT is another clown story it's not about making little kids happy but make them terrified, it's not about surprising you and giving you a hug but IT will murder you not in a nice way tho, but it does gives you a balloon but the difference is that you will float too. It's about supernatural killing clown (PennyWise) that kills and take little children, teenager and even adult, who can manipulate people's fear or emotion and turning it against them which cost murder.

Pretty good film, I do have a few criticisms but after seeing the way nicholas bowers publicly humiliated someone on youtube for simply having HIS own opinion and criticisms, I'll refrain from giving mine for I do not wish to be posted on his twitter. Lost a lot of respect for the film as a whole after seeing this Nicholas kid have an arrogant temper tantrum over 1 criticism. I'm guessing this is first (and now i'm sure only) film he will be in after his diva behavior shadowing negative and snobby light on a film that is supposed to be anything but that. Stephen King himself has taken so much criticism and takes it like a man. This is partially (along with him being a writing GOD) why he's held onto such an amazing career for all these years. Sadly I will not be watching this movie again, and will not suggest it. The 5 stars are for the hard, incredible work of everyone else in the movie (and mostly for stephen!!!!)

It ruined all the scary moments by making them way too loud so you were distracted from the horror, the clown talked to much so he became a lot less scary, the humor ruined it as well because it relaxed you and you never got a build up of horror.

1915,daleuchtman,A great book that deserves better.,6,6 October 2017,"I will start by saying I'm a big fan of the book, and was realistic about how adaptions for the big screen rarely pay off.Spoilers ahead. I found the film to be very nostalgic, with subtle nods to the viewer who love the novel, such as the Paul Bunyan Statue, the Tracker Bros and Freese's shirts, the mural in the alleyway of the shootout, various inclusions of Turtle motifs, etc. More than once I found myself smiling with glee. I had a problem however, with how the kids were already established as friends, as the novel is hinged on how the individual children find each other one by one, and find solace in each other when it looks like Pennywise is destined to kill them. They watered down the ""loser"" aspect of the Loser's Club, which I feel doesn't help when trying to care about them. Although the kids deliver great on screen presence, the look oddly aged in relation to each other. I really think this film should have been broken down into two films, giving enough material is there to fully flesh out these characters. Henry Bowers is huge force in the novel, and barely features in the film. I was hoping for the cerebral ending that features in the book, given that the Mini series didn't have the budget to do it, but sadly it doesn't feature the Ritual of Chüd, the Smokehole ceremony, the Macroverse or much of the Deadlights. Im glad they chose not to include the dude on dude HJ and the Losers Club running a train on Bev in the sewer from the book. Silver linings...Pennywise was well done, although CGI featured too frequently. The film itself is darker than the Mini Series and closer to King's gruesome vision, but not close enough for me. Im really hoping the part 2 is going to go over much of what was missing from this film.Go see this film AND read the book.",It

Even though I nearly peed myself for sure I would love to see this again! Overall I think that this by far is the best movie I ever seen! The jump scares were phenomenal (sorry if I spelled that wrong). While watching it you will be creep-ed out but by the end it will be the only thing you think about and will obsess over it. I really recommend this movie, but only if your ready to get scared because there are scenes that made me cry they were so scary. My final statement is that you will fall in love with the story, and with the actor/actresses, I recommend seeing it with a friend and or family member. This movie will make you appreciate your friends and love them so much more, plus I would be horrified if I wasn't accompanied cause really this is a hugely scary movie! 10/10 <3",It
1917,rtapiaruano,Not what I was expecting,9,8 October 2017,I grew up with Tim Curry's Pennywise. Nothing was and will ever replace his iconic version of the menacing clown. When I heard about this remake I was against it of course. Any classic movie or series should be left untouched. But after following up with the remake I was willing to give it a chance.After seeing this and knowing there will be a Chapter Two it all makes sense. It measures up to the original. The cast was perfect. The story telling is fantastic. The scares and pacing are perfect. And casting Skarsgard was brilliant. He did not try to mimic Tim's version. He simply made Pennywise another menacing clown. So far this is my favorite film of 2017.,It
1918,vanconants,As a Fan of the book/ and as a stand alone,2,8 October 2017,"As a fan of the book. Waited a month until family was together to go see movie. Having all recently read the book( me for third time) Everyone's first comment was ""did they even read the book?"" Now I realize that converting a 1000+ page book into a 2+ hour movie will require some things be dropped, even if you delete the adult section. Seriously though, besides the names of the characters and the fact that villain appears as a clown, I found very few correlations. Spoilers Time period-1958 vs 1986. denies many of the tensions and fears of the heroes. Age-5th grade vs jr high. again 11-12 year olds have a completely different outlook on life than 15-16 year olds. Parents- the hero's relationships with their parents are central to the story. Here, they are either dead (mike) overblown (Eddie) re imagined (henry) or missing (everyone else, besides the fathers of bev and bill) Central themes- missing vs dead (gorgie) Added characters, reasons why losers club is hated by bowers, reassignment of hero's roles, ""beep beep"" ""high-O silver"", the list could be as long as the novel. As a stand alone If I had never heard of IT before, this movie would still only score a 2 or 3 for me. Characters were flat and uninteresting, I felt no reason to care for any of them. Clown was scary until, they used cgi to turn him into beetleguise. Besides Gorgie, deaths were boring and uneventful.

1920,csissel,"Good, but could have been great",7,9 October 2017,"I remember seeing the trailers for IT and being a bit skeptical (as I am with most remakes or reboots), but then I later learned that rather than this movie being a remake of the miniseries of the same name from 1990, this movie was going to focus more on adapting the Stephen King book rather than remaking the miniseries. The miniseries was a mixed bag for me, the child actors were great and the first half is actually quite good (despite me not finding Tim Curry as Pennywise that scary) but the second half falls flat, scenes drag on for too long and the adult actors aren't nearly as good as the child actors in the first half and the ending was a huge letdown, but I am getting sidetracked here, this review is supposed to be about my thoughts on the 2017 film adaption of Stephen King's IT, so what did I think of IT? I enjoyed the movie quite a bit actually. The movie focuses on a group of kids that encounter a malevolent shape shifting monster from another dimension and about how they eventually come together to fight back against the creature. I want to end this review on a positive note so I am going to talk about some of the things in this film that I disliked. I understand that this movie takes place in the 1980's but I personally found it a bit obnoxious when the movie would play 80's pop or rock music over a scene (they do this several times), this annoyed me because these montage moments felt really out of place in an otherwise suspenseful and well made thriller, now I understand that this movie is trying to have comic relief to balance it out with some of the scarier scenes, but, we already have comic relief in the form of the banter between the kids in the loser's club, the dialogue between this group of friends is really funny, these characters feel like the kids from Stand By Me or South Park, so since the movie's comic relief is already supplied from them, we don't need these cringe-worthy scenes with music playing over them. There is another thing in this movie that really annoys me; do you know that stupid cliché where two characters who used to be friends get into a fight and then they separate only to reunite for the movie's climax? well that cliché in in this movie in the scene after the losers first go into the spooky house to fight Penny Wise and come out. The last complaint I have is that some of the jump scares in this movie were annoying and focused more on being loud and obnoxious than actually scary. Now, i will talk about all the things I enjoyed; like the child actors. The actors and actress that make up the Losers gang all gave outstanding performances, the chemistry between the friends really works and feels as though they were actually friends in real life, the dialogue feels natural and I especially commend the actor who played Richie and the actress who played Beverly, as they were the best out of the bunch. The actor who played Penny wise was also quite good, he doesn't just try to copy Tim Curry's Penny Wise, Bill Skarsgard gives us a Penny Wise that is much more psychotic, demonic, and scary than the Penny Wise from the miniseries, I also really like how you get to see Penny Wise shape shift and contort and change into these other different creatures. The cinematography and the pacing in this movie are also really good, there are many great looking shots in this movie and scenes never drag on for longer than they need to unlike the miniseries from 1990, I was never bored while watching this movie. There are some really well executed scares in this movie also such as the scene where Mike sees the hands of people who are burning alive and screaming for help trying to open the door in front of him and then the door slams shut, only to slam all the way open were Pennywise is visible from a distance, carrying away one of his victims, there are several other scary scenes that are very effective. Overall, i like this movie, heck, I even saw it a second time in the theater and It comes close to being a modern horror classic but there are several major flaws that the film has that hold it back from me loving it, but with that said, its still a pretty decent horror flick that I would recommend to horror fans or fans of Stephen King.",It

1922,evilqueensdontgethappyendings,A Superb Film with Mediocre Special Effects,5,10 October 2017,"I highly enjoyed the story, being a Stephen King. I found that the take on Pennywise was a nice change rather than to see someone try and fail at emulating Tim Curry. The children were all wonderful young actors, especially for being involved in a horror movie. The script was well written and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the story unfold, but the lack of advancements in the effects department caused me to not find myself lost within the setting of the film. I will post my example below. It contains a spoiler so please do not read further than this if you do not want a spoiler.********************SPOILER ALERT******************** My biggest problem was with how fake most things looked. I prefer smooth effects that appear realistic but Pennywise's teeth change during the scene with Georgie losing his boat as well as the injury Georgie receives made me and quite a few other people chuckle in the theater. I am uncertain if it was meant to add a comedic take on the attack or not but it bothered me probably more than it should.

1924,SomeDud3,IT Movie Review 9/10,9,17 October 2017,"With inspiration from Stephen King's novel IT, Andy Muschietti, Argentine director, reincarnates the horror novel onto the twenty-first century theater screen. The movie takes place back in the 80's, while following a group of kids self labeled as the ""loser club"" of Derry, Maine. The movie opens in the same fashion as the book; the opening displays little six-year-old Georgie Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott) chasing his toy boat, USS Georgie, as it sails down a gutter and into a storm drain. Then the plot develops to include Georgie's older brother, Bill, and his ""loser"" group: a nerdy chatterbox Richie (Finn Wolfhard), a germ-phobic mama's boy Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), plus a Jewish kid Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), a black farm kid (Chosen Jacobs), a new kid Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), and an abused daughter Bev (Lillis). This group of ragtag kids comes together to confront the Pennywise clown (Bill Skarsgard). From its fractional Stranger Things cast and terrifying special effects, Muschietti's IT balances humor and horror to produce the success, horror film of 2017.Muschietti's effective use of humor throughout the plot exemplifies signs of humanity in ways all audiences can relate. The nostalgic, for many, 1980's America setting also helps to provide some classic clichés and comedy to the cast. Even in the midst of the final battle, comments from Finn and Jack position comedy where it is least expected. After the audience is absolutely creeped out from Pennywise's games, there are cuts in the nightmare showdown where a need to laugh is created. A few sexual punchlines, here and there, really go a long way to keep the audience scared and satisfied. Bill and his group of Derry kids manage to bring some sense of comedy to a mortifying situation of life and death. Unlike Muschietti's relative flop Mama from 2013 making only $28 million opening week, IT bursts out the gate with $123.1 million for opening week. From his previous endeavor, Muschietti learns there is such a thing as too many jokes. He then manages to find that perfect ratio of jokes to jump scares. At no point does one solely watch the movie as a horror or solely as a comedy, instead it is a concisely measured concoction of the two. The recurring childlike, yet not innocent, humor compliments the movie's deeper meaning to the terror of Pennywise: in a way that keeps the audience relaxed, but on the edge of their seats. Along with the humor, IT carries a lot of success from the horror of the clown, Pennywise, and his deeper rooted symbolism. Muschietti portrays the clown as a manifestation of the kid's fears. In many ways how Freddy Kruger lives from the nightmares of his victims, Pennywise feeds from the fears of the town's kids. However, there is no one clear cut event leading to the creation of the clown. Derry's history has been full of tragic events dating back as far as the books go. Muschietti is trying to convince audiences Pennywise's lore stems not only from the fear of death itself, but also a concept much more primal and unexplainable. Which is a key difference when compared to the antagonists of Jason and Freddy. The acting of the clown also exemplifies ""show don't tell"" strategy of great literature books. Most of the terror from Pennywise comes from the spot on acting of how the clown is simply just toying with the kids. Pennywise only comes out to scare the kids here and there with some indirect appearances. Sometimes the clown will be in the brush waving a bloodied hand, chilling in the storm drain, or watching from the haunted house. There's nothing special when it comes to the actual visual effects of editing of the movie, just the normal stuff from Hollywood in 2017. Yet the movie made $123.1 million in it's opening week, which is the third highest for movies in 2017. Much of that success can be accredited to Muschietti's image of Pennywise and the hysteria it was able to conjure from the audience. The director, Andy Muschietti, establishes the perfect mixture of humor and horror to yield the most successful horror movie of 2017. The ""loser club"" of kids' adult jokes brings a level of comedy and humanity to a horror film not yet too widely popularized. That right amount of humor combined with Pennywise's deeper allusion to raw fear blend perfectly to make the contemporary outline for horror in 2017. These resulting guidelines provide examples that other horror directors in the future should analyze before drawing their storyboards and interviewing their cast.",It

Its use of CGI combined with the lively acting makes for a satisfying and immersive movie experience, something I haven't seen in a long time. Their expressive reactions to Pennywise made me feel like I was a part of the Losers Club, experiencing it alongside the actors.The plot was also stable.

1930,archambaultemily-54938,Terrifying Horror or Fun Coming of Age? Neither,5,17 August 2018,"It was a movie with a lot of potential. Stephen King's enormous (and enormously creepy) book had the perfect makings for a modern horror thriller. A shapeshifting, killer, demonic clown terrorizing a town and targeting a ragtag group of ""losers"" who feel abandoned by adults? Yeah, that plot sets up a Hollywood triumph on a silver platter. Horror movies that have originality and avoid falling back on old tropes and gimmicks everyone has seen a million times before are getting harder to come by. It had an amazing opportunity in its grasp, but sadly failed to make it a reality.
 The biggest issue in this film was the tone they were trying to set. Before its release, it seemed like it would be horror all the way. This movie could have followed easily in the footsteps of past King adaptations, joining the ranks of now infamous films like The Shining and Children of the Corn, or even the previous mini-series version of It. The marketing seemed strategized well; people who had never touched a King book were still lining up to see It, simply for its potential as a horror movie alone. The teasers and trailers were all objectively horrifying, and the R rating only added to the impression that it was for an audience of adult scary movie fans. 
This would all be great, if only the movie had delivered. But instead of focusing on the horror aspects, the film turned the whole story into a wacky coming-of-age plot with a few scary parts. After acting like it would be the next great horror phenomenon, the movie turned into a Stranger Things wannabe (complete with Finn Wolfhard as Richie Tozier and changing the time period to the 80s from the 50s, opting for trends and nostalgia instead of originality and reasonable adherence to the book). The movie ultimately tried to be more Goonies and Stand By Me than total King terror, which left many in the audience confused and disappointed.
The book, being over 1000 pages, has more development and background than could possibly fit into a feature film. The novel always maintains an eerie tone that spirals into fear frequently, but it was also able to explore the relationships between the growing kids as they try to figure out how to deal with the monster. While the book could fully blend both these directions, it's a much harder balancing act for a movie. It tried to do both, and the resulting jumble of killer clown pop out scenes with preteen adventure only served to make the scary sections, well...not scary, and the human interactions underdeveloped, stereotyped, and all around lacking. 
Let's start with the horror. After the opening scene of Georgie's death that let the audience glimpse Skarsgard's bone-chilling performance as Pennywise, the titular character is given nothing else to do that is in any way compelling. Reduced to mere jump scares for the duration of the film, the clown falls into a predictable, boring pattern. When set up well, jump scares can be extremely effective, (the moving picture in the garage scene was a pretty good part) but when used over and over again as the only main way of scaring the audience, it's a cheap cop out to actual cinematic techniques. Furthermore, since the protagonists were all kids, the movie decided to portray the clown in its various forms, as well as other intense parts, as not realistic. The message of the book was that despite the fact that they were kids, and the adults couldn't see nor help them, everything that was happening to them was real. Instead, whenever Pennywise took on a different persona that was supposed to be one of the kid's worst fears (Eddie's leper, Stan's painting, etc.) the grotesque use of CGI made it look like something you should laugh at, not run screaming from (Ben's decapitated person being a prime example), effectively killing any kind of pervasive fear they were trying to instill. It only worsened as the movie progressed, and the climax featured the kids attacking the clown as its head changed shape to fit each kid- the ultimate effect was stupid. The scariest form of It by far is the clown, and trying to put a new face on It completely backfired again and again. And yet this is far from the only example where the horror was toned down. The rock fight scene-so intense and heart-pounding in the book- was made to look tame (and some terrible slow-motion effects were thrown in for some reason). You could've swapped the rocks with water balloons and it still would've made sense. Another instance, the aftermath of the blood eruption in Bev's bathroom was treated as an upbeat bonding moment for them all to clean up, undermining the seriousness of the situation completely. And the list could go on.
 Apart from the horror, the focus of the movie was the kids becoming friends and growing up. For this to work well as a premise, the characters would all ideally need to be diverse, and complete a kind of arc from beginning to end. With seven main characters, it's a little difficult to pull off. It worked okay for Bill- the audience connected with him at the start and could sympathize with his struggle to cope with his brother's death. The others, however, were reduced to simple caricatures of actual people. Eddie the asthmatic hypochondriac, Ben the fat nerd, Richie the one who swears a lot, and ...Stan and Mike? If those were even their names. Bev started off as one of the strongest characters, the only girl in the group, before having all her glory ripped away as she is kidnapped and put into a trance by Pennywise, turning her into a damsel in distress archetype that the boys had to go rescue. (A completely unnecessary deviation from the book, they didn't need any extra motivation to go hunt down the monster, and it seemed like an odd way of imitating Audra's storyline from the adult half of the book). It only worsens for Bev when Ben manages to wake her from her sleep by kissing her (like a princess in a fairy tale), which was a move that may have been slightly less absurd if the movie hadn't ended with Bev kissing one of the other guys (because there was a desperate need for a preteen love triangle).
 This isn't to say the movie was all bad. It had some surprisingly clever moments that made it more intriguing. The child/adult dichotomy, so agonizing in the book, played out very well on screen (Eddie's mother and the pharmacist in particular), with actors who ended up being just as creepy as Pennywise, without any special effects or pop-outs needed. Other moments include the red balloon appearing in the car that drove by Ben without stopping, and the scene in the library of Ben reading with the librarian far in the background, staring at the camera, and coming closer and closer in each shot. These brief moments of genius only make the weaker parts seem so much worse in comparison. If only the movie had relied more on subtler, deeper forms of terror instead of predictable cliches again and again. It didn't follow the book very closely at all, and even though the novel has areas that would never translate well cinematically, the movie still differed in lots of small parts for no apparent reason. With another chapter coming, focusing on the characters as adults, (already promised to be more scary and intense), we can only hope that the style of the sequel is more focused and carefully crafted. With the ""coming of age"" part of the story out of the way, there's nothing to undermine the elements of terror, and hopefully, we will all get the insane horror movie we were promised in the first place.",It
1931,gregsin-08701,IT 2017 movie review - A horror movie it is....,8,17 October 2017,"For me, the reason I watch the movie because I am very curious since there are a lot of good reviews and my friends already watch it. I know it was from the Stephen King novel, so I am very excited to watch it. And for sure it will be awesome since the last movie that I saw from Stephen King was Carrie which it was awesome too.Back to my review of the movie, It is not a very conventional movie, which at first you will be thinking about why, but you will be amaze at first story was the boy was playing a paper boat then he came across with a little hole in the alley.Which there was a clown and got his paper boat. Then the clown tried to persuade the little boy which makes me curious what will the clown will do to the kid. But it was very awesome for me because I thought that he will just threaten the kid, but he bite the kid and got him. WOW. 2 thumps up. That was just a first story line. We are just getting started.At first I thought it was just the kids imagination for a clown, it wasn't, it was different it feeds on fear. The more you fear him the more he will be stronger. He will create a thing that you fear the most and it will devour you whole literally. Which makes me chills to my spines, but excite on the other hand. Because it scares me.So it was a very good movie, then not typical horror movies which you can predict the story lines anytime. So I recommend this movie, a must see movie. A horror movie it is...",It

This was kinda corny. The kids were annoying. I love horror and I had a feeling it was gonna be ""the clown movie"". IT was not a horror story for me. I don't think that was SK's idea when he wrote it. The only thing scary for me in the book were Mike Hanlon's notes in his journal. Too bad they switched Mike's role and gave it to Ben.

1933,blinddogroofer,"Gratuitously excessive bad language, random red herring, and predictability.",1,19 October 2017,"The Good. The Movie was well filmed and well acted. The bad: I grew up in the 80s, and not even drunken sailors and pirates in a bar fight swear as much as the otherwise adorable kids. It was completely unnecessary and excessive to the point it ruined the movie for me, and I'm nothing close to a prude. The incessant sexual references, by kids who by and large had no idea what sex was, was also not something authentic, and was off-putting. We had swim trunks in the 80s, and ""tighty whities"" an inch thick in the movie might have been necessary to retain an r-rating, but pretty unrealistic both as an impromptu swim (we went skinny dipping) or as a planned swim (uh, trunks, hello!?). A girl cuts her long hair in a sink and long sections of hair go right down. Drains plugged in the 80s folks, and sinks had traps and strainers. Later, she puts a tape measure down the sink and it goes straight down 24 feet. Since they're looking for an old well it seems relevant, but it's below the sink, and there's no explanation for what seems to be a red herring. There's no explanation why adults don't see the bad thing (trying not to explain too much) but the characters reveal that adults go missing as well as kids so it's not just a kid thing. There are absolutely no surprises and everything that happens is painfully obvious in advance. One of the kids does research and discovers tragedies with high death counts every 27 years, but there's no explanation for why that happens or why in the beginning it would be a circus fire or something, but then becomes a series of individual attacks, and there's no explanation for why no one in town notices large groups of people going missing every 27 years, especially children, which people tended to keep track of in the 80s. There is no exposition to get any sense at all why things are happening. In short, it's pretty random. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if it's a bad adaptation, or if Mr. King is coasting. I don't read/ watch many horror movies, but Pet Cemetery was excellent with none of the flaws I mentioned here.

1941,sadeqabdullahi,IT Has Flown Me Away,7,7 November 2017,"Pennywise (also known as IT by the group kids) is a clown that feeds off the fear of kids to survive. He appears every 27 years. For this movie I expected a ten out of ten or at least a 9, but I received a 7.5 instead. I was bummed out because I wanted to be scared by the movie. All I received were jump scares and after a couple of them scared me I could predict when it was going to happen, so it did not scare me as much. Also the plot of the movie wasn't that great. If you didn't read the book you wouldn't know that the story was changed, but if you did then you probably noticed some of the differences between the book and the movie. The way the children encounter IT is completely different in the book, than the way the movie showcased it. In the book, Ben sees a mummy, but in the movie he sees a headless guy. Although the movie didn't meet the expectations I set up for it, the movie was still good because of the action scenes, acting and drama. For example, the part where Beverly is attacked by her dad after he says ""are you still my daughter"" was especially entertaining. Also the love triangle between Bill, Ben, and Beverly was very interesting because it left me wondering who Beverly is going to pick. The movie ended by foreshadowing the next movie.

1942,oudaiya,Believing is seeing,6,8 November 2017,"The movie reminds me ""The Skeleton Key"" which has the similar topic that only if you believe the existence of evil, the evil can hurt you. Although ""The Skeleton Key"" only got 6.5 while IT got 7.7 on IMDb. The difference is very likely to come from the clown since it scares many adults. Clown hasn't been out of date yet proved by the last success from the American Horror Story Season four. The quirky smile on clown's face that terrifies people immediately made the beginning of IT impressive, especially when the victim is an adorable kid. No matter how the clown changes its appearance in front of different kids, it always came with a red balloon, suggesting evil is coming. The sign always reaches people quickly. Maybe next time you saw a red balloon on the street, the movie would pop out of your mind. However, other parts of the movie were average. Somebody says that IT will be a great show if you like Stranger thing. While as a Stranger thing fan, I feel the similarity only exist in external. Because unlike stranger thing, IT failed to build a convincing logic world and there are many unreasonable places. For example, so many kids are missing and only one parent cares. Or, the main character somehow made his friends searching for his brother at risk of dying. When they tried to kill the clown together, it weirdly became a cult movie where a bunch of kids turn their fear into violence. After that, they cut their hands to make the vow to kill the clown again if it came back and held hands in blood. Ironically, the next scene is two kids kissing in a beautiful grass field.

How screwed are one can be when he comes knocking? IT, which is a remake of a 1990's film one pressing question comes into our minds did it live up to the hype? Well here is what I have concluded. IT (2017) is a good remake because of the Scenery, Plot, and Humor. As stated it is a remake of a miniseries from IT (1990) a group of misfits or the outcast team up together against IT and his influence with the main bully. The main character's sheer willpower, teamwork and dumb luck they overpower Fear itself!IT (2017) is a good remake because of Scenery. The advancement of technology with substantial funding to remake IT (2017) made it possible to have better cameras, and editing software one can see in the texture of the monsters or the morphing of IT comparing it to the older film. The film also had a reference by going through the old one to see improvement which is probably an advantage at this point. In the comment about scenery really can affect how the movie is portrayed especially in the beginning of the rain setting the mood for a sad undertone of the first kill that is connected to one of the main characters. With the advancement of technology, it is more and more possible to recreate the images we see in our minds as we read fantasy books down to the very details without cringing in the animation of it. Not only is IT (2017) a good remake because of Scenery, but also a good Plot.IT (2017) is a good remake because of the Plot. ""Boys going to be boys"" the hormones kicking in checking the only chick in the group. This movie got it all romance, funny, and some scary points I'll give it that. It accurately depicts what the kids do with the lack of common sense getting all scatter brained to a point of conflicting decisions to group up and be safe or get picked off one by one. Romance at this point of the movie is with what seems to be the main leader character in the group and the smart new kid on the block with the only girl in the group. Funny parts is definitely when the skinny/smallest guy in the group keep on saying bad words which I relate pretty much because I am that guy in the group. Prominently pointed as a horror movie it does follow the pattern of an overwhelming force against the weak (kids) gets unbelievably defeated in the end, but is he really? One part criticism of the plot could be that IT had multiple times where he could've picked them off no questions asked and I say IT was just getting their fears up because that's what he feeds on the scariest thing would be the anticipation on when he is going to strike ensuring paranoia, then IT can feed off more to their fear. The Plot is representative of kids in that age to have urges and they all seem to be not all in the same page meaning they have uncertainties, but it worked out in the end. Not only is IT (2017) a good remake because of Plot, but also a good Humor.IT (2017) is a good remake because of humor. IT is beginning dialogue before he bit the kid's arm off was off setting at first because one know what is going to happen, but we are forced to watch and say oh my god get out of there KID QUICK. Another cool fun ways IT displays is through Polaroid's as IT changed the mom's face into Penny-wise the clown hilariously as it reminds me of the time my mom fooled me in the same way, but a different monster (The Grudge). Dark humor being present is a good nod to some people like me who finds the joke not the act itself to be humorous in a way that one don't usually see it happening, but it's happening making it ironic. An example would be dead kids which shouldn't happen somehow it does in this story could be a nod to the real world on how death doesn't discriminate. Another example is about the main girl character not only haunted by IT, but is also with subtle hints of abuse by her very own father which is sickening indeed, but that really does happen making us sympathize more to the characters hating their predicaments and why must they get further punched down by society and the monster. The humor was right for a person like me because I can see the situation where its coming from and how it could be funny cause I have a kind of dark sense humor.Because of Scenery with the advancement of technology in filming, Plot to where its accurately depicted what a kid might think or do, and Humor with the tint of black humor IT (2017) was a good remake. IT monopolizes on our fears if the misfit kids can do it, why can't we? All in all as reasons shown above IT was a good remake and hopefully the sequel can also deliver the punch it did as its predecessor and give the generation the fear it deserves to have as it did generations before.",It
1945,johnjohnandr,Drama and horror mixed to the perfect combination,10,25 January 2018,"Not as scary as I expected, but gorgeous. The message that it conveys was really wonderful. I absolutely suggest you see it.",It
1946,herbietool,Don't Believe the Hype,4,18 November 2017,"I spent over 5 hours today with It. I re-watched the original mini-series and then this movie, so of course I'm going to make comparisons between the two. I had read many reviews of this film heralding it as the next great horror movie, surpassing many box office records, and even putting the genre back into Oscar contention. After viewing the film, I can't say I see where any of this hype comes from.First off, the kids in the 1990 mini-series had much better on screen chemistry then the kids in this version. The mini-series did a much better job of giving them a back story, and really portrayed them as having a relationship in which they genuinely cared for each other. In this version, we have the kid from Stranger Things (Finn Wolfhard - Richie) relentlessly making ""your mom"" jokes until the other cast members haphazardly stumble into the plot, and end up joining up with the Loser Crew for some very benign reasons.Secondly, this film added a whole bunch of unnecessary horror tropes into the story that, in my opinion, did nothing but take away from the horror aspect. Beverly's bathroom scene for instance gained nothing from the added blood and gore. If anything, it made it less believable, as in the mini-series she is able to clean the blood herself, but in this movie there is a cleaning montage with six characters cleaning a blood soaked room while under a tight time line before her father returns home.The jerky villain motions are also something that has been overdone, and they feel out of place for a story that is supposed to be set in the 80's. Ditto the wide-mouthed toothy grin that Pennywise has; the shoehorning in of the ""haunted house,"" in a story that's supposed to be centered around a sewer system, and the scene where a victim gets dragged out of frame accompanied by a high pitched scream. All in all, these things were too clichéd to make the movie scary.Third, it felt like the characters were neutered versions of their book/mini-series counterparts. Mike's character in this version seemed like almost an afterthought, while he was intended to be one of the central characters, arguably even the main character of the original story. The bullies also lost their backstories, and end up essentially being token bad guys for no reason, even though they had fully fleshed out backstories in the novel.I understand that no visual representation will be able to capture all of the nuance of the novel, but this version seemed to come up glaringly short- especially considering the review scores it got.All in all, I think this remake would have been better off being a multi part mini-series, as was the original intention. While I completely understand that they intend to make a Part 2 centered around the adult's story, two hours is not nearly enough to express the detail and emotion that this half of the story required.",It
1947,andreviens,Best,10,19 November 2017,"I think it has some redeeming qualities.The first half with the losers club is not bad. It's just very difficult to adapt Kings work. He always has strange concepts that he can write and explain very well, but having to adapt it visually without his talent for details can lead to really bizarre and strange moments. I got the impression the mini series was showing you the different events and scares from the book without really knowing how they connect to each other. So a lot of it is taken out of context, which makes it a little awkward to watch.",It
1948,scottkhy,"Modern Horror, Not Enough Creepiness",4,23 November 2017,"I was excited to watch this newer version of It, hoping that with a good cast and a great story to build upon, I would get a glimpse back into my childhood nostalgia of deep fear and a sense of being really, really scared...but boy was I wrong.While the cast was great, the main creepy of the movie was ruined by an exaggeration of scenes, mostly with jump scares, and Pennywise being almost a joke with all of his CGI effects. My expectations for Pennywise were to sink in a level of fear, instead I got a dose of modern film CGI. It almost felt like crossing a modern Transformers movie with the old version of It. The kids were great, everything else wasn't.The movie couldn't pull off the ""Horror"" expectations and the film score didn't help much either. The score was really bad and exaggerated just like the so called scary scenes. The director and producers of this version would have done well to study older horror films to try and reproduce the sense of scare and fear vs the exaggerated scenes and jump scares it had.",It
1949,mcoscelli,a strong horror movie definitely the best of the year however lacked basic originality.,8,3 December 2017,"It (2017) is a strong and enigmatic film. pennywise is a very strong and interesting character you feel as if you want to delve knee deep into his life and want to know where he came from. It manages to mix the horror theme with others such as adventure, this is key because otherwise, you might be feeling bored halfway through. it has very small details in it which are key to its film success this year, in the way of which when pennywise is about to attack his eyes turn yellow, also in the way of which the lamp post where the missing person sheet is displayed has so many holes in it from earlier missing people. it has a solid intriguing plot throughout in the way of which a group of bullied middle school kids comes together to eventually kill Pennyworth. However, a lot of deaths lack basic originality and you can almost always tell what is about to happen next.",It
1950,maorspear,Made me miss the original,5,26 October 2019,"For transparency sake let me say that the Original 'It' was one of my favorite movies as a kid. It was my first scary movie ever at the age of 12 and I must have watched it at least 5 times. I was so excited for this new reboot but ended up being so disappointed. It in no way does the original (or the book, which I've also read multiple times) justice. The clown is not scary at all. The jump scares are boring and I found myself waiting for it to end. The children have no characterization or personality beyond Bill. The chemistry between Ben and Bev which was so clear in the book was missing here and it honestly just made me miss the original. Frankly boring film.",It
1951,kassi_wright,Loved,8,22 December 2017,"It was a lot better than I imagined it would turn out. The graphics were great and looked very realistic in most parts. This is definitely a family movie to get the laughs and little scares here and there. One thing I would change would to have it slightly more scary, I believe it was the right amount of funny I just would have liked to be scared a little more with this type of movie due to my love for horror movies. Overall I would say they knocked it out the park with this remake and I would recommend this to everyone.",It
1952,anouaramas,What was that ?,2,1 January 2018,"NO tension, NO context, a sort of a backstory the least you can say about it is BAD, with personal issues for each character just sprinkled over a rushed script to show some kind of character diversity and convince us that ""those kids are not the same"". You spend the entire movie trying to understand the reason why all these random and non-frightening things are happening, but the only thing you get is moments of basically staring at the WB man of 2017 doing things that make no sense and don't move the plot forward. Add to that the almost comical portrayal of numerous stereotypes and a way over the top exaggeration of the kids' authority and critical thinking. And yeah, it's not scary.",It

1958,sorrelclarke,Brilliant!,10,21 January 2018,"The remake of the film was amazing! There were some small concepts and scenes missing from the old version (1990) but I guess it doesn't have to be the same. 
You know the scene where SPOILER ALERT Georgie dies? Well there is bonus scene when he survives! There are other scenes like extras (about 11). You need the disc to watch them though. The music was good, Bill who played Pennywise/IT was fantastic, and there is a behind the scenes documentary about it. I think its good, not scary at all for me but don't show this to people who are easy disturbed or children (that's why it's a 15) It is a little bit of a comedy and a mainly a horror. I still yet haven't seen the old film, having heard only the bad info about it, but I found myself on most days searching on Youtube about comparisons of both 2 films or easter eggs etc. The concept of the film was captured through the eyes of Stephen King himself. Having said that, I truly believe it is a film for horror film lovers or similer people to watch.P.S This movie swears, has very small sexual references and LOTS of blood! I now warn you...",It

1960,Jeff_Loubat,It could have been far better,6,23 January 2018,"""It"" is far less scary than the first original movie. Tim Curry putted his character on another dimension by playing more psychological. Moreover, the abondance of hemoglobine scenes acted a little bit as a turned down.They wanted this movie closer of the Stephen King's book atmosphere but it happened to be all the contrary that occured.However, I liked the prestation of the ""new clown"" who could have been epic with a better scenario.",It

I don't get the good reviews, this is just so boring, the kids are annoying as hell and this is too much like stranger things or the goonies. I wanted to tell those kids to phone the FBI to let them deal with the clown lol but like in stranger things, kids are saving the world...

1962,sgustafson-66759,Disjointed and at times confusing,5,31 January 2018,"For me, I know that a movie is not as good as the hype when 1) I slowly become disinterested in the story line and 2) I fast forward to the end. I had that feeling with this movie. The opening scene had me intrigued, but it slowly but surely went downhill from there. The kids seemed one dimensional, almost cookie cutter like, and I never had the feeling that these kids where ""best friends"" to the end. The actor who portrayed Henry Bowers was neither menacing nor interesting. The monsters themselves where at times laughable, and though the actor portraying the clown did a rather good job of it, nothing compares to Tim Curry. Skarsgard's rendition made me uneasy; Curry's rendition was simply downright scary. My final complaint was the CGI - way too much of it. When a movie relies on so much CGI to move a story along, then I wonder about the quality of the movie. After awhile, I didn't care what happened to either the kids or Pennywise. It was an OK movie, but way overhyped. I won't watch it a second time.",It
1963,stabcore-95051,It really is that bad,1,3 February 2018,"The kids were all extrodinary in their roles. And that is the only redeeming factor of this terrible adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel. Every other aspect from this movie, from the writing, editing, directing, you name it, is unforgivably flawed. I wish I could say I was simply ""let down"", but this is seriously one of the worst films I have ever seen. Without the aid of the original miniseries, and/or the novel, there is no reason to care about any of these characters, and no way to even understand what the film is even about. There's virtually no story to any part of this move. And the CGI, seriously!!!! Wow. I can generally look past obvious CGI effects in other films. But this isn't your normal ""obvious CGI"" this is really really really BAD ""obvious CGI"". Aside from the parts in the preview, there is not one scene of pennywise that isn't laughably executed. From the first encounter with Georgie, to the ridiculous dances, to the awful ending. This film has ruined an iconic horror movie antagonist, and the worst part about it, is that they're going to make another one. I'm not sure exactly what went wrong, or where they went wrong, because every single aspect (aside from the acting of the main 7) is just wrong. To say I'm disappointed would be a vast understatement. 
The PR team however, deserves commending for keeping the rating well above what it deserves. Forget horror movie, this is just a bad bad bad bad bad movie.Save your money, safe your time, save yourself from enduring this forgettable train wreck of a film.",It

To this day the original ""IT' movie scares me and I'm 35 yrs old. I wish these directors and producers would stop remaking classic movies it just doesn't workout especially the horror movies. One can not and I mean can not remake a Stephen King origianl stop it already. The remake of Nightmare on Elm street another example of a bad idea. Freddy was my height and I'm 4'7 dammit.

1968,sutoafili,IT wasn't disappointing,7,9 March 2018,"""It,"" originally written by Stephen King is one of the best horro storylines that I've come across. Stephen King is one of my favorite author because I love horror movies and stories. I watched this movie with my ex when it first came out and he was scared out of his mind. He hates horror movies and super scared. I was laughing at him the entire time eating my popcorn and enjoying the movie and its plot. I loved how Pennywise came at all of the children differently and individually pulling out their greatest fear and showing the audience more about the characters themselves. It showed character development throughout the movie how the children got over their fears and pushed through for the better of their friends and ultimately taking one for the team. The actor who played Pennywise was undoublty wonderful and scary and no one could have played it better. His mannerisms and the little actions he displayed made him even scarier than just his appearance. The actors who played the children did an amazing job displaying innocence and being naive to every situation. The script, story, and action was perfect nop doubt about it. There were so many people in the audience that I hear screaming over and over again because the horror was just that good! The movie did a very good job at keeping up with he book and being loyal to Stephen King. Although the movie was only 135 minutes long and it moved by quickly, time flies by when you're having fun.The negative movie reviews states that theres no characters development, no bond of friendship and it wasn't clear if the m0vie was supposed to be funny or scary? IT CAN BE BOTH. And there was character development. The girl was distant from all of them and they bonded over fighting pennywise despite their greatest fears! I think you have to be pretty blind to say that they were no character development and that the movie wasn't good at all. Obviously a movie can be more than once genre. Yes the movie was advertised to be a horror scary movie but that doesn't mean it can't be funny at all. Many people said that they were disappointed because the trailer overhyped it and so did many other people. They backed this statement up with saying the film had shitty scripts and shitty actors. This claim has got to be weak and unthoughtful. This film is based on Stephen Kings classic book. One of the best horror writers of all time probably the best writers in general of all time despite his choice of genre. IT was as realistic as possible, in scare wise. Although there weren't that many jumping scares there was a lot of build up, the sketchy environment, and the uncertainty of the kids. Not once was I unconvinced of their fear and what they were feeling of the torment of Pennywise. This movie had to have been good because of the lasting outcome of people talking about how they wanted to be the cast of IT for Halloween. Or how everything Pennywise and It related was sold out of stores on Halloween.""It"" is a movie worth watching to those who are into comedy and/or horror. ""It"" is a good movie overall because it was well written....duh. ""It"" is a movie consisting of a couple of kids facing their deepest darkest fears individually trying to come to a conclusion as to why and how a kid in their neighborhood was killed. They come together as friends and make new friends to figure out this murder/his disappearance. They came together despite their differences and put bits and pieces together. While finding clues one of the friends was abducted too.. While trying to find clues something haunts the kids and brings out their deepest and dearest fears trying to make the kids scared and scare them off hoping to scare the kids enough to call off their search to find out what happened to their friend. In the end they put together all of their clues and fight off Pennywise the clown and find out what's happened to their friends. The ending to me was kina gay and could've been better.",It

It never felt very tense and any scene that could have been somewhat scary was ruined by a pointless jump scare that made most of the scenes more annoying than scary. However the special effects are well done and the humour is decent however it's overall a boring, frightless film that left me extremely disappointed.Maybe it may have been the reviews that made my expectations really high but I've tried to watch it a few times trying to like it but just can't.

1984,eckerd-60840,Kids See Ghosts (sorry for bad english),7,28 July 2019,"I see some reviews with the rating 4-5/10 from 2017 and i think that its because of the hype around the film. Even before the premiere, many people called this movie as ""the best King adaptation"" or ""best horror of the decade"" etc. but we didn't got anything mind-blowing and people were disappointed, but that's a good horror movie with nothing special.
It's appearance wasn't good/terrifying at every single of his show-ups as Pennywise, but when he plays with the kids by showing up as their baddest fear or some traumatic character of their lives, it was really good. The jumpscares are lame in my opinion, except the projector scene. What's the best part? The kids. Phenomenal acting by all of them, and extra point for the writers that they doesn't wrote them as some innocent sacred children. Richie always talks/thinks about sex, and sometimes they swear harder than adults.
So It is a good horror movie if you dont believe the hype like ""best King adaptation""(better than The Shining or The Green Mile or Stand By Me or The Shawshank Redemption).",It

There was just enough changes to make it worth redoing the movie, but still held true to the miniseries.Great acting and I appreciated all the humor. Everyone complaining with the CGI are forgetting how bad special effects look on our modern TVs. The miniseries is a joke now...my kids were shocked I could have ever found the original minseries scary.",It

1990,DevilsAndDragons,Trying to hard,4,2 January 2018,"AS a fan of the original It, this one was expected to be a new take on the story and not a carbon copy of the the original. I was OK with that and was excited to see what direction they took. SO I guess I have to start with what I liked about the original. Like the first Jaws, Pennywise was rarely seen and when he was he more playfully sadistic then outright gore. Taunting, torturing, and otherwise being a general nuisance to the kids. The opportunist that he was would allow him to pick one off when the option was there. The horror was subtle.This version is not subtle at all, matter fact is overboard with gore and for no good reason. It doesn't make Pennywise more evil or less. They tried to hard . He is constantly trying to lure them to him to get them where the old version he was more methodical. Imagine that the old Pennywise is more refined and practiced, while this one is a rookie.That is what it felt like to me.Now for the other characters. Namely The losers club. You felt like Bill form the first one was actually a stuttering kid. You felt like the kids were who they played. This one felt like a bunch of snot nosed foul mouthed kids running around trying to play their characters. The amount of f bombs dropped and at times for no good reason other then a line was not enjoyable to watch. It lessoned the experience into any other run of the mill horror movie where the characters are shallow and morally bankrupt. At times i was hoping Pennywise would get one just to shut him up. Between Richie and Eddie I kept shaking my head. Not once did the characters in the first one make me annoyed. This one, annoyed within minutes.Bill Skaarsgard did a good job with the character in look , and this still can be a good outcome in Chapter 2 if they drop the trying to hard feel and just let movie be what it is from the start. Sadly with little character development from the first chapter we wont get much more in the second half.",It
1991,k8lynw-29291,IT (2017) Movie Review,10,15 October 2018,"I'm not completely sure what I was expecting from this movie when I sat down to watch it. Friends who have seen the movie before gave mixed reviews, some didn't like it, some loved it, some people said it wasn't that scary, and other people said it was horrifying. I never heard anyone give a lukewarm reaction to the movie. Personally, I thought it was amazing. It was a concept that I never have seen nor heard of before and was very successful. It wasn't a very realistic concept, but as a horror movie, it was fantastic. 
 The movie is based in Derry, Maine. Bill Denbrough, played by Jaeden Lieberher, has a little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) who goes missing in the first few minutes in the movie. About every 27 years, there is some sort of missing children incident. The viewer knows that this is because of Pennywise, played by Bill Skarsgård. He takes children down in the sewers, eats them, and makes them hover in the air when he is finished with them. However, the characters do not know about Pennywise. To help him track down his brother, Bill gathers all his friends, Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), and Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs). The kids call themselves the Losers Club because they are all outcasts for all different reasons. As they search for Georgie, Pennywise tries to separate them so he can scare them and eat them. Because of this, the viewer learns what each kid is afraid of. Bill is afraid of his stutter, Stan is afraid of a woman in a painting, Eddie is afraid of lepers, Richie is afraid of clowns, Beverly is afraid of her father, Ben is afraid of the history of Derry and if it repeats itself, and Mike is afraid of being burnt alive. To defeat Pennywise, the kids have to overcome their fears and prove that he cannot scare them anymore. 
The setting and music of the movie created a great atmosphere. The barrens, which is the Losers Club's main hangout spot, is open and large. There is normally no background music to give the impression that it's just a calm and quiet space. The Neibolt House is an accurate representation of an abandoned house, with a creaky floor, cracked walls, and dirty windows. The music is eerie, creating suspense of what will lie around every corner. Finally, the sewers are filled with rubble, dark water, and dripping pipes. In this area, the music is mostly dramatic because this is where the group finds Pennywise's hideout and have their final battle with him. 
All the actors in the movie were astounding. They were all able to portray and evolve their characters very naturally, and they could convey great emotions. For example, the way that the actors were able to portray the Losers Club as just a little friend group who got mixed up in a big problem in their small town seemed very realistic. One actor imparticular, Bill Skarsgård, Pennywise's actor, was able to make his character come to life. The way he was able to convey such fear in just a simple facial expression is beyond impressive. 
Overall, the movie had a new, interesting concept that worked well as a horror movie. The actors and crew were able to collaborate to create a movie that truly makes us ask ourselves, ""What Are You Afraid Of?""",It
1992,alexandrefilipelopes,So bad bad bad,1,8 October 2019,"It's one of the worst films I've ever seen.
There's no story.
The actors are poor and unworthy.
Director! There's no director, I think they forgot to hire and the most important the script!
Another piece that this team doesn't have a clue what it is.",It
1993,lordxpatti-85135,Should have trusted my instincts,2,31 October 2018,"Wasnt going to watch it, thought it looked terrible. Well all my friends and family said it was good and it's the season....Wrong time to doubt myself",It
1994,shortnsweeet,"Great Film, Sparks Deep Thinking",8,8 December 2018,"This is a fantastic film and the story line was amazing. Upon watching this film, I noticed that there were such strong themes that resonate with Pennywise that were present in the film. These themes included fear, fear controlling the characters and fear distracting and manipulating them from living their day to day lives. Have you ever noticed how these themes play out in our own lives when we let fear become bigger than us? Often times we let it control us, hinder us, and knock us down until we are helpless on the floor. However, (SPOIL ALERT) When the kids recognize what it was that was scaring distracting, manipulating them and controlling them, they knew just how to combat It. And that was by stepping outside of fear and soon they had authority over the very thing that was the source of their anxieties.
Watching this movie as a Christian, it really made me think (and these are just my personal thoughts) about how much Pennywise represents fear and how the devil uses the very fears that he knows will cause a distraction from living a day to day life to effectively control our lives. But there's good news to this. The good news is that we don't have to live in fear. Just as these kids stood up to Pennywise and said, ""I'm not afraid"" we can stand up to the fears in our own lives and combat them in whatever way we can. For me, it's Christ. I know that there are times when I struggle so much with worry and anxiety. However, knowing how to overcome it with the power of Christ, who died on a cross for you and me to take away our pain and torment, really has helped strengthen me in these areas. When we stand up to our fears and say, ""I am not afraid,"" we are capable of doing so much more than we can ever think. God bless!",It
1995,oscarlindehey,"It was good, but hyped",9,8 June 2019,"As the title says: It was good, but hyped.It was well-acted and fiendishly frightening with an emotionally affecting story at its core, It amplifies the horror in Stephen King's classic story without losing touch with its heart.",It
1996,sazfcr,It - A Scary Clown Movie,9,21 June 2019,"Based on the book ""It"" by Stephen King, the movie adaptation is one of my favorite horror movies of 2017! This movie is about kids, but it's not for kids. Leave your kids at home! The movie is really scary and full of different terrifying creatures like clowns, evil dads, and demons! It's very frightening, but the story is incredibly entertaining. It's about 7 kids in a group called ""The Losers Club"" who need to stop an evil clown. Go see the movie if you like to be scared, it can definitely scare you!",It
1997,matthiasdoster,great but not perfect,8,3 January 2019,"The beginning: It is a rainy and cloudy day. Georgie Denbrough , the brother of the protagonist, is following a boat made out of paper which disappears into the sewerage. Suddenly an evil clown (IT) grabbed his arm, ate it and pulled the young guy into the sewerage.
The structure of the beginning is a very typical introduction for a scary movie. That means not it is bad but it´s nothing new. The main function is to explain us why the protagonist wants to fight against the evil clown.
Thats another good aspect of the movie. The ending is connected to the beginning and the whole plot is based on the introduction. Later they say in the movie something like we don´t want another missing Georgie.The special effects are very great. Like in all good horror movies is there lots of blood. The special effects are very great. It's almost impossible to notice a badly rendered person.The most interesting point of the whole movie is that a group of young children go together to fight against the evil clown. It is example to fight your own fear to reach your goal.Now to the negative aspects.
At the end the clown explains that he is kidnapping children to feed himself with their fear. You don't know why he is doing that. But the most negative point is that you don't know where the clown is from. The most interesting fact of its motivation and his origin.",It
1998,mhendu-49475,Another remake that should have taken more time to flesh out,5,16 May 2019,"The novel ""It"" is so complicated that, eventhough, this is a first installment, it felt forced and missed so many nuances that Stephen King captured in the book. Understandably, converting a novel to film will not have the exact feel, the kids were comical where comedy should not have been point - this kept me from ever gettting in that nervy feeling and expectation of foreboding. It felt like ""Goonies"" meets ""Stand By Me"". There were some very good effects that you don't see often in recent horror movies and then there's was rubber body part scenes where you wonder, ""did they even try?"" Overall, if you want a Cliff's note of King's ""It"" to where you'd earn a solid ""C-"" for comprehension, it will suffice if you can't make it through this epic tome. We'll just have to see if the creators figure things out with Part 2 to earn a better score from me.",It
1999,ctropera,I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this movie,8,4 April 2019,"""It"" actually feels like a real movie that just happens to be scary, which is how the best horror movies are. The writing, the acting, the thrills, and the cinematography are all very spot on. I'm especially impressed with how well all the child actors performed. As far as scariness goes, it's not necessarily super scary, but almost every scene manages to be thrilling in some way, so overall it's very intense and very fun. I would definitely recommend it",It
