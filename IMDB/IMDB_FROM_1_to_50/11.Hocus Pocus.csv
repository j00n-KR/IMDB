0,MartinHafer,Enjoyable kids stuff.,7,10 August 2013,"I just saw this film on ABC--an American network owned by Disney. Well, after doing this, I DON'T recommend you do this yourself! Instead, rent the movie, as ABC inserted so many commercials that it was driving my poor daughter mad as we watched. They chopped out portions of the movie so they could insert more commercials! Because of this, important parts of the film were missing--such as what happened to the parents who were STILL dancing as well as what happened to the bullies. On the other hand, the film inexplicably has a few obscenities (odd for a kids movie) and ABC sanitized them--a plus for parent concerned about their kids hearing this sort of stuff. As for me, I'd rather hear a few obscenities and actually get the whole film. Curse you Disney! While I did not love this film, I watched both my daughters (the one who hated the ads plus my other one) and they were absolutely fixated on it. Throughout, they laughed and had a wonderful time. And, given that I did not grow up watching this film (like my kids did), I enjoyed it well enough. Overall, a clever story with enough to interest kids and parents alike. As for me, I loved the scene where the witches met Satan--quite clever.",Hocus Pocus
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Yes, the film is patchy, but overall it is an under-appreciated and perfectly watchable movie",7,23 October 2009,"Hocus Pocus is a decent movie. I agree that it is one of the lesser live-action Disney efforts, but it is a watchable and I think under-appreciated Halloween movie. I honestly thought My Favourite Martian was worse, despite it having the wonderful Christopher Lloyd in it. Back to Hocus Pocus, it does have its flaws, the script has its weak spots, the direction is at times lifeless and Omri Katz never quite convinces in the lead. On a positive note, everything else ranges from decent to very good. Bette Midler steals the show, while having the most screen time, she is evidently relishing her role. Her co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy equally delight, and all three women are suitably scary and hammy. The music is very nice, I loved the catchy Put a Spell on You and I thought the beginning of the movie was superb. The camera work was good, and the special effects were decent. What I loved most though was the original storyline, there are some funny and scary moments. Kids will definitely love it, adults not so much, though my dad did like it. Overall, patchy but enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Hocus Pocus
2,Leofwine_draca,Noisy Disney nonsense,2,3 November 2016,"In terms of plotting, HOCUS POCUS has a little in common with the great children's horror flicks of the 1980s; I'm talking THE MONSTER SQUAD and its ilk. A bunch of kids accidentally summon up some centuries-old witches who once again go around spreading havoc everywhere, and said kids must team up to stop them. There the similarities end, however, because this noisy nonsense is an example of the Disney style of film-making at its very worst.By worst I mean that this is a noisy, pointless mess of a film where no line is spoken when it can be shouted instead. The acting from the trio of main actresses is indescribably bad; Bette Midler is the worst culprit and seems to think she's in some kind of pantomime and needs to shout to keep the audience in the back row awake. The whole film is full of their shouty nonsense as they fly around, curse people, and generally give viewers a headache.It's this kind of over the top style that makes me avoid anything Disney put out. Surely a little restraint here and there wouldn't have been out of the question? The kid actors like Thora Birch are by contrast subdued in the face of the hamming adult stars, and the only one who comes out of it with reputation intact is the reliable Doug Jones, whose zombie supporting character is the best in the film. Elsewhere it's a mess of special effects and zaniness, and I watched it with my finger hovering over the 'off' button all the way through. If you want to watch a similar children's fantasy about witches then go no further than Nic Roeg's THE WITCHES, a model of restraint and class compared to this.",Hocus Pocus
3,SnoopyStyle,It may work for the kids,4,1 November 2014,"It's been 300 years since the Sanderson sisters Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Mary (Kathy Najimy) were hung for sucking the life force from a girl. They vow to return to Salem with the help of a virgin and suck the life force from all the children. Max Dennison is a new in town. He's not into Halloween. Pretty girl Allison (Vinessa Shaw) gives his number back to him. Bullies steal his shoes. He is forced to take his sister Dani (Thora Birch) trick or treating. Trying to impress Allison, he and Dani go with her to the old Sanderson house and light the black flame candle. This brings the sisters back from the dead.This is definitely a children's horror movie. There is nothing here for everybody else. I don't like the kids. I really don't like the boy. Thora Birch is fine but she's more bratty than lovable. Vinessa Shaw is a blank. The three witches are not funny. They're not scary either, at least for adults. This may work for the kids. That's the best that I can say about it.",Hocus Pocus
4,lee_eisenberg,Not even Bette Midler can save it.,3,11 March 2006,"What should have been one of the coolest movies of 1993 gets drug down by inept dialogue and over-usage of special effects. Portraying three witches (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy) coming back to life after 300 years to take revenge on Salem, Massachusetts, ""Hocus Pocus"" makes you roll your eyes. Just how did the usually dependable Bette Midler get involved in this swill? And by the 1990s, wasn't it more chic to portray witches as good (ever since ""Bewitched""?).And one more thing: how could Omri Katz go from something as cool as ""Matinee"" to this? Oh well. At least most of the people involved in it have done good things since (namely Thora Birch). But seriously folks, why waste your time on this junk when there are so many good movies out there? The title should be ""Hokey Pocus"".",Hocus Pocus
5,jboothmillard,Hocus Pocus,5,14 September 2007,"I knew I had seen tiny snippets of this Disney film and knew of the three quite big female leads, so I suppose I was kind of keen to see it. Basically, 300 years ago (1693), the Sanderson sisters Winifred 'Winnie' (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Mary Sanderson (Kathy Najimy) were sentenced to death for their unforgivable witchcraft, oh, and before they died they turned teenager Thackery Binx (Sean Murray) into an immortal black cat. In the present day (1993), it is Halloween, and Max (Omri Katz) and Dani Dennison (young Thora Birch), along with Max's new love interest Allison (Vinessa Shaw) have gone out trick or treating. But when they explore the old Salem Sanderson sisters' mansion, Max lights a candle and unknowingly brings the three sisters back to life. The sisters are now attempting to gather as many children to help them steal their youth, while the three kids, along with talking cat Binx are trying to find a way to put them back in their graves. Also starring Amanda Shepherd as Emily Binx, Larry Bagby as Ernie/'Ice', Tobias Jelinek as Jay, Stephanie Faracy as Jenny Dennison and Charles Rocket as Dave Dennison. The special effects and action is very slightly tame, and the three actresses make themselves look pretty ridiculous (that's their job), but the kids will obviously enjoy it. Worth watching!",Hocus Pocus
6,moonspinner55,"Too much of the teenagers, not enough jokes for the witches",5,13 October 2002,"The Sanderson sisters, witches hanged in Salem some 300 years ago, are revived in the present day by three cynical kids: a high school boy (in a tie-dye shirt) and his little sister, new arrivals to the East Coast, and the boy's maybe-girlfriend. Good-looking Halloween picture from Disney has a fine, hammy cast and some lively scenes, but someone made the bad move of focusing much of the piece away from the goofy witches in favor of the too-hip teens (these enfants terribles are so blasé, not even a talking cat appears to phase them). Nevertheless, Bette Midler is in high spirits and gets a few good laughs, and she works well with Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy. The trio aren't always supplied with hilarious dialogue, yet they look so good together in their costumes it's tough to complain. Midler went on record soon after the picture's disappointing box-office performance as saying she felt let down by the end results...but time has a way of rectifying past perceptions, for now ""Hocus Pocus"" is considered a holiday classic! It must have looked surefire on paper, but a lack of real wit and cleverness makes itself felt. ** from ****",Hocus Pocus
7,blanche-2,three sisters reappear after 300 years - watch out!,8,29 March 2012,"Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker are the Sanderson Sisters, three witches who reappear after 300 years, in ""Hocus Pocus,"" a 1993 film.We first see the girls - Winifred, Mary, and Sarah -- back in 1683 when they stealing children and doing all kinds of wicked things. When two teens, Max and Allison (Omri Katz, Vinessa Shaw) enter the witches' old home with Max's little sister Dani (Thora Birch), they find a candle that is supposed to be lit by a virgin.One of the kids, Zachary Binx, trying to save his sister Emily, is turned into a black cat. Eventually they are destroyed, but not before Winifred does one last potion from her very important recipe book.Fast forward to Halloween 1993 when two teens, Max and Allison (Omri Katz and Vinessa Shaw) along with Max's little sister Dani get into the Sanderson house. There they found a candle which is to be lit by a virgin. Max lights it and brings the three witches back to life. They still have their powers, but are thrown off by modern times. If they can't steal a child and take over her youth, at dawn, they will disappear forever.Truly delightful, fun, and heartwarming film with Midler, Najimy and Parker in top form as they attempt to wreak havoc on Salem. Midler has a big number, ""I Put a Spell on You,"" at the parents' Halloween dance, and she's terrific. This is supposedly her favorite film, though had she accepted the lead in ""Sister Act,"" that might have beat it.The film is loaded with funny moments, one of which is when three little girls steal the witches' brooms, and the sisters have to make do. Najimy ends up with a vacuum cleaner.Great Halloween movie.",Hocus Pocus
8,edwagreen,Hocus Pocus is Silly But On Focus **1/2,6,28 February 2009,"The Sanderson Sisters of Salem become alive again and return to Salem to wreak absolute havoc in this inane Disney film of 1993.Bette Midler is terrific as the oldest and ugliest sister. She is ably supported by fellow ""sisters"" Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy. They want to ""gobble"" up the children of Salem so that they can remain alive.The movie becomes slap-shot in nature as the 3 witches battle a young man and his sister, recent arrivals from California along with a beautiful young girl of the town. We have some very silly dialogue here. The thought of Najimy, so heavy and riding through the air with a vacuum cleaner is a little hard to take.",Hocus Pocus
9,Calicodreamin,Best Halloween movie ever,10,2 October 2019,"Hocus pocus is a timeless classic. The perfect Halloween movie, a combination of minor scares, great laughs, and some killer costumes. The most iconic three witches in all of Salem. I rewatch this multiple times every Halloween season, and it only gets better. A perfectly quotable masterpiece. Midler, Parker, and Najimy play their roles amazingly as three 17th century witches catapulted into the modern age. Some of the kids acting is marginal, but with so much going on you hardly notice. After all, it's just a bunch of hocus pocus.",Hocus Pocus
10,view_and_review,"Larry, Curly, and Moe of Witches",7,22 April 2020,"Though they are three witches they were not the Witches of Eastwick. ""Hocus Pocus"" is about as clean as you can get for a movie about witches sucking the souls out of children. I mean, at least it wasn't bloody, profane, or lewd. There wasn't even a kiss between the two lovebirds.In 1693 three witches--Mary (Kathy Najmy), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Winifred (Bette Midler)-- were killed (don't worry, they don't show it). Before they met their demise at the hand of an angry mob, Winnie cast a spell which would bring them back to life should ""a virgin light the blacklight candle on the full moon of Halloween."" I know, very specific. Not many chances for that to occur.Well, 300 years later that very thing happened when new kid on the block, Max (Omri Katz), lit the candle. He was thoroughly opposed by his little sister, Dani (Thora Birch), and cute classmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw). But if he never lit the candle, we'd have no movie.
They spent the rest of the movie trying to evade the female versions of Larry, Curly, and Moe. It's a kids' movie, no doubt. It was cute and fairly harmless. Even the witches themselves looked and behaved innocuously. I'll put it this way: the witch from ""Wizard of Oz"" was far scarier.",Hocus Pocus
11,morrison-dylan-fan,The Witches.,5,24 October 2020,"Catching up on episodes of Charting With Dan, I was surprised to learn that at the US box office, Tenet (2020-also reviewed) almost lost the top spot recently, to the re-release of this title. Whilst having been aware of the movie,I've never had the chance to watch it,and learning that it is also on Disney+,I got set to do some practical magic.View on the film:Departing from his tradition Stephen King adaptations, co-writer Mick Garris is joined by David Kirschner and Mystery Men (1999) writer Neil Cuthbert in casting a spell over a shaggy dog tale that the studio left sitting on the shelf for years, after buying it in 1984.Merrily opening with a flashback that neatly sets up the cackling glee that bonds the three witches, the writers keep the battle between the trio and the plucky kids bubbling away with welcomed,playful arrivals of a zombie ex-lover and a immortal black cat joining in the fight to break the witches spell.Only the second non-music video/TV episode project he had made (the first was Newsies (1992) ) director Kenny Ortega & cinematographer Hiro Narita high-kick to a joyfully Camp atmosphere, where child-friendly tributes to The Evil Dead (1981-also reviewed) are pinned onto brightly lit, spooky greens and reds that sizzle to glossy close-ups on the witches having a ball.Sharing every scene they are in together, Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy give a joyful ensemble turn, thanks to Midler hammy it up being matched by a gleeful SJP cackling away and Najimy screeching at those trying to stop the witching hour.",Hocus Pocus
12,Aaron1375,I fail to see why it has become so popular.,6,5 November 2019,"My wife made me watch this film, never really had a desire to do so, but I figured it wouldn't hurt. I know that for some reason, it is more popular now than it ever was in the 90's so I thought it may be good. It was not bad, but I just do not get the strange love interest people have with this thing. A few funny moments here and there; however, I just felt aside from the three witches, the rest of the cast was just not very good. Unfortunately, the focus of this thing is a kid who wishes to woo this girl that he pretty much met the same day. There was another problem in the story telling, the witches were the most charismatic thing on screen, but they made them child killers, which I felt was a bit too dark for a kid's flick and made you have to root against them.The story starts out in Salem in the past. Three witches lure a child to their home where her brother comes to rescue her, but is too late. He is turned into a cat right before several townsfolk come to the place and for reasons unknown, Bette Midler's witch can shoot magic that can do some damage, she uses it sparingly and the three get caught and hung. So, years later a virgin boy from California has to move to Salem where these two jerks steal his shoes, but they do not get theirs in satisfying enough fashion. Seriously, they torment a poor boy by turning him into a cat for daring to rescue his sister, but these two idiots they just lock up in cages? So the sister's get revived and must suck the souls of children so that they do not turn to dust forever.I would have rather the film focused on the three witches in modern times trying to figure things out as the scenes with stuff like that were the best. They made the witches too evil, the whole children killing thing too much, I would have rather seen them as more hapless than horrible especially since they showed instances of being very friendly and pleasant to some of the townsfolk.So, it was okay, however, I still don't understand why it has become this massively popular film. Perhaps, there are not enough family oriented Halloween movies as there are plenty of short specials, but not as many comedy Halloween films. Still, at times, the humor in this one is a bit risque and I wonder what the heck they were thinking. The last thing I would want to take a younger child to, is a film where the one guy is wanting to get into a girl's pants and his little sister does some rather creepy things. If they had focused more on the witches and made them a bit less evil, I could see this one being a bit better than what it is.",Hocus Pocus
13,Mr-Fusion,"Good cast, bland material",5,31 October 2017,"I remember seeing the commercials for ""Hocus Pocus"" as a teen, but I think I'd just missed its target audience. Evidently, it's become somewhat of a cult movie because it seems like people mention it everywhere this time of year. But its charms are lost on me. Aside from the makeup and effects budget, it smacks of Disney Channel fare. Not to mention loud.That said, the witches' costumes were impressive. This is just one of those movies that seemed to pass right by me.5/10",Hocus Pocus
14,StevePulaski,"Too much hocus, a lot of pocus, not much focus",5,2 November 2012,"Consider me the one who stands awkwardly in a crowd of people laughing, joking, and having a good time. Hocus Pocus, a film which has gone on to be something of a cult classic, gaining replay countless times around Halloween and constantly coming up in the conversation around this time of year, to me, was a very strange, uncomfortable movie experience, mainly because of all the hocus and the pocus, none of it memorable or quite fun.This is a film of many strong stars, various special effects, and stylistic trademarks, however, they are put in a black cauldron and are not stirred properly, if at all. There's smoke boiling all over the top of the cauldron, but what goes on inside of it is nothing shy of uneventful. If anything, the film should be memorialized as a Disney film that tried to at least do something different, creating a darker, more tween-oriented story than their previous films. We open in Salem, Massachusetts, around 1693, where we meet the three Sanderson witches, Winifred (Bette Midler), Mary (Kathy Najimy), and Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), who we learn prey on young children. Their goal is to suck the lives purely out of them to be able to practice witchcraft, but their plan is failed when they are killed by an angry mob of townfolk. Before dying, however, the witches enact a spell which will bring them back to life if a virgin were to light a specific candle on All Hallows' Eve.Fast-forward three hundred years later, on October 31, 1993, and we have our subjects; Max Dennison (Omri Katz), a Los Angeles native who is upset with having to move to Salem, where he lacks any friends and has become the social pariah of the school. Reluctantly agreeing to take his annoying little sister, Dani (Thora Birch) trick-or-treating, he stumbles upon the house of his crush named Allison, played by Vinessa Shaw. Out of pure curiosity, and because they are filled with the inconsequential Halloween feeling, they venture out to an abandoned museum, where Max will light the candle naively and resurrect the Sanderson sisters, effectively establishing that the rumor all these years was true and that witches do in fact haunt the town of Salem.The remainder of the film is chaotic to say the least; a cockamamie blend of a third-rate farce, a distorted premise, drastically unpleasant characters, lame jokes, and a ton of special effects which, more often than not, consume the screen in a murky fashion. While punctuated with scenes providing some entertainment, there are a whole lot of dry spots that plague Hocus Pocus, many of them being with the humans rather than the witches.Yet the Sanderson sisters, the characters which the movie is built around, are not given much interesting to do. They are stereotypical witch archetypes, played by character actors clearly sagacious and intelligent enough to choose better roles. Bette Midler, while being the most entertaining, is still buried under a plethora of makeup which can't disguise her character's lack of soul and wit, and Najimy and Parker's characters might as well be low-rent versions of Larry and Curly of The Three Stooges.There's an audience for a film like this, which has already been established by the mention and existence of a cult. If only I were able to belong to that noble group. Hocus Pocus pleased me with its ambition and versatility, yet bored me with its listless agenda. It favors chaos over pacing, special effects over characters, and shells over identifiable people. And considering that there are many more films aimed at this same market of tween obscurity, that pack stronger morals and more substance, and there are some too that just have the ""let's have fun"" message, to pick up and rent Hocus Pocus for the twelfth time on Halloween is like being a witch who continuously haunts the same town every year. Don't you want to try and branch out? Starring: Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, Sarah Jessica Parker, Omri Katz, Thora Birch, and Vinessa Shaw. Directed by: Kenny Ortega.",Hocus Pocus
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's a cute little Halloween flick,6,7 September 2004,"When I was a kid, I adored this movie. In fact, I thought it was the ""Citizen Kane"" of all movies. :D But I was only 8 when I saw this in 1993. I showed it to my little cousin, because it was a rainy day. He loved it. Of course, my opinion changed a little. I still have to say though that this is a great movie for kids. Especially if they like horror flicks. I'd suggest try and stick to the clean stuff like ""Hocus Pocus"". It has some laughs, even for the adults. Anyone could get into it. So, if you know a little one who comes in from Trick-or-Treating, show them ""Hocus Pocus"". I think they'll enjoy it. Who knows, maybe even you will. :D6/10",Hocus Pocus
16,OllieSuave-007,I was rooting for the witches.,5,11 April 2014,"Here is a family fantasy Disney movie starring Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Michelle Parker as three resurrected witches from Salem, Massachusetts who want to achieve immortal life and continue their reign of terror. Therefore, it is up to teenagers Max (Omri Katz) and Allison (Vinessa Shaw), young girl Dani (Thora Birch) and an immortal black cat to stop the witches.The movie's story is simple and childish, nothing too intriguing or suspenseful. The supposedly evil witches were portrayed as whimsical and mischievous, not the devilish, cold-hearted, and morbid types that would scare the pants off of you. I actually enjoyed watching the witches' villainous yet funny roles on screen - much better than the amateurish, sappy, lovey-dovey teenagers portrayal. The kids annoyed me so much that I was actually rooting for the witches to succeed in their plans.It's a predictable movie that is best suited for kids. Adults should stay away.Grade D+",Hocus Pocus

I thought this movie is incredibly cheesy but it is just perfect for the children.This film is about a group of kids who wake up a bunch of dormant witches whose goals are to kidnap children and take away their youth.The acting is okay. I actually think that this is Sarah Jessica Parker's best role. I also liked Bette Midler as the main Sanderson witch.Overall, this is just a fun movie for kids. It's creepy but not scary.

19,lesleyharris30,"A Fun, Family Friendly Halloween Pick,",7,2 January 2018,"Hocus Pocus is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It is a very enjoyable family Halloween film that has a few thrills, but nothing that would be too much for a younger audience. The highlight is without a doubt Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as the three witches. They are all unrecognizable and have a great presence in their respective roles. It does become a little far fetched at times. Though it is obviously a kids fantasy film, as an audience, we are expected to stretch our disbeliefs an awful lot after awhile, as the plot gets a lot more convoluted and adds too many elements. The more dramatic moments in the film also fall very flat. The moments where they try to add depth to the characters or a bit more humanity to them simply do not work, they just come across as cringey, and the film would have been better iff without them. Reasonable fun. Enjoyable, but forgettable, Hocus Pocus is a nice watch for the family, but do not go out of your way to see it.Three witch sisters are resurrected and begin haunting a small town.

20,Bored_Dragon,Average Disney,6,12 November 2017,"As expected from Disney. If we put aside tradition of making animated masterpieces and concentrate on feature movies, Disney rarely fails, but there's even fewer great movies. This one is no exception. Quite dark story presented in optimistic and cheerful way typical for this company. It's fun and entertaining and it has no bigger flaws, but there's nothing to praise either. Good choice when you just want to relax your brain, cause it's not needed for watching this flick.6/10",Hocus Pocus
21,ironhorse_iv,Hocus Pocus is spellbinding! It's an entertaining kid movie.,6,28 October 2013,"This kid movie might not seem very controversial at the time, but if you look at it, today. You might be asking yourself, wait a minute, this movie was made for children? First off, the language is a bit harsh- Many of the characters swear, mostly referring to hell, and condemning people to hell. While, I don't like the reference to the Occult, bad like other critics because the fact that it's set during Halloween. I did had a problem with the movie problem with virginity in teenagers. Honestly, for a kid's movie by Disney, I thought they wouldn't be promoting underage sex, but this movie loves to mention a billion times, that being a virgin will cause witches to come back alive, and try to steal your youth. The film loves to focus on the fact that the main character is embarrassed of being a virgin and that some people have a problem with him still being a virgin. Come on, movie. The kid has just became a teenager. Do you really feel that he should knock up some girl or have multiply partners to the point that he gets STDs or AIDS? I felt that this movie teaches children to lose their virginity quickly which is wrong. There is nothing wrong with being a virgin in your teenager years. This is very unusual for Disney to promote. The movie is selling sex like crazy in this film, from his mother wearing a Madonna pointy bra to his little sister calling attention to his girlfriend's breast. It's like the movie was a pre-teen horn dog. Directed by Kenny Ortega, the movie focus on three witches known as the Sanderson Sisters. The first witch is Sarah Sanderson (Sarah Jessica Parker), the youngest witch sister who has the dumb slutty blonde archetype. It's weird in a way, because this movie is made for children, yet her character is always trying to grind on the laps of men throughout the film and her breasts are always partially exposed. In my opinion, it's one of the few movies where I find Sarah Jessica Parker, kinda attractive. The other sister is Mary Sanderson, who looks and acts like the cannibal Witch Hazel from the Looney Toons cartoon. The last is Winifred 'Winnie' Sanderson (Bette Midler), the buck-toothed leader of the Sanderson sisters who hates being call ugly. The three witches were inadvertently resurrected by a virgin teenager Max (Omri Katz) along with his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and classmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw). Now, they must fix their mistake, by stopping the witches with the help of Thackery Binx (Sean Murray) who been turn into a cat, years ago in 1693. For a kid's movie, it's one of the few movies Disney movies that has a children die on screen. Oh my God, the overacting in this movie is way too much. It was a bit over the top. The movie does have some funny moments that was this pretty laughable even if this movie is a bit dated. Amok! Amok, amok, amok, amok! Still, makes me laugh. Still, it had some sloppy writing. I do like the Penny and Gary Marshall cameo as 'the Master'. ""I Put A Spell On You"" music number in the middle of the film seems fun, but how on earth, did the Sanderson sisters know the lyrics, if they been dead for 300 years? Come little children was a pretty haunting creepy lullaby and Jessica Sarah Parker did a great song with the song. Like I said before, I don't know how this movie was ever made for children, but it was indeed made. The movie has this weird tone, as its seems to poke out of the box of safe Disney movies, just a small bit, that parents wouldn't question it too much. What other Disney movies can you see a cat get ran over or a zombie name Billy Bitcherson (Doug Jones) get his head kick off. Yes, a lot of gruesome body parts scenes in this movie. The 1990's special effects were pretty OK at the time. I agree that practical effects often look better but this film is far from that proof and holds up very well and seems to gain an even larger following as time progresses. While, never a huge hit in the box office, the film was released to VHS and was rebroadcast annually on television during Halloween, which I happen to find this movie. Overall: it's a good movie that had a lot of dark humor, that you wouldn't see much in the tamer more modern Disney movies. Despite the PG-rating, there are some things parents might want to know before showing this to their children. Still, check it out.",Hocus Pocus
22,Thanos_Alfie,Magic is everywhere...,6,27 October 2018,"""Hocus Pocus"" is a Family - Comedy movie in which we watch a youngster who is the new kid in town and doesn't believe in magic, witches, and Halloween in general. Everything changes when by his accidental actions wakes three witches who were executed 300 years ago. These three witches have only one night to secure their continuing existence and the youngster with his sister and a friend of his will do their best in order not to let the witches achieve their goal.I liked this movie because it has an interesting plot with some very clever plot twists. I have to admit that I didn't expect to like this movie and I was thinking that it will be a boring Disney movie but I was happily surprised by it. The good plot in combination with very good interpretations had as a result, this beautiful movie. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that I liked Omri Katz's who played as Max, Vinessa Shaw's who played as Allison and Thora Birch's who played as Dani and she was simply outstanding. Another thing that I liked in this movie was the combination of funny with dramatic moments. Kenny Ortega did a very good job in the direction of this movie and this can be easily understood in the whole duration of it.To sum up, I have to say that ""Hocus Pocus"" is a great movie, with a very good cast and a well-written script. The plot is equally good and you won't get bored not even for a minute. So, I recommend everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much and you will have a lot of fun.",Hocus Pocus
23,pmtelefon,Very entertaining.,9,29 April 2019,"I remember that when ""Hocus Pocus"" first came out in the theaters the critics really bashed it. I saw it anyway. I went to see it with my then girlfriend (now wife). We were deep in our 20s back then. I liked ""Hocus Pocus"" then and I still really enjoy it now. It fell out of my rotation for some reason and that's a shame. It's a very funny and exciting movie. Bette Midler is great. The rest of the cast isn't far behind. I need to watch this one more often. It's a lot of fun. Honorable mention: a dreamy Sarah Jessica Parker.",Hocus Pocus

25,taylorkingston,One of my favorite childhood movies...,9,10 June 2015,"I absolutely love this movie. I have seen it so many times and it doesn't get old or boring at all. I saw it for the first time when I was probably about seven or eight years old. It was a little scary at first, but it is just a funny, interesting movie now. My favorite character is Winifred because I love the way she acts, talks and treats her sisters. This movie is about three witches who died in 1693, and on Halloween night, 1993, Max, a teenager new to Salem, lights the Black Flame Candle, which resurrects the three witches. They have to suck the life out of children in order to stay young and survive when the sun comes up the next morning. The entire night, Max, his sister, Dani and his crush, Allison, try to stop the witches. It's very funny to see the three sisters, Winifred, Mary and Sarah react to the new world. Best part of the movie: Pretty much anything with the witches.Worst part of the movie: When Billy is chasing the kids.Recommended for: Everyone.Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing.",Hocus Pocus
26,lisafordeay,Saw it today for the first time as an adult as I never seen it since I was a kid. Not a bad film,7,19 October 2014,"Hocus Pocus is a Disney movie starring singer turned actress Bette Medler,Sarah Jessica Parker,and Katy Najmy. The film tells the story of three witches long ago who sucked the life of a child in order to stay young and they turn the young girl's brother Zachary into a black cat as punishment. So the three witches got hanged and the film later cuts to the year 1993 where a boy who doesn't believe in ghouls has a crush on this girl in school called Alison. He just moved from California to go to the place where the witches were hanged many years ago and hates the sight of this new state. Of course during a Halloween outing with his sister and Alison he goes into the Sanderson Sister's house and lights the candle with the black flame,causing the three Sanderson sisters to com back to life and finish what they started,many years go.So what is good about this movie? Well I liked the effects and the backgrounds look nice and Bette Midler sings in this movie too called I've Got A Spell On You and yeah she was great as the witch. As the other two they were good too. As for a horror film(and I hate horror films btw as they scare the crap out of me) but this one wasn't scary at all. If you have younger kids they would be afraid of it. And now for the bad,this film has something against virgins. Now as a kid I didn't notice it but when I was watching it today I was shocked that the writers would thrown in this scenario. Like seriously this is a children's movie NOT for grown ups like me.Overall it wasn't a bad film not the best film ever made but since its Halloween soon I'd say go ahead and watch it.Overall its a 5/10.",Hocus Pocus

Outside of Dick Tracy I don't think I've seen color used to well in a film, both for entertainment and for pure wow.It popped... and, yeah, there was a story here too.This was the 90s, it was that time where they could make a children's movie that was still a little dark, a children's movie that was still entertaining for adults to watch. In other words, they made a FAMILY movie, and that hasn't been done lately has it?You can watch it as an adult and love it because it has a real plot, it has jokes that are above the low brow children's fair, and jokes that cater to them as well. It takes an effort to be appealing to ALL age groups.And, as I said, it has a plot that you can follow, which again is new for the modern family film which are more or less a series of scenes loosely linked together.It's entertaining, it was entertaining when I was 13 and my little sister was 7, it was entertaining for my parents that took us, and it's still entertaining.

30,CubsandCulture,"Campy fun, screams the 90's",8,21 December 2020,"I just re-watched this for the first time in nearly 30 years. It is a fun, campy flick that largely works because the cast is *just* right to make the admittedly lame gags and storyline work. The film is *extremely* dated with creaky CGI, the sassy 90's kids trope and just the general shooting style. This film very clearly typifies a family holiday film of the 90's. The finally film is cheesy but the ending is still a little sweet. Or at least sweet enough to watch a few times around the holidays.",Hocus Pocus
31,jimbo-53-186511,Its target audience will probably find this enjoyable and that's what matters I suppose,4,17 June 2016,"Back in 1693, the Sanderson sisters are hung for performing witchcraft. 300 years later they become resurrected after a sceptical teenager lights the infamous black candle as he believes the legend of the Sanderson sisters to be merely 'Hocus Pocus'. Newly resurrected, the mighty Sanderson sisters are set to bring about a new reign of terror on the town of Salem with only 2 teenagers, a young girl and an immortal cat intent on trying to stop them.Strangely, the best way for me to analyse a film like Hocus Pocus is to imagine yourself being sober and being in the company of a bunch of drunk people; they start off amusing and you find yourself being able to have a bit of a laugh with them in the early stages, but then the longer the evening progresses and the more drunk they get you start to notice that they become louder, more annoying and harder to tolerate. Interestingly, this was my perception of this whole film....In the last paragraph I am specifically referring to the 3 witches (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy). To be fair, their performances are excellent here and they are definitely responsible for the funniest moments in the film, but when watching them it does feel like you're in the company of the 3 of the most irritating people in the world (Najimy as Mary says 'I smell children' quite a lot and this is her only real memorable contribution). Parker puts in a good performance, but it essentially just consists of her either being flirtatious or childish - again a mix that works well at the start, but begins to wear out its welcome in the latter stages). Midler is easily the best of the 3 and is able to carry the film with ease - it probably helps that as the leader of the group that she's given more of a character to work with, but she's the only one who really shows any general menace. All 3 women are guilty of overacting at times and their scenes together also feel quite theatrical a lot of the time. The supporting cast are actually OK, but are not as compelling as the leads with only Thora Birch really being able to display any real talent (Birch is probably better known for her work in American Beauty).Aside from feeling like a wacky, zany and crazy acid trip the film is also rarely funny and seems overly reliant on star power to get by; the story is actually quite weak and isn't particularly involving - this isn't helped by the obligatory trite teenage romance slotted slap bang in the middle of the picture which seems to dominate proceedings.I also felt that the film missed out on opportunities to be smarter or funnier; the witches are resurrected 300 years later, but the only comments they make on their new society relate to firemen being witch-hunters and Bette Midler asking a bus driver what the strange contraption is that he's driving... More tit-bits like this would have given this film an edge and just made it a bit funnier than it was.I have to admit that although there were a lot of things that I disliked about this film it's still a colourful and fairly lively film at times and Midler, Najimy and Parker do breathe some life into the film and make it much better than it has any right to be. I suspect that the basic level of escapism that it provides will please older children (its darker themes make it unsuitable for young children). For me though, despite it having some historical significance I just found the story a little weak and found the whole thing to be a little too wacky and crazy and sadly these things came at the expense of it being funny most of the time.",Hocus Pocus
32,snoozejonc,Enjoyable for children at Halloween but that's it,5,27 July 2021,"The story of three witches in Salem who are resurrected centuries later.'Hocus Pocus' sounds great on paper but for me it never quite works. I think the opening scene is good, but after the focus shifts to a different time period I struggle to keep interested. However, I am a forty-something male so I acknowledge I am not it's target audience.Sometimes when movies have messy plots they can be saved by the characterisation and performances, but I found these equally difficult. I do not think the child and teenage actors are bad, they are just playing poorly written characters with weak dialogue. I feel like I am meant to like some characters, dislike others and be wildly entertained by certain scenes, but it all feels so forced and mistimed.The less said about Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica-Parker and Kathy Najimy the better. These are three good performers given awful material to work with and what appears to be limited direction. What should have been a winning combination results in annoying, giggling, shrieking, incomprehensible silliness. The only scene I enjoyed was the musical number performed at the Halloween party. Again I appreciate that humour is very much a matter of taste so others may find it funnier than I did.Considering it is a Disney production the visuals are quite average and do not stand up to modern scrutiny. Although, the sound effects are good and make the atmosphere quite appropriate for the theme.My only real positive is that my daughter (aged 5) enjoyed it very much and it held her for the duration.

35,drownnnsoda,Personal Childhood Favorite of Mine...,8,23 October 2006,"""Hocus Pocus"" is a childhood favorite of mine that I grew up watching every Halloween as a kid. The film is about Max Dennison (Omri Katz) and his little sister, Dani (Thora Birch). He and his family move from Los Angeles all the way across the US to Salem, Massachusetts, the location of the infamous Salem witch trials, where three sisters were accused of witchcraft and murdering innocent children. Max develops a crush on a girl named Allison (Vinessa Shaw) that goes to his school, and is bullied by some peers. On Halloween, while taking Dani trick or treating, he lights the black candle in the Sanderson sisters old house, unlocking the curse and freeing the sisters. Now the sisters are back, and Max, Allison, and Dani, with the help of a 300 year old cat who was formerly a boy (thanks to a curse enacted by the sisters), must stop them before they continue their rampage.Every time I watch this movie it reminds me of my childhood, so the nostalgia factor is definitely what makes me enjoy this movie so much. But aside from the memories it brings back, ""Hocus Pocus"" still has some good things to offer. The story is well paced, the jokes are right on par, and the Halloween/fall atmosphere brought to life by the settings and the filming locations is really heavy, making this a seasonal film by default. The cast is fairly impressive, the Sanderson sisters consist of Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker, who all play their evil yet likable characters well. The protagonists are lead by Omri Katz playing Max, who never really went onto any other large projects, although his performance wasn't bad. Thora Birch plays the innocent Dani perfectly, and Ms. Birch went on to develop an impressive film career (for me, her performance in ""American Beauty"" was remarkable). Lastly, Allison, the likable girl next door is played by Vinessa Shaw, who went on to star in the brutal 2006 ""Hills Have Eyes"" remake.Overall, ""Hocus Pocus"" is a well done, fun little family-friendly Halloween horror movie that is perfect for the younger kids. I've always been a fan of horror films, even as a small child, so films like this (plus ""Scooby Doo"" episodes) may have contributed to my love of the genre. Definitely one of the better family-aimed Halloween-themed films out there, I grew up watching it every Halloween and still do. 8/10.",Hocus Pocus

Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker all team up here as the Sanderson sisters, 3 witch sisters raised from the dead from on of the teenagers. This Disney movie is honestly one of my absolute favorites by Disney! Hocus Pocus is a great, entertaining, and family friendly movie for all ages to enjoy. You'll laugh your ass off watching this fun flick. Also, the special effects are very good and cool to see, lots of flying on brooms, shooting lightning, and more..... The plot is well constructed as well, it'll make u laugh, cry, and just have a lot of fun! All the actors do a great job with the film, Bette midler in particular! She was amazing as the lead sister, Winnifred Sanderson. So families at Halloween time, I've got a good one for you! And there isn't really anything inappropriate in it, the word virgin is used a few times, it's kinda integral to the plot.

I couldn't stand Kathy Najimy's performance, and SJP was inappropriate. Bette Midler almost hits the right tone with her over the top scenery chewing, but has nothing interesting to do. It's too embarrassingly silly for anyone over 8, but also a little scary and graphic for very young children--did they have to use the word virgin so many times? As good as the Disney studio is at making theatrical movies that everyone can enjoy, the division of the company responsible for this film clearly has no quality control. I also can't believe that there is still demand for this property such that the characters appear in the parks, on merchandise, and probably in a sequel. Sad excuse for entertainment.",Hocus Pocus
38,masonfisk,NOT FOR ME THEN NOT FOR ME NOW...!,3,5 October 2020,"My triumphant return to an actual cinema found me watching this 1993 Disney cheese (I never saw it before it, I swear). The film's trailer was very prominent back in the day & since the film wasn't aimed at my demographic, I safely skipped it but since I needed a top half of my double feature (more on that later) I figured necessity is the mother of invention (or desperation) so I hunkered down for 90 minutes I would never get again. A trio of witches (Bette Midler, Kathy Najimi, Sarah Jessica Parker) are hung for their crimes during the Salem witch trials but not before they kill a young girl (taking her life essence to make themselves look younger) & changing a girl's brother into an immortal cat. Flash forward to modern 90's times & we find ourselves in the midst of a high schooler (recently arrived w/his family to town) getting shot down romantically as he makes a play for the girl, played by Vinessa Shaw, but she still has a smile on her face so things may change. On the way home, he gets accosted by a couple of lame white hip hop kids (who steal his sneaks) & arriving home he finds he has to take his younger sister, played by Thora Birch (recently seen on The Walking Dead), out trick or treating that night but no sooner do they start their night they meet up w/the hip hop kids' crew & eventually making it to Shaw's home where w/Birch, become a trio where they find themselves at a museum (which celebrates the dead witches) & due to a plot contrivance, a black candle is lit & the witches are released w/their goal being to entice children to them so they can again imbibe their essence & become immortal in the process or die when the sun rises. Kenny Ortega (a hot choreographer at the time for his work on Dirty Dancing) got a lot of flack for this film (which was especially savaged by critics at the time) & it is typical of his films, largely passable w/just enough of everything to be classified as film but nothing especially memorable (hey it continues to work for him since he's behind the mega-successes of the High School/Descendants musical trilogies) but other than really young kids, no one else will get anything out of this. Look for humorous cameos by brother/sister directors, Garry Marshall & sister Penny (both who have sadly passed) as Halloween revelers the witches visit, Charles Rocket (an infamous SNL'er who got fired for cursing on air & later in life sadly committed suicide) as the lead's father, Doug Jones (the man behind many a monster suit) as a resurrected zombie & Kathleen Freeman (the nun from the Blues Brothers films) playing a History teacher.",Hocus Pocus
39,aharmas,Midler is Sensational!!,9,2 October 2016,"""Hocus Pocus"" is fun, simple, silly, and delivered in a long gone style. There is nothing deep or complicated but a tale of legends and children who dare to play with forbidden objects. The line "" I told you so"" is probably one that one could hear over and over. Instead, we just tag along and enjoy the various episodes dealing with black cats, vengeful witches, and adventurous children.Back in the time of Salem, three witches are executed, leaving enough proof of their existence and becoming the heart of the many legends in a small Northeastern town. There's nothing really scary or threatening here. Yes, the witches are back for revenge and speak of having people for dinner. However, as the lines are delivered by Midler with a twinkle in her eyes and her sisters ham it up for the camera (Najimi being more successful than Parker), the comedy is broad; the type that children will enjoy the most, and adults can be willing participants to feel like kids again.I was mostly impressed by the quality of the production, obviously filmed in a studio, yet good enough to give the illusion of a Halloween fairy tale. You will see witches flying, some double entendre for the adults, and a hint of zombies. Just tune in, get some pop corn and enjoy a bit of magic.",Hocus Pocus

41,aidanratesmovies,I Clearly Don't Get it- this film is a mess,3,23 October 2020,"Although it can be entertaining, Hocus Pocus is an incredibly unfunny, cliche, and generic children's film with every Disney trick in the book. Many people blame the film's corniness and flaws on its stance as a children's film, but truly that should play no part in an argument for such a less than mediocre little flick. This film doesn't know what it wants to be. It can at times be poking fun at its culture at the time, with witch like gags, but other gags can also include the witch not understanding the culture. This may be a little flaw, but with that we are also handed a ton of typical corny Disney archetypes that truly seem so poorly written I am surprised this film wasn't on the Disney channel. Not to mention its overabundance of jokes that only a 5 year old would enjoy, oddly mixed with a weird amount of adult content. Its uneven, messy, and very poorly written- but sadly that's just the start of the films flaws. The acting in this film is absolutely horrendous, especially lead actress Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy, as well as Omri Katz. Not to say that Sarah Jessica Parker or any of the other cast is good by any means, there are just less horrible, and most certainly, less over the top. It's the overacted moments that hurt the most to watch, as these actors pour everything into the roles that it truly feels unbearable. Some of the worst performances I have ever seen. It can be easy to watch, silly, one joke made me laugh, but mostly it's an unamusing, unfunny, and almost unberably corny time. In the end, Hocus Pocus is riddled with cliches, generic archetypes, horrible acting, and horrendous writing. Ultimately this film should have been left in the coffin.
My Rating: 3/10",Hocus Pocus
42,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Witch/Family Friendly Horror Movie,8,9 October 2020,"This is actually an odd movie that I never saw growing up. If you follow my reviews, you know that I missed some key childhood films due to watching more adult movies that I didn't fully understand. I did watch this one as Jaime and her friend where they both love it. They felt I needed to finally tick this off the list. The synopsis here is a curious youngster moves to Salem, where he struggles to fit in before awakening a trio of diabolical witches that were executed in the 17th century.We start this movie in the 1600s as the synopsis states. There is a trio of witches where Winifred (Bette Midler) is in charge. There is the heavier, more comedic Mary (Kathy Najimy) and the boy crazy one of Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker). They entice an Emily (Amanda Shepherd) into their house. It should be pointed here, they all look old currently. They do a spell to steal her essence to become young again. Thackery (Sean Murray), her older brother, tries to stop this ritual and gets turned into a cat in the process. The townspeople learned of what happened and executed them, just not before they perform a curse.This all becomes local legend in the area. Everyone seems to lean into it so when our new kid of Max (Omri Katz) mocks it and Halloween, he is ridiculed. He shoots his shot though with one of the young women that mocks him, Allison (Vinessa Shaw), by trying to give her his number. She turns it down though as she has a boyfriend. On his way home, he encounters Ernie, who now wants to go by Ice (Larry Bagby), and his friend Jay (Tobias Jelinek). They steal his shoes in during this encounter.Max is upset and just wants to sleep, but he's told by his parents, Jenny (Stephanie Faracy) and Dave (Charles Rocket), that he has to take his younger sister trick or treating. His sister is Dani (Thora Birch). She has a big mouth, but she means well and loves her brother. She does get him bullied a bit more by Ice and Jay, as well as making things awkward when they end up at Allison's house. Max does see a chance to spend time with her when Dani brings up the Sanderson sisters. They convince Allison to take them to their house, which is now a museum and share more information.The house is a bit more rundown than it probably should be, since it was a working museum until recently. Max doesn't believe any of these things and he lights a candle that burns with a black flame. The legend goes if a virgin does this, which he is, then it will bring back the Sanderson sisters, which it does. Winifred, Sarah and Mary have until sunrise to perform the same ritual they did the night they died or they will die forever. Being Halloween, there are a bunch of children, ripe for the picking. The problem though is Max, Dani and Allison take their spell book and they can't remember the ritual. They also get help from the cat version of Thackery (voiced by Jason Marsden). They will have to contend with magic and a zombie named Billy Butcherson (Doug Jones) to make it to morning.Now that's where I'm leaving my recap and I should probably state here, I've been getting grief for not having seen this movie for at least 5 years. As a horror fan, people are shocked that I hadn't seen it. I really do have to fill in the back-story that I laid out in my opening paragraph here. Some people get it and some people don't.One thing I will say though, this is back when Disney could still make horrorish movies with a bit of questionable subject matter. I've also recently seen The Goonies and it feels like another one that if I would have saw as a child, I would enjoy it more with the help of nostalgia as well. Dropping terms like 'virgin' or what the witches are looking to do is something that I'm not sure would necessarily fly today. I could be wrong, but just the way that we're going, I don't know.The concept of this movie is good. I do believe that these witches would need to do the things that they are. It feels like it is borrowing a bit from The Evil Dead in that their spell-book is bound in human flesh. There is probably a bit of plot convenience that they need the book to do the spell since they can't remember. I would have just been fine that the book is powerful that you just need it to do the spell.We do get a bit of a cautionary tale as well with Max being a non-believer. He mocks Halloween and doesn't fully buy into what they're spinning with the Sanderson sisters. It is fitting that he would be the reason that they come back, so he has to be the one to stop him. The love that develops between him and Allison feels a bit Disney where she seems interested immediately. I can buy that going through this night with him she would develop feelings, but what about her 'boyfriend'?I realized while writing this review, horror does not appear on the Internet Movie Database for this movie. I'm not surprised as this is a family movie with comedy so the horror elements appear, but they aren't necessarily scary. This is a horror movie in my eyes though, much like The Addams Family. I mean you have witches who are eating the essence of children to become young, which isn't too dissimilar to what Elizabeth Bathory was supposedly doing. It isn't as horrifying here. We also have a zombie and a spell that will kill all of these parents at a party.Shifting over to the acting, I think no one really stands out, but it is fun. Midler has some good comedy and really comes off as the bitchy leader well. Parker is looking probably the best I've ever seen her and I love how dumb her character is. She plays it so well. Najimy as the bigger one also brings her own style of comedy that I liked from Sister Act 1 and 2. Katz is fine as the skeptical hero who gets bullied. By the end, he's strong. Birch is funny and Shaw is solid. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed with cameos by the great Doug Jones and uncredited ones by Garry and Penny Marshall.The last thing to really go over would be the effects. They aren't great, but I'll be honest, some are on par with things that I've seen in the 2000s lately. It is 1993, so the talking cat doesn't look good. I can be a bit forgiving there though. Most everything else that is done was fine with me. This includes the look of the past, the look of the witches and the practical make-up for Jones. The cinematography is also fine and I had no issues there. I don't have a lot to say about the music, but we did get a fun musical number from Midler that made me chuckle.Now with that said, I'm glad that I finally ticked this movie off my list. It is one that I'm not sure when I finally would have gotten around to. It has an interesting concept and with how the story plays out, it is much closer to peak Disney for me. I think that the acting is good across the board. No major issue with the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack works. This is definitely one that if you're looking to get children into the genre to show them and it really seems to be a favorite for many from their childhood. I would rate this as good film though as I really don't have that nostalgia bump for it.",Hocus Pocus

Especially that it is a 1993 Disney movie and focuses on sex, plus a lot of witch lore being based on women being sexual in a time where it was so inappropriate they would be burnt at the stake. I digress.While the Sanderson sisters are a compelling premise, if sloppy, and an interesting metaphor for the desires of power, hunger, and sex, it goes to an almost cartoonish levels of ridiculous for next to no reasoning.All the non witch cast do a fine job, and I especially liked Thora Birch's performance, I can see why she took off so well. As for the witch cast, I have no doubt they did was in the script very well, but the script is overly ridiculous, and even just trying to relax there are jokes that make no sense and just aren't all that funny.Ultimately it comes down to being a Halloween themed sub-par Babysitter's Club, or your choice of child adventure groups.",Hocus Pocus
45,mike48128,Is This a Kid's Movie or Not?,8,3 November 2013,"Three soul-sucking witch sisters from the 17th Century return to Earth on Halloween Eve after being summoned back-to-life by a virgin. Sounds like something Wes Craven dreamed up, right? Wrong. It's a Halloween comedy aimed at teenagers and little kids, originally released as a ""Touchstone"" Picture. It can't decide if it's cute or cruel, funny or scary. So, after sucking out the ""lifeforce"" of a little girl, the 3 Sanderson Witches get hanged and can only come back-to-life if a ""virgin"" lights the black candle of doom at their 300-year-old house, which is a closed museum. The witches are all funny up to a point, but when Bette ""zaps"" someone, it isn't funny at all. Bette Middler sings ""I Put a Spell On You"", a catchy old tune. Sarah Jessica Parker then sings ""Come Little Children"" and all the kids converge on the witches' house, in a trance. Actually much funnier and better than it sounds. It even has a bewitched talking black cat (like ""Salem"" on ""Sabrina"") and a friendly zombie. Too much emphasis on ""cleavage"", between Sarah Jessica Parker's push-up bra and a pretty teenage girl. Good special effects, and one of the witches rides a Hoover when she can't find a broom. It's too scary for little kids and too childish for adults. Look for Gary and Penny Marshall in a gosh-awful unbilled cameo. Hauntingly enjoyable, in spite of all it's many faults! (Note: the adults ""dancing spell"" ends, and the bullies are released, which you won't see if your station cuts or shrinks the ending titles.)",Hocus Pocus
46,Pumpkin_Man,Awesome Halloween Fun!!!,10,24 April 2010,"This movie is awesome. It takes place on one of my favorite holidays, it's funny, and it could be for teenagers (like me!) It has a great plot about three witch sisters from the Salem witch era are resurrected 300 years later by a virgin who lit a candle. Max, his sister, his new girlfriend, and a talking cat named Thackery spend all HALLOWEEN night trying to figure out how to kill the witches. Once the flame from the candle is out, the witches will die. During this time, Sarah Jessica Parker was hot. I kind of had a crush on her, but not anymore. I always wished that they would make Hocus Pocus 2. If you love comedy, and HALLOWEEN, you'll love HOCUS POCUS!!!",Hocus Pocus
47,Sirus_the_Virus,"I know it's cheesy but Midler, Parker, and Najimy make it work.",7,25 October 2009,"You'd expect a witch to be ugly right? Well, with Hocus Pocus, that is the case with two out of three of the main witches. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy star as three old hags in Hocus Pocus, a cheesy film that is actually quite funny. They star as the Sanderson sisters, three witches who would kidnap children, suck their souls, and become young again. They are hung. So, many, many, many years later, Salem Massachusetts(what a cliché') is huge on Halloween. But a teen named Max is not. On Halloween night, him, his sister(a younger Thora Birch)and his crush Allison go to the Sanderson house and bring them bitches, excuse me, witches back to life. So when Max steals their magic spell book, they chase after the three youngsters. And try to continue their plans to suck souls and get younger again. If they don't make a potion by sunset, they will turn to dust. That's another reason why they want the book back.I liked this movie. Though it's cheesy at times and kind of a cliché', it's funny. I know it's not a great movie, but I give it a thumbs up anyways. It's a fun Halloween movie with some great stars. And oh by the way. Two out of three of these witches are indeed ugly looking. But Sarah Jessica Parker, to me, looks better than ever. Just saying. I don't want to be rude. But it's true.Hocus Pocus:***/****",Hocus Pocus

Now Max must stop the witches with the help of Alison and Dani, as well as a cat named Thackery, once a boy forced to live as a cat by the evil sisters.Growing up I loved this movie and it always came on television on the weekend leading up to Halloween or after. The film had a brilliant introduction that threw you into the madness of Salem, and then brought you to the present. It had an eerie tone which thrilled me as a child and had a good strong cast who sold their roles brilliantly. As a youngster of nine, ten; I adored Alison played by the elegant Vinessa Shaw and jumped with joy from beginning to end; I find it quite odd that there has not been a Halloween kids movie since that has been as good as Hocus Pocus.Simply a thrilling and magnificent Halloween movie.",Hocus Pocus
49,hnt_dnl,Funny Halloween flick,8,31 October 2015,"""The proof is in the pudding!"" I need to always remind myself of this line. Too many times I have not watched certain movies due to the premise not appealing to me or having seen terrible reviews. Then I have to remind myself of 2 things: (1) Most movies nowadays pretty much suck out of the gate, AND (2) Many movies of yesteryear actually hold up because they by default have so much going for them: genuine dialogue, more practical effects, better and original stories. There are films that I never dared watch as a kid that I have since re-visited that have become personal faves.This Halloween treat HOCUS POCUS (1993) has become a holiday favorite of mine having seen it for the first time marathon-ing a slew of Halloween-themed movies. While it's definitely flawed, it's funnier than 99.9% of the comedies now. Hell, let's just for the even 100! ""Hocus Pocus"" is the tale of 3 Salem witch siblings who were persecuted in the 17th century, but are revived 300 years later on All Hallows Eve 1993 by the opening of their book of spells by an unwitting teenager named Max (skillfully played by Omri Katz of ""Dallas"" fame; he played the character John Ross Ewing for the longest time frame in the original series). Katz does a commendable job carrying the ""kid"" portion of the film, but it's the witches themselves who steal the show!The 3 witches are hilariously realized by Bette Midler (Winifred), Kathy Najimy (Mary), and Sarah Jessica Parker (Sarah). Midler, Najimy, and Parker are a laugh riot throughout, with Midler the crafty, witty, wisecracking oldest sister, Najimy the goofy middle sister, and Parker the ditzy youngest sister. I even dare say that as hilarious as Midler and Najimy were, it was Parker who stole the show perfectly playing the brainless blonde bombshell! Parker is so effortlessy ditzy and sexy in this, I'm surprised she never really played another role like this at any other time in her career. She's almost unrecognizable. Also, this is perhaps my favorite of all of Midler's comic performances. She really lets loose here as this is probably her most broad comic role. Midler also makes the best, most funny facial expressions. And Najimy's acting choice of making her character slur her speech totally works and would have sunk in the hands of a lesser comedic talent. And I love the way the 3 actresses show the symbiotic relationship of the witches and do things in sync throughout the fim.The ""kid"" cast isn't half bad either. The aforementioned Katz is all in and exudes charisma as the put-upon teenage newcomer to Salem, as his family has just moved from LA to put down roots in the infamous, historical town. Katz gets great support from then-child actress and scene-stealer Thora Birch (playing Max's precocious younger sister Dani) and fashion-model-actress Vinessa Shaw (as Max's love interest Allison). Shaw is kind of the weak link among the ""kids"" as she is obviously more mature than Katz and it's somewhat of a stretch at times she'd be attracted to Max's clutzy, innocent character. Although it's always nice when the nerd gets the girl! Also, there are a few memorable minor characters, most notably the zombified Billy Butcherson (played memorably by Doug Jones), and also the 2 teen bullies who harass Max and steal candy from the trick-or-treaters, the bus driver who has the hots for the witches, the ""cop"" who doesn't believe the kids story about the witches, and none other than Garry and Penny Marshall, who play a rather creepy married couple. Also, there's Thackery the cat! Can't forget his contribution.There are even a couple of musical numbers, as Midler gets to show off her singing prowess with a memorable number ""I Put a Spell on You"". Also, Parker gets to show off her singing chops with a spellbinding rendition of ""Come Little Children"" during the film's climax. The movie boasts an upbeat and fast pace, nonstop laughs, and 3 iconic comic performances from Midler, Najimy, and Parker. The actresses comedic chemistry and timing is something to behold. I really enjoyed how Winifred was the brains and her younger sisters Mary and Sarah spent virtually the entire film mimicking her. It was like they were all sharing Winifred's brain! LOL I will say that the kid's storyline kind of lacked the humor when they were on their own and really amped up when they were in the presence of the 3 witches, which makes sense as the 3 actresses were noticeably more adept and skilled at comedy and comic timing than the younger ones. But, trust me, I've seen a lot worse child actors, a LOT worse! This is one of those movies that further supports my theory that film critics know jack squat about entertaining movies. Last time I looked, comedies were supposed to be FUNNY! If they don't pass that test, they fail completely. Thankfully, ""Hocus Pocus"" succeeds!",Hocus Pocus

The movie is very enjoyable: fun, scary, as well as entertaining. As a child, the movie was pretty terrifying, and this is what makes Hocus Pocus such a fine movie considering it's a Disney one. Like I said, the movie was a terrifying one; I mean, the witches were pretty scary. It were those witches that made this movie a success - the witches were brilliant right the way throughout. There's nothing the witches could've done any better. The rest of the characters were also impressive. I really liked the ""talking"" cat. Each of those recurring characters offered something to the movie - you could just tell. It's a great Disney movie to watch especially during the Halloween season.

56,mfellipecampos,Good,7,22 November 2019,"Hocus Pocus (Brazil: Abracadabra) is a fantasy genre movie released by Disney in 1993 and directed by Kenny Ortega. The film began as a special Disney Channel movie to be produced in one of The Walt Disney Company's smaller studios, but the script caught the eye of Walt Disney Studios who came to the conclusion that the movie was strong. enough to attract a movie audience. Winnie, Sarah, and Mary are three seventeenth-century witches, who reach the twentieth century after their spirits were summoned on Halloween. Banned 300 years ago due to the practice of witchcraft, they are willing to guarantee their youth and immortability.

58,baileycrawly,Absolute Cult Classic,10,11 August 2020,"Hocus Pocus is one of those films that was absolutely bashed by critics, a major flop at the box office and a film that, despite receiving a VHS and barebones DVD release, was largely forgotten by the Walt Disney company for many years. It wasn't until 2018, after years of phone conversations and emails with the higher-ups at Disney, we got the Anniversary Edition which, while lacking, was better than nothing. Now, with the 4K Ultra HD BluRay on the way in a few weeks, I think it's time to look back and revisit the iconic 1993 classic.In the 1600s, the Sanderson Sisters are hanged in Salem for luring children into their homes and draining the lives out of them to make themselves younger. Now, in the 90s, Max Dennison and his girlfriend and sister go back to the house and light the cursed candle that has the power to bring the witches back from the dead. Now, trying to adapt to life in the 90s and drain the lives from enough children to sustain themselves, the Sanderson Sisters - who are all too stupid for their own good - have to run amok for one Halloween night.Firstly, this movie is genuinely funny. Being a Disney movie, of course, it wouldn't ever have played as a straightforward horror. The film relies very heavily on the stupidity of the witches as a running gag throughout the movie, and it works. Bette Midler's Winnifred (Winnie) Sanderson brings the closest semblance to intelligence to the trio, making all the decisions while her two bumbling siblings either thwart her plans or waste their time with their own redundancy.
It relies so much on the comedy of the witches, in fact, that Kathy Najimy (Mary Sanderson) was originally reluctant to take the part out of respect for the relatives of real witches who were burned at the stake, and to avoid actively stereotyping currently practicing witches at the time.The movie relies on a very simple plot and it's very straightforward in its execution. You wouldn't turn to a movie like this expecting an Oscar-winning, game-changing viewing experience, but it was good for its time. Some of the dialogue is extremely dated by today's standards - as are some of the outfit choices - but it never really detracts from the movie.There were a few weird choices that don't make a whole lot of sense to me. There's the constant focus on the fact that high-schooler Max Dennison (Omri Katz) is a virgin which is, itself, a mockery of the fact that movies like that always require virgins to succeed, and this is the first DIsney movie, to my knowledge, to have a character tell another character, very blatantly, to go to hell in a time when DIsney was still projecting their squeaky-clean ""oh my gosh"" image.There isn't really anything in the movie that takes me out of it, though. It's a regular Halloween guilty pleasure; a kind of comfort food. It's the kind of thing you watch since childhood, curled up on the couch with something Pumpkin Spice in your hand and watch every year. It's a go-to sign of the season. It doesn't really get old with the passing of time - or with repeat viewings - and the cult following it's gotten over the years has been pretty substantial for Disney to finally reissue them, host anniversary parties and allow Bette Midler the rights to perform her iconic rendition of I Put a Spell on You on-stage on her tours occasionally.It's not perfect, but it has its charm and, when viewed through the eyes of nostalgia that I and so many others have toward it, Hocus Pocus is a special piece of perfection that can do no wrong.",Hocus Pocus

The effects with Thackery (Sean Murray) being turned into a cat and him running around the rest of the film as a cat just screams 1993 and is no longer effective, but I easily forgave the effects due to other things going on screen.

'Hocus Pocus' is a family-Halloween film directed by Kenny Ortega. It is based on a story by Garris and David Kirschner.
I don't like this movie. I'm sorry, and I know it's loved by lots of people, I personally can't stand it. If you enjoy this movie, don't read this review, skip over it and go to a different one, unless you can take criticism for movies you like and understand movies are subjective.
After 300 years of slumber, three sister witches, Winifred, Sarah and Mary (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker & Kathy Najimy) are accidentally resurrected in Salem on Halloween night, and it is up to three kids Max, Dani and Allison (Omri Katz, Thora Birch and Vinessa Shaw) and their newfound feline friend to put an end to the witches' reign of terror once and for all.
Aside from Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy who play the witches and Thora Birch, everybody in this movie was kind of bad. I didn't get into their characters because they were so over acted, but in a way where the over acting was bad acting, and I just got so confused with what was happening on screen.
I don't understand all the hype this movie gets. I know it's a Halloween cult-classic and aside from 'Halloweentown' it's the most Halloween family film there is around, but that doesn't make it a good movie. The timing is weird, the editing is off and the acting doesn't go anywhere with little character development.
Overall, I won't be going back to this one for the next couple Halloween seasons. There is just no enjoyment I get out of it and it's such a disappointment because I really do want to like this movie.

One of these is the delightful 1993 ""Hocus Pocus"" from Disney. Ever since I was a kid, it's a movie I've always cherished, and I think anyone who loves Halloween will too. When a group of kids decide to light the black candle, they unknowingly release a trio of witches who are determined to kill every last child in Salem to prolong their existence forever, unless they can be stopped first. Bette Midler shines in the role as head witch Winifred, bringing the right mixture of comedy and menace, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy equally shine as her comedic sisters bent on mischief and malice.

73,LanceBrave,A tone of improbable goofiness,7,3 November 2013,"If you grew up in the nineties, you've probably seen ""Hocus Pocus"" a few hundred times. I think most every generation gets their own kid-friendly horror-lite Halloween movie. ""Gremlins"" probably filled that role for a lot of eighties kids and hopefully ""Coraline"" is the pick for the modern 6-10 crowd. ""Hocus Pocus"" is nowhere near as good as either of those movies but I've seen it a bunch anyway. Probably more, since my Mom has long been a Bette Midler fan.Of course, even goofy kid's flicks like this have new information to reveal. I had no idea that Mick Garris, veteran horror screenwriter, co-wrote this one. Nor did I know that Doug Jones, probably the most famous creature actor today, played the zombie in this. Was there any other new information waiting me? The movie actually holds up alright. The decent premise is classic horror stuff. Set in Salem, of course, the child-stealing Sarandon sisters were executed but not before doing a few things: Turning a local teen into an immortal black cat, draining his little sister's life force, and, more pressingly, placing a curse on the town. Should a virgin ever light the black candle, they will return. Of course, this happens. Recently relocated teen Max, dragging his little sister and high school crush with him, lights that candle, revives the witch sisters, and leads to a bunch of wacky antics.The cast and characters make the film far more likable then it would have been otherwise. Bette Midler goes far over the top as lead witch Winnifred. Her make-up is cartoonish, including frizzy red hair, perpetually pursed lips, and comically exaggerated buckteeth. Midler's acting is on the same level. She hoots, hollers, squeals, and delivers every line with comic-stripe panache. Even her facial expressions and body language are calculated for goofiness. She plays off the other two sisters nicely. Sarah Jackson Parker, before everyone started calling her a horse, brings a manic energy to the part. She jumps around, repeats dialogue, and actually conveys a wacky sexiness. Kathy Najimi is similarly silly, acting like an overgrown dofus.Much of the humor comes from typical ""fish out of water"" shenanigans. The witches are baffled and occasionally delighted by asphalt, a bus, TV, remotes, and the concept of Halloween. Some of this is more entertaining then others. The interaction with a horny bus driver or Garry Marshall dressed as the Devil get genuine laughs. The trio constantly being fooled by fire sprinklers or headlights proves less so. Some of the overly goofy gags prove better then others. The witches having their brooms snatched by young look-a-likes is amusing. Them jumping on mops and vacuums are the sorts of goofy, kid's movie jokes you'd hope the movie would avoid. Midler and crew deliver their frequently corny dialogue like pros, never loosing that ridiculous cartoon tone.It's not uncommon for the kids in the kids' movies to be punch-worthy. ""Hocus Pocus"" mostly avoids that too. The movie's theme boils down to one of sibling love. Surprisingly, this is incorporated organically into the story. Binx, the talking cat, lost his sister and is driven by the hope of being reunited with her. Max comes to appreciate and love his sister over the course of the story. It fits in and isn't overdone. The improbably named Ormi Katz finds a decent balance between grouchy, angsty teenager and proactive protagonist. A tiny Thora Birch also comes close to annoying. Her emotional interactions with the brother and the talking cat make the character relatively real. Vanessa Shaw is lovely and shows some genuinely comedic skills as Max's love interest. Only the ridiculous bully characters overdo it.The movie couldn't cast Bette Midler in the lead without getting her to sing. The whole movie's tone of improbable goofiness is best summed up when a three-hundred year-old witch walks on-stage and sings a choreographed song-and-dance number. Yet that's probably the most memorable moment in the film. The zombie antics, with his head and fingers getting knocked off, are nicely gruesome for a kid's flick. ""Hocus Pocus"" even has a moment of eerie beauty, when Parker lures the children of the town away with a siren song. The music is ethereal and the image of hundreds of kids, some still in their Halloween costumes, walking the streets at night sticks with you. The special effects don't hold up and the whole movie is a goofy trifle. As far as nineties nostalgia go? ""Hocus Pocus"" is one of the better examples from my childhood.",Hocus Pocus
74,Ginger87,Disturbing For a Disney Film,4,13 August 2004,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS*""Hocus Pocus"" was one of the worst Disney films ever released.  I saw in the movies when it first came out when I was six years old.  The movie was so scary that I had trouble sleeping for the next few weeks.Then I saw the movie again this past Halloween and I realized this movie wasn't scary it was just plain stupid.  But for little kids this movie would be scary.  Especially when the witches are in the sky singing ""Come little children..."".  Thats freaky.The only thing I liked about this movie was the actor Omri Katz playing the role of Max.  I was a big fan of Omri Katz in the T.V. show Eerie Indiana. I also liked the cat, he was cute. I give this movie 4/10 stars and suggest little kids should avoid this movie.",Hocus Pocus

It is the feel-good movie of October. Its a movie I can watch 100 times and never get sick of. The movie is a classic and I understand why they don't want a sequel.

76,Dragoneyed363,A hilarious and exciting Halloween film,10,12 February 2008,"Hocus Pocus is one of those movies that I have enjoyed greatly for many years, even if it is a seasonal/holiday based film. This movie is just so fascinating to me for those fun aspects and qualities it contains that I could enjoy it on any watch. It has the right amount of funny that kept my eyes on the TV the whole time and my mouth wide open with laughter, and it seems many people forget that sometimes that's all we need from a movie to truly love and enjoy it.With Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker being some of my favorite actresses, I decided that this was going to be a great Halloween flick to begin with, and it certainly turned out to be, for all the three witches put smiles on my faces, and even though this movie had some humorous features without the main three women casted in the film, they really were the most enjoyable and lovable of the film and most of the reason it is as enjoyable and lovable as it is, honestly. After watching this movie, Kathy Najimy actually turned out to be my favorite character though, because she was just plain out hilarious as her ditsy self, like when she flew on a vacuum. All the Sanderson Sisters turned out to be funny and special in their own way, and like I said, Midler, Parker and Najimy's portrayal of them is really what makes this film for me, even though the story and other characters are just as entertaining and fun. Hocus Pocus is one of the movies that people just have to see at least once if they haven't, because after they see it they will want to watch it again and again, because it really is one of my favorite movies in general, and I hope more people will discover it and view it as greatly as I do. This movie is a magnificent, entertaining, really great and laughable adventure that will leave you in awe. I recommend it to everyone.",Hocus Pocus
77,Jamie_Seaton,i actually thought this was good when i was a kid,10,12 August 2009,"i will always remember this film because it was a favourite of mine when i was young. watching it these days really shows how cheesy and stupid and childish it is, hence the reason I've rated it five stars. i still think its a pretty OK film now but it is only aimed for young teenagers and under.the film basically goes a little like this...... a new family move to a town called Salem. the two children, one being a young teen lad and his younger sister are trying to get to grips with the change of moving homes. on Halloween night they go trick or treating with another girl that the young lad has a crush on but end up at an old abandoned shack that was the home of three evil witch's 300 years ago. they then make the mistake of lighting a candle that releases the witch's from a mystical prison and brought back to Salem. thats a little of what happens in the film.the acting is cheesy but OK. i will always remember this film even though its not as good now i'm older. worth a watch if your under 14 years old. if your older then maybe you should leave it, i know i would....... 5/10.......j.d Seaton",Hocus Pocus

79,jaredpahl,"Hocus Pocus' Cute Energy And Halloween Spirit Make It A Sweet, If Familiar Treat.",7,26 October 2017,"In the years since its release in 1993, thanks to annual showings on television, Hocus Pocus has become something of a Halloween classic. I didn't grow up with the movie, and I don't think it is an especially well-crafted work, so I can't necessarily vouch for Hocus Pocus' ""classic"" status, but what I can vouch for is the movie's wholesome family spirit. This is a lovable little movie, the kind that renders any faults moot by the sheer charm of the production. I guess it's not a very good film, but its black magic worked on me.I'll keep the summary short. Three witches (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy) are resurrected in Salem, Massachusetts and they wreak havoc on Halloween night. A small band of kids try to stop them. That's really all the plot you need to know. What's important to consider is that the movie takes place on Halloween, and it makes the most of that setting. I've always had a soft spot for Halloween and Halloween-related accoutrement: Monsters, ghouls, jack-o-lanterns, and the like. So Hocus Pocus appeals to me on the basis of simply being about the holiday, and relishing in the spirit of Halloween. It is also one of the few Halloween movies to capture that specific ""spooky, but not scary"" feeling Halloween night had as a kid. For someone who has long outgrown trick-or-treating, it's an inviting bit of nostalgia.Let's talk about the cast. Has there ever been a more likable bunch of actresses than the three witches here? Midler, Parker, and Najimy show no pretenses. They are just out there goofing around and having fun. Their performances aren't anything special, of course, but you can't tell me they didn't add more than their share of cute energy to the proceedings. Speaking of cute energy, I have to give a special shoutout to Thora Birch as the young sister, who gushes with charm. She's the heart of the movie, she's got screen presence, and she's a good little actress.Not everyone will see Hocus Pocus the way I do. I have a pesky habit of rooting for movies because they are silly and innocent, rather than in spite of. Others find that sort of thing unbearable. In this case, Hocus Pocus has two things that distract me from its formulaic, kids- save-the-day plot: A lovable cast, and Halloween spirit. As dumb as it is, I still get the urge to revisit it every October. You could say I fell under its spell.66/100",Hocus Pocus
80,SofiaHedge,Worth a watch,7,23 May 2020,"I saw this on Halloween last year and it was decent. Everything about it was decent. It is very interesting and amusing. I recommend this fun, entertaining film to anyone who's willing to give this a try.",Hocus Pocus
81,haydenluz,Hocus Pocus,4,5 September 2020,"Hocus Pocus is one of those films that I grew up watching every year, so I will always have a special place for it in my heart, being one of my absolute favorite Halloween-time movies! With the plot being fairly simple, and spread out pretty thin, the extremely fast pace keeps the viewers entertained at all times, having plenty of guilty pleasure laughs, and sequences. Where the film runs into it's issues, the over abundance of cheesy, and cliché moments, with a mix of some wooden characters, kept Hocus Pocus from separating itself from the pack. Kenny Ortega seemed to have a tough time setting and balancing the tones, having things be lighthearted at one moment, then gets unusually dark and mature, and it just doesn't seem to flow right, especially for what they were going for. Even though this film has plenty of enjoyment, mostly coming from the three witches, there is still a lot that could have be worked on.The script wasn't the strongest, having really weak dialogue, while missing more times than hitting, with their jokes. The script had it's enjoyable segments nevertheless, but it came off too silly at times, not holding much weight at all. If Ortega balanced out the tones, the script would've followed, and would've beefed this film up a bit.The characters had a few high moments, but also more than a few not so good moments, due to the screenwriters having a difficult time fleshing out these poorly written characters. The three children were awfully bland, while having a real simple structure, and very little characterization. They came off completely stereotypical, and forgettable, while being obnoxious at most times - almost all of their deliveries were completely translucent. The three witches is what carried the film, bringing a lot of charm to the film. If they had more screen time, it would've taken away from the boring protagonists, and gave us more of an emotion towards our three antagonists, and maybe could've saved this film a little bit. My favorite character of the whole film, is the black cat, Thackery Binx! He brings a lot of subtle humor to the film, while surprisingly having a few witty moments. The creative team tried too hard to incorporate too many characters for entertainment purposes, but it left everyone underdeveloped, and some soley used for a plot device.The production design wasn't executed as well as it could've been, having a pretty cheap feel, but Ortega and the creative team did a decent job of capturing that great feel of Salem, during Halloween, with some cool set pieces. The effects don't hold up the greatest, but it gets the job done. It was a good thing that the effects weren't heavily relied on, because it could've easily gave this film a cartoonish feel, to go along with some of their other mixed tones they already have tossing around.Even though Hocus Pocus doesn't hold up all that well, I will forever watch this film, once a year, because of the joy it brings to me, and everyone that watches it.",Hocus Pocus
82,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,Sarah Jessica Parker is hilarious.,6,26 October 2012,"This was my first time watching ""Hocus Pocus,"" and it's actually a pretty good movie. The cast was fine, and I'll say that Anne Hathaway in ""Alice In Wonderland"" was emulating this version of Sarah Jessica Parker. Some parts of the plot, like how the witches got out of the oven and the ""virgin"" gag, were either annoying or unexplained, but overall it was a fun movie with some really great lines. I liked the romantic storyline between Max and Allison, and I loved seeing Dani and Max get along so well.

84,mbhgkmsgg,Halloween fun for the entire family,6,30 October 2020,"Well, that was quite something. Hocus Pocus is, without a doubt, a fun Halloween film that will put you in the right mood for the holiday. Is it a good film though? Not really, no. But then again, a movie like this doesn't have to be particularly good to be entertaining.Where Hocus Pocus really shines, is in providing every member of the family with something. There are a lot of jokes that will fly right over the kids watching, but there is also a lot of very exciting, and perhaps even scary stuff for them. As such, I don't really have trouble understanding why this film is a staple in many Halloween movie lists.I have to admit that there wasn't much that I liked in this film. However, for some mysterious reason (perhaps magic), the sum of the parts became a rather fun 90 odd minutes. Will I be rewatching Hocus Pocus every Halloween? Probably not. But, I do think that if I ever again am in the mood for some fun Halloween cheer, this film will be one that I will consider watching.This film, then, manages to do, rather perfectly may I add, what it intends to do. It is suitable for all ages, it is very Halloween and puts you right in that spooky mood, and it's a fun adventure that will keep you engaged for its entire runtime.
It might not be a great movie, but it sure as hell is entertaining.",Hocus Pocus
85,moviemattb,Happy Halloween For This 25 Year Old Movie,9,1 November 2018,"Can't you believe that it has been 25 years, since this movie came out during its first released? Yep, it is now Halloween, and really want to talk about ""Hocus Pocus."" I grew up with this movie, since I first saw it on the Disney Channel program and now as I am an adult; does it still hold up? Here it goes. The movie its about the Sanderson sisters as back in 1693; their goal is to take the lives out of children in Salem, Massachusetts so they could be young forever. A teenage boy name Thackery Binx gets himself turned into a black cat, due to the witches curse, and they would later be hang. Binx continues to live on as a cat, while a California boy name Max accidentally brings them back by lighting the black flame. Now its up to Max alongside with his sister Dani, and Alison as they team up with Binx to get rid of the witches once and for all. The movie isn't really a movie that make you think, nor has some deep meaning to it. It is really movie that is suppose to be fun and entertaining; it really shows and does not disappoint. I will admit though, the movie does have some flaws as its not a perfect movie, but it doesn't make it a bad movie. The effects themselves has some pros and cons to it; even using CGI on Binx, where at times he looks good, and at times he looks bad. The story isn't really original, but it is really well told for what it needed to be. The humor is funny, and does have moments that are dark; even when its for adults. The cast do a really good, mainly for Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy. They are the stars in the movie, and really do keep us entertain. Omri Katz, Thora Birch, and Vinessa Shaw are good too. Doug Jones is also great as the zombie, and really good how and what a zombie should perform. The makeup on him is fantastic. John Debney's music is outstanding, and never forgettable. The pacing is never boring, and the visuals themselves really does have a Halloween vibe to it. Kenny Ortega does a terrific job on directing the movie, and the cinematography is nice to look at. The movie may not be a masterpiece, but it is a terrific movie, and it is fun for the whole family. Whenever we enter Halloween, the movie should not be forgotten, and it wouldn't be the same without. I can always get into the Halloween spirit, whenever I pop this in, and be entertain by it. If you haven't seen ""Hocus Pocus,"" then feel free to check out as it is worth your time. I enjoy this movie, and I'm giving it a 9 out of 10.",Hocus Pocus

We annually watch the best Halloween film of all time - do not bother arguing as you are wrong, plain and simple! I am also a wuss when it comes to horror films, so The Sanderson Sisters are about as scary as I get!
You know the plot; you know how great this film is and you know the bits when you well up! But I have to mention a few things,1. Binx is one of the best film characters ever written and has some brilliant one liners and at the end, well- it gets me every time.
2. Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker are the perfect combination of actresses for the sisters and each one of them could have had the part written for them.
3. Omri Katz and Vinessa Shaw deserved better acting careers after this film.
4. Thira Birch's Dani is super annoying whilst also being very endearing.
5. I have always wondered if Ice and Jay ever did get down or are they permanent exhibits in the Sanderson Museum now.And let me stress how important this is, Billy Butcherson is my hero, what an amazing zombie he is, he should have his own film continuing his adventures of being a scary dead being but also so kind and funny and generally awesome!Scarily Shell pointed out that this film was released the year I finished my GCSE's, I feel horrifically old now. However, I am rather impressed that the film has aged better than me, well done comedy spooky peeps! A Halloween special, it put a spell on me, 18/20.

Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy & Sarah Jessica Parker delivered hilarious performances as a trio of witches brought back to life to cause mischief and mayhem on the scariest night of the year. Why anyone would give it a bad review is beyond me? This film is good for fans of all ages.In 1693 the Sanderson sisters Winifred (Midler) Mary (Najimy) and Sarah (Parker) convicted of witchcraft and the death of Emily Binx (Rivera) were hanged by the townsfolk but before their death Winifred vowed they would return when a virgin would light a candle and the life force from all the children will be for them.Approximately 300 years later in 1993 teenager Max Dennison (Katz) has moved with his family from Los Angeles to the town of Salem Massachusetts, where the legend of the Sanderson sisters is still popular he believes it to be nothing more than just a stupid Halloween story made up by a candy company. He ends up taking his 8 year old sister Dani (Birch) trick or treating while his parents attend a party at town hall. They stop at house where Allison (Shaw) the girl Max has a crush on and classmate from school is holding a party, she tells them her knowledge of the sisters and that the house they lived in is now a museum. Wanting to impress his dream girl they all go to the old house where Winifred's spell book still is in a glass case. As soon as the black flame candle is lit trouble begins when the Sanderson sisters return from the grave. Aiding Max, Dani, & Allison in the battle to stop the witches from taking all the children's life force is Thackery Binx (Murray)a teenager from the 16th century who had a spell of immortality placed on him and was transformed into a black cat as punishment for trying to stop the the enemy and has lived with the guilt of not being able to save his sister for centuries.I'm not going to spoil the ending for those who have yet to see the movie all I can say is that you have to see it to believe it.",Hocus Pocus
92,benjaminwest-242,A fun Halloween film,6,30 October 2021,"Hocus Pocus is a classic, featuring excellent comedy paired with a solid premise. The acting is mostly good, highlighted by the performances put on of the Sanderson sisters. The comedic tone is largely spot on and ironically adds to the scare factor that three three-century old witches brings. However, there are cringey moments to the film, particularly in the conclusion and a weird obsession with virginity. The emotional depth is decent, but does slightly lack due to scenes progressing too fast and unconvincing dialogue. The plot isn't as strong as it could be either, with seemingly missing scenes and odd decisions by the protagonists.

In the first scene our three witches kill a little girl and turn her older brother, during his futile attempt to try to rescue her, into a cat for all eternity yet we are supposed to find them wacky and comical?!? This movie is disturbing, idiotic and the acting is HORRIBLE. I suppose if you saw it as a little kid it could be considered nostalgia. That said just because it may be nostalgic doesn't mean it's a quality picture. Seeing the film for the first time as an adult, it's unwatchable!

I like how in the end we come to think Max and Allison have some chemistry. The song I put a spell on you is also very catchy and fun to listen too, the film is just good all around, good story, good costumes, good sets and overall just good!

Hocus Pocus was okay in fact its close to being lame.The acting was good, the cast had fun. The actresses playing the witches believed in this movie or they gave it their all to hopefully save it. Omri Katz who plays Max stopped acting, I guess he didn't want to be famous. For those who don't know, Leonardo DiCaprio was offered the role but he turned it down for What's Eating Gilbert Grape?The humor is okay, its cliche. Have I ever laughed out loud? Only once, during the second graveyard scene. The humor was honestly lazy during the third act. Yes, there are some forced jokes.The visuals are fine, they're mostly practical since CGI wasn't exploited yet. I thought the cat was digital but he was a real cat whose head was replaced by a digital head. I guess the head looked fine back then and an animatronic cat was used sometimes.Overall, Hocus Pocus was okay. Its a cheesy comedy aimed at kids. I understand why Hocus Pocus is a cult classic.

The plot is better than many family movies and kept me engaged as an adult the whole time. Some people have complained that the Sanderson sisters' characters were over the top but its important to note that this is a family movie and the witches would totally scare the crap out of kids if they weren't also silly-acting.

102,dragonslayer-87950,A Spill Binding Fun For The Whole Family.......,7,24 October 2021,"So, let's get the Negatives out of the way first tis time since it's little easier. The First is the Actor that plays Max is Unfortunate Not Good At Playing Teen Angst, it just feels over the top and Poorly acted, although he is a Good Actor for the Rest of the Film but it's jus when it comes to playing Teen Angst in this Film not so much, especially in that scene when he stormed in his house and stormed up to his room all because he wasn't having much fun since moving to the small town of Salome. And speaking of those two in my opinion pointless Character Bullies that Talks like a Couple of Surfers, don't contribute much to the film as a whole aside from acting as a Comedic Reliefs, which was unnecessary for me since there are other and better Comedic Reliefs in the film. But however, I did enjoyed the fact that the Character Dani Max's much Younger Sister told those two off. The Bus Driver is Necessary but his character comes off as Grange Worthy to me. And the last things that I didn't like is, the first is that ""It's Not Dracula It's Dadcula."" that is such an Unnecessary Pun for me, in fact, that's right Grange Worthy. And the next is that Both Parents comes off as kind of Clueless to me Especially that Mom. And I Guess this last one is kind of a Nip Pick, and that is that I'm kind of questioning how did Winifred know how to mimic a police officer to tant the kids as they are making their get away after rescuing Dani? Oh well as I have Said Nip Pick.And Now Finally on to the Positives, the first must be the two songs they both are so iconic and recognizable to me, and not only that I just don't know what about the 'I Put A Spill On You' that started this Desire in me that I just gotta buy it. And Not Only that but it always seems around this time of year the October Month that it this song (I Put A Spill On You) seems to be all over the place, much like most Christmas Carols in the Month of December. Next is that some of the Humor does still hold up, I think the ones that I have Mentioned above that I have a Problem with as to the Regrades of Humor goes that I could remember, especially ones involving the Sanderson Sisters. The Actress Dani did a Great Job at her part I really believe she was given Good Material, how her Characters acts and talks in that Decade. I love how the first time that every one thinks that the kids have Won but in actuality they almost did had they not found a way to reassemble themselves. I also Love the Cliff-hanger at the end with the Book. I enjoy how Billy the Zombie is Not As what he comes off as. And speaking of I loved that little exchange where he basically told Winifred she could go, and her response to that but I guess that sort of goes under the Humor part. Put it's Not all Laughs I like how this Film also has Heart. Which is a Good Segway to my next point. Now first don't get me Wrong I'm Beyond Satisfied on how it Ended, but for me it would have been enhanced just slightly had they had the Spirit of Emily just ran towards Dani and say something like ""Thanks For Looking After My Brother"" or something to enhance the Emotion just a little just a little, before running back to rejoin her brother's spirit. But as I've said I'm Satisfied of what is in the Film.Final Thoughts as the Title Says it's a Fun Whimsical Spill Binding Fun for The Whole Family, Despite all of my Negatives for this Film it's still an Annual Halloween Tradition for me.",Hocus Pocus
103,sharkey197,Good moral lessons,9,26 October 2010,"This film is not only entertaining, but contains some really good moral stuff for those who look for it. First of all, Max being a virgin and having the ability to therefore bring back the witches is a very nice twist on the old tale of it always being a girl. His admitting to this, also says something to the youth of the country, that it's no ""shame"" to be a virgin while a teen.Also, Max being willing to sacrifice himself for his sister says a lot for family values and sibling love and was quite nicely done. All in all, the character is written quite heroically and I found that refreshing.Performances in the film were far above average and it's the perfect Halloweeen movie. Enjoy.",Hocus Pocus

Filmed on location, the magic ""witchery"" of Salem is absolutely, and fabulously captured. Immensely enjoyable for the kiddies :))

105,jmcd2007,An Underrated and Timeless Classic!,10,27 November 2014,"I always make an effort to watch this film every Halloween, and it never disappoints! If you like Halloween films that are more comedic than scary, then this film is for you. It's fun for the whole family, really! The main plot of the film revolves around the Sanderson sisters, Winifred, Mary, and Sarah, who were hanged in Salem, Massachusetts in 1693 for the ""spiritual"" and untimely death of Emily Binx (the witches literally sucked the ""youth"" out of her), sister of Thackery Binx, who was later cursed by the sisters to eternally live as a feline after attempts to save his sister from the witches, failed. However, before their deaths, the witches cast out a spell which will resurrect them once a virgin lights the ""black flamed candle"" on Halloween night. Once the sisters are hung in front of the whole town, Thackery Binx ends up guarding the Sanderson sisters home for the next 300 years. However, on October 31, 1993, the witches are brought back to life after a curious virgin, Max Dennison, lights the black flamed candle in the witches former residence. Upon doing so, all three witches immediately come back to life, astounded at how much has changed in the world since they were last alive. After Max, his younger sister Dani, and his girlfriend from school, Allison, flee from the cottage after meeting Binx the cat and stealing the witches unique spell book with a moving eye, the Sanderson sisters, after being sprayed with water from the sprinkler system in their home, which was later converted into a museum for historical purposes, then come to the realization that the water is harmless and that the spell they cast only calls for them to be alive on that Halloween night. Knowing this information, the sisters then go on a hunt for their stolen book and the kids that have it. Mayhem ensues as they attempt, and fail, to capture the kids throughout the film. The sisters are then lured into a high school, where they are tricked into an incinerator, burned up and reduced to smoke. However, they survive and return home. Later on, Max and Allison eventually end up opening the spell book to see what's inside. By doing so, a strong green light emits from it, which immediately alerts the witches of its whereabouts. Knowing this information, the witches travel to Max's house, retrieve the book and kidnap Dani and Binx. In response to this, Max and Allison slowly make their way, by car, to the Sanderson's cottage due to all of the children in the street thanks to Sarah's hypnotizing song. Upon their arrival, Max then tricks the sisters into thinking that the sun is coming up using the headlights of their Ford Explorer, with Max jokingly referring to it as ""daylight savings time."" They all then make a break for the cemetery, where they run into Billy Butcherson, who is a former deceased and mummified lover of Winnie, and who was also poisoned by her after having an affair with Sarah. Billy unwillingly follows Winnie's orders to go after the kids, only to ignore her as time goes on. Dani is later captured by Winnie again, and at that point, Max manages to steal the potion from Winnie, which was only enough for one child after Max tipped over and spoiled most of the potion earlier in the film. In any case, Max then threatens to smash the bottle in an effort to let his sister live. Winnie then threatens to kill Dani in return. Max then drinks the potion himself, which causes her to let go of Dani and pick up Max, who puts up more of a struggle. However, Max then manages to knock Winnie off of her broom, with her other two sisters following suit. Because the cemetery is hallowed ground, the witches turn to stone, with the sun rising not long after, and their statues explode into dust. After their battle is won, Billy returns to his grave, once again entering into eternal rest, and because the witches are gone, the spell on Binx is rescinded, who therefore dies. Binx then re-emerges in spirit with his sister Emily, thanking them for what they have done. After many years of being apart, Binx and Emily then walk off together into eternal life.Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy all put on a fine performance in this film and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of family friendly Halloween films.",Hocus Pocus

I have to say it's still as good as ever! I still love it, but just in a very different way of seeing it than I did when I was 6.I swear Bette Midler was born to do this role. I never ever EVER saw her doing a role anything like this, but she did and she was so Oscar Worthy! Very underrated performance. The other actors are good too, but the 3 main witches Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker are the best actors and all of them are well casted.Great fun Halloween movie. Sure, it's unoriginal and we've seen it before, but it's fantastic Halloween fun! Still love the movie 13 years later! 9/10",Hocus Pocus
107,Brandon Hall,"I Love Bette Midler, and this Movie!",10,20 June 2001,"I think this is one of the best Bette Midler films that I have ever seen (and I have seen them all, Isn't She Great, being the best.) It has some great acting and a sensational cast! Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are good. But the spotlight has to go to Bette Midler. It deals with 3 witches from the 17th century that cast a spell and come back in the 19th century. Bette Midler plays Winnie Anderson, Sarah Jessica Parker plays Sarah, and Kathy Najimy plays Mary. I don't want to spoil it for you but I just want to let you know that it is really worth getting and I highly suggest it. In my opinion it's a 10 star movie. Therfore, I give it a 10 out of 10!",Hocus Pocus
108,RanDizzle1198,Watching over and over,10,25 October 2019,"While many fellow REAL Witches (Wiccans, Druid's, Pagans) found this film a horrific rendition of a truly beautiful and natural religion disheartening, I did not. I enjoyed every single second of this film and though it depicted my beliefs in a harsh manner, I continue to thoroughly enjoy it to this very day. The film was spookie, hilarious, enchanting and down right enjoyable. Hollywood will never ever put together a film on real witches. We are tree hugging, nature loving, loving people who have one single commandment - 'do what thou wilt as long as it harms none'. It sums up what good witches believe strongly in.I did still truly love this film and when rumours went around that there could be a follow up with all original cast, I was over the moon! To this very day, this is one of my most loved and cherished of all films. I can speak each line of the film in tandem with the characters. It drives my friends nuts when I whisper under my breath every line and softly sing every song. This film will be a favourite of yours too and not just for Halloween but for any time of the year.

I recently bought it on DVD as my VHS quality was getting poor (probably because I watched it over and over when I was young!).My oh my...it bought back some good memories. As sad as this is, I use to remember EVERY single word in this movie when I was a little whipper snapper, and I use to speak along with the cast! This movie sparked up those memories!! It's a classic film for anyone I would say. I love how it still makes me laugh and I love singing along to the classic numbers ""I put a spell on you"" and ""come little children"".An awesome awesome film about 3 witches who come back to life after 300 years of being dead. If I have children when I get abit older, I will Definitely be showing this one to them as this is NOT a film to miss! And I didn't actually realise that the little girl in the movie is Thora Birch (well I did, I just didn't pay attention to the fact). She's a great actress and even then at such a young age!

This is a children's movie based on the legends and myths of the witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts. It uses its setting to great effect and establishes a very enjoyable autumn mood throughout the entire running time. Critics fall victim to their own pretensions. Yes, we all love The Seventh Seal but not every film needs to blast me in the face with serious moral dilemmas and deep philosophical questions. Can you imagine a world where all art did that? No thanks.This is a fun little film for kids and the adults will enjoy it also. I have had the pleasure of seeing this in Salem, Massachusetts at Cinema Salem more than once which was a nice touch. This story of witches and the kids who try to thwart them will really engage your children around Halloween time.

Because everyone else says they like it.
Three great actresses are wasted in this corny, uninspired movie. The fast pace and ""tap-water"" safe family humor that is mostly shot on what obviously looks like a studio soundstage must've been perfect for the infestation of hyper-censored, Barney/Disney coddled, OCD/ADD ridden 90s children on meds who had to give their game systems a break... But it is just so bad.
I'm sure a bunch of lazy parents must've rented this idiotic but safe movie for their latchkey kids instead of actually spending time with them on Halloween and it gradually became a pseudo-cult classic among nostalgic Pokémon fans. The critics were right. This movie sucks.",Hocus Pocus

Bette Midler and her companions were in my view truly outstanding. The story and the flashback elements handled fantastically well. Many cameos stand out, not least the use of substitute brooms complete with cord. Wonderful@Biggest annoyance for me, and from our family perspective, was the totally unnecessary obsession with virginity throughout the entire movie. If only the script writer had used ""innocence"" instead of ""virginity"" it would have been entirely suitable for all ages in my view. Personally I did not have a problem with the ""Madonna bra scene"" but I did literally edit out the superfluous objectionable exchange with the motorcycle ""cop"" on virginity at each showing. The joke exchange concerning breasts on arrival in the house, and the reference to virginity in the closing scene, were both totally unnecessary in my view, and spoiled an otherwise excellent movie.",Hocus Pocus

Well, last night, while trying to get into a more ""Halloweeny"" mood, I decided to give it a try (and ended up realizing I should have followed my first instincts)!Bottom line? I couldn't have been more disappointed.Or maybe annoyed is a better word. Seriously, this movie gave me a headache. I mean, yea...I knew it would probably be a bit juvenile, but it's way more idiotic then I thought it would be, and not even in a cute or funny way. Just in an irritating way.All the over-acting. Wow! From bratty Thora Birch (who wasn't the least bit cute and lovable, like a little kid should be) to Bette Midler (an established actress you expect so much more from) the acting is just abysmal.And then there's the flimsy plot, which is as follows: The three Sanderson sisters are witches who lived three hundred years ago, sucking the life out of children. They were banished, and only a certain spell, spoken by a virgin, will bring them back to life.Enter, the Main Boy in the Movie. He's a somewhat depressed kid who has been forced to move from California to Salem, Mass. Oh yea. And he's a virgin, which means he's the perfect candidate to recant the spell and bring the three witches back to life, thus creating the irritating havoc which ensues.(Before I forget, there's also a talking cat thrown in which is really a young boy from 300 years ago. Go figure. And there will be a zombie. For some unknown reason. Just because, I guess).Back to the plot: The main boy is accompanied by his little sister, who he is forced to take trick-or-treating, along with Allyson, the ""hot girl of his dreams"" (who brings a sort of blank nothingness to the film).The movie seems a bit confusing as to what it's supposed to be. Is it horror (light)? Is it comedy? Is it drama? What the heck is it? There isn't enough plot, story, suspense, cleverness, character development or...here's the big one...HUMOR for it to be much of anything, and especially not enough to keep adults interested.Yes...the lack of humor. Let's discuss that. I thought...at the very least...this movie would be funny. However, aside from a few weak chuckles here and there, it's not really funny, at all. It's not....anything!How did this film become such a ""cult favorite"" that they run it every year? I don't get it.Maybe you need to be a kid to like it. Or you needed to be a kid when you watched it the first time around, so it reminds you of your youth. I don't know. It didn't do a thing for me, except make me feel like an idiot for sitting there watching it, like I was totally wasting my time.I was just sort of waiting for it to be over. I was bored.I remember pressing the ""pause"" button and thinking, with relief, ""Good! Only ten more minutes to go!"" Those ten minutes felt like a lifetime. The whole movie sort of felt like...suffering.Back to the witches. The antics of these three are just so hyper and manic and over-the-top, it's like all three of them are on speed, or dumped too much caffeine into one of their potions.If they had added a bit more mellowness and realness and character development, instead of making everyone into a mindless trope or caricature, the movie could have been better... instead of so one-dimensional, like an endless comedy skit or a bad cartoon.My advice? If you have avoided this movie thus far, keep going with that instinct! If you have a young kid, I suppose you could watch with them, but be warned. Have something else to do, or you will find yourself slowly going insane, wishing you had a flying broom to escape on!",Hocus Pocus

It's a prime example of what is now commonplace in movies, but wasn't when this was released; it appeals to both adults and children.It has some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, in the main, due to Bette Midler's wonderfully over the top performance as Winifred. Kathy Najimy is also great and Doug Jones as Billy is very funny.It's all here: Comedy, nice little scares and that Disney factor. On the whole, minus the odd cringe-worthy moment, this isn't bad.

Witches and the craft have been a part of our history all along and this movie covered what some of them did to young children. Aside from their loveable characters, this is a revelation to black magic and the very real powers of darkness.

63/100Look, for a film that doesn't take itself a tad bit seriously, i don't think a serious review would go along well. The thing is, the film is really bad; it has so many unoriginal tropes, such as the narcissistic main character who, by the way, definitely looks as if he grew up to become a hype house member. The movie never considers giving him any sort of repercussions on account of what he did in his plot decisions. You have the secondary character who, not only it's his sister, but also that one ""overly energetic"" family member who was written that way because ""kids are like that"". Hell, the film even has the weird romances and the bullies. But that familiar sense it radiates, that feeling of nostalgia, the three witches' performances and, obviously, that cover of ""I Put a Spell on You"", make this film feel like a 10/10 in my heart.

When he is forced to take his little sister Dani (Thora Birch: Parenthood) out trick-or-treating the trio wind up at the historical home of three witches Winifred, Sarah and Mary Sanderson (Bette Midler: Beaches; Sarah Jessica Parker: Honeymoon In Vegas; Kathy Najimy: Sister Act) who were hung 300 years before.  When Max lights the ""Black Flame Candle"" he inadvertently resurrects the witches who must use their dark magic to syphon the lives from the children of Salem before sunrise in order to remain alive indefinitely.  The children must out-wit the witches until sunrise and save all of the children in the process.  Thakery Binx (Sean Murray: This Boy's Life; and Jason Marsden: White Squall), a boy cursed 300 years ago to live eternally as a cat, aids the kids in their battle against the witches.I absolutely adored this movie.  It was very much a fun-filled adventure. Great for older kids, but not advisable for little ones due to the horror themes.  All in all it is more comedy than anything.  Midler, Parker and Najimy are an absolute magical trio to begin with and Midler's rendition of, ""I Put A Spell On You"" is sure to apease the musical tastes of her fans. Parker also sings in this one! It also has hilarious uncredited appearances by Gary and Penny Marshall.The film is a fabulous modern day Grimm's fairytale and if you see it with that attitude then you'll enjoy it a lot more then if watch it while expecting too much from it.I believe it flopped for two reasons.  Primarily, because it was uncharacteristic of Disney to make such a film.  Secondly because it was too kiddified for the adults and too adult for the kiddies.

Bette Midler is one of my favorite actresses and after seeing the movie, I am an even bigger fan ! I don't understand all the negative reviews this movie got. If you take and accept this is 1) A Disney Movie (so not a horror movie !) 2) About Halloween, then the result is no less than magnificent. The movie has fun for all at different levels (children and adults !)and is very entertaining. The 3 witches are delightful (but both Sarah & Kathy are of course overshadowed by Bette, who really steals the show) The storyline is creepy enough though (some reviewers say it is too creepy for small children, others say it would never scare anyone.. so), the special effects are great and the costumes and settings all have this fairy-tale touch to it. Some of the lines really had me laughing.. Bette's delivering of ""je veux mon livre"", after being locked up in the school, is hilarious. The musical number ""I put a spell on you"", is great and confirms again the different talents of Mrs. Midler. The only thing in the story I don't get is that the witches do overcome the school oven.. The children's acting is not great, but effective and has the young Thora Birch (from American Beauty).

132,FernAshes,Pretty cute,7,22 March 2003,"I'd actually lost this film for a long time - in other words, I couldn't remember for the life of me what the name of it was. And I found that shame, since I thought it was pretty cute when I was little. As you can see, though, I found it.Something hit me when I was reading through the comments: the people who can't spell, or can't write in full sentences or say ""cool"" or ""rock"" at least every three words all loved it. The people who were writing normal English didn't like it. I wonder if that's supposed to mean something? But to shoot my own theory to pieces, I do an awful lot of English proofreading - yet I liked it.I actually watched Real Women Have Curves a while ago (pretty good film - I gave it a six because it needed a few loose ends tied up) and liked it. It's a movie about a Mexican American girl who goes to high school in Beverly Hills. The film opens when her mother is asking her to stay home and cook breakfast for everybody - on her last day of high school. The film continues like this.. but in the end, she actually learns something. You see true character development.This week while I was home sick I watched Bend It Like Beckham. If you don't know it, it's about an Indian girl in England who is a talented football (soccer for the Americans) player, but her parents refuse to let her play. I could tell you a lot more, but I'll just make my point.
I compared the two movies in my head: what kind of vote would I give Bend It Like Beckham? Was it better than Real Women Have Curves or not? I finally concluded that Real Women Have Curves had more depth... Bend It Like Beckham was more cliche. But... no, I'm not done. I refuse to give Bend It Like Beckham a bad score - I actually watched it twice. So what's the difference?A film doesn't have to be a piece of literature or whatever just to be entertaining. I was entertained by both, even though Real Women Have Curves definitely affected me more. My point is that Hocus Pocus might not be a masterpiece - but it IS fun and entertaining. It may not have won awards.. but I think it's worth watching.Thanks for reading my rant.",Hocus Pocus

You cannot have the expectations that there is some deep meaning connected with this film, or that it is going to be another Bette Midler comedy with R-rated humor.  If that is what you are looking for, watch ""Ruthless People"".  This film is funny and cute.  That is all.  If I was a 10 year old child, I would love this movie.  It is a family film and nobody should expect anything more.  Secondly, it has Bette Midler and a wonderfully funny Kathy Najimy and dim-witted Sarah Jessica Parker......so, ENJOY!",Hocus Pocus

136,quinnwalton-43176,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!,1,2 October 2020,"Ugh, don't even get me started on how bad this movie is! So many people say that they love it and treasure it, but I honestly don't see why. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy all give some of the worst performances I've ever seen in a movie. I can barely even call it a movie. It's more like a dumpster fire, to put it nicely. This movie made me want to listen to fingernails on a chalkboard. So, whatever you do, steer clear of this disaster!",Hocus Pocus
137,kooolkyl,Great Movie!,10,5 February 2007,"This movie is great! Some people say that its a bad movie because the parts that are supposed to be scary aren't. They aren't supposed to be scary they're supposed to be funny! And some say the actors aren't good at being witches because they're not scary either, again not supposed to be. Winnie (Midler), Mary (Najimy) and Sarah (Parker) are supposed to be villains that make people laugh not frighten people.The three witches themselves are so well developed. Winnie is the leader, who is seriously evil, and wants to steal the lives of children to redeem her own.Mary is the suck up of the three: She is always trying to please Winnie and make sure that Sarah doesn't ruin Winnie's happiness. She is always making sure that Winnie is please with herself and whenever she is upset, she offers Winne to allow her to hit her to see if that will make her feel better.And finally the youngest,ditsy, spider-eating Sister Sarah. She is always getting herself side tracked. In the party when she is supposed to be looking for Max, Allison, and Danni, Winnie catches her making out with one of the boys at the party. She never has a clue and is always caught wondering what is going on the whole time, when she is turned young at the beginning her first words are ""Oh boys will love me!"" So in the long run this movie in my opinion will always be a Halloween classic. All the Halloween movies are either too scary, too corny, or too gory. During the Halloween season this movie is one of few movies that you'll see on TV (Besides the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown..) that doesn't involve blood and gore in it.",Hocus Pocus

139,rowan_red,Strange Mixture of Kid Stuff and Sexual Innuendos,3,11 March 2005,"I have seen ""Hocus Pocus"" recommended as a ""kids movie"". Well, I would say that with big reservations. ""For kids 8 and over"" might be more a more accurate recommendation, if that.The movie includes a living corpse character brought back to life from the dead: part of the humor is that his body parts keep falling off. There is a lot in this movie that might seriously freak out little children!And then there's the running gag about the boy who is the hero being a virgin. Be prepared, if you watch this with your little kids, to be asked to explain what a ""virgin"" is. The local bus driver picks up the three witches, who are pretty freaky, and seems to be extremely attracted to them. When they tell him they desire children (another really frightening concept in this movie), he replies, ""It could take a while, but I think I could do that for you."" And witch Sarah Jessica Parker displays a lot of cleavage (who knew?!). And much more of the same type of innuendo occurs, which is more on the level of a teen movie than a kids movie. (And teenagers will say it's too ""kiddish"" for them.)The movie veers back and forth between light-hearted comedy and gloomy, scary, violent scenes, in a way that turns out to be rather badly balanced. The expectation of a Disney movie doesn't prepare parents and kids for some of the contents of ""Hocus Pocus"". For instance, when the witches kidnap the hero's young sister from her bedroom, this is really a frightening thing for kids (and parents).And then having to look at Bette Midler with her buck teeth, and Kathy Najimy, who appears to be continually on the verge of drooling--now that's disturbing!",Hocus Pocus
140,j-a-lind,Tweeny Halloween Film Too Lame for Tweenies,2,27 October 2013,"At just two minutes or so into this film I realized it was a Kiddie Movie with a distinct problem: some subject material made it unsuitable for kids under about 8 years old, but the storyline and script were incredibly lame for kids older than about 10. It's a Tweeny Flick but only for the first couple years of the demographic. The storyline is too hokey for older Tweenies with all too predictable and sappy plot elements.Unlike some other films that have subtle elements to entertain at an adult level such as Beetlejuice, Corpse Bride, Frankenweenie, or Tim Burton's Chocolate Factory or his Alice in Wonderland (the remakes), it has near nothing to maintain the interest of anyone 11 or older. That is not just a problem, it's the films failure. We're fortunate there's never been the thought of inflicting a sequel on mankind.I'm not opposed to films targeting the young, but to create one that's only suitable for children spanning just a few years in age is a travesty. They should work for a wider age range than the incredibly narrow one this film serves.",Hocus Pocus
141,Juaqino,This movie is great and here's why,10,7 November 2011,"I was shocked to find out that so many people left negative reviews for this movie! First of all, the movie is rated PG. Moms, if you thought this would be a good movie for your 6 year old and then got angry when it contained naughty words on the level of ""doodie"", well, you shoulda read the MPAA rating on the VHS tape.I don't know what kind of stereotypes people are talking about that are in this movie, but if you're offended by this movie then I imagine Shirley Temple classics would probably offend you as well.Anyway, I LOVE this movie. I don't want to make it sound like it's the greatest movie ever, but as far as a fun Halloween movie, it really delivers on many levels.I had actually first seen this movie when I was around 11 years old and I thought that one which with the long silvery hair was really hot. Then years later I learned that she's played by Mr. Ed! Oh, I mean Sarah Jessica Parker. I guess she wasn't so bad looking years ago.The acting is decent all-around. I can relate to the main character because my hometown is LA, and when I have moved to different places I'll say ""I'm from Los Angeles"", and people say ""Huh?"" Then I have to say ""You know, LA."" The fact that the main character had to go through the same thing really cracked me up.Anyway, if you don't like ""horror"" movies but you'd like a spooky movie to watch on Halloween, give Hocus Pocus a try!",Hocus Pocus
142,du04,They'll put a spell on you!,10,31 January 2007,"I have loved this film since the moment I first saw it, Bette Midler steals the show as Winnie Sanderson, closely followed by roles in the form of Sarah Jessica Parker as Sarah Sanderson (who knew she could sing?), and Kathy Najimy as Mary Sanderson.The plot is just your basic Disney movie I suppose, boy brings witches back from the dead on Halloween, they cause havoc, eventually boy, girl and sister defeat the witches and life carries on.But what makes this film magical (pun intended) is it's great lead cast (the witches) and good supporting cast (the kids).Bette Midler steals almost every scene she is in, but at the town hall ball, where she performs 'I put a spell on you,' shows the depth of her talent as an actress and singer. This is one of my favourite films of all time and will probably remain so well into my life.One questions remains however, how does Kathy Najimy do that thing with her mouth???",Hocus Pocus

145,robinpoe,Bewitching Bette,8,5 July 2005,"This movie is funny, scary, but warm and human all at once. It emphasizes the value of families working together to help each other and does not create confusing messages about good and evil. It's a fast-paced comedy that does not trivialize the characters. Bette Midler's rendition of ""I've Put a Spell on You"" shows the depth of her talent as a singer/stage performer. The divine Ms. Bette has great chemistry with both Kathy Naijimy (how does she get her mouth to do that?), and Sarah Jessica Parker (amok, amok, amok). While the scary factor with corpses and death may not be appropriate for very small children, the movie is lots of fun for the whole family.",Hocus Pocus
146,colinrfricke,THE Quintessential Halloween movie!,9,1 November 2019,"This is without a doubt the best Halloween movie ever made. I consider this a ""preteen"" kids movie: more than enough storyline and humor to keep adults entertained but mild enough for kids to understand. The story revolves around three witches from 1693 Salem who are brought back to life for one night on Halloween in 1993 by teenaged skeptic Max, his younger sister and soon to be girlfriend. They have to last the night as the witches try to steal their spellbook to suck the lives of children to survive forever.The movie is entertaining and very nostalgic. For those who grew up during, what probably were the greatest years to be a child, the 1990s this brings back memories. To this day I watch the movie every Halloween. Can't beat it!",Hocus Pocus

152,monkey_manmarge,"On my list of best Halloween flicks, hands down.",9,15 January 2006,"The story is a classic Halloween yarn about three witches from Salem in the late seventeenth century. They were discovered to be using witchcraft, so they were hanged. But before they went, the older sister, Winnie, cast a spell so that on Halloween night when a virgin lit a candle used in Dark spells called the Black Flame Candle, they would rise again. Three hundred years later, a teenager named Max lit the candle to show off for his crush and to scare his sister. Unfortunately, the magic worked and they had to defeat the witches.All three witches were cast perfectly. All three ladies are so incredibly funny together. This is a very good movie to watch around Halloween. The whole atmosphere is just filled with the fun and mysteries of that night... boo! Sorry for ending my review cornily.",Hocus Pocus
153,daykaseya,It's just a bunch of Hocus Pocus!,10,25 October 2011,"Hocus Pocus centers around new kid in Salem, Max Dennison, his little sister Dani, and Max's crush, Allison. I can't say enough good things about the dynamic between these three. Max's flippant ""Hollywood"" attitude, Dani's irritating little sister routine and Allison's Salem native know-it-all spirit make the movie more than a little endearing.As if this fantastic trifecta weren't enough, we also have the three Sanderson sisters: Winifred, Mary, and Sarah. These heinous witches and their flesh-bound book have been sucking the lives out of Salem's children since the 1600s. After being captured by the townsfolk of Salem, they are to be hanged for their crimes, but not before chanting a spell that will bring them back for one night when a virgin lights their black flame candle. I can't put into words why these three actresses work so well together. You literally have to watch to understand just how humorous - and terrifying - these three can be.Cue 1993, when Max and his girls head to the Sanderson museum, conveniently located in the old home of the Sanderson witches. Max is seeking a convenient opportunity to impress Allison, while Dani just wants to get back to trick-or-treating. The unbelieving Max lights the black flame candle (a virgin, ooohhhhhh!) and Winnie, Mary, and Sarah return in search of children so they may be young and beautiful forever.The hilarity and spooks that ensue are priceless. This movie has been a staple in my home every Halloween since 1999, when I was ten years old. The characters are lovable and the relationship between Max and Dani is what I always expected from a brother and sister. At the end when he says, ""Well I'm your brother"" I always get a bit emotional. Hocus Pocus deserves its title as a cult classic, and if you haven't seen it, do yourself a forever and buy this one for the Halloween season.",Hocus Pocus
154,castielfan89,Best Halloween movie Ever!!!!,10,4 October 2017,"I love this movie so much I watch it every year. Next year it will be 25 years old and it's still so funny and compelling. It has so much campy and cheesy moments that you typically find in a Disney channel movie but it's so good and worth every minute of watching. Bette Midler brings her A game as Winifred Sanderson the oldest of the Sanderson sisters. The movie starts in 1693 and shows us the Sanderson Sisters doing what they do best sucking the life out of little children so they can have eternal youth. Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker play the other two Sanderson Sisters each bring their own comedy to these three witches. Finally in 1693 they get caught by the townsfolk who of course hang them, however before they die Winifred swears they will be back. The movie fast forwards three hundred years into the future where we follow max a boy and his family who. Moved from LA to Salem. He ends up being the virgin that lights the black flame candle which brings the Sisters back to life. Now max and his crew must battle the witches to save the children of Salem.

She should be ashamed.And what's up with boob-love comments by an eight-year-old and other forms of sexual innuendo? No child should ever watch this film, despite some of the comments posted on IMDb, because it blends quite frightening themes of child abduction, cannibalism, Satanism, and necromancy into a story basically about teenage kids.Bette Midler has lost all of my respect and so has Kathy Najimy. Their willingness to whore themselves for such stereotypical garbage is embarrassing. And Hollywood's enduring connection between witchcraft and Satanism is both poorly informed and highly destructive.This film is, in short, a careless exploitation of witchcraft for petty profit.

169,kylethesonicexevictim,"Oh God, No.",2,24 October 2016,"This film is comparable to Amy Schumer and Adam Sandler's careers.The witches each have one character trait, and that's it. The main characters are bland generic 90's children with no personality, the attempts at humor are cringe-worthy and painful, and the series of events are so stupid that I could not even finish this to the end. But first, some story issues: 1. Why did the cat not warn the teenage boy to not light the candle? If he did, the entire movie would not have happened.2. Why did the zombie chase the heroes at the start, but then helped them later? Was it because his mouth was sewn? 3. Why did the cat only talk to guide the heroes and be captain exposition? If he had spoken when they were talking to the parents, I'm pretty sure the parents would have taken them seriously.There are several points in the film where the conflict would have ended if they had spent two seconds thinking before acting irrationally. For example:1. Why didn't they hide the spell-book by burying it or hiding it under some floorboards? Seriously, the witches had to physically look for it, and it only became a beacon when someone physically opened it.2. Why did they open the spell-book immediately instead of waiting until morning? ""I know we're dealing with witches and who knows if we actually killed them, but let's just learn about black magic, I'm kind of curious."" 3. Why didn't they surround themselves with salt as soon as they found out they could do that? Again, They take no precautions and act like they're invincible.4 Why did the teenage boy drink the life-stealing potion instead of offering to the witch, waiting till she was low enough, then jumping up, grabbing his sister, throwing the vile to the ground, and playing tug-of-war until sunrise? The ""jokes"" are about as forced as a crap. First, nearly all of them are written so the film can get a PG rating so the film can look ""cool and adult,"" and as a result, you've got:immature and uncomfortable sexual innuendoimmature and uncomfortable usage of ""damn"" and ""hell"" and so on. Each one is so awkward and contrived that it feels like I'm watching a High-School production. The acting is laughable. Ever see an amateur production of Hamlet? That's the witches' performances. Ever seen awful child actors before? That's the heroes' performances.All in all, pretty pathetic. There's also some awful green screen and stupid scenes before the conflict actually starts, but I won't delve into that.If you're the kind of person that doesn't switch off their brain while watching a movie, I'd suggest you avoid this like the plague.2/10",Hocus Pocus

This movie really sparkles in the representations of the witches, who are all cast perfectly.  Bette Midler provides for a hilarious and almost frightening Winifred (the leader), Sarah Jessica Parker shines as the sexy, dim-witted Sarah, and Kathy Najimy is marvelous as the funny, perky Mary.

The plot is interesting because through out the movie three children are going against three witches and they steal their spell book. The low key lighting in the scene before the children enter the school at night creates suspense and a nerve-racking image. The part where the witches and the children are inside the movie gets because you can hear the lightning outside and again there's low key lighting, but there's a little bit of light from the candles. You can also hear the chandelier squeaky noise and swinging back and forth constantly from the wind. The special effects of the spell casting is cool to see because of the colors that appear on the screen and it has some sort of like lighting sound to it. There's really only medium lighting in the beginning, but it makes sense sense it is a Halloween movie. Hocus Pocus is also a comedy.

I've been through a lot of stuff; and this movie reinforces that ideas are a pretext to future reality. Does not introduce these notions and ideas in a healthy way, at all. The whole 'virgin black flame candle' thing..bad enough.. the innuendos that are so cliche...after a certain point it makes you feel like it is not just people expressing themselves and having fun with a purpose, but someone driving the whole narrative. Not trying to be cancel-culture or anti-freespeech.. i certainly enjoy a good john wayne movie..but yeah.. you get to see what these companies have done and how they contributed to 'what is'",Hocus Pocus

I found the plot to be about as interesting as any of those other made for TV movies that kids watch now. How many movies are out there where some ""I'm too cool for this"" pre-teen does something stupid just to make a point and end up unleashing some horrible monster exist? Aside from childhood nostalgia, what saved this movie for both my friends and I were a handful of the jokes. Oh yes, they go there a few times. But don't worry parents, there are not that many and I still consider this an appropriate movie for kids.Obviously I am reviewing this from an adult's perspective. I'm not going to watch again this any time soon, but if I have to put on a movie for some kids I'd rather watch this and not be bored to tears.",Hocus Pocus
185,alilrebelchick,I love this movie!!!!,10,13 April 2013,"This is by far one of the best Halloween movies I've ever seen! I watch it every Halloween, every time it comes on TV (and yes, I have it on DVD too). All the actors did such a great job I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. It's got it all! The scary, the funny, that childlike, sentimental Trick or Treat feeling of Halloweens gone by and the beauty of Salem/New England that makes you feel like you can almost feel the autumn chill in the air while Billy the Zombie is chasing you! I don't think Leonard Di Caprio could have outdone Omri Katz and Sex In The City's Sarah Jessica Parker was fantastic playing the dim witted sister Sarah. And who doesn't love Mary Sanderson played by Kathy Najimy? And we can't forget darling little Thora Birch as Dani Dennison! (My, how she's grown since then). Oh, and I must not forget to mention the great soundtrack. You can't beat the vocals of the Divine Miss ""M""! All in all, a great movie for the whole family to be seen again and again. In fact, I suspect this movie has become a Halloween tradition for many Hocus Pocus fans.",Hocus Pocus
186,martyn-lindley,Excellent Family Movie,10,27 October 2013,"This movie was a staple in our household for many years as a quality way to spend a spooky Halloween evening together. Now that the kids are grown, I am hoping (and expect) that our grandchildren will be just as enchanted. The target audience is families with children from 6 to preteen, so any negative reviews that ignore this are just not thinking about the goals of a certain genre of movie. This was back in the day when Disney family movies and TV were truly doing a great job... now I don't want to sound like a codger, but my impression is that even Disney has moved past the age of innocence and is putting out material that is very narcissistic and full of ""empty calories"". Lastly, I would have to say that I truly think that Sarah Jessica Parker delivered the best performance of her career in this film. Of course, I don't think her work after this film really could be deemed as high quality, but she was so funny in this movie that I think she squandered a career of playing sexy/ditsy roles that would have been ""spellbinding"".",Hocus Pocus

193,Velvet_Nightmare,A classic Halloween tradition for the family,10,8 October 2006,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it, when I was 7 years old, and I'm still loving it 10 years later. It's become a family tradition to watch this movie every Halloween, and it's something I definitely want to continue doing. Along with the other fans, I'm shocked at the poor reviews I read from other people. I admit that some scenes may be intimidating for the real young ones, but that's why it has a PG rating! The funnies quickly overshadow any scene that could be considered ""mildly"" frightening. A lame script? What more could you expect from a children's/family movie? If you want a deep, epic and intricate plot, go watch The Lord of the Rings. Luckily, I'm not hearing many complaints from the acting, and I'm glad for it. Bette Midler, Katy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker are the highlights of the movie with their hilarious portrayals of the Sanderson sisters. Midler's rendition of ""I'll Put a Spell On You"" and Parker's ""Come Little Children"" are wonderfully done; I was humming the tunes for days after seeing the film for the first time, and I still do whenever I watch it. And, of course, I can't leave out Omri Katz and co.'s acting, to which I give two thumbs up. Truly, this is a movie for all ages, whether you're 7 or 70. Those who can't appreciate the film's humour must have therefore lost sense of their own.

My favorite actor is Kathy Najimy. i like her in this movie is when shes trying to sniff out the kids she goes ""ive lost my powers"" and starts crying. and gets wrong kids by mistake and says when she hits different kids.

Beware though, there are all-singing, all-dancing parts! As I'm not American, I found that it was a great insight into the Halloween and trick or treating traditions. As the movie is set in New England, the addition of stories of and witches and witch-hunts is tied in nicely.

I'm surprised my DVD hasn't messed up yet. This movie is goofy and it has its serious moments as well. The actors and actresses do a great job. Sarah Jessica Parker's character is absolutely funny.

Now I am 23 and not only is it a favorite of mine, but a classic with my 7-year-old little sister, Miracle. Probably our favorite character (or mine anyway) is Thackery Binx whom I like both as a cantankerous black kitty and as a dashing young man played by Sean Murray. I also love the bond that develops through the film between Thackery and Dani, Max's little sister, Dani. I like the scene where Dani takes Binx home as her new cat and the two snuggle together while Binx purrs himself to sleep. However, my favorite scene in the whole movie is the ending where Dani and Binx say good-bye and Binx kisses Dani on the cheek. As for disturbing parts of the film, the only one that some people might be troubled by is the scene at the very beginning when the witches suck the life force completely from Thackery's little sister, Emily. The theme of the plot represents the bonds between siblings. But it does this without becoming too heavy or sugary. Great family Halloween film that I recommend!",Hocus Pocus

The reviews stating that the set-up, costumes, and acting don't fit par are appalling. The movie is delightfully hilarious, with a surprisingly good plot, despite first glance. But above all, the cast could not be better...particularly for the Salem witches. Sarah Jessica Parker and Bette Midler simply throw the delightfully comedic, yes appropriate movie over the top.

It has actors that did there best and created a movie thats still shown every year for 18 years, that says some thing about how good it is. Now the person in charge of picking out the actors/actresses did awesome because each actor/actress fit each role wonderfully even though one actors voice isn't even used, but that was to give it more reality.

The truth is, this film is a wonderfully comical and charming tale of three Salem witches that are resurrected by a teenage boy, who, with the help of his little sister and love interest, must try to stop them from stealing the souls of children. This movie really sparkles in the representations of the witches, who are all cast perfectly. Bette Midler provides for a hilarious and almost frightening Winifred (the leader), Sarah Jessica Parker shines as the sexy, dim-witted Sarah, and Kathy Najimy is marvelous as the funny, perky Mary. What makes the film even better is that there are two stunning musical numbers--Midler's delightful ""I Put a Spell on You"" and Parker's hypnotic ""Come, Little Children.""

218,Mimicantdomath,Were the critics watching this with bags on their heads?,8,21 October 2012,"Hocus Pocus, a film that only comes around once a year...October. I wait all year long to watch this film, and have been doing so since I was very young. I have never purchased it because they play it nearly a dozen f!#%ing times during the month of October. At the same time, this film is great year round. I chose this as my first review because I just watched it and feel that the film in under-appreciated. This is a charming little film about three Salem witches resurrected from the dead by a teenage virgin whom lights a black flame candle. Max must stop these witched from stealing the souls of children. He does so with the help of his adorable little sister, Allison (whom he pines over at night), and a helpful talking (cursed) cat called Binx. The casting is absolutely perfect, right down to Omri Katz as Max. Bette Midler does a fantastic job as the evil, scheming, mastermind Winnie. Sarah Jessica Parker plays the flighty, dumb, and playfully flirty Sarah. She goes back and forth between a hypnotic ""come hither"" persona and then will burst into random chants and fits of joy over disturbing things such fresh dead man's toes. Kathy Najimy plays Mary, the chubby witch with sometimes wrongfully placed optimism. There are two musical numbers in the film, most notably Bette Midler's rendition of ""I Put a Spell on You"" which is both humorous and pleasing to the ear. When you watch this film, you cannot take it too seriously, in fact don't take it seriously at all. You will have a much better viewing experience this way. This film is absurd, and cliché, that's the beauty of it! It is also very comical with laughs for children and adults alike. There is a point in the film where Mary, Kathy Najimy's character, is flying on a vacuum cleaner. This is just one example that stands out because it has had me cracking up since I was six years - old. Ignore what others say about Hocus Pocus, the critics reviews are baloney. (I couldn't find something similar to the phrase ""Hocus Pocus"" that would be witty and fitting to describe their reviews. Sorry. Baloney it is.)This film is marvelous and entertaining for all ages, all year round. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. Then you too will consider it a quirky classic.(8/10)",Hocus Pocus
219,lin2069,Not as good as I remember,5,23 October 2012,"The story of Hocus Pocus was a classic from my childhood. I would watch this movie every Halloween with my cousins after we scrambled up and down every street in our neighborhood trolling for candy. We would dump out our pillow cases on the living room floor, organize our stash, and pop this movie in the VCR while we inhaled chocolate, caramel, chips, popcorn, and all manner of candy. I loved this movie. Unfortunately, it's been a few years since I have partaken in this particular tradition, so I haven't seen Hocus Pocus in well over ten years. So, when it was on television the other day, I just had to watch it. What I saw was rather disappointing. In the beginning of this movie, three sisters, Winnie, Sarah, and Mary Sanderson are hanged for practicing witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts. After 300 years, a virgin boy unknowingly brings the witches back to life. Max, his sister, and his love interest are the only ones who can stop the Sanderson sisters as they try to obtain eternal life my sucking the souls out of children. Watching it as an adult, I have absorbed a lot more of the movies subtleties. There are several sexual innuendos throughout this movie. The most obvious occurs when the witches come across a bus and the creepy bus driver tells them that buses are used ""to convey such beautiful creatures such as yourselves to your most... forbidden desires."" Winnie then reveals that she and her sisters desire children,to which the driver replies, ""Hey, it may take me a couple of tries, but I don't think there will be a problem."" When I was a kid, I thought that the bus driver was going to help them kidnap children, now I know better. Another running joke is that the hero of the story, Max, is the virgin who made the witches return from the grave. I never knew what a virgin was as a kid, but I probably asked my parents about it, and they probably thought it was hilarious. The last thing that I struggled with as an adult was the scene where the teen trio lures the witches into the school. The kids end up locking them in ovens where the pottery is made, and burning the witches alive. After they do that, they run around celebrating on the front lawn. This was a big problem for me. Where was the compassion, where was the guilt? Hello, they just killed three people and are happy about it? What happened to a fair trial? What happened to innocent until proved guilty? Besides the lingering nostalgia, I no longer have a love for this movie. However, I would watch it again for the same reason I would watch Even Stephens; to remember a time when I did not know what a virgin was.",Hocus Pocus

It is a fun flick that everyone in the family can be entertained by. Some of it may be a bit frightening for kids under 5, but my 6 & 7-year-old think it is just cheesy and fun.The story is not particularly fabulous, and most of the entertainment value for adults is seeing all the 'big name' stars who appear in this film. The rest is in watching your kids watch the film! There are funny scenes that only adults will (should) get, but the rest is just a fanciful romp on Halloween Night.The kids like it because children are the heroes and adults are either villains or incompetent.

222,weewizard2013,The best Kid's Witch film of all time!,10,1 February 2014,"Just wanted to leave a super quick review of one of my favourite films of all time, a Witch film, that just ticks so many boxes for me it's unreal. I know this was 1993, and it's probably lost a great deal of it's momentum, but I'm here to state that in my mind it is one of the finest children's spooky witch film that takes everything to a whole new level & still hits the spot to entertain Kids and Adults. ( *SOME POTENTIAL MILD SPOILERS BELOW*) 1st off, It's a Disney film. now we all know Disney is a lot more liberal these days on what they can and can't show and say. Disney films are riddled with dark humour especially new ones like Despicable Me etc, but back when Hocus Pocus was about, there really wasn't many films alike at that time, which is why it stands out to me, it really went heavy on the content & still hit the PG rating. within the first 10-15 minutes you see a girl get the life sucked out of her, directly after that you see Witches getting hanged, by the time the witches return from the dead, words like Virgin are being thrown around, ""And he's a Virgin"" ""Are you a Virgin?"" surely at some point some kid is going to ask his parents what a virgin is! A spell book with an eyeball in it, given to Winnie by the devil himself, in ""Satan's"" house, the wife calls Sarah ""Tart Face"" and the whole tone of the film is really extreme for a family friendly Halloween film. I'm not complaining about these things, they are what made it for me, to this day they still stand out and i don't know how Disney got away with it. Think that Kenny Ortega is doing High School Musical etc now, it's totally different to what Hocus Pocus was like, most people don't actually believe hocus Pocus is Disney when i bring it up in conversation. (Continued Review) The casting was brilliant, Sarah Jessica Parker looks out of this world then compared to now, they look so different, she was beautiful in this, Bette Middler just nailed the character of Winnie so well, all of them were buck mad, eccentric and over the top and zany! I don't know how they were able to get into that crazy mode and speak the way they did, it's certainly not an American Accent I heard off them, it was just undesirable! It's fun for Adults, and it's fun for kids, it really isn't scary, however everything from the movie soundtrack, to the script and set pieces and not to mention incredible special effects all go perfectly. They touch a wee bit on the whole Macbeth 3 witches thing, the big bubbling cauldron, zombies, magic, talking cats, it's just brilliant. You see movies like Harry Potter today and see him whizzing round the Quidditch Match on like a manual broom with a green screen on it, or even completely computer generated at some points and compare it to these witches flying, on wires the proper way, you can see they are flying for real there, no trickery, that's why it's perfect for me, they tried to do as many things as real as possible.The movie is just so much fun, I seriously believe it's underrated, and I think that some other movies tried to take little bits out of Hocus Pocus, like look at Rohl Daul's The Witches, first off, the very opening scene? it has a camera high in the air flying over white snowy mountains as the credits role, i'm sorry but that had nothing to do witches because none of the witches flew in that movie, in Hocus Pocus however, there is a camera high in the air flying over Salem, with a witches silhouette, it just seemed too similar as if they were nudging towards Hocus Pocus, oh and as for Casper Meets Wendy? three witches round a big dry ice filled cauldron, one witch peering out the window, the other one making jokes to the more aggressive leader witch, and then she says things like ""Ugh, What did i do to deserve sisters like this?"" ... Hocus Pocus Winnie - ""Why, Why Why was I cursed with such idiot sisters?!!"" ...If you ask me.. Hocus Pocus is the ULTIMATE WITCH FILM AND ALWAYS WILL BE!!!!!",Hocus Pocus
223,kgirl1990,Three witches are after young kids so they can live forever.,10,8 April 2006,"I had a second cousin that would always babysit me when i was three because I broke my collar bone and couldn't go to daycare and she would watch me while my parents were at work. The memory with her i remember the most is always watching ""Hocus Pocus"" like everyday, I loved it I would laugh and smile and really enjoy it, my favorite witch was the stupid one dressed in purple with the long blonde hair. It was our thing, now I'm going to see her today and it's her birthday and I decided to buy her it on DVD for sentimental value. It's a great, awesome, sick movie and I encourage all to watch it. It's funny and sweet, and really really cute and I think that all will love it. I give it ten out of ten because it's provided me with one of my favorite memories ever, me and my cousin spending time together.",Hocus Pocus
224,swirls_09,Great film!,10,5 September 2005,"Twelve years after being released, this film has become a children's classic. Now 21 years old, I can still watch this film any day of the week and be completely entertained. It has also been a love of mine since I was a young kid - great fantastical sets and story, fun witches who are a riot to watch, a compelling plot, and some really great music.I realize that the majority of the people who have given this film a bad review are those over the age of 40, and that would make sense. This is not an adult movie. It is a movie for kids, and for those of us who can still recognize that little kid in all of us who loves a good scare and a good old fashioned story about Halloween.I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a light-hearted, exciting film with some truly great acting in it (ala Bette Midler, Kathy Najimi and especially a young, pre Sex and the City Sarah Jessica Parker). Keep your ears out for the wonderful soundtrack in this film as well...Sarah Jessica Parker's singing of ""Come Little Children"" will mesmerize you - much like the rest of this film.",Hocus Pocus
225,nievesmartir,A must for halloween movies,10,1 November 2020,"Love this movie, watch it yearly. It's a very 90s movie, with so many typical references of that era. I recommend this for any kid 8 and older.",Hocus Pocus
226,gordan0789,sequel? be careful about it!,10,19 June 2005,"Making a sequel of this movie isn't a good idea... it could end up being redundant to the first part, with the witches trying to get their book but keep getting tricked by Max, it wont go well. and other plots wouldn't be easy to come up with either... if they still only have one night to make the potion and absorb souls, that means the black flame candle would have to be remade somehow, or something that could turn out quite well is if some unsuspecting person happens to go by their house, and opens the book and reads a random spell that happens to bring the witches back for good... and the new plot would be to kill them once and for all rather than to keep running from them until sunrise. if they make a sequel, they need to be careful because other movies that were great originally were made to look stupid after their sequels, like dumb and dumberer (even tho its a prequel) and son of the mask (even tho the main problem was most likely that Jim Carey wasn't in it)",Hocus Pocus
227,marty-rjparsons,"3 witches, a cat who is a guy, and 3 kids all on Halloween only Disney could do it!",8,3 July 2005,"I really like this film Bette is great as the lead witch especially with her catchy rendition of ""I Put A Spell On you"" does anyone know where i can buy it!?! Yes the story line is a bit childish but for heaven sakes it's meant to be it's a Disney film, thats one of the reasons i love it, it's a bit more grown up than the animated classics, but it has some great jokes and if your a bit over sensitive like me get the box of tissues ready to dry those tears! the songs don't dominate the film like many Disney films and its a bit of all round family fun definitely something the whole family can enjoy! the whole coming of age thing for the pre-teens is also covered well, it's just a great movie!",Hocus Pocus
228,orlith_the_dragon,Thouraghly enjoyed this movie. 'tis a classic for people of all ages.,10,7 July 2005,"Firstly, My grandma looks like Winfred though Grandma's prettier.This movie is one of the few that you can watch over and over again without getting bored. The jokes that were sneaked into the movie made my whole family laugh. I would rate this movie higher then Ten if I could. I especially liked the way Danny could manipulate her older brother in such a way. My mother has let us watch this movie since we were bubs and 'tis one that I can never forget. Sarah Sanderson's song was enchanting and hasn't left my head though I haven't watched the movie for a week now. I loved the way the director made it so the three sisters had the blonde and beautiful one, the leader of the pack and well, then there was the one in between.",Hocus Pocus

230,bradleyread,Stunning!,10,10 January 2006,"This will always be my favourite film from my childhood. Every time I watch it it brings a smile to my face and I feel like running ""Amuk!"" all over again. Bette is fabulous as Winifried, with the most hilarious lines for years. Will always be very close to my heart.Not Very successful when it was first released in 1993 but has since obtained a cult following, including everyone in my old 2nd Year Class. A Family Fun Classic.N:B - There is a lot of talk at the moment about 'Hocus Pocus 2' I hope that if a sequel is made that it will contain the original cast, they were an explosive combination. Hocus Pocus will be are hard act to follow. I don't think it could be possible to make a sequel as good as the original...we shall see.",Hocus Pocus

232,fitmom,Schlock,1,24 October 2016,"It was difficult being in front of this movie. I am particularly nauseated by the reviewers of who claim ""it's the hit of the Fall season"". These people are paid reviewers with no pride. Without being insulting, I would say it's an OK movie for up to 12 yr olds. 28 million budget? Maybe 28,000. On second though, they had to pay for the ""big-Stars"". Actually, there was something positive about this movie....it actually made Sarah Jessica Parker look attractive in her makeup and costume although you could still tell it was her. There's a clue in this movie why Americans are dumbed-down and why someone like Trump is able to compete for the presidency.",Hocus Pocus
233,wilder-treadway,Three witches who are hilariously funny and who are a little naughty.,10,13 July 2006,An amazing move. Awesome direction by Kenny Ortega and it's a shame that it did not get voted for Disney Channels Click It To Pick It movie versus Twitches. It has an awesome plot and it's not corny in the least. 3 lovable characters that you cannot seem to forget. They are hilarious and you will be saying their jokes over and over again. If you don't like the movie you have no sense of humor and are just plain crazy. It has a storyline that you will fall in love with and that you will never forget. If you're young or old you will have an amazing time watching Hocus Pocus. You can watch it with anyone and they will get a kick out of it. The characters are wonderfully INSANE!!!,Hocus Pocus
234,gryffindor_seeker_0013,Watch this excellent movie!,10,2 October 2005,"This is my favorite movie of all time! I saw it for the first time when I was 11, when it came out in the movie theater. Since then I see it at the very least, on Halloween, every year with my brother. It's my favorite part of the year, and the celebration! Watch it with your kids, or your nephews, or your siblings, or just by yourself! You won't be wasting your time. The cast is truly magical! The three witches are hilarious. The entire plot is suited for the entire family, doesn't matter if you're 2 years old or 100! Every time I watch it, it makes me laugh. The movie contains important lessons about family, love and friendship. Watch it now, be it on Halloween or any time of the year.",Hocus Pocus

One of the children who is ""supposedly"" dead is actually a black cat who has taken to protecting the house from crazy teenagers, such as Max, his sister Danni, and his hopeful girlfriend, Allison. Max brings the witches back to life by accident and then the three kids have to get rid of them with the cat's(Zachery Binks)help before they suck the souls of every child in Salem, hoping to gain youth and beauty. Close encounters, zombies,the three kooky witches, and their Hocus Pocus spells create a terrific Halloween thriller. Be sure to bring you salt.",Hocus Pocus
236,TheMagicMan548,Best Halloween Comedy About Witches Ever,9,5 October 2006,"I love this movie. I grew up watching this movie with my parents and whenever this movie would come on i would go crazy over it. anyway this movie is fun for the whole family. This will most definitely go down as a classic movie for Halloween. this is one of those movies you never get tired of watching. I personally love this movie cause of the Sanderson sisters and because you see how smart but stupid they can be at times. this movie should be owned by anyone who loves Halloween comedies or witches. I think this is a movie that you will like watching whether your 4 years old or 84 years old. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest you rent it or at least buy it cause it doesn't matter what time of year in is. this will be a movie you can watch in the winter, spring, summer, or especially fall. Overall I highly recommend this movie to all ages",Hocus Pocus

239,michael-masterson,Hocus Pocus,10,2 January 2006,Hocus Pocus is a fun family film which contains some really good and exciting characters. I have watched this film a lot and enjoy it each time i watch it. I admire Bette Midler for all her work in all her movies and songs she has performed and think she is a brilliant actress and makes this movie really good and exciting.It's amazing how much work was put in this film and all the tricks of the camera really make this film real. There is a lot of comedy in this film and i think thats what makes it so good. The scenery is amazing and think that this movie is 10/10 for defanate. Also i think that when the olden times were done at the beginning made the film more real and made you continue watching it to find the outcome of the movie.,Hocus Pocus
240,robertguenther-74954,Pure Halloween,10,21 October 2020,"Every October we look forward to watching this movie, multiple times. Our kids grew up on this movie and loved it when they were little and still love it now. Everyone in the cast makes a solid contribution.",Hocus Pocus
241,sarahhunt-20092,All Time Favorite Halloween Movie,6,15 October 2018,"The movie Hocus Pocus is a movie the entire family will love. The characters are well developed as well as having a good storyline. The movie that came out in 1993 is still a beloved Halloween classic twenty-five years later thanks to the work of director Kenny Oretega and a talented cast. The movie tells the story of how new to town Max played by Omri Katz and his sister Dani played by Thodra Birtch bring three centuries old witches back from the dead, Winifered Sanderson (Bette Midler) the leader of the group, Sarah Sanderson (Sarah Jessica Parker) the boy crazy one, and Mary Sanderson (Kathy Najimy) the funny one of the group. The Sanderson sisters soon plot their revenge for their untimely death centuries earlier. I liked how each character had their own flaws all while giving three powerful leading women something not many movies at the time would have done, especially not a Disney movie. I did not like how Sarah Sadnerson could be characterized as being overly sexual, yes that is how the character is written but to come from a movie produced by Disney I think just goes too far past what would ever be expectable in a children's movie to be completely honest it should have never been included in the first place. This movie has a pg rating I would suggest not allowing children under thirteen to watch alone due to the over sexualized characters as well as the graphic nature of some scenes. The movie also includes a Halloween song favorite in the form of I'll Put A Spell On You. Hocus Pocus has also inspired its own show at Disney's Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party called Hocus Pocus Villain Spectacular. The three Sanderson sisters call upon Disney villains to help create a special Halloween spell that results in the castle being decorated in light projections and fireworks all around the most magical place on earth. The show itself involves music and dancing as well as some light projections of its own of things like evil spirits and bugs. Hocus Pocus is also having a twenty-five-year spectacular celebrating the movie and al its years of success.",Hocus Pocus
