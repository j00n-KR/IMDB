0,Horst_In_Translation,Fine entertainment for over 2.5 hours,6,4 November 2021,"""The Last Duel"" is a co-production between the United Kingdom and United States from 2021, so still a very recent movie and also a very long movie as you can see from the title of my review. This one makes it past the 2.5-hour mark, even if just barely. The language spoken here from beginning to end despite all the French names of the protagonists is English, certainly because of the actors' background. There is one very brief occasion in which we have Adam Driver use the German language, which was especially interesting for me as a German native. So there I mentioned one of the actors already, but I will first of all stay with the people who made this movie and are not seen on the screen. The director is Ridley Scott, way into his 80s now, but more prolific than ever. I saw they even announced plans of him directing a Gladiator sequel? Anyway, Scott has never been a prolific writer, so they got a trio of very interesting other writers instead. The first would be Nicole Holofcener, an experienced director herself, and she collaborated with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, which is especially interesting because of the characters they play in this film, but also because of their shared past. It all started for them when they wrote Good Will Hunting and won an Oscar for it when they were still really young. They did some writing in the almost 25 years since then too, but not super often. For Damon, this film here was the first writing credit since 2012 and Affleck has also worked on one screenplay only in the last ten years. As for their characters, they are antagonists here, which is also interesting because of how these two are really close friends in real life and have been for a long time. Remember Ricky Gervais announcing Damon as an awards presenter and what he said about Affleck? I think it was at the Golden Globes. Anyway, let's stay with this film now. Of course, I must mention Adam Driver too. His career is really going strong with Star Wars, this film, the upcoming Gucci movie (again by Scott) and another film where he is the lead next to Marion Cotillard. Life's good for him. The female lead here is Jodie Comer, an Emmy winner from Killing Eve. She seems supporting for the first 90 minutes, but that changes quickly afterwards. Those are the big names, plus Harriet Walter maybe.So this film takes place several centuries in the past, which should be obvious from the poster here on imdb already. Pretty impressive cast for that I would say, especially with the three big names. These do not too often get Hollywood powerhorses in films like this, but Scott directing surely helped the matter, especially because he had already worked with Damon on the really successful The Martian a few years ago. Now, let's focus on this one here and the story here is much more Earth-bound. You can divide this film into four parts basically. Three of them are the key story being told from the perspective of one central character (Damon, Driver and Comer each in this order) and number four is basically the prologue that already takes place after these three segments in terms of chronology and the actual duel in the end and the prologue is basically an appetizer for this duel. However, let's focus on these three long middle segments for now. There are scenes in those that are shown twice, which is one reason why the film is this long. This refers most of all to the tragic rape scene that is basically the center of the plot, also with the film's title, so it makes sense they put it in twice. I still think it maybe could have been a better film if it had been 20 minutes or so shorter, but I must admit that I do not really know what to cut either, so let's just keep it all this way. Besides, it was safe from beginning to end for me that this film would get a positive recommendation and there was no doubt there. Unfortunately, I would also only call it a good film and not a ""great"" film because the truly memorable segments were not frequent enough for such overwhelming appreciation. Technically, it is almost a flawless film in terms of everything that falls into this category. Doesn't matter if we are talking costumes, visual effects, sound, art direction and cinematography too. Probably others. I do believe this will score Oscar nominations in some of these fields.For the acting probably not, even if it don't think it would be totally undeserving. I mean Comer brought one of the strongest film females of the year to the screen here. Damon (with a big scar in his face) and Driver had quite a few moments in which they really shone and Ben Affleck, with unusually blond hair, also made an impact, even if his character is maybe not significant enough for massive awards attention. But he took a risk here, played something different than he usually does and did a good job with it. I must even admit it took me quite some time to realize it was him, which definitely had to do with the looks, but also with how he truly disappeared in character here. Good for him! With the #metoo debate still going on in 2021, it is no surprise that the film still made some powerful statements when it comes to the ways how women lived centuries ago and what rights they had. Namely, almost none. After the rape, Comer's character talks to her husband and tells him that she can only go through with it if he supports her. It's true. She could not have done anything on her own and Driver's character's words that maybe her husband could even kill her did not feel impossible either. She is basically her husband's property and her father's military history is not helping with her standing either. But it seems Damon's character really loves her because he marries her despite her father, despite getting less than he was promised and stays with her despite what happened to her when everybody was out. There's more ""scientific"" talk there. A woman cannot get pregnant from rape. A woman cannot get pregnant if she does not have an orgasm. Or little death as they say. Oh what were times like back then. Maybe people who complain about lack of gender-adequate language should think about that instead of literally seeking stuff to mistake for discrimination. Or take the comment about how she considers Driver's character attractive. That's a completely different subject though, not entirely uncommon in 2021.As for the actual duel, it was okay I guess, but still not overwhelming. They sure tried all they could with the two fighting up on horseback first, then the horses are killed and they just fight like foot soldiers. I did not like too much that they really made it look all the time as if Driver's character was in charge and ahead only to turn things eventually into a happy ending with Damon's character prevailing. Maybe you remember the quote from Driver's character about how he would never bet against Damon's character in battle and this surely was a bit of foreshadowing. Also the idea of God's will (no matter if you believe in God or not) could not have been any more absurd, in the sense of him deciding if the rape actually took place by choosing a winner. I must say I would have thought the duel to be more one-sided with Damon's strength in battle and well Driver's character having fought in battle too, but he was more of a leech. Still somewhat equal. In the end, all his dignity and reputation are gone because his death branded him as an actual rapist and there he hangs like a dead animal. His attitude towards Damon's character must still be discussed: The two once were really close friends and he keeps defending Damon's character when he talks to Affleck's for example. Or also how he says on one occasion that nobody ever said a bad word about Damon's character's father. He respects the man for sure. However, at the same time he is quite a brute as we see on another occasion and how he deals with women there. Still he is smart, good with languages for example. But he also possesses a massive ego. Take a look at what happens right before Damon's character heads to Paris. How the latter shows up there and complains to Driver's character that he does not call him a sir or sire. One of the two. He really exposed him there in front of everybody, despite Driver's character trying to make peace and saying it was not Damon's character's fault that the mission in Scotland was a failure and that he still deserves his money. However, after this talk he received it seems as if he knew exactly what he was about to do when he wishes Damon's character a lot of fun in Paris. Then the tragedy happens.Admittedly, Driver's character probably also would not have expected this duel to happen because on one occasion we find out that life-or-death duels were not really a thing back then anymore, but the very young king with his appetite for sensation agrees to Damon's character's proposal and so be it. Right before the duel, we also find out a bit more about the female component of it all, about how Damon's character's mother had her own dark past and how living to bring up a child may be more important than seeking justice. This conflict is also in Comer's character's head near the end, but nobody gives in. Comer's character as well as Driver's until the very end stay with their versions of the story, which also shows us that Driver's character is not scared of God and keeps lying despite asking for forgiveness from the Lord earlier. You could say that Comer's character in the end is maybe the only good character here. Damon's is also not evil, but there are acts from him that seem vile, but fit in with times back then. Just take a look at how he forces his wife so briefly after the assult to have sex with him so that Driver's character is not the last man to have had her. There is a lot more to elaborate from this film because of really good attention to detail, such as the stallion/mare scene (also the colors), but I shall leave it at that. Good film. Watch it.

1,kosmasp,It takes two to ...,10,2 November 2021,"... Duel I reckon should be the thing that would fill out the sentence. On the other hand, we are talking duels here, so maybe that is what I meant to write, yes? Also it takes more than two in this case ... but as with the role played here that seems almost sidelined by events and how the characters feel things happened.You can call this feminist I reckon, on the other hand it may just be showing something that was way worse in the middle ages, but still exists in some way, shape or form today. Something that is shameful when it comes to the role of the woman and her standing in society. Also how she is being treated and seen by two men. I had absolutely no idea what the story was going to be (apperantly based on a true story and characters), so others may be at a (dis)advantage if they know more before watching it.But even the trailer that seems to reveal a lot, does not give you everything. Which is good, because there is a lot to explore. And while we are revisiting certain moments and scenes, they are always kept fresh and with a new perspective. Ridley Scott is a master when it comes to the technical side of filmmaking there is no doubt about that, the story here is also so strong that both elements fuse into something quite incredible.One thing I should notice. While there is not that much action considering the run time (which never gets dull or boring), when violence and fights erupt, they are as bloody and visceral as they can get! If you are faint hearted you may not want to watch certain scenes alltogether ... if you do you are in for a treat - no pun intended.",The Last Duel
2,CinemaSerf,Grand scale search for the truth...,7,16 October 2021,"Sir Ridley Scott has stitched together quite a compelling watch here, depicting well, as it does, the rather pyramidical feudal system that provided the legal and cultural structure of life in 14th century Europe. The film centres around allegations made by ""Lady Marguerite"" (Jodie Comer) that during the absence of her war-hero husband ""Sir Jean"" (Matt Damon) she was subjected to the unwanted attentions of powerful squire ""le Gris"" (Adam Driver). By way of a legal presentation to King Charles VI, the narrative now presents us with three equally plausible tales of just how these events may have unfolded. A tale of the initial friendliness between the men and of the ambition, greed, politics and fickleness that led to their current predicament. I cannot say that Damon is particularly good, nor is the blondly coiffured Ben Affleck particularly impressive as their overlord ""Pierre d'Alencon"", but both Driver and Comer offer us strong and characterful performances as each of their stories are rendered to the Court. The different versions are largely the same, there are but subtle and nuanced variations that you might, were you to be on a jury, have to identify and evaluate - in the end there are no forensics, there is no evidence as such - it is all about whom you believe. Again, this makes the film more interesting. It's not just whom you believe, but whom you want to believe, whom you think you ought to believe. There is the powerful church to consider; the local lords - decisions cannot be made according simply to any ""rule of Law"" or ""code of chivalry"". The duel - letting God decide - is the culmination (we see this at the very start of the film before our deliberations begin), but the cleverness of Scott and the writers here is to present us with as near facts as they can - we are left to make our own assessment. We are left to look at the way in which land and people - high born, or otherwise - were pawns in a game knowingly, or otherwise, that frequently became matters of life or death. The photography reminded me a little of the recent ""The King"" (2019) in that the filthy, muddy, damp and rat-infested conditions in which even the grandees lived are presented authentically and that adds loads to the overall feel of the film. The weather being often cold and wet, the battles being fierce and bloody - all of this contributes well to the strong visual imangery. It is a long film, but I found the episodic nature carried that rather well and the last twenty minutes are certainly worth sticking around for.",The Last Duel
3,mm-39,Brutality realistic.,8,18 October 2021,"Brutality realistic. The Lat Duel is done in three chapter, by the stories of the main characters and the viewer decides the truth. Which I like! Great environmental filming as the viewer experience the smells, feels, and dirt of 13th century France. France is a true socialist state run by the Royals (government) with sword control only royals can own, and the surf society which decides who get represented by a two tier law system. People took by force, and Matt Damon's character is a professional soldier with the perfect 13th century mindset! Damon takes, and wars for possessions including Damon's character's wife! Damon's rival Lane fought with Damon but is a political animal. More educated, personable and useful works in with Affleck, a duke, and moves up the power latter and gains property etc off of Damon's expense. I believe there is a rivalry between the Damon and Lane characters and the rape of Damon's character wife is Lane's characters motive to one up Damon and get away with the crime with connecting with the duke would be able to get away with the rape. Rules do not apply for Lane's class morally or legally! Damon power play for the duel is the only systematic way to get back at Lane and is the warrior which should win the duel. The third chapter is Comer character a women who was sold as property, and meant for breeding. The rape was a property crime with a state run church accusing the victim that if Comer testimony's un true then God will the the victum be burned at the stake if Damon loses. God will let the true man win in the idea of divine providence! Lane is the one who runs the estate and is more educated can read and writes abilities does not matter becasue Damon has all the legal rights; Damon as the warrior makes the decision of the duel. All three Chapter perfectly directed by Scott builds up for the duel, which becomes a savage entertainment. Brutal and realistic 8 stars.",The Last Duel
4,jdesando,"Epic and enjoyable, a perfect date at the cinema.",9,15 October 2021,"""The penalty for bearing false witness is that you are to be burned alive."" Le Gris' Priest (John Kavanagh)Indeed, epic and enjoyable, The Last Duel bears the weight of rape that goes on even today with a woman who challenges a man for violating her against her will. However, this historically accurate medieval occurrence happened 600 years ago under the Normandy reign of the ""mad"" king, Charles VI. In addition, its legal battles are almost as interesting as how a virtuous woman can withstand the pressures of men who rule her and all other women with witless tyranny.Conditions for Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Comer) are worse for her in the 14th century because the same ""he said"" ""she said"" is met with the same disbelief as in many cases today. Her uptight husband, Sir Jean (Matt Damon), who rarely smiles, will eventually agree to a duel with his squire, Jacque Le Gris (Adam driver), the accused. It may be the last duel, but it is not the last time a woman comes near death for her allegations.Ridley Scott, who knows something about action (Blade Runner, Gladiator), directs this almost melodrama to a fine degree as he explores, Rashomon-style, three points of view about the rape yet has as memorable a stock dueling scene with horses and lances as any I've seen. The complex drama allows us to question the truth of contradictory elements and to long for a resolution that is unambiguous but eventually hard to attain.The question about justice for women is present as it is today, for in the end the men determine, and women are left helplessly pleading to be treated fairly. That the truth of her allegations rests on the outcome of the duel is absurd but allowed because the King wills it, as if chance could determine the truth more than truth itself.Never does Scott let the action overshadow the search for truth because he allows sharp questioning take place, albeit resting on false assumptions such as if a woman doesn't feel pleasure at the end of the act with her husband, there will be no child, or that a child does not ensue from rape, or that describing a man as handsome predisposes a woman to adultery. Ages ago but a contemporary ignorance our ultra-conservative covens love.Not half as important but more interesting is the turf battle, where land is capriciously given away or gobbled up for debt less than its worth. Women as chattel is not new-doweries exist today even if they are not called that: ""Rape is not a crime against women"" says one man. ""It is a crime of property.""The Last Duel gives the audience almost all the possible pleasures from a motion picture that include gorgeous property and people. Enjoy as it was meant to be seen-in a theater.",The Last Duel
5,UniqueParticle,A lot of great dynamics and incredible Gladiator vibes,9,19 October 2021,"I'm glad I got to see this after interviewing to work at my near by theater well worth it! Jodie Cromer is a riveting actress she has some powerful moments and I really hope The Last Duel gets nominated. Ridley Scott still makes amazing movies decades into his career! The action is incredibly visceral, set design is massive it all felt so authentic and the dialogue was perfect. This movie was meant for the big screen so much of it was cinematic.Sorry for my review but I did love it!",The Last Duel
6,cruise01,Strong performances and Ridley Scotts direction but could have been better.,7,20 October 2021,"3.5 out of 5 starsThe Last Duel is a pretty fair historical drama film that has a knight challenging his friend in a duel. Which his friend was accused for raping his wife.It has a beautiful shot cinematography from the direction of Ridley Scott. The plot is moving which builds up to the duel in the climax. Showing the perspectives of Jean (Matt Damon), Jacques (Adam Driver), and Marguerite (Jodie Comer). Strong and powerful plot which involves these characters and a development leading to the duel. Some scenes can be difficult to watch for some.Great performances by Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Ben Affleck, and Jodie Comer.The script does get repetitive which is the down side of the movie. Showing three different perspectives with the three main characters. Seeing the same reenactment of the dramatic events with very little new detail. After seeing the third perspective replaying through the events. It can be a little annoying. Which feels like it is just adding to a long run time as it is. With the movie clocking around 2 and a half hours.The movie does have a couple of brief battle sequences. The duel climax is intense and thrilling. Seeing Jacques and Jean combat each other.It is a pretty decent film that could have been better. It did ran a little too long with its repetitive script. The direction and performances are worth noting.",The Last Duel
7,eddie_baggins,A challenging and gripping medieval drama,8,21 October 2021,"His best film since 2007's American Gangster, Ridley Scott's newest two hour plus dramatic epic The Last Duel see's the esteemed British director team up with stars and screenwriters Ben Affleck and Matt Damon (with help on the writing front from fellow filmmaker Nicole Holofcener) to deliver a gripping, confronting and even grueling examination of one of France's most infamous duels of the middle ages that may not appear to be on paper as tension ridden and engaging as it is as a finished product.Those expecting more Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood or Gladiator old school Scott may be disappointed by what Duel offers, despite the fact the infrequent battle scenes here are some of the best you've likely seen on the big screen in some time, but as the film breaks away into three distinct acts exploring the version of events that form the crux of this story from the viewpoint of Matt Damon's dedicated knight Jean de Carrouges, Adam Driver's charming but potentially devious squire Jacques Le Gris and Jodie Comer's intelligent but repressed wife Marguerite, Duel becomes one of Scott's most incendiary and challenging films of his long-standing career.Duel takes its time to get its full head of steam in momentum, with viewers likely to find themselves trying hard to wrap their minds around everything going on in the early stages of the film with Scott rushing around through time and locations to get Duel to the place it needs to be to really take hold but once it finds its groove, the brilliant collection of performances (with Ben Affleck a surprising joy also in small amounts of screen-time as the blond haired royal Pierre d'Alençon) and clever way of exploring a life defining moment for all involved and what lead them to the particular instance in time ensuring Duel will have you under its spell right up until a heart pounding and masterfully staged finale.Amongst all the technical prowess and storytelling genius are a number of intriguing sub stories to take note of with Duel offering rising British star Jodie Comer her biggest Hollywood breakthrough yet, with her turn as the charming Marguerite likely to get her attention at the soon to arrive awards season, why the ever impressive Driver is as good as his ever been as the smirking, devilishly charming and detestable Jacques Le Gris.It's a real shame that by the time many would've seen Duel the story that will prevail most prominently about this mature and topical production will be around its noteworthy failings to capture audiences at the box office booths around the world and in a time and place where these type of adult oriented dramas are becoming less common commodities, it's a real shame Scott's best work in decades will have to work hard in the year's to come to find its true worth in audiences minds.Final Say -It's not always easy to watch but The Last Duel is one of the best examples of the medieval drama in some time and with a raft of quality performances and smart filmmaking, Ridley Scott's latest films stands out as one of the best mainstream releases of 2021.4 gloves out of 5.",The Last Duel
8,Tweetienator,Good,7,26 October 2021,"Well, to cite Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon may be not the worst idea, but to put the different perspective ""technique"" again in the context of rape/sex smells to me a little like a copycat. Production and acting are good, but the story provided was a little drag for me. Someone remembers, The Duellists (1977)? The movie is about two French officers (again France, again the theme duel!) in the times of Napoleon dueling over many years because one officer felt he was insulted by the other officer on one incidence. That one is in my opinion the stronger movie - you can taste the code of honor and the movie drags you back to those times. For sure not everything is accurate too but it feels like. The Last Duel did not entirely convince me that I watched characters of the 14th century, there are here and there ""glitches"" that just felt wrong. All in all for sure not a bad movie and worth your time, if you are interested in the story, but The Last Duel does not belong to the top movies of Mr. Scott's oeuvre. Just my opinion of course.",The Last Duel
9,stevendbeard,"Classic 'He Said, She Said'",7,17 October 2021,"I saw ""The Last Duel"", starring Matt Damon-Deadpool 2, Saving Private Ryan; Adam Driver-the Star Wars movies, Lincoln; Jodie Comer-Free Guy, Star Wars:Episode 9_The Rise of Skywalker and Ben Affleck-Justice League, He's Just Not That Into You.This movie is based on a true story that took place during the medieval times-1300's I think but don't quote me-and is directed by Ridley Scott. Matt plays a Knight and Adam is his squire and they fight together in lots of battles, side by side. Matt falls on hard times financially and decides to marry Jodie, a rich woman. Ben plays a Count, a cousin to King Charles the 6th, that befriends Adam but hates Matt. When Jodie tells Matt that Adam raped her, Matt challenges Adam to a duel-that's how they used to settle their disputes back then-even after Adam claims his innocence. It's a classic case of 'He said, she said'. According to the courts and the King, whoever wins the fight is telling the truth and the dead person is a liar. Also, if Matt looses, Jodie is to be burned at the stake-punishment for her lying. The story is told in 3 chapters, with each chapter telling a person's side of the events that did or did not happen.It's rated ""R"" for strong violence, language and sexual content-including sexual assault & nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 32 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.",The Last Duel
10,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Last Duel,8,25 October 2021,"8/10 - if you go in expecting modern dialogue and relatively few action sequences (it's a drama, not an action film), you will find a lot to love in this expertly written and timely story that features strong performances, direction, and set design.",The Last Duel
11,pixrox1,This remake of a Japanese flick from the 1900's . . .,8,20 October 2021,". . . is more of a lamentable shot-for-shot reiteration (of RASHOMON) than was Gus Van Sant's likewise colorized version of another crime classic, PSYCHO (a 1998 rehash). Like Gus with PSYCHO, LAST DUEL producers Matt and Ben apparently figure that they can breathe new life into RASHOMON by simply shooting it in the so-called ""Wonderful World of Color."" And just as colored water did little to make a shower stall more menacing in the PSYCHO reboot, colored garments fail to add any verve to a non-sensual rapacious assault scene during RASHOMON REDUX.

12,arthur_tafero,Passable Revision of Rashomon - The Last Duel,6,8 November 2021,"The Last Duel is a 21st century revision of the classic film, Rashomon, which presents the viewer with three visions of the truth. It was a very effective tool for that film, and it is what makes them film passable as a story really without a protagonist; everyone in the film is carrying some type of baggage. This is not Ridley Scott's best work; far from it, but it is passable as an action film in addition to the obvious love triangle. I believe Matt Damon was poorly cast in this role, as well as Ben Affleck, as they are really 20/21st century personae, However, Damon is always quite the trooper, and gives it his best shot. Affleck, however, seems completely lost in his role. Everyone else in the film does a fairly decent job.

14,davidmvining,Complex and Brutal,8,20 October 2021,"A $100 million epic that probably should have been made for significantly less considering the subject matter, Ridley Scott's The Last Duel is a hard-edged Rashomon-like look at a rape in Medieval France and the ensuing legal duel, sanctioned by Charles VI, the last in France's history. I'm going to be honest, I'm not surprised that it's bombing horribly at the box office. This isn't the sort of thing people want to buy popcorn to and go to the theaters to watch. It's too heavy.The film is broken up into three chapters, each telling the story up to a certain point from the perspective of the three main characters. The first is centered around Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), a squire who led a hasty charge on an enemy line in battle that cost his lord, the Count Pierre d'Alencon (Ben Affleck), a key city. Alongside him in battle was Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) who helped Jean avoid death in battle and is also a squire under Pierre. The friendship between Jean and Jacques quickly devolves into a rivalry as Jacques gets closer to the Count, receiving more gifts for loyal service than Jean. Jean, meanwhile, meets the daughter of a pardoned traitor, Marguerite (Jodie Comer). Jean negotiates with her father for her dowery, agreeing upon a particular plot of land that gets snatched from him when Jacques, unknowing the pending engagement of Jean and Marguerite, agrees to accept that land for the rents that Marguerite's father owes Pierre, essentially (but not literally) stealing the land from Jean. Lawsuits are filed, egos are bruised, and Jean becomes increasingly bitter as he sees his lot in life lowered while Jacques seems to raise his own lots through no effort of his own.Before going any further, I want to admire the film's structure. The first third, Jean de Carrouges' telling, is where we get the bulk of the world building, and it's important stuff for the story. It's not just about women being pawns in the games of powerful men. There's a lot of detail about how the feudal system in France worked. How squires reported to Counts who reported to Kings, about how lawsuits worked, and how finances worked. Everyone is always short of cash, and the only way Jean de Carrouges can get out is to go to war from plunder and prisoners to sell at ransom. He goes to war in Scotland for just this, returning with nothing, and needing to immediately go to Paris to receive payment from the crown for his efforts. When he comes home, Marguerite tells him that Jacques Le Gris showed up when she was alone and raped her. Jean believes her, and he pursues a course of action that leads to the King of France endorsing the legal duel.The second section is Jacques Le Gris'. Where Jean's section showed a man perennially beaten down, Le Gris' shows a man of education and loose morals climbing the ladder of power easily. Much of his section takes place in Pierre's presence as he plays witty word games and joins Pierre in sex games with the pretty young women in Pierre's court (outside of Pierre's wife's presence, of course). He's also good with numbers and takes up Pierre's accounts, agreeing to make sense of the books but also go to the different tenants on Pierre's lands to pick up the missing rents. It's here, in Le Gris' section where we see that there are subtle but very interesting things happen. There's one particular moment that is in all three sections where Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris attempt to reconcile at the celebration of another squire's new child. In all three, a single line is uttered by different people about how no fight between squires should be allowed to continue for it is ruinous to all. In Jean's he speaks it, in Jacques' he speaks it, and in Marguerite's the other squire speaks it off camera. This is like the memories of the three reflecting back on the events from the end of the movie, wondering how they all got there.The most important aspect of this difference is in the rape itself. Jacques loves (lusts after?) Marguerite, but it's mostly from afar. After a brief exchange at the celebration where both are revealed as book learned and witty, they spy each other in different places over the next few months. When Jacques sees Jean after Jean returns from Scotland on his way to Paris, Jacques decides that this brute of a man has left behind his beautiful, intelligent lady of a wife behind at home alone. He visits, enters her home through deception, and gets into her bedroom with her and no one else in the house. What follows is a recreation of an earlier scene from Pierre's bedroom where Jacques had chased another lady around a table in a game that led to consensual sex. You can see the mirror, but at the same time it's obvious that Marguerite doesn't want to participate. It's not playful, but it's definitely not consensual. However, from Jacques' point of view you can see how he might see it that way. As he explains to Pierre later, when the accusations are running around the country, Marguerite was a lady who just put up the normal objections, like the lady from the earlier scene.The final third is Marguerite's point of view, and it provides more interesting context around both men. Her first scene is of Jean angrily arguing with her father about the loss in dowery with her father promising him that Marguerite will be fertile. The celebration scene clarifies a moment where she was dancing with Jean but looking at Jacques with her dialogue explaining about fake smiles getting people places rather than anger. There are scenes with Jean's mother, and the two really don't like each other. There are scenes of her sex with Jean which obviously pains her (the common belief at the time that women require ""the little death"", an orgasm, in order to conceive is mentioned by her doctor in reference to how she can't conceive). And, most importantly, there is the rape, which is a good bit more horrible from her perspective. We can see that Jacques was thinking that he was playful, but he's also far rougher with her and her protestations far more vocal. Also, Jean's reaction to the news if far less understanding that Jean's memory.It all ends up with that titular duel, and Ridley Scott puts his trademarked look on the brutal fight that earns every bit of the R-rating. It is both satisfying in some ways and really empty in others, on purpose. Neither Jean nor Jacques are particularly good people. Even in their own tellings they're not really admirable at all. Jean is a thin-skinned and impulsive brute who got himself laughed out of court, and Jacques is a cruel womanizer. When one side wins, it's not the pure victory anyone really wants because motives, purposes, and intentions are all crossed and confused.No, this really isn't something that was going to make its money back at the box office.I loved it, though. It's a complex portrait of a brutal time filled with very good performances from everyone especially Jodie Comer as Marguerite and Ridley Scott's wonderful visual sense of grandeur. I would never have greenlit this movie with a $100 million budget (and a script that is rumored to be at least an hour longer than the final product) as a producer, but I'm glad it's here. It's a hard film, but I think it's ultimately very worthwhile.",The Last Duel
15,rgkarim,Dueling stories Make This Search For Truth A Wild Spectacle,8,16 October 2021,"LIKES:The Setting:
For reviewers and audience members like me, being pulled into a world makes the experience, and the Last Duel has accomplished this very well. Like Game Of Thrones, the studio has pulled us into the time of the European conquests, where countries and lands switched alliances in the name of greed, power, and entitlement that we've seen time and time again. Misty forests, and wide fields culminate in the feeling of vastness of the world prior to modernization, as one traveled between havens of castles and forts for celebrations. Within these walls, the dark and hallowed halls are authentic, creating these immense fortresses that hold much with the walls and courtyards. All the subtle nuances of lighting via flickering flame, the echoes of the halls, and the details of changing certain room to please the owner's needs are here, and you really feel pulled back in time.The Cinematography:
It's beautiful to say the least, with great use of lighting and filters to bring about the moods of each scene. Battle scenes are engaging and ever changing to really draw you into the fight, with many angles capture at just the right approach to really draw out the emotions of the scene. Meanwhile, the more dramatic moments find blend plenty of dynamics together to draw out the scenes and give you the full emotions of that moment and the stakes that they hold. The fervor of the scribe who is being abused, or the pain of the person as they are berated for their thoughts are all beautifully stacked and layered from the camera work and really get you into this dramatic tale.Dialogue:
It's a movie that holds a lot of talking and character development, meaning that the words need to evolve past the common dialogue found on social media and comedy films. The Last Duel has some amazing words lining the page, using the poetic descriptions famous for these time period pieces that blend metaphor and ""common"" tongue into a fluid ballad of deeper tones. It paints the pictures of the feelings of all those involved, being used as a weapon to cut deep into the pride and ""honor"" of characters who hold those qualities close to heart. The deep dialogue is certainly a meat of the movie that you will either hate or love, but for me, this film does not get so lost in the dialogue to have you scratching your head like reading Shakespeare in high school.The Story Telling:
This dark tale stands out from other drams, due to the presentation of what is a common tale in this day and age. It's not just because it occurs in the Medieval time period, but more so in the way Scott and his team told the tale in the chapter approach. Each of the chapters in the Last Duel comes from the perspective of the person involved in the act, with the same tale being told, but getting those added nuances and beliefs by the storyteller about what they believed occurred. Seeing those subtle differences and getting to see their actions during the time period was a genius move that does not rub stuff in your face, and ending at the same point helped build up to the titular duel to come.The Action:
Believe it or not, this movie does have action outside of the trailer's fight and at times it is rather impressive. Scott and his team give you representative battles of the time period, combining swarm moments with personalized action, to combine into a fight that had some character behind it. A little violent sure, but Scott's handling of these moments gave use enough break from the drama to wake up, but never detracting too much to lose grip of the story. When the final sequence occurs, Scott extends the chaos of the battlefield into one duel, and it is a splendid dance of word and blade that last about 16 minutes by my watch. It holds the spirt of the entire movie and puts a fitting and exciting conclusion that has you wondering who will stand and who will fall, unless you know history.The Acting:
Hands down, this highly character centered piece requires good acting and this may be the strongest piece of the film. Damon is a wonderful opening chapter for the film, and his time as a squire is filled with moments of hurt, betrayal, and fury that he plays so well. Similar to other roles I have seen him in, that control of letting the emotions out in the right amount at the right time cannot be understated for me in this film. His engagement in the facets of the knightlihood actions, and how he processes all the pressure of the time are incredible and I loved how much he was pulled into the film to challenge that dynamic. Adam Driver, well the man continues to blow my mind with how elegant his skills can deliver on a character. More aristocratic in nature, Driver brings more of the poetry and nobility language that paints a rivalry between the two nights. His delivery of the language is much tighter than Damon's, and his outrage is more focused to again show the approaches to the lifestyle of the time periods. Ben Affleck does very well with his role as the arrogant Lord of the Land, his delivery holds more of the nobility debauchery and corruption of the land, but works well with his sinful delivery of the dialogue. The champion though, was the Jodie Comer, who once again delivered a role I enjoyed despite the harder scenes to watch. Comer holds so much elegance as a noble lady, only to then see her spirit come out during her side of the tale in the actions she did for her estate. When the emotional moments came up, she stacked her emotions to gradually pour out, from hurt betrayal to full on hysterics depending on the scene. She was elegant in her delivery, yet new when to lose that elegance to make a point and that control and depth, alongside the darker moments she had to bear, continues to display the talent and promise she has.DISLIKES:The Pacing:
I agree with my fellow reviewers that the movie loses its stride as the first hour fades, becoming a bit of an uneven mess that loses the power of the first act. A strong opening act starts to wind down int eh second and the third, and its only the promise of the duel and the outcome that gets you to stay. This uneven pace mixed with the longer run time, can make it difficult and if you don't have the energy, the quieter moments can lead you to falling asleep, but if you can make it to the end you'll be rewarded.The Animal cruelty:
The Last Duel does not venture into the territory of unnecessary torture of animals, but it does have some graphic displays that were painful for me to watch. I'm not a fan of seeing graphic shots of animals suffering or their corpses, so I can't say this was my favorite aspect. Yes, it's realistic and keeps in theme with the rest of the film, but for people like me, it can be a little somber to watch.The Sexual Moments:
Yeah, if you've read my reviews, the sexual moments are already not as enjoyable for me to watch if they offer little to the story. While the debauchery does show the characters of some of our casts and how one entertained oneself in old times, much of it got a little too visual for me. Seeing lots of the acts in the manner we see can be a bit hard to watch as well, especially seeing the more aggressive and illegal acts unfold that can be hard for those with PTSD. Applaude to the actors for making it come to life, but I'm still not the biggest fan of seeing forced love making multiple times when I get the picture the first time.The Presentation:
Ironically, as much as I love the three perspectives, I can't say that it did not have it's own weaknesses with the presentation. The three acts will give you the perspectives of all three and allow one to appreciate how stories fluctuate depending on the mind of the teller. However, seeing many of the same scenes again and again starts to lose the fervor and become boring given how little is added. Fortunately, there are other scenes happening around the moment that help relieve the boredom, but still seeing many of the same scenes occur with little action moments to again break up the drama was not the best choice for me and a more linear tale would have escaped this flaw.The VERDICT:
The Last Duel is a splendid example of cinematography storytelling for a very sensitive subject. Ridley Scott immerses you into the setting with visuals, clothing, and setting that will haul your butt into the Medieval time period and settle you into the politics of the movie and the subject matter. Fantastic writing feels authentic to the world of yore, and enriches the dramatic moments with a life that would otherwise be a bit dull, while action scenes contain all the splendid details to drop you into the carnage the world once faced. Yet the acting alongside the presentation are the solid points for the movie, with a cast who really does make such a dark subject tolerable and engaging, while also illustrating the flaws vanity can bring and how there are multiple sides of the story. Yet, the movie is not for those who get constant excitement in their films, as the pacing is off after about the first hour, which for a 2.5 hour movie is saying something. Mix in the darker elements that can be a bit much at times, alongside needing some action to break up the monotony of the film. And while the presentation is unique and artistic, it also is a big limitation because of how bland the same scenes become when little is added to them. Overall, the movie scores a worthy of theater vibe for me and I recommend a watch if you get the time.My scores are:
Action/Drama/History: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.5.",The Last Duel
16,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,I'm shocked that this bombed so hard.,8,26 October 2021,"The Last Duel's got everything: marquee talent behind and in front of the camera, sweeping scope to match and swordplay you'd expect to see in the best episodes of Game of Thrones. Yet Disney decided to give this movie next to no promotion at all in spite of Ridley Scott's robust reputation in Hollywood.The Last Duel's got equal parts good and weird elements in its runtime: the action's genuinely fantastic and Adam Driver is sensational, though Matt Damon's accent is outright broken as is Ben Affleck's blonde hair and make-up (I'm sorry, but seeing Batman with that haircut and a goatee-like beard in 14th Century France is pretty damn weird). Aside from the weird stuff, you still genuinely feel like you're in France during that grittier period in time, and the chaptered storytelling structure helps the film feel less overwhelming for people unfamiliar with French history.The Last Duel feels like it's amongst the last in a dying breed of cinema: historical epics with hefty budgets up against other blockbusters to match; which is a damn shame because it didn't have to be this way. This deserved better treatment from a marketing standpoint and didn't deserve to underperform the way it did. Pandemic or no pandemic there could have been an other way.Anyway, this film is a treat, if at times somewhat unusual because of Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's odd character quirks in front of the camera. 4/5 stars.",The Last Duel
17,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Even into his 80s, Ridley Scott's still got it",9,3 November 2021,"Probably my favourite movie of the year so far. Thankful to have seen it at the cinema, too, because the way the film looks and sounds is really impressive and immersive, helping to make the 2.5-hour runtime fly by.The start of the titular last duel is shown at the beginning of the film, before three separate flashbacks show the events leading up to it from a different perspective each time. The beginning of the duel feels intense without the context, owing to the atmosphere, sound, and direction. By the end of the film, when we understand not just how we got there, but how multiple characters perceived the events that got them there, the tension becomes almost unbearable.You're thrown into things in the first 15 to 20 minutes, but the film becomes clearer as it goes on, and really shines when events begin being shown from different points of view. Some changes us to perspective are obvious, but some are more subtle, and it's fascinating to see one character see themselves in one way when they're ""telling the story,"" but to see them in another way when someone else is. Damon in particular plays an almost completely different character in each section, owing to how differently he sees himself from how Driver's character sees him, and then how differently Comer's character sees him, too.Acting wise, everyone's great. Adam Driver is intense and menacing, Damon successfully plays the same character who changes dramatically depending on the POV being used, and Affleck is the best he's been in years in a smaller role. Comer probably steals the show, though, especially in the final hour. She gives an incredible performance, and surely will get some award nominations in the coming months.The film is paced well and endlessly compelling. The buildup to that last duel implied by the title is excellent, and the duel itself is one of the most intense scenes I've seen in a film in ages.This is a great movie, and one that feels vital and important, despite depicting events that happened over 700 years ago. Direction is strong, performances are great, and I loved how the film incorporated all the different points of view.Highly recommended.",The Last Duel
18,Anurag-Shetty,Please watch this on the big screen.,9,26 October 2021,"The Last Duel tells the story of Sir Jean de Carrouges(Matt Damon) & his wife, Marguerite de Carrouges(Jodie Comer). When an unspeakable crime is committed against the Carrouges by Jean's aide Jacques Le Gris(Adam Driver), King Charles VI(Alex Lawther) tells Carrouges & Le Gris to settle their differences by taking part in a trial by combat.The Last Duel is a jaw-dropping film. Director Ridley Scott has given us an unforgettable movie, that will lead to long discussions about the bygone early centuries when kings ruled the land, long after the credits roll. The long wait for the next screenwriting collaboration between Matt Damon & Ben Affleck after Good Will Hunting(1997), along with the excellent assistance of Nicole Holofcener, has definitely been worth it. The action set pieces are mind-blowing with a shock & surprise factor that's just not present in most action films, these days. In the middle act, the movie does drag a tiny bit. However, what follows immediately after, makes up for this & then some! The titular duel is definitely the highlight of the film. Matt Damon is amazing as Sir Jean de Carrouges. Adam Driver is outstanding as Jacques Le Gris. Jodie Comer is the star of the show as Marguerite de Carrouges. Comer deserves an Oscar nomination for her spectacular performance. Harriet Walter is great as Nicole de Carrouges. Ben Affleck is unforgettable as Pierre d'Alencon. Alex Lawther is awesome as King Charles VI. The supporting cast is impressive.

19,bankofmarquis,Just Doesn't Work,6,30 October 2021,"With films such as GLADIATOR, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, ROBIN HOOD, EXODUS: GODS AND MONSTERS and the current THE LAST DUEL, Director Ridley Scott is single-handedly trying to keep alive the ""Sword and Sandals"" genre that was so much en vogue in the Golden Age of Hollywood.However, he'll have to do better than THE LAST DUEL to keep the genre going.Starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Adam Driver and Jodi Comer, THE LAST DUEL tells the tale of the...well...Last Duel in France in the 1300's. The story tells the tale of 2 noblemen, their ups & downs and the accusation of the wife of one of them that the other raped her. The only way to solve the dispute is a duel to the death.Following the format of such films as RASHOMON (1950) and, more recently, WRATH OF MAN (2021), THE LAST DUEL is told in 4 parts - telling the same story from different perspectives. But, unlike RASHOMON and (surprisingly) WRATH OF MAN which peeled the onion back during each different telling, adding a deeper and richer layer to the story each time, THE LAST DUEL pretty much tells the same story over and over, not really telling it differently and not really adding any layers to the story. You pretty much know before THE LAST DUEL who is innocent, who is guilty and how the duel is going to play out.So, Director Scott will need to rely on the performances and the look and feel of the film to get the audience hooked and intrigued during this 2 hour and 32 minute epic, but the script (by Nicole Holofcener, Affleck & Damon just isn't up to the task.The acting is...fine. Driver fares the best out of the 4 leads - probably because he is the actor most suited for this type of film than the others. Comer's part is underwritten and she has surprisingly little to do - which brings us to Affleck and Damon. Affleck has the showier role and provides a spark of interest in his limited time on the screen while Damon is dour and serious and trudges through the film - as does the audience.Director Scott (ALIEN) brings professionalism to the proceedings and accurately depicts the look and feel of the time and stages the duel (and battle scenes) with a trained eye, but the characters/performances did not leave me with anyone to truly root for (or care about) and by the time we got to THE LAST DUEL, I just wanted it to be over.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Last Duel
20,bob-the-movie-man,Three nuanced perspectives on a winter's tale,8,16 October 2021,"In Ridley Scott's new movie ""The Last Duel"" we are in the late 14th century in France. And - apart from in one scene - it appears to be perpetual winter!Positives:
It's an intriguing script - the first collaboration between Damon and Affleck since their Oscar-winning ""Good Will Hunting"" from 25 years ago. It presents 3 different versions of ""the truth"" from three different perspectives. (One of these - Marguerite's version - is suggested as being the 'actual' truth through a clever delayed fade of the chapter title). Many of the same scenes are repeated in each variant: sometimes with obvious differences in fact; sometimes with the slightest nuance of tone or expression; and sometimes with no change to the visuals, but with the benefit of hearing the dialogue being spoken. Very clever.""Killing Eve""'s Jodie Comer is just brilliant here. She is the master of nuanced expression, and she genuinely deserves an Oscar nomination for this work. Combined with her great and fun role in the surprise summer hit ""Free Guy"", Comer is surely on a path to movie acting greatness.Damon, Driver and Affleck also have great fun with their roles: they are all eminently watchable and this is a study in acting greatness. But I particularly loved Alex Lawther's turn as the king: all excitable childish power in the body of a young adult.Battle scenes and the final duel are delivered in visceral nature reminiscent of Ridley Scott's famous battle and arena scenes in ""Gladiator"".Excellent production design and special effects on show here. Another Oscar nomination perhaps? The movie was filmed in the Dordogne region of France and also - after a 2020 Covid lockdown - in Ireland.Negatives:
At two and a half hours it's another long film (is October 2021 designated long film month??). And although the nuances between the different versions of reality are fascinating, there's a degree of tedium involved in rehashing the same scenes (in some cases) for the third time. Arguably I think a few of these re-versions could have been omitted to reduce the bladder-testing run time.Summary Thoughts on ""The Last Duel"": This is Ridley Scott back on top form again. I found this a gripping watch. As the film opens, we are teased with the start of the 'boss level' duel between Damon and Driver. But these final dramatic scenes are the emotional lynchpin of the movie since only then do you understand the background and the ramifications of the fight. Evidently, 14th Century France was NOT a great time for sexual equality. Women were merely chattels, denied not only fair play and self-determination, but also the bedroom niceties of foreplay and, in most cases, orgasms. As the story was based on real events, the courage and determination of Marguerite of Carrouges were extraordinary. And Jodie Comer's portrayal of her wonderfully demonstrates, yet again, why she is the UK's most exciting acting export for many years.(For the full graphical review and video version, please search for #onemannsmovies on the web.)",The Last Duel
21,Movi3DO,Could have been much better,6,18 October 2021,"Oh it's Mr. Steal yo girlBased on a true story, the movie told the event that led to the duel between a knight and a squire whose friendship turned ugly.The cast of this movie alone excited me. We got Jason Bourne, Kylo Ren, and Batman. And they were all solid in their roles.However, I had a major problem with the storytelling. The plot was told in 3 separate chapters with each from a character's perspective. This was meant to fill in the blank and reveal major twists to the story. The problem is that the story itself was too simple for this style of storytelling to work. Chapter 1 and 2 were enough for me to comprehend the whole story and had good understanding of the characters. Many scenes were repeated in the same way without any unique look from the characters. This led to the runtime feeling too stretched out. I think 30 minutes could be cut off and the story would still be coherent.I would have been entirely bored of the movie if not for the duel itself. That duel was the only unpredictable part of the story, and Matt Damon and Adam Driver (or their stunt double idk) performed the fight very well. There was good amount of blood and intensity to made me excited.Overall, despite the great concluding duel, the storytelling made for a disappointing movie. 6/10.",The Last Duel
22,tm-sheehan,Clever Script that reflects modern issues in a historical mirror,8,21 October 2021,"My Review - ""The Last Duel""My Rating 8.5
Ridley Scott Producer/Director of many fine movies like Gladiator, The Martian, Blade Runner, and Thelma and Louise hasn't lost his touch with this fine film .He is now 83 years old and has another much awaited film due out later this year ""The House of Gucci."" starring Adam Driver who also stars in ""The Last Duel"" .Adam Driver is certainly on fire at the Box Office these days in great demand.Ridley Scott is one of those fine Directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Pedro Almodovar,
Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick ,Jane Campion, Frederico Fellini and many more who have given us great film entertainment but never won an Academy Award?I think ""The Last Duel"" is one of his finest films with a Screenplay co written by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Nicole Holofcener based on the novels by Eric Jäger.The Last Duel set in France 1386 is a cinematic and thought-provoking drama set in the midst of the Hundred Years War that explores the ubiquitous power of men, the frailty of justice and the strength and courage of one woman willing to stand alone in the service of truth. Based on actual events, the film unravels long-held assumptions about France's last sanctioned duel between Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris, two friends turned bitter rivals. Carrouges is a respected knight known for his bravery and skill on the battlefield.Matt Damon plays Sir Jean de Carrouges who challenges Jacques Le Gris , Adam Driver to a duel to the death after his wife Marguerite magnificently played by Jodie Comer accuses Le Gris of rape while her husband is away fighting in Scotland.As usual no spoilers from me this is a film in 3 Chapters seen from 3 different perspectives first the husband's , then the accused and finally the wife's which we are told is the Truth.The author of the book Ben Jager counts the film as ""at least 75 percent historically accurate, maybe more,"" noting that while evidence may not exist for specific moments, there is a general record that supports the re creation.I read that Matt Damon said that he and Ben Affleck brought on Nicole Holofcener to help them write the female perspectives of the screenplay and I think that's very obvious as it's a fine script .I can't think of a period Drama film that reflects contemporary issues and attitudes as successfully as ""The Last Duel .""
Co Screenplay writer Ben Affleck made this observation recently about the film
he commented ""Schools educate you, and religious services deliver sermons, and movies - at their best - can generate empathy and generate compassion,"" says Affleck. ""There is this paradox of the human experience where oftentimes different people come away from the same situation with different impressions of that. And yet there can only be one truth. We wanted to examine that. But we wanted to do it through the lens of this situation.""So it wasn't so much about hewing fastidiously to historical truth, because that wouldn't have served the narrative needs we were as interested in, as much as illuminating the fact that the vestiges of the sexism and misogyny of the patriarchy we live with now come from a place that was Western civilization's codified value system.""
There's some fine performances in this movie especially from Jodie Comer as Marguerite we saw her recently in the 2017 series playing Elizabeth of York she is equally brilliant in period drama or contemporary roles like her wonderfully evil psychotic character Villanelle in Killing Eve Jodie Comer is a wonderful actress.The other standout performance for me is Adam Driver as the accused Jacques Le Gris I'm so glad he came on board and that Ben Affleck who was originally cast to play his role stepped aside to play the lesser role of Pierre d Álencon the foppish Count . It was the right choice as Adam Driver has the intensity and dark mood that's so effective for this role.Both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give good performances Ben Affleck looks a little odd as a fair blonde bearded character it took me a while to recognise him.Matt Damon looks so scarred and weather beaten which is appropriate for his role .Apparently Matt Damon can't grow facial hair, so the makeup department had to try out 20 different beards to apply to Matt Damon's face. He reportedly got a skin rash underneath the stuck-on beard, which was so irritating that he had to be treated with ice packs after every scene, while shooting the movie.Filming began on February 14, 2020 in Dordogne, France and continued until March 12, 2020 in the medieval castle of Berzé-le-Châtel (near Mâcon), Burgundy, France.On March 13, 2020, production of this film was halted due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Before that, filming in France was finished, and the production had moved to Ireland. Ridley Scott had already filmed for four weeks, and had one hour of the movie completed during this time, the filming only concluded production in October last year.This is definitely a film to be seen in a Cinema don't wait till the end of its 40 day theatrical release when it goes to Streaming .Like many movies affected by slow audience return to Cinemas this is a film thats had a disastrous Box Office return so far with a return only of $ 9.9 million The film cost north of $100 million to make it deserves to be seen and seen in a Cinema.",The Last Duel

24,MrDHWong,Revels in the grandiose spectacle of the time period while offering some reflective commentary on attitudes towards victim shaming,8,21 October 2021,"Just saw ""The Last Duel"", a historical drama film based on the non-fiction book ""The Last Duel: A True Story of Trial by Combat in Medieval France"" by Eric Jager. Directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"") and starring Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Jodie Comer, and Ben Affleck, it revels in the grandiose spectacle of the time period while offering some reflective commentary on attitudes towards victim shaming.In 1386, knight Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) returns to France after a victorious battle against the Scottish army. Upon arriving home, Jean's wife Marguerite (Jodie Comer) informs him that while he was gone, his best friend Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) forced himself into their home and brutally raped her. Jean takes this matter to the magistrate Pierre d'Alencon (Ben Affleck), but due to him being a close associate of Jacques, no charges end up being pressed. With no other option left, Jean challenges Jacques to a duel after receiving approval from the King and wishing to prove himself, Jacques accepts.Films set during medieval times aren't really something I find myself gravitating towards. This isn't due to me not being interested in that particular setting but rather because I think there's an oversaturation of media taking place in that era (I blame this on the overwhelming popularity of ""Game of Thrones"" during its heyday). What I think helped ""The Last Duel"" rise above the typical medieval tropes that have been done to death was how it addresses some uncanny parallels to relatable modern day issues that audiences can identify with.The catalytic plot device that sets things in motion is Jacques' sexual assault of Marguerite and the aftermath of her accusations against him. Due to the time period and her social status, Marguerite's pleas for justice are mostly met with ridicule from the general public. This is similar to what happens today with real assault victims whose allegations are called into question because of the abundance of those discovered to be crying wolf. Of course, Marguerite is telling the truth but naturally others find it hard to believe her. I never would have expected this type of movie to address these matters in such a concise, reasonable way, yet it manages to do so without seeming like it's picking sides. It shows that issues like this have been problematic throughout history and likely always will be with how things are currently going.Structurally, the film is divided into three chapters - Jean's story, Jacques' story, and Marguerite's story, culminating with a lead up to the titular duel. As a result, certain events play out from each of the character's different perspectives to show how the three of them all give biased accounts of what happens throughout the story. A technique like this is highly reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film ""Rashomon"", which told alternate versions of the same basic story, forcing the audience to make their own judgement of what really occurred. A common misconception is that there are always two sides to every story but in actuality there are three - yours, theirs, and the truth. Because of the personal bias that comes from someone's unique view of the world, it is impossible to ascertain the exact way events played out, so by offering fragmented parts of the truth, the film cleverly allows us to make up our own minds.Coming from a director like Ridley Scott, you can expect him to spare no expense when it comes to the film's visual style. He immerses us in 14th century France with breathtaking shots of large medieval castles towering over the land with a watchful eye on the peasants below. Huge crowds are seen congregating around the battle arena waiting for Jean and Jacques to fight each other to the death, which is reminiscent of Scott's 2000 film ""Gladiator"". All of this combined with careful pacing and editing helps the 153 minute long film feel much shorter than it is. While Scott's films have been very hit-and-miss lately, I would consider ""The Last Duel"" to be one of his hits, providing a solid mix of medieval action and genuine human drama. Interestingly, Scott's directorial debut was a 1977 movie called ""The Duellists"" which also featured duelling as its main plot element.It's no easy task to focus a film around the viewpoints of three different characters but with lead actors as well cast as Matt Damon, Adam Driver, and Jodie Comer, it works fine. Damon's character Jean is appropriately hot-headed and temperamental in the way he handles any situation, whether he's battling against vast armies or defending the honour of his wife. Although he is usually the morally superior one, his bad attitude prevents him from becoming the true hero of the story. Adam Driver plays Jacques as the jealous best friend, coveting Marguerite with a sense of entitlement born out of him frequently rubbing shoulders with French royalty. Unfortunately, we only see a few minutes of the two interacting favourably before the remainder of the film focuses around their mutual resentment. I just wish the film had shown more of Jean and Jacques' friendship before their falling out as it would have added more emotional weight to their inevitable duel. Despite being the lesser known of the acting trio, Jodie Comer holds her own alongside Damon and Driver, portraying Marguerite as a genuine victim of assault who remains strong in the face of the non-believers. She's the closest thing to a hero in this film, although that's not really saying much.Although ""The Last Duel"" may not be viewed as a classic Ridley Scott film years from now, it will certainly be remembered as one of his strongest efforts. The man always works hard to make his films look as authentic as possible to transport his audience into the world he has helped bring to life. Since Scott is considered to be the ""father of the director's cut"" (e.g. ""Blade Runner"", ""Alien"", ""Kingdom of Heaven""), I'm curious to know if there will ever one released for this film. This may be wishful thinking right now but it wouldn't be too far out of the realms of possibility.I rate it 8/10.",The Last Duel
25,Alexander_Blanchett,Not the kind of Epic you would expect it to be,8,15 October 2021,"I liked it. Its not what you would expect form the trailer or Ridley Scott, its more Rashomon than Gladiator. So I ssume a lot of people might be disappointed by being mislead.But its a good story, very up to date and relevant. The film reunites Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as writers the first time since Good Will Hunting, and just as in Good Will Hunting they also share the screen, with Damon having the more prominent role but with Affleck having a stand-out as well.The screenplay is cleverly written, with ""old fashioned"" dialogues mixed with modern words, behavoir and reacitons. It was an intersting mix and quite surreal at times.Acting wise it was solid. Matt Damon was all right. Not his best performance, not his worst. I guess he just got overshadowed by some of his co-stars. Most prominently Jodie Comer who gave hell of a performance. I think this will be her final breakthrough on the silver screen and I wouldnt be surprised if she makes some appearance in this years award season. Really a fantastic performance with many facettes. I also liked Adam Driver quite a lot. His character was nicely developed and he added a lot to it. Another good performance on his resume. Last but not least you have blonde Ben Affleck. Blonde Affleck is a bit irritating and very cartoonish at first but once you get used to it you realize the sarcasm that lies his in his performance - kind of reminds me on his turn in Shakespear in Love.The score is good, the cinematography amazing. The editing seems off at first but in the essence makes a lot of sense. Good directionl effort by Ridely Scott who was for once more intersted in the story than monumental fight scenes.Really loved the last 10 minutes.",The Last Duel

It took me a while, but i got into it. If you didn't catch something, don't worry, though. You'll see it again, and again. I was wondering what ben affleck was doing, until the credits rolled.

27,statuskuo,Medieval Frat House,6,20 October 2021,"After reading some negative reviews, much of which I agree with, I will say, it is an engaging film. If Jodie Comer gets nominated for Oscar it would not surprise me.This is toxic man -- medieval version.The story is of a woman who is passed off from one despicable man to another and pawed on by a third. The men, themselves, are interlinked by feudal setups. Landowners, noblemen and the like. In this case Matt Damon plays a squire who earns his living through fighting. As does Adam Driver. They're pals, at first, but the word of a woman drives a wedge between them, BUT more importantly, pride destroys them. Cue Enya music.Now, the men themselves aren't mustache twirling jerks. They are men of the time. Seen through the eyes of modern politics, you may bring this sensibility. If you care to watch...don't. It does work best if you don't see any connection to modern era ideals. Because it gets heavy handed towards the end when you see the story unfold again in Jodie's retelling of the events. I did enjoy the differing portrayal of the rape. It's not done as wildly nutty as I was expecting. And watching Ben Affleck torturing his lifelong bud Matt gave me some chuckles here and there.Perhaps this is an apology in Afflecks case. Considering his brother was hit with sexual harassment charge.As mentioned by others, there are anachronistic moments in language. The ""F"" bomb is flung around like at a bar. And mannerisms seem very modern. But look, Jodie, and her doe eyed innocent nubile sexiness makes you understand the reason why so many less attractive town resent her. Whilst men leer at her.Adam Driver...well...they keep pitching that he's handsome. I don't get it. But okay. It almost seems a pretty boy would've allowed guys like me to enjoy the ending more. There is some metal clanking brutality thats worth the time itself.I save my biggest gripe for the look of the movie. Looks very digital. And flat. It really takes you of the period. Should have shot on film. Give it more texture. Makes it look more television than movie.",The Last Duel

29,lareval,Best Ridley Scott Movie in a lot of years!,8,7 November 2021,"Ridley Scott proves he is still capable of directing great movies with this last movie so far. A gripping and thrilling drama based on multiple unreliable narrators that builds slowly -yet never losing its addictive tempo- towards a sensational and terrifically tense climax. The performances are top notch, the visuals and the design are truly masterful and the script manages to invest throughout the entire runtime. While the pacing may drag a little bit sometimes, this is a must see movie! A perfect cure to predictable, CGI grotesque blockbusters that populate our screens.

30,Xavier_Stone,"From the director who brought you Gladiator, brings you trash",3,17 October 2021,"Gladiator was shown in 2000 and it was awesome, that's 20 years ago. Bringing up that movie from 20 years ago was persuasive enough to get me to watch, but it sure let me down. It's basically the same story told 3 different ways and at 2.5 hours it had better be a damn good duel scene.It is not.It's 6 minutes of mediocre fighting knights which includes slow motion and cuts to supporting actors/actresses. This director did Gladiator remember, and has seemed to have forgotten all that worked in that movie as this is downright amateurish.Overall this movie is downright horrendous. From the poor Ben Affleck acting/muttering throughout and the poor lighting and darkness it seems to have been at night.It seems Ridley was on a budget with this movie, every battle scene was a whopping 3 minutes of close ups and ending soon so as to keep the retakes to a minimum and not to use too many extras. Then the movie just ends abruptly.Opening scene is the dueling knights getting prepped, then 2.4hrs of talking, then a 6 min duel. The End. Gimme my Oscar.",The Last Duel
31,sweidman-28016,Solid Movie,7,2 November 2021,"""The truth does not matter, there is only the power of men.""In Ridley Scott's first feature of the year, The Last Duel accounts the true story of Margerite de Carrouges who swore on her life that she was sexually assaulted by Jacques Le Gris. The taboo subject resulted in the duel between Sir Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris to either save the accused or the accuser and her wife. Rarely do we get large scale medieval dramas like this anymore. I can't think of anything else besides Ridley Scott's failed attempt at Robin Hood over 10 years ago. I guess mainstream audiences have moved their interests elsewhere considering this 100 million dollar budget movie hasn't even made a quarter of it back in 2 weeks and has dropped from theaters around the country. The marketing wasn't all that great, if we're being honest. Even so, the cast for it is fantastic. We have Matt Damon and Ben Affleck collaborating once again in both acting and script writing. Adam Driver has been a big name star for the past few years, even having a popular meme made out of him just this summer from a scene in Girls. And to round it off, Emmy winner Jodie Comer who had Free Guy just this August. The acting is the standout of the project and mainly where the attention has been brought upon. Comer has been receiving so much praise even in consideration for best actress. Honestly, she's on the cusp of gaining that nomination, we just have to see if Lady Gaga gets in or not for House of Gucci; which leads me into my next part.Ridley Scott has directing another movie this year, House of Gucci, which comes out later this month. More focus has been put on that, mainly because of Lady Gaga and the story and the once again stacked cast, also including Adam Driver. Nobody seems interested in Ridley Scott's name being attached to a project anymore. I can't 100% defend his name because I did find the direction in The Last Duel to be sort of bland. It's not so much the scripts fault, but I don't think Scott's direction added much to the story. Rather he just made a movie out of the script. Also, it ends up being a little too long than it needs to be. Going into the script, I thought it was fairly strong. It's told in three parts through the perspectives of Sir Jean de Carrouges, Jacques Le Gris, and Margerite de Carrouges. It's told in Rashomon-style, which mainly works in its case. Nicole Holofcener wrote the third act, the truth told by Margerite de Carrouge, and that's where the best moments lie. Not only do we have a powerful performance from Comer, but it's incredibly intense. We have both the perspective from her side, and also the duel which Scott does direct very well. A great aspect of the story is how it focuses on the men and not the woman. At the time, women were expected to basically ignore the fact and carry on with their lives to serve their husbands. Everything is made out to be a matter concerning the men and never her. It's painful to watch and Comer conveys it perfectly. Everyone ended up making a solid movie. It wasn't as striking as I would've liked it to be, and as much of a statement as it was trying to make about toxic masculinity and a Me Too story, it didn't get the impact as it thought it had. Still, a good movie. I would say go out and see it, but I guess you'll have to wait till it's hard copy release, then again nobody does that so wait till it goes to streaming in about half a year.",The Last Duel
32,DLochner,A great Scott - brutal,8,17 October 2021,"Brutal and lots of dialogues. What you definitely have to say positively about Ridley Scott's new work are the very well drawn figures. In terms of acting, it was also an absolute masterpiece. Especially for Matt Damon and Jodie Comer. It is a slowly told story about the question of truth. Based on a true story, Ridley Scott stages a dramatic story in which you don't know who the main character is. The real strength of the film lies in the script, which, unlike many other period films, is less interested in the show effect and more in the message the story wants to convey. The story, which has a running time of at least two and a half hours, takes the time to take a close look at its characters. Is certainly not a feminist manifesto, but it proves that every genre can be told anew and profitably from a female perspective. In this respect, the film on the one hand is a classic, really god, but you can tell that the original idea didn't come up with your own mistakes.",The Last Duel
33,colewaters,Sir Ridley Scott did it once again,10,17 October 2021,The last Duel is another cinematic masterpiece from Sir Ridley Scott. Matt Damon stole the show once again. I highly recommend this movie. Definitely worthy of oscars.,The Last Duel
34,kgprophet,Difficult Material Handled Well,6,18 October 2021,"A question I expect was discussed among the producers of this film was how to make a period piece such as this for modern audiences? For me the answer is depth and pacing.Depth as in each scene must be working several levels at once, and tactile realism is a must. Pacing as in catering to the short attention span of modern audiences. Periods of exposition or slow character portraits need to be condensed or chopped to the bare minimum.""The Last Duel"" accomplishes that for the most part by using a smartly written script (wait, what am I saying? It was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck!), where Matt Damon's character is established throughout a number of scenes detailing significant moments in his life. Adam Driver, the antagonist, seems less well composed. Supposedly he and Damon bond while fighting together, with Driver thanking Damon for saving his life. The next part of the film sets up the stakes for each character. Partially over lust for power, partially over greed, or survival of the family name, their actions have consequences.Some of these are somewhat mundane, with squabbles of property, for instance, but the quick pacing keeps things moving. Another smart approach for modern audiences was the structure of the script, where the same story is told through the filter of the three main characters. With the help of co-screenwriter Nicole Holofcener, the woman's perspective is smartly done as well. This includes the subject of rape. A couple poignant moments develops sympathy from the audience.These themes of decisions based on politics can be solid enough of a story that the duel at the end of the film seems almost unnecessary. Such as it is, the last duel happens pretty quickly, since the audience has been presented with the truth (with a special effort by the filmmakers to verify the real version of the events surrounding the rape). Nevertheless, after a two and half hour slog, we get to see reactions from the main characters as the duel goes down, and the stakes are clearly drawn.Did it really require more than two hours to tell the story? For one reason, it had three stories tell. Perhaps the producers wanted this film to fall in the Epic category, which requires a film to be over two hours. I think there is always a way to trim a film down. Here, perhaps remove a few steps of the journey. The real story begins later on, in which the accusation of rape becomes the center post that sets in motion the big duel. What about our favorite movie brats, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck? I was having a problem accepting Damon as the protagonist, a french soldier who has a bit of an ego. Especially when we see him in combat, I feel like I am watching Jason Bourne gone back in time. Ben Affleck is charming, his character is supposed to be a seductive womanizer living in the lap of luxury, so it is possible to see him fit the role. Then there is Adam Driver, who people might consider a level above Damon and Affleck in acting ability. But his character seemed too nebulous. The setup for his visit to Damon's wife seems to come from nowhere. Driver declares his love for her, despite only briefly chatting with her once.The duel itself is brief but effective. The cinematography relies on the current trend of keeping everyone in shadow (The Green Knight, Mank), but the director seemingly made a point to fully illuminate faces at times where he felt necessary. Director Ridley Scott made his feature debut with a similar film. In fact the storyline is almost identical. The cinematography was stunning, with shots framed and lit to look like a classic painting. In this movie, the cinematography is more perfunctory. The editing is one of the strengths of the film, knowing when to cut out of a scene and keep the story rolling, but also knowing when to linger, to emphasize the implications. The soundtrack seemed spotty. It is kinetic in the first half, helping to drive the narrative, but almost disappears in the second half.I give it a 6 out of 10. It tells an interesting story set in an interesting period, but that's about it.",The Last Duel

director: Ridley Scott
starring: Matt Damon, Jodie Comer, Adam Driver, Ben Affleck, Harriet Walter, Alex Lawther, Nathanial Parker, Tallulah Haddon etcBased on the true story of France's last trial by combat in the Middle Ages. Knight Jean de Carrouges challenges his former friend Jacques Le Gris to a duel after Jean's wife Marguerite accuses Le Gris of rape. Told in multiple Rashomon-style points of view. What an incredible and powerful film this was.My first few positives would be the amazing cinematography, set locations and action. As well as the strong use of gore, great plot structure and fantastic performances. This film was visually stunning, it bought to life the medieval period in such a striking and realistic way. The action scenes were so well shot and crafted; the film made the most out of its budget. The set locations were also amazing and so large in scope, it really made me just escape to the past in the best way as I was invested at the grandness and sheer scale of each location. I also thought the action and gore was very strong. It was gritty, gruesome, and hard hitting. Certainly not for the faint hearted. But the gore really added impact. The film showed how easy it was for the knights and people of the time to die so young. As the chaos of the battles and how brutal they were really showed how intense the fighting was within the war. I also thought the plot structure was fantastic. Splitting the film into 3 parts from 3 different perspectives was fascinating and an interesting dynamic to the film. Seeing similar scenes repeated but from a different perspective or hearing a conversation that wasn't heard the first time around was cleverly done. Plus, how the film manipulated what the audience knows due to who the perspective was from was fantastic. The performances from the whole cast here were also fantastic. Matt Damon, Adam Driver and Ben Affleck delivered passionate, hard hitting and often uncomfortable performances and were incredible. But the true star for me was Jodie Comer. She is an incredible actress. Her performance was moving and powerful, bringing so much emotion to her character.My Next few positives would be the character conflict and likeable characters. As well as the chemistry between the cast and fantastic pacing. And the great tone, dynamic between characters and fantastic themes. I thought the character conflict was very strong, it played into the films themes with its male characters very well. The conflict felt very personal so therefore the tension and stakes were high not just for the plot but for the characters as well. I also thought the characters were likeable in particular Marguerite, she had such a caring charm to her. Despite the limitations of what she could do, she still made the most out of her opportunities and was a genuinely kind person. I also liked how the film manipulated the audience into believing Jean (Matt Damon) and Jacques (Adam Driver) were likeable and good characters but once we saw the truth it was the complete opposite. I also thought the whole cast had fantastic and believable chemistry which made it so much easier to get invested in the plot because you cared about the characters. Next, I thought the films pacing was perfect. For me there wasn't one single dull moment, and I was intrigued and glued to the screen from beginning to end. With the constant action and the fascinating storytelling, I was always invested so the runtime went very quickly. I also thought the film balanced its different tones perfectly. The blend of gritty action and gruesome gore, and more personal and emotional drama was fantastic and there was a great balance of them both that never felt like the film was going too far in one direction tonally which I loved. I also loved the interesting dynamic the film gave the characters. Depending on what point of view was being told the relationships were always conveyed in a different way. Which was fantastic storytelling for me as it made characters look better than what they were. So, when we saw the truth the dynamics between relationships changed completely. One of the strongest elements of the film for me was its themes. Themes such as power, honour, and pride were handled brilliantly and in depth. Whilst also highlighting the disgusting way women were treated at the time.My final few positives would be the building of stakes and plot development. As well as the fantastic script and uncomfortable tone. And the fantastic final act. This film-built stakes incredibly. The duel that was built up throughout had so many lives on the line, but Marguerite risked that to be heard and to speak her truth. I also loved the development to the plot. Each scene had purpose and was important to the plot, and as it developed into the different point of views any pieces of information missing was given a scene to explain or explore. This just further proves how fantastic the script was. The attention to detail was incredible, the dialogue was powerful and moving and it was just incredible writing. I also appreciated the attention it gave to the horrors of rape and the lack of people who get prosecuted. It was very uncomfortable seeing the scene twice, but also seeing it from the point of view of the man making it seem consensual and the truth was awful but also a sad reflection of issues in today's society. The final act for this film was incredible. It was entertaining, intense, and moving. The duel was incredibly shot and gruesome and ended the film incredibly well.Overall, the last duel for me is what cinema and film is all about. With powerful performances, a clever and well-constructed plot. And its themes handled in a powerful and thought-provoking way. It gave a voice to a woman who refused to be silenced.Overall score 100/100.",The Last Duel
36,gavinp9,Long human-focused drama,6,21 October 2021,"'The Last Duel' was not quite what I was expecting from a Ridley Scott historical epic - better than 'Kingdom of Heaven', 'The Duellists' and 'Exodus: Gods & Kings', but not of the same calibre as 'Gladiator' and 'Robin Hood'. It's set in 14th century France (but no subtitles here, all in English!) with Jean de Carrouges (Damon) and Jacques Le Gris (Driver) seemingly ageless knights. Marguerite (Comer) is Jean's wife and Pierre (Affleck) is the count for which Jacques is a squire. It should be noted that the other main co-stars are Damon's mullet and Affleck's dyed blonde hair & goatee!The first 40min seems a bit scattershot, jumping all over France and to different times during a 20-year period, with lots of blanks. But it soon becomes clear that we're watching three different retellings from the perspectives of Jean, Jacques & Marguerite, as the plot slowly unveils itself and your assumptions are challenged each time. After the battle at the start, the middle 90min is a bit slow, with it basically being a drama and battle of wills between the four main characters.The actual duel at the end is really brutal and very well executed. The subject matter, and filming, of the rape that is the focus for much of the film is disturbing and while you admire Marguerite's courage, the ending left me asking what the point was? I know it's based on a true story, but the resolution felt unsatisfactory and mostly serves as a bleak reminder of how bad things were for most in past centuries. By no means a bad film, just not as much medieval battling as I was hoping for, or as much humour as I expected from Damon & Affleck.",The Last Duel
37,movieman6-413-929510,Same story from different points of view,5,16 October 2021,"The Last Duel is a new historical action drama directed by Ridley Scott, the director of Blade Runner and The Martian.The film is set in 14th century France where Sir Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) appears to have been betrayed during his knightly duties by his old friend Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver). Jean's wife Marguerite (Jodie Corner) claims that Le Gris abused her. When Jean Le Gris confronts this, he denies everything. Jean and Marguerite each have to prove for themselves what Le Gris has done to the court. Ultimately, Jean and Le Gris are forced to face each other in a duel with only God's help to determine who is telling the truth.The film's story is based on a true story for which Ben Afleck, Matt Damon and Nicole Holofcener co-wrote the screenplay. The story is divided into three chapters. Each chapter tells roughly the same story, just from a different point of view. Thus, each chapter brings out different details of the story. As a viewer, you are put in a position that makes it seem like you are a member of the jury of the court and have to decide for yourself who is telling the truth. Because they repeat the story a bit and you sometimes see the same scenes several times, only each overlapping from a different point of view, it can sometimes seem a bit repetitive or long-winded.Ridley Scott beautifully portrays the film and plays with almost the same scenes by conveying them from the different points of view. Because of the film set and costumes, they also convey the time and location in which the story takes place well.The cast members played their roles well and all with an accent that was spoken around the 14th century. One does this better than the other. Because they seem to show some scenes several times, they get the chance to play with these variable scenes a bit. Matt Damon portrays his character in his character's story as a righteous hardworking knight. Jodie Corner her character Matt Damon first experiences his character in this way. Then, when told from her point of view, Matt Damon comes across as a brutal man who sees his wife more as his property than his equal wife.",The Last Duel

40,darkreignn,Thrilling,8,16 October 2021,"There can be no doubt that Ridley Scott has an illustrious career in Hollywood. And from the science-fiction classic ""Alien"" to the historical action drama ""Gladiator,"" and everything in between, Scott has proven himself to be a director who isn't afraid to film big, bold stories. ""The Last Duel"" is no different.A reenactment of the last officially recognized judicial duel fought in France in the year 1386, ""The Last Duel"" tells the story of Marguerite de Carrouges, played tenderly by Jodie Comer, a woman who accuses a man by the name of Jacques Le Gris of assaulting her. Jacques, Adam Driver's character, proclaims his innocence and sets into motion events that cause Matt Damon's character, Jean de Carrouges, Marguerite's husband, to fight Jacques to the death in a trial by combat.""The Last Duel"" tells its stories in three chapters, with each one showing the perspective of the movie's three main characters. Chapter One tells the story from Jean's point of view, with Chapter Two demonstrating how Jacques thinks the events unfolded. Finally, the plot starts coming to a conclusion in Chapter Three, aptly titled ""The Truth,"" which is from the POV of Marguerite. Each chapter, while a retelling of the same events. Are different from one another, in both small and large ways - and thank God, because these differences save the retellings from becoming boring. One reenactment of events, for example, may show a primary character acting extremely confident, courageous, and heroic, while another point of view will depict that same character as hot headed, insecure, and prideful. The different views of characters, events, and plot points is thrilling and will keep you guessing as to what, exactly, is the truth of the matter - that is, until Chapter Three.The main question of the story, which is the question of whether or not Marguerite is telling the truth about her assault, is one that is answered very decisively. While a more ambiguous retelling of events may have served the purpose of making the story, and the final duel, slightly more intense, the movie is still consistently thrilling, especially when the final chapter begins. As the true nature of each character is shown, much more depth is added to the story and the events that are happening on screen. Is Jean fighting to right the wrong of his wife's potential assault, or is he rather attempting to regain his own dignity and enact his own revenge? Is Jacques as playful and seductive toward women as many believe him to be, or is he actually a sadistic assaulter who simply believes himself a Casanova? As the pieces fall into play, you're treated to interesting realizations played by actors who are doing some of their best work onscreen.Adam Driver is riveting here, and honestly it's worth watching this movie strictly for his performance (though I'm very biased, because I'm a huge fan of his). Matt Damon is good here as well - I found him slightly wooden at times, but he also had some absolutely show-stealing scenes, with one in particular where he confronts Driver regarding potential disrespect of his new found Knighthood being particularly fantastic. Ben Affleck is another actor I am very fond of, and while he doesn't get much screen time here, he's good with what he has. I found him potentially miscast at certain points, but since his character is meant to be a sleazy womanizer, the overall appearance of the character and demeanor in which Affleck chose to play him ended up working better than I expected.There's also some very good action here, with Ridley proving that even at age 83 he can still film some intense sequences. Chapter One has most of the action, which takes the form of small medieval battles. There's a lot of cool kills, with one involving a spear through someone's head that had me grinning like an idiot. After that the action slows down until Chapter Three, but pays off big time when the titular duel starts. Matt and Adam were so great here, and the action itself was filmed very well. The fight was gritty, brutal, bloody, and dirty - everything you'd expect a fight in the late 1300's to be. The duel didn't end the way I expected it to, but the movie had a very satisfying, and historically accurate, conclusion that I imagine will please audiences.As is the case with many Ridley Scott films, perhaps it is a touch too long - surely, some sequences could've been left on the cutting room floor (especially the horse scene - you'll know it when you see it). That said, with this movie's combination of gorgeous scenery, incredible performances, and stunning action, and not to mention its thrilling plot, I found ""The Last Duel"" to be one of the best movies I've seen in theatres recently.",The Last Duel

I had a good time and this is not bad, but I had a weird feeling the entire time watching this movie. I cannot really explain it - but playing out in France with no one speaking or hinting at being in France, and a dragged out story which we have all seen before and a couple of bad performances is probably what make my brain go ""meh"".Jodie (excellent!) and the actual ""duel"" upgrade the movie. Most of the scenes, the directing, music score, costume and overall design of the movie is great but the movie just do not have ""that"". As said I am uncertain exactly what ""that"" is, but I was constantly going ""ah, that is fine and I like it but I do not really care"" to almost everything going on. And the point of view filming is a nice touch but we have seen it many times before and if you want to see it done right go and watch AoS season1, episode 13. They did it a lot better and with a much better flow.All in all a fine movie with fine writing, acting and cinematography. It is just not something special and we have seen it all be done better before. There is energy or gravitas or something missing and it drags a bit and a few performances did not sit right. Which leads me to a 6/10, which normally would make me recommend, but in this case... No.. I cannot recommend you to go see this.

43,jdring2007,"gritty, harrowing historic drama with bursts of violence, and an epic ending",9,17 October 2021,"I knew going into this that it would be a drama more than an action or anything else, and this held true. Ah, yes. Truth. The central theme and one up for debate, until the third act, in this film. Telling the story via three different perspectives was both a wise and challenging feat; the differences between each ranged from small - nonetheless important - to immense. Still, there was a lot of repetition that I felt could've been avoided. The acting was thoroughly exceptional by every person, and some of the disturbing scenes were genuinely hard to watch even for someone like me. Cinematographically it was a sight to behold, especially during the battle scenes - only two, but each were raw and gritty, immersive and violent - and the duel. The intensity of the duel itself was achieved foremost by culmination, and an underlying factor that was Lady Marguerite's fate, and details of that fate which came as a shock to me. This all made the duel even more intense, as I had no idea what the outcome of this historic tale was. I'd advise you go into it knowing as little as possible yourself, and even this slow burning drama will feel much like a thriller. And while it took place in the late 1300s, it should be unsettling to all viewers that some facets are still relevant today, albeit in less odious manners.",The Last Duel
44,hunter-friesen,A Modern Medieval Epic,8,15 October 2021,"At 83-years-old, Ridley Scott is quite the inspiration. With a directorial career that spans nearly 2,500 commercials and countless films - such as ""Alien,"" the Best Picture-winning ""Gladiator,"" and ""The Martian"" - no one would blame him to hang it all up and retire to the countryside. But Scott has never known the definition of the word ""break"" and has tasked himself with increasingly tougher work the more he ages, with 2021 seeing the release of two major tentpole films in ""The Last Duel"" and ""House of Gucci."" The latter of that pair bows at Thanksgiving, with the former hitting theatres this past weekend.In an extended prologue surrounding the titular bout between Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) and Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver), ""The Last Duel"" sets up what to expect, such as the grey dourness of the setting and story, lensed exquisitely by Scott's longtime cinematographer Darius Wolski. Atop both of the knights is the petulant King Charles VI, who is more than giddy for some bloodshed. And standing between the duelists is Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Comer), whose fate is linked to the outcome. Before any of the men meet their maker, we flashback sixteen years prior, to a time when they were dear friends.Broken up into three chapters, the film follows the unique perspectives of the three central individuals as it tracks the events that led to the duel. This ""Rashomon"" inspired structure is where Scott, along with Damon and Ben Affleck in their first credited screenplay since ""Good Will Hunting,"" show off their brilliance.The first chapter is ""The truth according to Jean de Carrouges."" In Jean's eyes, he's a righteous knight that has been wronged by those that deserve less than him. Despite his proud military record, his squire Jacques is shown favor by Count Pierre (a bleach blonde Affleck), who gifts Jacques with a vast piece of land once promised to Jean. The growing resentment between the two reaches a tipping point when Jean's new wife, Marguerite, accuses Jacques of rape.But ""The truth according to Jacques Le Gris"" sees things differently. Jean is headstrong and foolhardy, easily leading Pierre to favor Jacques's worldliness. Jacques feels that Jean is wasting the sophistication of Marguerite and that he is the only person that truly appreciates her. Therefore, his sexual act cannot be classified as rape, since the two of them are meant for each other.Not that it's much of a spoiler of what the actual truth is, but ""The truth according to Marguerite de Carrouges"" displays the words ""the truth"" for an extra couple of seconds before fading away. This chapter is written by the talented Nicole Holofcener, as Damon and Affleck felt they were unqualified to write from a female perspective.Marguerite's truth sees both Jean and Jacques as squabbling children using the pretexts of duty and honor to mask their cruelty. The rape scene is played again, this time amplifying the excruciating horror of the act, prompting a necessary uncomfortable feeling within the viewer. Her accusation against Jacques is met with hostility from both Jean and the rest of France, as rape is not considered a crime against a woman, but a property matter.The greatness of the film's structure is that it creates a puzzle where the pieces are constantly shifting in size and placement. Even a simple act, such as a handshake between Jean and Jacques, is seen from three angles, each eliciting a different response.It's fascinating to watch as the web of lies and truth becomes increasingly difficult to parse, with Scott supplying the necessary inertia to keep the film moving at a great pace.And the final duel more than lives up to expectations, especially when compared to the high bar Scott has set for himself within his filmography. There have been only a handful of final battles that weren't already decided by the plot before they begin, and this is one of them. There's an exciting amount of tension as the knight's exchange blows in agonizing brutality.Bolstered by spectacle and substance, ""The Last Duel"" is one of Ridley Scott's finest films. It's one of the few films in 2021 to exceed my expectations, and one of the few blockbusters of the modern age to be propelled by collaborative artistry, rather than preconceived properties and overblown budgets.",The Last Duel
45,arabnikita,Finally a 2021 movie that meets expectationa,9,16 October 2021,"The Last Duel (2021)When I was going into the cinema, I was expecting to watch a medieval story with a strong cast and one of my favorite directors at the helm. I loosely knew that it was based on true events of the last official mortal duel and the rest was a mystery. Happy to say that my expectations have not only been met, but they were also significantly exceeded. I knew this was going to be a solid medieval movie based on Scott's experience but I could have never imagined that the seemingly straightforward story would be presented in a such a creative and spellbinding way.The film begins with Matt Damon and Adam Driver charging at each other in full battle gear. Their quarrel somehow involves Jodie Comer but before they annihilate one another, we get to see these three characters tell their version of the exact same story from 3 different perspectives. Each person presents the ""truth"" as they see it and the mastery of this film is the nuanced way in which the identical events are perceived so differently based on who is describing them. It's incredible to watch the psychological analysis of the 3 different viewpoints which allow every character to feel substantial which results in a powerful story.The Last Duel itself is something like the Trial by Combat in Game of Thrones, where God decides who deserves to live. When these men finally clash, it turns into a violently breathtaking spectacle resembling a fight filled with genuine hatred. I was able to feel this hatred because of the great acting by the quartet of stars. Matt Damon was naturally great and Jodie was unexpectedly fantastic but it was Adam Driver who surprisingly managed to bury under my skin and make me loathe his mere appearance.What I particularly liked is how despite taking place in France, the film scrapped any kind of accents. Additionally, the movie managed to effectively portray certain struggles without ever being ""in your face"" about it, which is a rarity nowadays. The costumes, decorations and the technical elements were all top notch as expected from a Ridley Scott movie. Finally, a 2021 film that lived up to expectations!Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest and on point movie and TV Show reviews.",The Last Duel
46,Come-and-Review,Scott returns to form,9,13 September 2021,"Seen the film at a screening at the Venice Film Festival.Even if there is no way of telling that what The Last Duel portrays is entirely how the events took place, or as authentic as it seems to be in depicting middle ages, one thing is certain: it belongs to Ridley Scott's better works, and proves that the 84-year-old filmmaker is still able to deliver memorable films.The dramatization takes on a three act narrative frame that resembles partly that of Kurosawa's masterpiece Rashomon: three chapters narrate the events, each from the point of view of one of the three protagonists, the two duellists and Marguerite.The film clearly seeks a historical authenticity, and seems to succeed at achieving it. The almost word-by-word, blow-by-blow adherence to the accounts of the duel seem to confirm such an achievement, and is in a way reminiscent of Scott's debut film The Duellists, known for its methodical reconstruction.The true essence of this film's stance is the idea that through the study of history more can be learnt about the contemporary world, the past as a mirror of the present.The Last Duel is, in the end, a film that deals with the present by showing the past, and does so in an exquisite and entertaining fashion.(extract from my review on comeandreview)",The Last Duel

49,Oktay_Tuna,A Brutal and Thought Provoking Cinema Drama(Character Analysis),9,16 October 2021,"This film has a lot to take in both visually and story-wise. First of all this film isn't a war movie, it is a drama which I loved. I thought the end duel was masterfully done, one of the best build-ups and pay-offs I have seen in a long time but I want to focus on is purely the script and the two characters it has. Notice that I only say two characters because Marguerite isn't a character not because they failed at making her a character but because they were successful at making her a mere pawn. The only time she has been a character was when Jean de Carrouges left for Scotland and she had time to do some daily work. I have heard some people say that her character feels flawless compared to Jean and Jacques Le Gris's characters but it is because she doesn't have one. She didn't have one at that time. She didn't have the chance to defend herself, the trial was between the two duellists not between the accused and the victim.The film had 2 chances where it could have failed miserably but fortunately it dealt with these perfectly. The first one is the question: ""Is Jacques Le Gris lying to himself and the others?"" and surprisingly the answer is no. According to him he didn't rape her. In a scene near the beginning of the 2nd chapter we see Jacques Le Gris chasing a woman as a ""game"" and in the end he basically rapes her with the help of the others. Some might she is willingly there but then my answer is she chose to be there because the alternative was just worse, it didn't mean she chose to be raped. So Jacques Le Gris thinks of their encounter with Marguerite as an adultery rather than a rape. When he looks at her and fantasize then see that she is looking at him he thinks it is because she also wants it too(which is unfortunately still present in some people today). Him thinking like that isn't uncommon in that time period clearly seen by the fact that Marguerite finding Jacques Le Gris handsome is a proof that it wasn't rape(which again unfortunately is an argument some people defend today). In the end Jacques Le Gris still says that it wasn't rape not because he is lying but because it was the truth, for him. Loved this.The other mistake the film cleverly avoids is making Jean de Carrouges a likable character. Maybe in the first chapter he seems like a protagonist but even there we see that in the marriage they never talk about her life but only about his. How bad of a husband he was(according to today of course, in that time period his actions were seen normal) is way more clear in Marguerite's perspective, which feels like an objective narrator but that's only because she isn't an actual character but just an object in the context of the film which is brilliant. I mean I don't even have to explain how he was about to not get married because some land wasn't in the dowry or how he and his mother(whom I thought was a very complex character) talk to her. The only scene I need to mention is after he learns that she was raped. He says, ""I should be the one who had sexual intercourse with you the last"" to a rape victim. That's just cruel and proves that he never really cared about her feelings. In the end if Marguerite's life wasn't at stake I wouldn't want either of them to win(or would be okay with both winning). Not because I hated or loved either of them, I just didn't root for any of them meaning the film achieved its purpose. The symbolism from horses breeding to how characters thought stuff played out(and both were right according to them, so can we actually say they are wrong? This is a topic for philosophy though) and how much the Mom and Ben Affleck's character added to the film and so on but then this would become an essay. All these topics can be discussed for a pretty long time so if you had watched this film with someone and didn't talk more than a few minutes about it I strongly urge you because you will learn more and love the film more as you talk about it.",The Last Duel

RIDLEY SCOTT STRIKES AGAIN.",8,14 October 2021,"Based on the novel by Eric Jager, the master Ridley Scott manages to stage a tragedy worthy of his fame, in fact the result is atrocious, raw, true, disturbing and extremely well done, especially thanks to the triad Scott-Damon-Affleck to the script. The Last Duel, tells an incredible, poignant and epic story, rare in modern Hollywood (and especially of this workmanship) consolidating itself as one of the most solid and interesting stories ever told before; in fact, regardless of the story itself, the film is driven on with a sort of masterclass of a perfect Matt Damon, an incomparable Adam Driver and an insurmountable Jodie Comer, without forgetting the great Ben Affleck, all trapped in a unique and captivating narrative, testing the versatility of the actors, but also of the writing itself. Clearly, evidently, The Last Duel is one of the many successful films of the master Ridley Scott.",The Last Duel
51,jaredpahl,Dull Drama Defines Scott's 'Duel',6,16 October 2021,"They don't make historical epics anymore. That's still true, seeing as Ridley Scott's The Last Duel can't really qualify under 'epic'. But for a time, in the early years of this century, they did make historical epics. And Ridley Scott made some of the very best. With Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, and to an extent Robin Hood and Exodus: Gods and Kings, Scott created his own niche genre of brawny, muscular, elegantly made historical action epics. Movies that teenage boys could pump fists over, but that also felt like ""art"", smart and prestigious. The disappointment of The Last Duel is that it is not interested in belonging to this lineage. The Last Duel is interested in one thing, theme, to the detriment of story, drama, tension, and excitement.How's this as a thrilling idea for a movie? A French nobleman challenges another to a duel to the death in order to prove his wife's allegations of rape are true. Very thrilling, that's how. And inherently dramatic and quite fascinating from a historical perspective. But The Last Duel treats the fantastic real-life story of the duel between Jean de Carrouges and Jacques le Gris as but a jumping off point for what writers Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Nicole Holofcener really care about; topical issues. The bulk of this movie is scenes depicting or revolving around an incident of rape. Shown in three chapters, from three points of view, these scenes take up a tremendous amount of time, retread much territory, and differ very little on their way to making a pretty obvious point about female agency in 1300s France. The movie is meant to give literary types lots of thematic gristle to chew on. Affleck, Damon, and Holofcener want to say things about society, and they want us to quibble over what exactly they are saying about it. I'm sorry, but I can't seem to care what they have to say about society. I bought my ticket for something that would affect me on a visceral level, not for a discussion prompt.The actors will no doubt garner a lot of attention. No one is either good or bad enough, however, to really warrant a mention. But in the interest of prosperity, Damon plays a confused meathead, Driver a self-imagined lothario. Affleck is your standard posh aristocrat, and Comer is your standard strong, proud, wrongfully wronged lady. None of these actors even try to put on French accents. Regardless of how such attempts might have sounded, it would make their performances something other than inoffensively passable.Don't worry, I'll get to what works about The Last Duel. This isn't a disaster. But first...Ridley Scott, one of our best filmmakers, shouldn't be making films that look this bad. I hate to say it, because nobody appreciates the accessible artistic grace that Scott can infuse into something even as schlocky as Hannibal as much as I do, but his newest movie looks like crap. White diffused light filtering through windows is a blight on cinema. The grey screen that is seemingly overlayed on top of each frame of this movie is a felony. There are about five great shots. Everything else is depressingly dim.It sure sounds oafish of me to say it, but the best thing about The Last Duel is the action. The film kicks off with a thunderous battle scene, revisited later, where all the best Ridley Scott qualities are present. He has a way of shooting a line of charging horses, the clashes of swords, blood sprays and mud splashes like nobody else not named Mel Gibson can. There are a couple brief battles interspersed throughout the sitting around in dark rooms scenes, and they're just as great. Then comes the duel, where we feel, for the first time, some real tension. It rivals Gladiator's final swordfight for sharpness and palpable danger. Good stuff. Also the only part of the movie where I feel genuine passion coming through the screen from Scott.Most of the time, The Last Duel feels inert. I won't spend my review speculating as to what message the filmmakers want me to get, because I didn't spend the film caring about such things. Social commentary is an optional garnish on a movie. Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven garnished their stories with social themes, but underneath was real narrative propulsion, strong characters, solid dramatic storytelling. They were prime-cut medium rare steaks with chives sprinkled on top. The Last Duel is a plate of chives. It pains me to write such things. As one of the country's leading Ridley Scott fans, I was more excited for this film than anybody else. While there is enough respectability here to keep it out of the dust bin, and enough good action to make it worth a swords-and-horses fan's time, The Last Duel didn't stir me the way a good Ridley Scott epic does. I hope he has a couple more historical epics left in the tank, because he is the keeper of the flame, and when he's on, with a strong narrative and a creative spark, the results can be exquisite.61/100.",The Last Duel

The movie has several small battles, the 3 Rashomon like tales with their subtle and glaring differences, 3 great leads and a good supporting cast. Fantastic cinematography and Scott's usual masterful direction. But what really makes this movie excel is the last 15 minutes and it's titular duel.

Ridley Scott is 83 years old and needs to retire like, years and years ago. Though I know many of you enjoyed his ridiculous film The Martian from a few years back, but the heck with you people. Thinking The Martian is anymore than a silly popcorn film is an insult to your own intelligence. The worst thing about The Last Duel is the writing for sure. Though it claims to be a true story, and I'm sure there is one it was somewhat influenced by; Yet so little in the film really feels as if it is authentically portrayed. It all seems so amateur and lazily pasted together. Worst of all it tries hard to be topically trendy to most of the American liberal movements of the day. Many of the character interactions are just so ridiculous. Almost nothing at all in the film is well thought out. The different views shown make no logical sense if you really think about them. Overall in the end, the film is also incredibly pointless. Who's lying you may ask yourself, but you're more likely to ask yourself, do I even care who's lying? The way the film is put together, it really leaves you no desire to care what happened. Sure, for the real people in their time, it was important to them I'm sure, but why would it be to us considering what we are shown here? There is no reasoning in this film. It's just politicized blah junk for money. It really is completely pointless and unauthentic feeling drivel. A terrible medieval soap opera. I'd like to give a stiff middle finger to the studio and to everyone involved in bringing us this very uninspired trash.

Each character, no surprise, tells their version in such a way as to cast him or her in the best light. Not a bad idea. And it plays out pretty damn well. For a long time. Or, specifically, until the third story is told. The wife's story. The 'true story' as we are informed.Until her story we have two versions of an awful event, and the revenge that should be exacted upon The Squire who committed the offense. But as we hear and see her story unravel we realize that it is the same as the second tale; that of The Squire. We are being asked to sit through a series of events twice. Yes. In fact it appears that much of the footage is literally shown twice and from the same point of view. And if there is a difference between Versions Two and Three, that fact could have been illustrated in five or ten minutes, and not the forty-like it is given. Because the difference in versions is not one of deed, it is one of alleged intent. Was the rape intentional or was it simply ..... misunderstood.In the end there is a duel between the two men. It is, let me say, well worth waiting for. By the film's end the states have been raised, lives are in peril, and we absolutely care who wins.But at what price? For me it was worth the too-long tale.

58,christophershobris,A Return to Form,9,19 October 2021,"For Ridley Scott this is the bread and butter that seems to nicely fit his style of filmmaking. The nitty-gritty and fearless decision-making for the story from Scott as well as his colleagues Affleck and Damon who serve as screenwriters along with Nicole Holofcener who is a director herself. Combine that with a stellar performance by the blazing rising star in my eyes and is one of the best actors working right now Adam Driver, who quickly shows he can do more than just Kylo Ren. His acting range is very broad and complex and filmmakers see that. But the one I believe stood out the most and outacted everybody, is Jodie Comer. She plays a woman living in 1300 Paris when women were basically just pieces of property for the husbands to do with whatever they desired. Here, she finds herself torn between two men and the company they provide. The result is The Last Duel, a well choreographed, beautifully filmed fight between the two main characters. At the end of the fight which is ultimately the end of the film, it leaves you with a sense of unsatisfactory in a good way in that, you're not really sure if Comer's character really came away on top. The relationship between her and her husband (Damon's character) is very broken, and convoluted, which is why I say the ending is what I'm calling it ""satisfyingly unsatisfactory"" and it's why I really like the conclusion of the film, and the film as a whole. I love the way the story is chopped up into 5 different segments or chapters as it makes keeping up with the story really effective and feels well-paced. The location is good, I love films set in this time period. The story is relevant, even for today. The performance by the actors are top-notch particularly Jodie Comer. Ridley Scott impresses me again almost on par with Gladiator. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is very grounded and flows well with the story. The only issue I have is just the characteristic of Damon's character which is he's really good with horses. I thought it was a wasted, pointless thing to have in the film that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. It took away from the main story and was unfocused. Other than that, this is a great film, with great performances, great story, great direction, but also a pointless character trait. Therefore it doesn't get a 10 but does get a very strong 9.4/10. Well done Ridley Scott.",The Last Duel
59,fdbjr,Correcting the Record - Rashomon? No. 'Woke'? No.,8,19 October 2021,"I saw this movie the other night, and liked it quite a bit. The actors were very good, and the story well told and interesting. I am reviewing more to correct two misconceptions in other reviews.First, the comparison to 'Rashomon' can only be made by viewers who have never seen 'Rashomon'. That movie is an 80 minute work of genius in which the same incident is described by four different witnesses, in such a way that it is impossible to ascertain what is the truth. This movie is not that. While there are multiple narrators, the central events of the plot are not disputed. The multiple narrators do have different perspectives, reactions, and attitudes, but the reality of the events is not challenged.Second, the movie is not slanted to conform to contemporary mores ('woke'). I'd view it as a failure if it were. But the depiction of the status of women in the 14th Century seemed to me accurate, particularly in the acceptance of rape as a fact of female life, and the difficulties of credibility. The dynamic of the character played by Matt Damon, who is fiercely loyal to his wife (good), but based on a territorial imperative that most (but not all) modern women would find unacceptable, is particularly striking.All in all, a pretty good movie.",The Last Duel

I don't know how much was animated and how much wasn't, but the artists did such a great job blending environments in. Everything felt natural and like the world/century we were supposed to be in.My one downfall to this film is that it's supposed a story taking place in France and yet there's very little French connection.

Jodie Comer gives the best performance, she gives a tormented performance. Ben Affleck gives a lighthearted performance, I guess you can say he's the comic relief.The film is non-linear so the audience knows the full story. The film has three chapters, you see events through different perspectives. Several scenes are shown again like the rape scene so some people will feel restless. I think at least one scene should of been trimmed. The film is well paced but you still feel the length.The Last Duel isn't like Gladiator so don't expect a lot of action. I guess Kingdom of Heaven has plenty of action, I tried watching it twice. The action is good, its brutal. The film is a hard R mainly for sexual content in fact there's full frontal nudity. The rape scene doesn't have any full frontal nudity but it can be hard to watch.Overall, The Last Duel is a good film. Its a good allusion for the present. Even without rape, women were poorly treated back then. If you like the cast, go see it. Duel is a Fox film or a Century film so it could air on Disney+ soon.",The Last Duel

All the same, , I have a quibble: It is all about a trial by combat, not a duel. The incident portrayed is unlikely to be the final one, although it might be within a century of that. (Dueling continued well into the 19th Century). Such a single combat as in this film could only have been performed by the gladiators of a much earlier day. These high-ranking nobles pushing middle age could not possibly have been up to it.It pleased me very much to recognize Bryony Hannah, and (as usual) to fail to recognize Marton Csokas. Also, I must say that the prominence of Adam Driver, after the howlingly terrible Annette (2021), lowered my expectations. I must concede that he is well cast. Maybe it takes a stiff to play one.",The Last Duel
66,LongTimeMovieLover,"Good movie, not great.",8,16 October 2021,"First, the acting subtlety of Jodie Comer was excellent, and perhaps she'll be nominated for an award. The rest of the acting was very good. Matt Damon did a good job, but his character was not overly complex. Casting otherwise was very good. Again casting Jodie Comer was excellent; the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon thing is a bit old. Second, the story-line from three perspectives was interesting, although far less distinct in perspective than I expected. Third, the tone, set and direction are all great and should get award nominations.Also, as it seems to be generally for Ridley Scott, there is very little nudity, and where it occurs, it is distant or not the center of focus. It is no secret that the movie is centered on a rape. The rape is in-time; that is, not implied. However, although no rape is easy to watch, the scene is solely facial shots, so it is handled conservatively relatively (if that is a way to describe a rape scene); that is, without any nudity shown. The story message here is the juxtaposition of facial expressions, rather than gratuitous body parts..... By comparison, Game of Thrones/Rome/Tudors are more extreme.As to any ""political tone,"" the movie expresses the perennial points of injustice: the victim is legally incapacitated, the ""insulted"" husband has the legal standing, the system has favoritism, systemic corruption, the King is playing games with lives, God and good are expected to prevail, love is good and therefore supposed to make it okay, Evil has a self-justified perspective, etc.Overall, it kept me interested as an overall watch because it is well done overall, but it's certainly no Gladiator, Braveheart, Godfather. Being sufficiently interested and entertained is not the same as being engaged and engulfed. Sometimes the musical score will do it (think Braveheart), but not here.Set, direction, Cramer, 9.5, the rest 7.5-8. Thus, barely an 8, but not a 7. Still, 8 overall is very good, and it's a good pic for the theater.",The Last Duel
67,huntersmithx,Ridley Scott's return to the Middle Ages- crossed with Rashomon.,9,15 October 2021,"It was only a matter of time before Sir Ridley Scott, one who's traveled the world and seven seas with his cinematic art and genre crossing, returned to the Historical Epic in Medieval times. The Last Duel makes complete sense as a spiritual successor to his 2005 landmark Kingdom of Heaven, and thank luck for 2021 because it couldn't have come sooner.Kingdom of Heaven was his Crusades Epic that attempted to make sense of turn-of the century issues, political and religious. Here with The Last Duel, it's moral and social as 13th century aristocrat Marguerite de Carrouges (Marguerite de Carrouges) must gain justice for horrible deeds committed against her by Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver). Scott enchants the audience and dares them to take a side with any of the three leads via utilization of the Rashomon effect, a cinematic technique etched into history by the legendary Akira Kurosawa in his own turn-of the decade motion picture (released in 1950).The Middle Ages have never looked so sweeter and sour through the lens of Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski. The lack of sun combined with the seemingly everlasting winters and falls, muddy environments, fire, darkly lit interiors, battle sequences and especially the duels are all honed in with old-fashioned practical sets and wizardry. Several of the performances are also old-fashioned; I was never entirely sure what accent Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were employing with Jean de Carrouges and Count Pierre d'Alençon respectively, but they add to the characters more than they distract. The actors are recognizable in the best way, and can be taken with the most dire straits throughout the film. Affleck's Pierre d'Alençon borders on camp at times, but one can be sure it was likely intentional. 50s and 60s genre epic filmmaking has found ways to seep back into our modern times, and the old-fashioned filmmaking and performances combined with modern social commentary makes for the best of both worlds. Adam Driver is as sizzling as ever in his performance, both in dialogue and onscreen emotion. Young actress Jodie Comer has been making a name for herself on the big and small screen; she shall continue to do so in cinema with her award-worthy performance as Marguerite under the reign.Sir Ridley Scott has had and probably will continue to stumble and fall with his projects, but when he achieves something immaculate, it must be embraced on the most articulate theater screen possible. The Last Duel is an engaging, merciless and bold fable for our times.RATING: 3.5 out of 4 stars.",The Last Duel
68,michaelxqh,He Is Still The Man,9,18 October 2021,"Although Ridley Scott is 83, his directory on the new epic The Last Duel is an undeniable success. Despite mesmerizing scenery, well-recreated prompt, and skillful cinematography, the movie narrates a medieval rashomon from the perspectives of the litigant, the perpetrator, and the victim. If you could bare with the detailed and repetitive elaboration of the tale's various angles, you'll find the script intricately interlocking, with leads to an enticing resolution that penetrates the audience's heart. However, I feel like if the story doesn't points out the actual truth in the third chapter, the story would've been much more complicated, which fully demonstrates that ""truth doesn't matter"", as it's veiled underneath the irrational aura of human nature. Jean, domestically abusive, arrogant and narcissistic; Jacques, perfidious, lustful, and loathsome as a man. But is the Lady Marguerite truly innocent, since she lied about her relationship with her husband? In my opinion the film could've been better if the truth isn't yelled out directly from a female character's mouth, and all characters are created equally suspicious and flawed. Even if you don't enjoy time-consuming stories like The Last Duel, the acting of Jodie Comer and aesthetic topography are worth the tickets.",The Last Duel
69,CtlAltDel,It all made sense in the end,8,2 November 2021,"I was exasperated and then it all made sense.Here are some quick points:
Matt Damon does well as the oafish husband who is a dab hand with a sword if not in bed with his wife. His mullet and facial hair were off-putting though and I kept thinking it was James Hetfield from Metallica.After the first third of the film I was annoyed that every scene only seemed to last 30secs and events moved by too quickly. I felt the pacing was all wrong and wondered if it made for a 'social media audience' with limited attention span lol.I initially groaned when I saw we were going to get the story repeated from three different perspectives. Do I really have to sit through it again and again and again? But then conceded that we were being asked to find the truth and each of the three leads had different - and sometimes erroneous - versions of it. We were cast as the jury.I was angry that Ridley Scott was going to show the rape scene. Twice no less! Do I really need to see more women getting raped in film? Couldn't he just imply it? But no, by the end I saw that it made perfect sense. It was treated in such a way that SOME audience members might even had their prejudices tweaked and side with Adam Driver! Others of course will see it for exactly what it was, rape! And this prejudice is what the film examines and evokes in the audience. Clever.It was great we started to see the reactions of women towards the end. Those who were raped themselves and stayed silent. Those who didn't believe her. Those who cheered her at the end. You could almost call this a new take on the 'chick flick' genre.Adam Driver refusing to confess as he was about to be killed was perfect. Again SOME in the audience might side with him, afterall, if you believed in God and were about to die wouldn't you confess!? But no, he honestly believed he didn't rape her as so many men right up to today cannot see the crimes they commit. Perfect.And the ending with her watching her toddler in the garden. How cheesy it could have been if the child had jet black hair like Adam Driver. That would have totally ruined the film. But they didn't. Thank God!",The Last Duel
70,katiefanatic-791-306918,Now I get it.,10,28 October 2021,"When I first heard this movie had three writers, one female, it made no sense to me. Affleck and Damon had written skylar fine in 'good will hunting'. It was only during the accusation scene I understood why a female perspective was needed- a woman needed to basically explain why being nice was not an excuse for rape! I'm not really spoiling anything when I say dear men: smiling at you doesn't mean we want to bang you. Other than that it was a great film and I really enjoyed it. I was scared about the violence and nudity but found myself really getting into it, especially when the duel came. I whispered under my breath 'get him!' Multiple times. The actor who played the king reminded me of Joffrey on GOT. Very good at his job because he was a little prick but he was also young Alan Turing who I felt empathy for. Don't really have a lot more to say except it's an epic and effective movie. Also Ben affleck is hilarious.",The Last Duel
71,guskeller,"Extravagant, relevant, and unique",9,16 October 2021,"The Last Duel is a well-rounded film that hits lofty marks while being unique enough to stand out from its genre. First and foremost, Jodie Comer is magnificent for portraying her character slightly (yet thunderously) different depending on the perspective of the narrator. The remaining cast members nail their roles as well. Matt Damon, Adam Driver, and Ben Affleck deliver expectedly great work, but minor characters like Alex Lawther and Harriet Walter also provide flavor to the experience. Fortunately, this all serves an honorable script that is interesting, ambitious, and meaningful. Stories are rarely so fantastical and so relevant at the same time.Meanwhile, The Last Duel is a technical beast. Ridley Scott is known for his extravagant movies and that continues here. The production design shines as this film's greatest strength because it is exceptionally tangible and immersive. The fact that The Last Duel was actually filmed in historic French locations goes a very long way. Additionally, the sound design is rich, the cinematography is epic (utilizing motion, weather, and color tones), and the music is captivating. Truly, The Last Duel is a film without weakness that is bound to capture all audiences.Writing: 8/10

74,shawthingproductions,"Interesting take on ""the truth"".",8,15 October 2021,"Trailer recap: wife gets raped, attacker denies it and says it was consensual, husband sides with wife and challenges attacker to a duel to the death. That's it. That's the story.At nearly 3 hours long, this could have been a disaster but it is told through the eyes of the husband, the ""villain"" and the wife - each putting their own spin on the proceedings. This isn't done in court debates but by breaking the film into chapters and going back to the start of the story and following the other character. It's interesting as in one version this person says one thing ""heroic"" but, in the other version, it's the other person who says it. Lots of little things like that, which stopped it from becoming dull. You then get to see their personalities shine through.Matt Damon: cheated out of things in life over and over. Loyal to the kind.Adam Driver: hardworking, loyal to Matt Damon, falls for the wrong woman.But then Jodie's character comes in and you think - hang on - both men are tits actually. This had a knock on impact for the fight for me where - whilst I was entertained - I didn't actually care who won. I just wanted to see them kick each other in (and they really, really do).Adam and Jodie's characters had me questioning whether she really was raped. She seems to think she was in parts, but in other parts... Is there something in her eyes? Adam's character - in his version - clearly doesn't think he was and, it's clever in that you can see it from all sides.With regards to what the ""truth"" was - you'll have to go and watch the film. Honestly, you won't be disappointed. The film DOES give you an answer but, in that answer you're also left with questions.",The Last Duel

Each of the three focal characters gets their perspective and desires made entirely clear, and it makes the stakes seem all the more intense once that final battle inevitably comes. The third act is one for the ages.The film can certainly feel far too long at times, as it tells the same story three times in a row, from three different perspectives. The second third of the movie especially drags at times because of how uncomfortable it is to witness its events.Despite its pacing problems and occasional lack of focus, this movie is a truly ambitious, investing work of art.

Problem is none of those perspectives really much disagree with each other, so what's the point here? The effect is the boring experience of watching/(enduring) the same story 3 times. And the initial version's not all that interesting the 1st time around.Seems only purpose for this is as a ""me too"". But, er, yeah, woman's rights were particularly unevolved in the - 13th century. That's why it was the Medieval age.Only positive is that's it's bombed at the box office (cost over $100 mil, made $4.8 mil 1st week), so hopefully that will discourage Hollywood from making more movies like this.(An order of magnitudes better Ridley Scott ""duel"" movie is the The Duelists from the 80s, rent that instead)",The Last Duel
81,SangamYadagiri,A Good Wife in Medieval Times,9,23 October 2021,"The movie kicks off with a Knight's tale like duel (affaire d'honneur) scene (battle between two persons over a point of honor) and then slowly goes into oblivion with some typical battle scenes which initially was boring but later in the movie the momentum got caught up.This is not a typical Ridley Scott movie even though the title suggests it would be on the lines of Gladiator in the Medieval times. However, there is a nice family drama knitted in this 14th century period drama based on real events as they say.Especially, the story reminded me of Scott's hit TV series ""The Good Wife"". I liked the different versions told by different people from their perspectives and everyone says they are innocent though ultimately we don't know what actually was felt by whom as it was left for viewer's imagination.As the duel progressed, I would not know whose side I had to be on as I didn't know who's telling the truth for the truth is relative not absolute. According to the medieval law whoever wins is telling the truth and whoever dies had lied. Those were the harsh laws back then but it was what it was! It's thoroughly satisfying if one sits through the 2 and a half hour long movie.All the star cast including Matt Damon as the jealous man, Adam Driver as the sinner who committed adultery and feeling guilt, Ben Affleck as prejudiced king and Jodie Comer as the wife who is a victim of rape did a fantastic job. At the end of the movie, I got a lot of thoughts coming back on who's right and who's wrong and who felt what but, without the spoilers, as the end card says the lady has lived with prosperity and happiness - it feels very conclusively satisfying.Overall, a period drama with spectacular photography (or CGI) depicting 14th century France and a mind-bending ending!",The Last Duel

I wasn't wrong, but it was much more and certainly deeper than that. This movie is about the tragedy of a woman whose life is threatened by the arrogance and savagery of men. There are two leading male characters in this story but neither of them is a hero. One is a man of honor and the other is a man of love, but they both turned out to be nothing more than self-centered violent male chauvinists. I am sure those kinds of men were typical back in the medieval days. However, the female lead who stood against her predicament seemed different. She is like a woman of 21 century who doesn't hesitate to speak up and fight for her justice.

The second one is that I find that I don't have much to discuss about the movie. I can say, ""Good performances by Driver and Comer"", or, ""the final act was excellent"", but by the end the movie was so ""in your face"" (as they say) that it left minimal impression to me besides a silent respect for a movie well crafted.Two things before the end. First, I loved seeing a medieval-sword & shield movie on the big screen. I missed the sound of swords clanging and the sound of horses and hooves.

I've never seen Matt Damon or Adam Driver in a period piece like this. At first I didn't buy them fitting in but as the film progressed that feeling alleviated. As I got to know these characters more I began to enjoy their performances. I found everyone else here well casted, especially Jodie Comer I thought she did a great job, as she just filled the role so well, and gave a great performance. She is in my opinion the star of the film.The cinematography here was great, the battles looked real, felt real, and sounded real. The sound design was great, down to the swords, and sounds of war.The ending of this film is I think where, of those who see it would garner the most attention. As it personally left me with a lot of thoughts and emotions. Was justice truly done? Were the events portrayed on screen accurate enough to leave audience members with a truthful, and honest telling of this story? When the law of man fails, should we just put justice in the hands of God and have a duel? Would God interfere in the affairs of men?

It is astonishing to see him work and I look foreward to his future performances and the acting awards he may well earn.Matt Damon always and naturally is stellar here. While successful, I rarely hear his name mentioned among the great actors of his time. His naturalistic style causes him to almost dissappear in each of his roles and this is no exception.Jody Comer also shines in her role and Adam Driver is also awesome. While the film is not entirely compelling, it is a good movie, not great. It lacks sublety and does not build suspense. It often tells, instead of showing us the story. Neither does the story invest to build its romance nor friendships. This is a problem because it leaves the audience similarly emotionally uninvested.

91,blatherskitenoir,"A rape movie that is, oddly, not about rape at all",7,8 November 2021,"First off: the sets and costuming are every medieval history buffs dream (they use rivet mail, not chain mail!). And the seemingly odd choice to cast Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in historical roles weirdly works. It makes the people in the film feel very normal, like history was filled with the regular people you interact with in your everyday modern life, rather than super serious and grave Historical Figures.That out of the way: the film is shown in a tryptic style, with events shown from three different view points. Each person experiences and interprets the same events in a slightly different manner, making the viewer wonder about the nature of Truth.A good example of this is a reconciliation at a party, where the two men make up, the wife offers a kiss of peace, and someone throws out an inspirational one liner about the king. Each man remembers saying the inspiring line themselves, while the wife recalls the party host saying it, and the nature of the kiss changes from neutral to ""she wants me"" to ""he wants me"" depending on who is recounting the moment.These minor differences cause the viewer to ponder and question just what exactly is the nature of Truth.Now, the movie takes the interesting choice of making it very obvious that the rape happened. Le Gris and Margerite both recall the sex, so it 100% happened. Le Gris may have thought Margerite was being playful, but rape is one of those things where only one person has to view it as rape for it to unquestionably be rape, so if Margerite experienced it as rape, then it was.I believe this is the movie's downfall. The more obvious choice to take would have been if Le Gris and Margarite's accounts were completely different, as they were in the historical accounts of the trial, leaving the truth as a mystery left up to the audience to decide. Le Gris's main defense was that he had witnesses placing him 50 miles away and the the round trip would have been impossible to accomplish on horseback within the time frame, and that Carrouges forced his wife to fake testimony for financial gain, since he stood to receive most of Le Gris's property if he won the duel. This is left out, and there is no doubt the sex happened.But by making us certain the rape happened, suddenly, the film is not about the rape at all. That ceases to be it's focus. Rather, now it's about how all three humans are unable to see the entirety of The Truth, and instead have their own versions and experiences of it. And what is The Truth, really? The average of the shared experiences, or something we can get close to viewing, but never fulling see?The rape may have happened, but now we must doubt the other things Margerite experienced. (Failure to do so would sexistly suggest that women have the sole power of perceiving the reality of things)Is her husband really as boorish and harsh as she shows? From his point of view, he is doting, indulgent, and cherishes her. Is absolutely everyone constantly bothering her over her lack of a baby? Or does it just seem that way because Margerite is overly occupied with it? Is she really the adored, benevolent, and skilled steward of her husband's lands, or is she fooling herself? The wives of the powerful men running her trial sneak her concerned, knowing looks, are these real or imagined? There's a scene where she tells a stable master to go against her husband's instructions--is the man really as grateful to her and in acknowledgement of her good judgement as we see...or is this Margerite's imaginings, and really the servant resents her putting him in this position and he's appeasing her? Margerite views her post-duel husband as going on a triumphant parade through the crowds, happily stealing the lime light for himself. But, he just received a near-fatal wound to the inner thigh, surely he can't be enjoying that horse ride.It's a very subtle thing the director is wanting us to think about, which I don't think any viewers go into the movie to contemplate. They are watching for medieval violence and a bit of voyeurism, not contemplating the reality of perception. Sometimes, the obvious choice isn't the wrong one, and this movie likely would have been more popular and successful if it had made the more conventional choice of a did-he-or-didn't-he film which could have sparked viewer debate and discussion.",The Last Duel
92,JackCowart34,"Slightly disappointed, but I also expected Perfection.",7,15 October 2021,"This is a movie that I have been looking forward to for the past 2 years at least, and I saw it last night on opening night at my local theatre. I'm just gonna start off bluntly and say that it wasn't as good as I expected, and I try to have modest expectations for movies. It's just hard to do when it's being directed by Ridley Scott, and written by Affleck and Damon. There were a few very strong aspects to this film that I thoroughly enjoyed. The first is the acting, they were all good, but Comer and Affleck were outstanding in there respective roles. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see one, or both of them get considered for an Oscar when it's all said and done with. The second best part of the film had to be the intense and riveting battle sequences. They were very well choreographed, expertly filmed, and surprisingly gory holding almost nothing back. The final fight between Jacques Le Gris and Jean de Carrouges was worth the price of admission on its own. This movie really only had one flaw, although it was a big one. It was extremely repetitive. I understand what they were trying to do showing the same situations from different peoples perspectives. But it just seems pointless to do that when each of there perspectives showed basically the same thing. In all honesty this movie could've been an hour shorter, and much better if they utilized a linear storyline.

93,nlsteven-attheMovies,An Uphill Battle,6,1 November 2021,"The Last Duel features an intense duel scene and an Oscar-calibre cast and crew. The film's highlight is the final duel scene, which recalls Ridley Scott's brilliant work on Gladiator. Adam Driver and Jodie Comer deliver Oscar-worthy performances while cinematographer Darius Wolski's location shots of the French and Irish landscapes are breathtaking, although disturbingly darkly-lit. The film's biggest letdown is its screenplay, which tells the rape story in three alternative versions, rendering the film repetitive and slow-moving.

99,trav123,A big Midevil MeToo Gamble - a bit trite yet entertaining,6,18 October 2021,The directing is very well done like all of Ridley Scotts films yet as much as I tried to like this film's story it is hard to imagine the MeToo being shoved down our seats. And it was laughable to see a blond Ben Affleck who looked more pathetic than if he were to play Hamlet and not a big stretch to see him play a drunk rich bafoon.Matt Damon also seems way out of place yet holds his own esp in the battle scenes and Adam Driver does a decent job but the lady of the film that takes the helm is Margeuerite played by. Jodie Comer. Truly a fantastic acting job that carries the entire film.Otherwise it is a huge undertaking and risk to try to spend and possibly waste a huge hollywood budget on such a 13th century Harvey Weinstein MeToo movement piece and told by 3 different perspectives that many might find less entertaining and preachy. Plus it explains why it has failed at the box office as few people want to waste their time venturing to a theatre during Covid to see this type of agenda film - regardless of its merits. The truth is that we want good entertainment and less politics/agenda.A solid 6 and sure hope that Ridley next film House of Gucci is not a house of duds.,The Last Duel
100,finn9849,A cold supper that echoes the horrors of our species.,7,15 October 2021,"First of all, Ridley Scott does a fantastic job setting the tone of the movie. The costumes and sets are phenomenal. A million times better than Green Knight and Netflix's The Witcher. The acting is decent, BUT, I wish the editing of perspectives and early battle scenes could've been tonned up a bit. For the battles specifically, they felt like they ended too soon, and we didn't get enough wide shots to see the whole entirety of the action. That, and the switch between characters should've been more different, to keep more things in the dark so that way the final act would become much more of a shock, and though I'm trying to be as vague as possible rn, I will fully say this movie deserves points for getting the cold reality of what women lived through during these times. And for the guys crying about it being a cheap sense of wokeness, grow up. The medieval genre has admittedly become glamorized, but as a whole, the movie itself has a lot of things to enjoy despite the dark themes, and at the same time, it could still improve in a lot of ways.",The Last Duel

102,ajwhite-99150,Best Movie in 2 Years,7,21 October 2021,"I haven't been to the cinema in two years, and this film welcomed me back to a beloved pastime. The Last Duel is based on the true story of two French soldiers being granted permission from the king to duel over rape allegations. This was a well-documented event because dueling had been outlawed and the soldiers were fairly well known. The movie stays relatively true to the lives of these characters, and what led up to the duel... for the most part. The story is essentially told three different ways by the three main characters.This is a modern adaptation of a historical occurrence, so liberties to be taken with the story is par for the course, but the major detraction from what was actually recorded is that we still don't know if the rape happened. All we have to go on is Marguerite's testimony and Jacques le Gris's denial. The movie makes it perfectly clear what happened; twice. That was a misstep in my opinion, not because it added a layer that doesn't actually exist, but because the ambiguity makes the story more interesting, and is part of the reason why it is so captivating. The true events may very well have transpired similarly to what's portrayed in the film, but another possibility is that after years of bitterness and mistreatment, Jean and his wife Marguerite came up with a plan to get their title and land back from Le Gris after he wrongfully acquired it by accusing him of rape and challenging him to a duel.The cinematography was great, and the actors did a fine job with their roles, particularly Adam Driver and Jodie Comer. It seemed like they all understood who they were trying to be instead of simply reading lines... some actual French actors would've been nice though. Having said that, the movie felt overlong and could've used some tighter editing. With a title like The Last Duel one would think more focus would be on the actual duel. It was definitely exciting, but compared to the book, which was extremely detailed, it fell a bit flat. Cutting some of the earlier battle scenes, which weren't needed for the plot, and trimming some of Marguerite's telling of the tale, since that was largely fabricated anyway. I enjoyed her part of the story very much, but hers should've been the only point of view where we see what happens, and when it begins the title shot lingers on ""the truth"" a couple extra seconds, indicating hers is the only one that matters.Overall I think this is a good film that could've been great with a couple small tweaks toward the source material. Having said that, I encourage all who are intrigued by the write-up to watch it. Cheers!",The Last Duel

Back in that time, we were thought of as property and some folks don't realize this.The story takes three voices: the two male and one female involved and it shows you the twist of how the truth is distorted by whom is telling the tale.

However, the film was very enjoyable overall, and the end just tops it up, a proper climactic ending.The music was beautiful too.I loved it, it is understandable why some people hated it when they were expecting another Gladiator, which it isn't even close to it, but it was rather an enjoyable and interesting take on a true story.",The Last Duel

The Damon character perceiving the Driver character as a sycophant, the Driver character truly thinking he was innocent, and the wife believing she was violated. Each person from their own perspective was righteous. Each tells their own story as they see it.

He deserves an Oscar for his role.Ridley doesn't only still got the moves, he can also nuance cinematography so it feels original. Sure, there are plenty of movies with similar plots where men fight over women for their name and honor, but this finally has a feminist point of view thanks to Marguerite de Carrouges. It's fresh and up to date with the sad fact that barely anything has changed during 650 years.And the duel itself is one of the greatest fight scenes I've seen with original and intense choreography where you really can feel the stakes just like you did in Game of Thrones.",The Last Duel

-the movie is long and it feels long,
-the acting is mediocre,
-the soundtrack is bland,

However, I must say that even though the story starts off pretty promising, it somewhat gets muddled. For me it was because I couldn't completely understand the wants and needs of Jean and Marguerite. Jacques and Pierre was pretty clear in that sense. Due to stellar acting and directing, nothing felt like a repetition in telling of the same events from different perspectives. I've seen movies where it was done before, and this was a very good example. The technique of telling the same story from the perspective of the person telling the story is really well used, meaning that it is pretty clear how each character sees the other. This change of characters makes the story engaging, but it also left me wondering what type of a person Jean really was as he was drastically different in all of the three perspectives. I'll do some reading on him. I also think that they could've played with that idea a bit more especially during the climax but the climax sequence was so good that I can't complain. Definitely worth watching.",The Last Duel

115,iizjfkt,Strange decisions,6,23 October 2021,"The decision to retell the same story 3 times is only justifiable if meant to show how 2 very different personalities color the world around them, but then the third version (being the ""truth"") is pointless considering we had all the relevant facts we needed after the second. At that point any new scenes just served to make us hate the cartoonishly evil people surrounding the protagonist which came off more like a political agenda than a compelling story with grey areas. We're left not allowed to make up our own minds even about the inconsequential details surrounding the main incident.And the main scene showing the crime is given to us twice why? Her protesting was enough the first time for any decent person to understand the evil without having to sit through such an already depressing and painful scene twice. At that point it almost felt like exploitation of the actress to make her film it more than once, thus hurting the original stated point of the film.I don't know whose mind was meant to be changed with this film, sadly this was clearly the point. There was no mystery or guessing to it. They just showed a terrible act and painted everything else in black and white, actually hurting the message of the film because now people will walk away thinking a rapist has no capacity for trickery or charm.The very fact that the movie thinks the word ""no"" only means anything when screamed and cried, yes that's what it's really telling us even though its intention was the opposite, and that they thought people would only see that it was indeed a rape by showing us the same scene twice but the second time said with gusto is also disappointing.",The Last Duel

+ Entertaining & fascinating real story, that led to a brutal medieval duel between two former friends.+ Nailed the medieval atmosphere. Scott's best medieval film since Kingdom of Heaven.+ As a French speaker, I was not bothered by the English (for a story set in France), this speaks to the quality of the acting.+ Standout performances, especially by Jodie Cormer.+ The namesake duel is incredibly brutal and visceral, and a great climax to the film.Minus points
Be prepared for disturbing brutality. Incredibly violent combat scenes (especially the last duel), and the eponymous rape scene which is repeated twice in the film. Props to the acting however.A feminist point is injected into this film. Whilst women in medieval Europe surely had troubles, it is questionable whether it is accurate to inject an anachronism like this into 14th century France. Ridley Scott injected modern themes into Kingdom of Heaven too, which distracted from the film. Ridley Scott basically makes the point that ""men are evil and only care about their pride"", and ""women are smarter and victims of men's brutality"". This is a very large generalisation of a time period. Ridley Scott also throws mud on the Church and generalises about it, even making a hint about homosexuality/paedophilia.Did not like the inclusion of Ben Affleck in this film. Bleached blonde hair and modern mannerism, he just isn't the right fit to play a medieval French lord.Matt Damon as Jean the Carrouges isn't as bad as Ben Affleck, since he plays a simpleton. However, I do feel that Matt Damon doesn't nearly have the pedigree to play a medieval French Knight, who is still a noble.Conclusion: A brutal, hard hitting, medieval French film, with great acting performances.It is not every day that we get a historical medieval film, and this was excellent.",The Last Duel

120,theashcritique,"""How the truth is told since day 1""",8,7 November 2021,"Personal opinion
I was concerned at the beginning that it was going be a long detailed boring history story, but the film surprised me with its course and how he took such a small event and narrated it in a very unique way where he decided to tell you the story three times from everyone's point of view. So the movie is divided into three #chapters with almost the same events but from different sides of the story. Even though the story is repeated three times, its very real and very interesting how each one drops details and focuses on others, which has happened almost everyday since humanity started, and its very annoying how true this could be. The Directing and cinematography were on point. I believe this is an amazing experience in a very new way. The story starts and ends with the same scene. What I didn't like about the movie is the combat where he took very close shots which irritated the viewer and made you lose the enjoyment of the combat.Amazing performance by the rising star Adam Driver, who looks exactly like he belong in this era; He is also doing another Ridley Scott film this november 'House of Gucci'. As usual, Matt Damon played the character so perfectly that when you see him from his own truth how loving and caring he is, and then you see his wife's opinion, you will be surprised that this is actually the same character.It is a long film, but totally worth every minute, specially since this is a very touching matter about free rape that has been happening since forever, perfect embroidery of the feminist case, and how people should be supportive of every woman in need, and none should go unnoticed.",The Last Duel

122,alibaba3317,Ridley Scott doing Ridley Scott things again,8,15 October 2021,"I headed into The Last Duel with a cautious but optimistic mindset. Ridley has unfortunately been somewhat inconsistent as of late. More often than not, the issue isn't Scott's finesse as a visual interpreter, but his ability in picking good scripts. I was delighted to find out that this was not the case, as I hold this as one of 2021's stronger pictures, much to the writers' credit.The movie has an interesting, split narrative, told in three chapters from three viewpoints. It's a surprisingly captivating and dynamic approach, without falling into repetitiveness. A lot of this has to do with the clever script, but also director Ridley Scott's skill at staging shots. They're framed differently, edited differently and acted differently. The change in lens and mood is a testament to cinematographer Dariusz Wolski's expertise as well as Scott's.Ben, Matt and Nicole have written a temporary story with modern resonance; the politics are ancient, but fundamentally, it feels contemporary. The spoken dialogue in The Last Duel invokes an older time period, more so than it actually is.Technically, it's a Ridley Scott movie; what can you say? He's a master at creating crisp imagery, filled with texture and haze. The action here is violent and grotesque, yet beautiful and quick. His eye for aesthetics is impeccable, demonstrated in costume and set design. The audio mix is very strong, blending Harry Gregson-Williams' excellent score with a veracious sound design.The casting here is spot on. Adam Driver as Jacques Le Gris has a strange, muscular presence, radiating charisma while simultaneously being brutally unhinged. Jodie Comer as Marguerite de Carrouges is truthfully courageous and emotional; her performance is empowering without feeling burlesque.As the title suggests, the final duel is fiercely intense. It's gnarly, visceral and savagely distressful.At 152 minutes, the picture is undoubtedly long. The narrative might feel tedious to some and the overall tone is unflinchingly vile.",The Last Duel

132,samishoward,A Must-See on the Big Screen,10,20 October 2021,"It's breaking my heart that The Last Duel is doing poorly at the box office because in my mind it is without a doubt the best film of the year. Just truly excellent filmmaking with vision and originality in spades. It employs the Rashomon effect with fascinating results. The cinematography, editing, and costume design are stunning. The score is superb.The performances are excellent all around. I see a lot of people saying Ben Affleck's performance steals the show and a lot of excitement around Adam Driver because of his huge fanbase. I love those actors as much as the next person, but I feel Jodie Comer and Matt Damon's nuanced work is the heart of the film and they deserve more love. Both deliver awards worthy performances and they show the most range across the three parts. I think it's the best work of Damon's career and he is singularly suited to the role, tapping into numerous shades of characterization that are something to behold. And if together Damon and Comer are the heart, then Jodie Comer alone is The Last Duel's soul. She is truly phenomenal, grounding this sprawling story with her inspired choices and emotional resonance.The medieval setting feels so authentic, gritty, and fully realized. And the message of this film is both timeless and timely, universal and harrowingly intimate. It takes a long sharp look at gender politics, rape culture, and toxic masculinity, dissecting these topics with scalpel level precision even as the storytelling momentum never lets up. Despite its length, there is never a dull moment. The battle scenes are unbelievably realistic, transporting you to war-torn France and Scotland. The climax of the film is one of the most visceral and suspenseful I've ever seen.The Last Duel demands to be seen on the big screen to get the full sense of this historical epic's artistry and scale. One of the best period piece films in a long time, this one will appeal to fans of Barry Lyndon and Gladiator. I could even see it being a good discussion companion to Promising Young Woman (my favorite film of 2020), in its handling of topics relevant to #MeToo. If you long to be swept up in a classic cinematic experience and you don't want to see movie theaters become a thing of the past, don't let this one flop.

The way the movie is divided into chapters giving each main character's point of view is genius for a story like this. The holes in the stories of each characers (except for the the last) adds a bit of an unreliable narrative/ ambiguity to the story. While the movie is not action packed, it does not need to be. The final duel provides major tension that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Not to mention the locations in this movie. You truly feel like you're in this time period, and the immersion doesn't break once throughout the films runtime. Overall this movie is great and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.",The Last Duel
135,tmcmaster-67512,The Last Duel,5,20 October 2021,"I love Ridley Scott. Grew up on all of his earlier films & im sad to say as of late he is in his decline as a filmmaker. I'll start by saying I like the way this film is structured. I like the chapters and how each chapter is a different characters point of view. That being said the performances in this film are awful. All 4 ""main actors"" are giving nothing to this film. They have American accents (Damon, Affleck & Driver) in Europe?I was surprised to see Affleck and Damon got back together to write for the first time since Good Will Hunting and it made me excited to see this. But as I liked the structure, the actually words coming out of everyone's mouth is straight out of 2020 and not believable what so ever for time period.Back to the performances, the only actor to show any kind of real range was Jodie Comer. Despite not giving the best performance ever, she does almost save this film from being a complete disaster.Now i don't know who's idea is was to show a rape scene in full twice but it really took me out of the movie. The first time is happens it's a full on rape & this is from Driver's perspective which if he's remembering this way why is he picturing himself raping her? Then the second time they show it it's from Comers perspective and it's the exact same scene only a touch more violent. Either way he didn't need to see it twice in a 2 and half hour movie & if we did the first one should've been a consensual act. At least for some kind of drama to persuade the audience to believe Drivers character is telling the truth. Instead we still have an hour left and already know the truth of the situation.As for the end, it is the best part of the film, ya know when they actually duel. Ridley Scott can still direct a big budget film like no body else. But at the same time I felt nothing afterwards. I felt bad for no one. I felt no passion from any of the actors. It was just a complete bore. If not for Ridley Scott's great direction and world building and Comer's somewhat committed performance this would be a far worse film. Not sure I'd recommend it but if you like Ridley Scott give it a look.",The Last Duel
136,tommydougherty,"Great Story, Even Better Acting",9,20 October 2021,"I really enjoyed this film. It starts with an accusation and you get to relive the story from 3 different perspectives up until the conclusion at the end. It takes place at the end of the Middle Ages and is based on a true story. The writing is really good, it does a great job of drip feeding information about all the characters. Giving you just enough information to make a decision and then change your mind. The acting is phenomenal and everyone does a great job portraying their characters, especially Jodie Comer, phenomenal job there. 100% recommend this film to most people especially if they like films set in this time period.",The Last Duel

I want to start off by saying this is a hard movie to watch, because it's brutal in its truth. With out giving anything away here, I think the 3 main performance are incredible. Especially Jodie Comer! I think she's oscar worthy here. This a minor complaint, but the first act is weak but picks up near the 2nd.",The Last Duel
138,xfilesfannumber,Not as political as some people think,9,15 October 2021,"SPOILER
I think some people have made this movie way more political than its intended to be. One femal called it hyper-masculine. Ummmm... its pretty accurate to what actually happened. Telling history how it was isn't an attack on women. Also the males in the movie weren't exactly great guys. Damon's character wasn't awful, but he wasn't great either. That same critic also complained that the movie only has one female perspective and two male ones. Why???? It has the persepctive of the 3 main people involved, not because of their gender. Also, the ONE WOMAN'S perspective ended up being the RIGHT ONE. Not every modern movie with straight white male characters is an attack on women.On the flip side, some user reviews call this movie woke feminist trash. Also not true. While the woman was right, and the men weren't morally great, there is some doubt cast upon the woman. But also, like I mentioned earlier, the movie is pretty accurate. Its not woke and feminist to tell history happened. History is not ""woke"" nor ""hyper-masculine."" History does not care about the gender of its participants.Another point against the movie being ""feminist lies"" is that Damon's character was not completely awful. He fought for justice, and while its hinted he did this more for pride than for his wife, he still did what should have been done. He was a hardened soldier. That is going to make anyone a little cruel and non-affectionate.His biggest mistake was choking his wife when she fitst told him she was raped. He should have handled it with more compassion and grace. However, imagine the shock upon discovering your wife was raped by a former close friend.Then again he did pressure her into sex afterwards, saying he should be the last to know his wife. That was awful, no excuse for that.My point is, the movie is neither ""feminist"" not ""hyper-masculine."" Its history how it was, and frankly people need to grow a pair and stop trying to find ways to be offended by it.Awesome movie, a bit to much sexual scenes for me, but otherwise great, well acted, good visuals, and engaging.",The Last Duel

141,reidandersmay,Period Adultery Drama with Shaky Camera Action Moments,4,29 October 2021,"This film seemed to drag on and have nothing of consequence to reveal aside from fabricated testosterone and overhyped vegetable crushing sound effects during battle scenes. Dipping in and out of French language and accents, most of the acting was dry, like the superstars were just putting on armor, throwing a little mud and blood around, and playing themselves. Maybe Matt Damon stuck out a little more. It's possibly a realistic representation of class dynamics and living during the time, but I just couldn't seem to care. It's a period adultery drama with some too-shaky-camera action moments. Nice costumes and sets though!",The Last Duel

So kudos to seeing him and Matt Damon still arguing on screen.",The Last Duel
145,parksiet,An excellent historical epic,8,16 October 2021,"This movie is Ridley Scott's best in years. It's an extremely impressive, visceral and relentless historical epic, fitting in with other such as Gladiator or Braveheart! What really makes it stand out is the timely and very important discussions the film has regarding topics of sexual assault and rape. It's a brilliant, relevant and difficult commentary on how society responds to sexual assault claims, and the problems that victims are faced with. It's incredibly saddening to realize that these issues happening in the 1300s are no different today, and I respect Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for taking on this complex and important subject matter. Credit really has to be given to Nicole Holofcener though, she came in and really made sure the script dealt with the topics and themes in appropriate, yet striking and impactful ways. It's a hard watch and highlights the terrible ways that society treats victims of sexual assault, from disbelief to even punishing them. It shows how society makes it very difficult for victims to come forward and tell people what happened. However I think it's an important and relevant topic to cover and makes us reflect on current trends in society and what we can do to end this kind of treatment; a very interesting medieval epic in the age of MeToo. The film is a grand scale search for the truth, and it's brilliantly written. I was excited to see Ben Affleck and Matt Damon teaming up again, not only starring but writing as well and wow did they ever do a good job with both sides! I thought the script was really well done, and loved the format of the three chapters detailing the events from three different perspectives. I thought it was brilliant in how it slowly pulled back the curtain, revealing the truth by the end. Getting to revisit all the different sequences was good (however some were very hard to rewatch), and I loved how the performances slightly changed depending on who's perspective we were seeing the story from. It was a really engaging way of telling the story and allowed the audience to construct the truth in their head as we watched! It worked phenomenally for this movie, truly one of the best scripts of 2021. And the acting in this movie is absolutely phenomenal, everyone delivers some of their best work, and the movie really does feature the best performance of the year so far with Jodie Comer! She is brilliant in the film, able to communicate so much with just a look of her eyes or a facial expression. We feel her struggle and pain; she is what the audience is really able to connect to in the story. Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Adam Driver are also all fantastic and take risks with their performances, but it's really Jodie Comer who knocks it out of the park. Ridley Scott delivers his best work in a long time here, he comes back in full force and bringing back this gritty realism of war in medieval times as well as the brutality of it all. The action is also extremely intense and brutal... the titular duel at the end was truly the most violent and thrilling sequence I've seen on film in awhile. Every hit was shocking and I found myself gasping by the end - it's excellently staged and uses the context of the story before it to heighten the tension so well. The film also has excellent production design and costuming, just top notch production value. Sound design and cinematography are perfect too, everything makes you feel like you really were transported into the past. Scott brings every element together so strikingly well to create one of the most well made films of 2021. It's truly an excellent film, but an uncomfortable and tough watch due to its subject matter. But because it is an important and impactful watch, with some stunning performances and excellent filmmaking, I highly recommend this one.",The Last Duel
146,hristogbalabanov,Probably the best I saw in the last half an year.,9,15 October 2021,"The acting is good if a little stiff at times, the sets are great. It does a good job of pulling one in. The movie is very lengthily, it is so because it presents the story from the point of view of all three main characters, one after the other before concluding in the duel.Near the end, you begin to feel the length, but I at least did not find it boring, for each point of view brought new events to light, with sometimes (often times) conflicting recollections. There were some disturbing scenes, but they serve a purpose and it all leads to you been invested heavily and feeling the weight of the duel. Some found this movie to be preachy on modern issues, but I felt no such thing.I genuinely recommend the movie, but do buy a double set of popcorn and soda before going in.",The Last Duel
147,b-app,The last (duel views),7,27 October 2021,"Overall a good movie and kept me interested most of the time. Definitely a dramatic movie more than an action flick, although the last fight scene is well worth the wait. A what feels like very realistic and brutal fight at the climax of the movie is what held it all together. The fact that this is based on a true story was a great compliment to the movie. The scenery and accuracy of the times was really fun to see. My complaint would be that because of the story being told from different points of view the whole movie... it's hard to actually know what is true. They all have such different accounts of what happened. Adam Driver had the best performance in this movie for sure. Kinda weird to me that Matt and Ben chose a movie like this to finally do together... could have chosen a way better avenue of a collab.

What I got was a feminist drama that I did not see coming.The film overall was good, I'm just annoyed that they purposefully mislead you with the marketing to try and reel in a wider audience.

152,rock_bustin,The One Question Never Truly Answered,8,28 October 2021,"First off, this movie is VERY good! Ridley Scott as a Director is always worth the price of admission and I admit he's not getting any younger, so I would not let this chance to see Ridley, in theatres, and as director rather than producer slip away. The film is structured around the idea of 3 people, each giving us their version of what happened after a coercive and fairly brutal rape (as claimed). If this sounds like it steals a beat from ""Rashomon,"" you're right. That's one reason I gave the movie a 8 instead of a 9. Nine would be for the superb photography, sets, costumes, and direction. Ridley portrays medieval combat not as chivalrous and rule-bound, but as shockingly brutal and bloody - and done mostly for the profit of a few. IOW, correctly. The volume is obviously cranked up in these scenes so you hear every smash and clang to leave your ears almost ringing. Again, correctly we assume.But the real meat of the movie concerns the charges leveled by the Matt Damon's Sir Corrouges (sp?) against the charmingly vile Squire le Gris. We are given 3 versions: ""The Story according to,..."" first the knight, then the squire. The wife's version is given as ""The Truth."" Each version is graphically re-enacted. All the principles show great acting skills by how they must each alter their characters from version to version. Excellent work!So, what is the question that is never really answered?(SPOILERS!)
From the knight Matt Damon we see him portray himself as noble and devoted and consumed to achieve justice for his assaulted spouse in Mortal Combat. From squire le Gris we get what seems a pretty convincing tale of seduction and romance, not rape. But from the wife, we see the insidious, leering le Gris brutally assault her, only to have her husband distrust her story while complaining how this is such a blow *to himself*. In the end it comes to the duel with the rough and selfish knight savagely avenging himself upon le Gris - and all nice and legal. However, what is never answered in the film (at least plainly) is whether this was all a subtle play - by the wife. Say wha?You see, at 1st she believes there's a duel; 1 wins, 1 loses, and that's that. She looks shocked when she first learns that the price of her husband's failure will not only be HIS death by duel, BUT also HER death by burning at the stake! ""Why didn't you tell me of this before?!"" she protests to her husband. Yet it was she who first broached the crime to her husband shortly after he returned from yet another war. Also not shown when the complaint was 1st made was that she was pregnant! Therefore, a real possibility for her behavior is this: Bring a charge of rape, real or otherwise, If her husband dies, she inherits and lives comfortably with her maternal ""duties"" complete in a life of ease. If her husband wins, she is avenged (if it was rape), her honor is upheld (if she was being randy) and the husband who has not been able to father a child after 5 years will have the heir he seeks. Get it? The movie ends without ever posing this question.A very interesting character in the film is the Count Pierre, excellently played by Ben Affleck, He constantly eggs on the wanton behavior of the squire as his BFF for fun. He sorely regrets the duel must go on as law dictates and clearly wishes otherwise. But in the end, the count merely shrugs his shoulders, turns his back, and walks away from the squire's mangled corpse. He knows when he's been out-played.",The Last Duel

156,poyerd,Not good... unfortunately.,1,18 October 2021,"There was so much potential here and I feel like it was wasted. Retelling the story three different ways while even including body language and perspective changes was a brilliant move. Somehow, still, I found myself wanting to leave the theater multiple times. Showing the rape scene twice at full length was very unnecessary and uncomfortable. I know they probably did it for that exact reason- to make people uncomfortable but because the story wasn't well told and the characters (other than Jodie Comer) weren't believable it was more uncomfortable than necessary. It was also very long. Not only was the rape scene long but the movie was too... and you could feel it. About half way through the movie you start to not even care about the outcome. For a Ridley Scott film with such an all star cast this is a major disappointment. Of all of the stories throughout history I wonder why they chose this one... ohh... it gets super political which I wouldn't mind but it was so poorly presented that it felt entirely unrealistic for that time in history. I think they spent more time brainstorming the political/social statements they wanted to make than they did writing the plot. Save yourself almost 3 hours of your time and find something else to do/watch.",The Last Duel

158,emiraktel-2710,Ridley Scott is the Master of this Genre for a reason,9,17 September 2021,"After Good Will Hunting I was shocked why Ben Affleck and Matt Damon didn't write any screenplay together. Well, our wait is over because they have done a brave move, but this time it doesn't have that Hollywood storytelling vibe on it. This time, it is more experimental and different, they went for a new storytelling wave. (with help of Nicole Holofcener)
Best director you can find for this kind of visual storytelling is Ridley Scott, and believe me, he's still top of his game. To be honest I don't think that Gladiator was a best picture because of Ridley's effort, I think it was Russel's incredible performance. But this movie shines because of Ridley's awesome visual style.To talk about performances in this movie, Jodie has the lead, she can get awards buzz after this film. She plays her character from different perspectives, it is not an easy thing to do but Jodie does it beautifuly. Matt Damon makes his mark, after Ben Affleck's drop from the other lead role Adam Diver tooks it and I got to say it is an impressive casting, because, as a antagonist Adam has that villain look real good. Ben Affleck steals the show everytime he is on the screen, just like in Good Will Hunting his side character is real fun to watch.Overall it is really a brave movie, Hollywood doesn't make these kinds of movies, but they should make these kinds of auteur movies more...",The Last Duel

162,silviazamboni-16193,Great return of Ridley Scott,9,24 October 2021,"""The Last Duel"" is perhaps Ridley Scott's best film since the years of ""Gladiator"".Yet, be careful: if you expect the same atmosphere and epic tone, you'll be doubtlessly disappointed. In fact in spite of the title, fight scenes are definitely not the most relevant ones in this film. On the contrary, it is the refined psychological investigation of the three main characters (excellently interpreted by Matt Damon, Adam Driver and Jodie Comer) what you should take into consideration to fairly praise this film.Scott depicts a story told by three different perspectives. The viewers have to watch this movie actively to be able to recognize and to appreciate the details which reveal the characters' own points of view. Crucially, these details also make the attentive viewers doubt the reliability of what they see.""The Last Duel"" is not a banal representation of good characters fighting against bad ones: all is based upon an ambiguous (un)certainty and upon the different perspectives from which the same events are lived by the three protagonists.Scott's latest film spurs us on to reflect on the perception everyone has of him- or herself and of the other, rather than on the discovery of truth. Nevertheless, the final message is absolutely clear: there is only one truth but the way in which it is demonstrated is accompanied by inevitable bitterness.In the concluding scenes, the film does not relent: despite the faint hope it evokes, ""The Last Duel"" doesn't reassure its viewers. In Marguerite's eyes we recognize the pain and, at the same time, the dignity of abused women of every country and of every time.",The Last Duel

168,raven-11881,The Last Duel - An extremely authentic historical film,9,25 October 2021,"Now I still had the opportunity to watch ""The Last Duel"" in the cinema. I had to drive 60 km extra for it, but the film was worth it to me! I have definitely not regretted it, the cinema visit was worth every single kilometer and every cent!Actors / Dialogues / Storyline / Logic:Warning, slight spoilers in the following paragraph:The plot of ""The Last Duel"" takes place in France in Normandy between 1370 and 1387 and is based on true events. The linchpin is knight Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), his wife Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Cormer) and squire Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver). Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris, actually close friends, become more and more enemies in the course of the plot, for which Count Pierre d'Alençon (Ben Affleck) is also partly responsible, who always gives Jacques Le Gris preferential treatment and presents him with gifts in the form of titles and lands that would actually have been due to Jean de Carrouges. Jacques Le Gris, however, loves his life of wealth and influence so much that one day he desires Marguerite de Carrouges and, during her husband's absence, enters her estate and rapes her against her will. This ultimately leads to the last duel to the death before God ever fought in France. The winner told the truth, the loser lied. In the event of Jean de Carrouges' defeat and death, his wife Marguerite would be burned alive....The film tells the action from 1370 to 1387 from the points of view of all three main characters. I really liked this way of telling the story. From each point of view, the events are slightly different, each of the characters has a different memory of the events to some extent, which means that the differences are often only present in nuances. However, if you now think that the film would tell the same plot three times, you are only partially right, because the film manages to show the overlapped scenes often differently with different camera angles and slightly different dialogues, and also offers many scenes that could not be seen in the respective other memories. As a result, despite the same storylines, the film still feels very varied and remains very exciting until the very end, right up until the duel.The actors all play their roles extremely credible and authentic. I really buy everyone's role.Matt Damon shows a completely new side here and plays an honest, but also very stubborn and sometimes irascible knight, to whom above all his own honor and pride are important and who needs recognition and appreciation, without which he can become quite irascible. Damon's acting deserves absolute recognition, as he is convincing on every emotional level.Adam Driver plays here the funny and humorous, but also ambitious and pompous squire / nobleman, who likes to share the bed with many women and who believes he owns everything he wants. He is a liar before the Lord. Driver also plays his role exceedingly convincingly.Jodie Cormer also plays the wife and victim with a lot of emotion and commitment.Ben Affleck is also convincing all along the line as Count Pierre d'Alençon. He is a lazy drunk who prefers to surround himself only with his women and his wine and who does not give a damn about honor or sense of duty and to whom only his money and his pleasures mean anything.Setting / Equipment / Costumes / German dubbing:The setting of the Middle Ages is excellently captured and portrayed here. Everything looks extremely authentic and convincing. The clothes and armor look extremely real, and I also love that the dressing and armoring are shown here several times in great detail. The weapons also look very authentic and not like cheap imitations. You can always see the wealth of the figures in their clothes and armor. From dirty to neat to pompous and extremely clean and polished, there is the whole range here. Again, everything looks very authentic.The German dubbing is top notch and I love that our German voice actors continue to use the medieval language and actually pronounce terms and names in French or sometimes Latin. Very authentic!CGI animations / action scenes / fight choreographies:CGI didn't really stand out to me in the film, either because it has excellent qualities or simply because no CGI was used. Either way, excellent!Action scenes are rather scarce in the film. Apart from the titular duel at the end of the film, there are two or three smaller fights between the French, English and Scots during the war campaigns. These, however, have it in them and are bloody, brutal and dirty. The duel at the end is extremely exciting and hard, as a viewer I fevered extremely, already out of fear because of the possible outcome and the possible consequences.Camera / Scenery / Editing:I liked the camera angles throughout, except that in some fight scenes the camera was too close and some cuts were a bit too fast. But in the quiet scenes, which make up 95% of the film, the camera angles are always good. I also like the editing very much. There is never a rush in the action. What I like is that the camera angles in scenes that are repetitive are then completely different, matching the currently central character whose point of view you are experiencing.Music:The music is mostly very subtle or even non-existent. Often the events are so much in focus that the music is barely noticed. But in scenes like during the duel or in other larger scenes, the music is really well done and fits the time perfectly.Conclusion:The Last Duel is a board of a historical film. Unlike Ridley Scott's Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven or Exodus, the focus here is more on drama than entertainment value. In that respect, the other films are a bit more varied and also easier to watch. There is drama and emotion in the aforementioned films as well as a lot of spectacle and entertainment. The Last Duel is more of a pure drama here, which is nevertheless not boring at any minute if you can and want to get involved with the story and the characters and especially the narrative style from three points of view.For me, an extremely strong and truly authentic and believable historical film, but also very demanding and heavy on the stomach.There is one point ""deduction"", because I personally like it more when such films do a good balancing act between drama and entertainment, just like Gladiator. This is therefore more of a personal and subjective point deduction, which does not stem from weaknesses of the film.9/10 points - Low rewatch value.",The Last Duel
169,neurocore,Flawed and yet the best pandemic era big budget movie,8,21 October 2021,"The Last Duel had a simple but very compelling story.Take any other blockbuster in the last few years: Tenet, Dune, No Time To Die. They all share a common flaw: the story leaves you emotionally empty. You remain an observer who's never engaged , who's never truly sucked in by the story.Good news , TLD is the opposite. It will make you angry, it will make you sick and uncomfortable. Ridley Scott will test your patience and push your buttons but you shouldn't lose hope, you will be rewarded for it.",The Last Duel
170,rongan,Engaging script with admirable portrayals...,8,17 October 2021,"I think the first of 3 episodes was a bit slow. The last two were very good, but repetitive scenes should've been filmed from different angles. A few moving scenes worked on my emotions. A couple of twists did too. Most of Ben's wisecracks brought on smiles.Before the duel I was hoping both bad men will kill each other until a good reason to root for one of them was provided.I didn't recognize Ben until Matt was on his knees in front of him - that inside joke worked for me due to the smirk on Ben's face. Affleck will get an Oscar nomination - I'd bet on it. Usually when an actor just about steals every scene he's in and the movie seems to be more entertaining when he's on the screen, that actor earned a nomination.Jodie Comer and Adam Driver are good bets for nominations and one might win. I doubt if Ben will win. Matt might be nominated for writing the screenplay, only.The movie is worth seeing, but not one to highly recommend for many reasons.",The Last Duel
171,flissayre,"Terrible accents, great storytelling",7,5 November 2021,"The script and way the story was told made up for the terrible accents. Apart from Jodie Comer all the accents were terrible, Ben Affleck's is particularly bad.In the wrong hands the 3 stories could have been repetitive and dull but it was done so well and kept me engaged throughout.",The Last Duel
172,terramail,Overall well done,7,16 October 2021,"Good movie but not better than gladiator or brave heart type epics. I really didn't like Ben in a 14th century lord character , nor did I buy matt as a 14th century French knight but they are both outstanding actors. Cinematography was beautiful. Ridley is an excellent director full stop. Storyline was a bit lazy for an epic of this magnitude and budget. Needed way more depth, character development . Seemed like some irrelevant scenes were added in randomly and I'm still trying to figure out if it has any lipids besides gore. The costumes , set and cinematography would be 9.5 /10 but the stories cohesiveness is like a 6.",The Last Duel
173,adambartaaa,Not worth,4,5 November 2021,"The movie is based on a true story that is itself interesting, but the delivery was poor. You spend 2 hours watching the same thing all over but from different perspectives. That usually doesn't mean that it needs to be bad (Quarantino example) but this movie was just boring. I would personally give this 2/10 but I have too much respect for Matt Damon's acting, which was one of the only reasons why I I didn't leave in the middle.",The Last Duel

175,zeldery,"A drama about pride, power and truth",8,2 November 2021,"It has been a long time since the big screen see another ""serious"" movie about life, death, pride, power and truth. I don't mean other fantasy, super-hero movies are bad, but you will miss movies like the last duel because it becomes rarer and rarer everyday.The story followed three persons, or to be exact three stories, of the famous last duel by combat in the France history, occur in late 14th century. From the really good screen-writing of Academy-Winning dual, Ben and Matt, audience will see the same story in three different point of view, their reasons behind the choice that led all three to a combat of death and life, of humiliated and pride.The acting is on point, the cinematography is very solid, especially in visualizing the difference in their stories. This movie is on my list of re-watching, not only for the small details that the director put into, but also for a very good movie overall.For what to improve, I think the second act is the weakest point of the whole story. The act portraited the accused point of view, letting people see his reasons, motif, and the movie did not handle it too well, especially for modern audiences. It led to not enough sympathy for accused, and a predictable act three, where truth comes out. I am not sure how to fix it, but I think it should be better.",The Last Duel
176,Mr-Topshotta,"""THE LAST DUEL"" REVIEW",8,18 October 2021,"Directed by Ridley Scott. Starring Matt Damon as ""Sir Jean de Carrouges and his Frenemy ""Jacques Le Gris"" played by Adam Driver. With The most heinous act, RAPE done to ""Marguerite de Carrouges"", ""Sir Jean de Carrouges"" wife played by Jodie Comer. Who I must say was born to play these types of roles.This true story tells you the point of view from the three main characters. Matt Damon character of ""Sir Jean de Carrouges"" and how he saved Adam Driver character ""Jacques Le Gris"" life and how their friendship soured over time especially as ""Jacques"" became closer to the King of France cousin and lord over them ""Pierre d'Alencon"" played by Ben Affleck. Who hated ""Sir Jean"". And all the events leading to and after his wife's rape.It tells ""Jacques"" side of him being a loyal friend and using his friendship to ""Pierre"" to help his friend. But it also depicts his more savage side. He also shows how ""Marguerite"" flirted with him and wasn't as innocent as she seems.""Marguerite"" gives her side and the truth of everything. Inserting her story line with the two others. You do find out what really happens and the epic duel that decides who is lying and who is telling the truth. Which is extremely impossible to put that type of weight on this. Like if I'm a beater fighter your screwed no matter who's telling the truth.This was a true story that best friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote together. It's a fascinating story because it's about one of the first times that someone spoke up about Rape which forced legal action which turned into a duel. See back then it wasn't a big deal that a woman got raped but it's a big deal because your tampering with a man (her husband) property. Messed up I know. Also the Consequences that come with it because if they find you guilty which in most cases they would you get brutally killed. Most women don't want to take that risk.Also the minds of men. Just shows no matter what the time frame is, men can be some simple minded creatures i tell you. There is a scene where they say you can't get pregnant if your raped, you also can only get pregnant if you enjoy the sex. You see why women just didn't say anything, these are the people deciding your fates.I personally love mid evil time period movies. I love knights and the gruesome fighting/sword play. This had an interesting story line that was very layered. You didn't know what truly happened. Who was lying and who was telling the truth till almost the end. I have to mention they had a ton of STARZ ""The White Queen, The White Princess, The Spanish Princess cast members in it. Especially with Harriet Walter who plays ""Nicole de Carrouges"". She plays the mean mother/mother in law perfectly.""The Last Duel"" is slow paced but not boring. It's intriguing and layered. You find yourself rooting for certain characters, and hating others. Then flipping and hating the ones you loved. If you love period pieces you will enjoy this. It's just enough fighting to satisfy you in that regard. It's based on a true story which captivates you. I didn't know how I would like Matt Damon in this. It didn't seem believable but he played it very well. When you have a template already with Matt and Ben writing to it with Ridley Scott directing and actors that were born to play these types of roles you can't go wrong. I give this four more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥

178,matexunleashed,A schizophrenic grotesque mess of a movie,4,17 October 2021,"I'll be brief
cons:
when it tries to be historically accurate medieval times portrayal, it utterly fails because of the usage of modern language, words, phrases which just makes it odd and off and doesn't allow the viewer to build a belief that he indeed watches a 14th century eventswhen it tries to be funny, it throws at you some forced cringe marvel-style humour which rarely is any close to being funnyit purposely remodels the view of the role of those time, and I do not argue that those were injust harsh times for females but at the same time, putting some wannebe warriar feminist vibes in a movie about 14th century is just insulting, both to the viewer and to those past women, cause it simply undermines their hardshipsthe dialogues are weak, partly because of the totally not suitable modern wording, but also because often they are close to sitcom level and the only thing missing are the laughs at the backgroundthe acting is okeish at the best most of the times, Damon and Affleck, although I like them, seem to me one, maybe two-dimensional actors at best. Driver and Comer do slightly better job but nothing spectacular to be honestthe battles are chaotic and very fast paced, I don't know if it's a con exactly cause probably the real battles were chaotic as hell, but again, they are quite hard to follow and notice any detailseven the music sometimes is really off and it's not helping in climate building, especially in the rape scene, what was it, some dubsteepy war stylepros:
the costumes are goodthe sceneries were goodUnfortunately it's a total miss, it's really unconsistent movie. Most of the times it uses modern language, it places modern behaviour in times where it simply was not present. It really makes you feel that you're watching a failed parody of medieval. If you want a decent medieval times movie, go watch ""The King"", not this one, cause it simply tries to be to many thing at the same time, and fails in most of them.",The Last Duel
179,nessandandy,A great film..a bit perplexed by some of the middling reviews.,8,16 October 2021,I went into this with relatively low expectations having read some reviews which were less than positive. How wrong they were. This is Scotts best film in a while & Damon was excellent as were Driver & Comer. An unusual story well told by one of the all time great directors. Go and see it.,The Last Duel
180,swannwolff,God does protect those who tell the Truth,10,15 October 2021,"From the very first scene ""The Last Duel"" engulfs you into its medieval world.The score, the costumes, the locations, everything is in its place.Jodie Comer stands out with her layered and emotional portrayal of Marguerite de Carrouges, a young woman who finds herself surrounded by older, rougher men shaped by war. A world where she is seen only for producing an heir, sex and her heritage.Matt Damon as Jean de Carrouges has a naïve, chevaleresque view of things. A simple man, without hidden motives. Insensitive but not with a bad heart. He desperately wants to be respected.Adam Driver perfectly portrays his flawed character, Jacques Le Gris. A vicious, ambitious, power hungry man, consumed by his carnal desires.And Ben Affleck, well, I'll let you see by yourself.A raw and truthful portrayal of how a woman must have felt in these dark times.Some scenes are especially difficult to watch but are there with a purpose.The Duel itself is exquisitely filmed and choreographed. It grips you and holds you until the end. The tempo of the fight itself is expertly done.Years of experience are evident in this epic medieval movie. GO WATCH IT.",The Last Duel

184,NellaMarieDudova,Trigger Warnings Would Be Nice,5,4 November 2021,"TW: SA. I can't argue that both of the Scott brothers are extraordinarily amazing and talented. Reading the book ""The Last Duel: A True Story of Trial by Combat in Medieval France,"" before watching this adaptation was undoubtedly a critical choice. The movie is long. Yes, two hours and thirty minutes can be a long time for the average watcher. However, in this case, it has been executed perfectly. Seeing the same set of circumstances from three different points of view will always be exciting and very hard to accomplish. Of course, the most iconic, reigning above all 1950's Rashomon. I was so excited to see Matt Damon and Ben Affleck work together once again. They also brought in a female writer (Nicole Holofcener) Who helped their cause, however, with all this praise. I must note that I was highly disappointed. As a survivor of sexual assault myself, I must say that I have seen many individuals leave the screening during the extremely explicit rape scene, and I was on the verge of a breakdown. This alone ruined the whole movie for me because all they needed to do was add a trigger warning to the beginning of the film. I have seen many women going to see the film to watch a movie empowering women. However, most of us (women) agreed that the movie was the polar opposite of empowering. On a different note, when it was revealed that Adam Driver would have a nude scene in the film, none of us thought it would be THAT scene.",The Last Duel

Maybe that helped with my enjoyment of the movie. I truly did not know how it was going to end.It did take me a little bit to find the groove of the story. There are some sudden transitions in time that lost me a little even though there are occasional title cards either dates.I've seen some reviews stating the message as too on the nose, but honestly, doesn't it have to be? I still see people here complaining about a feminist agenda. This stuff happens for real, maybe not every time but it is a reality.There is also a moment that is shown twice from two different perspectives and some think it's to unsettling to show an audience. I think the point is to make the audience uncomfortable watching these scenes and if you're not then there's something wrong with you.I thought this was a great movie that made its point very well.",The Last Duel

188,kdaddy-787-800267,Ridley Scott has lost his mojo,3,19 October 2021,"The trailer for this movie was amazing but really disappointed with movie.Okay it had moments but overall too slow in pace and boring.Oh Ridley you have fallen behind. The warning signs was the sequel to Prometheus. You just not cutting it no more.Gladiator will always be the standard Ridley Scott set and it has never been equaled or surpassed.What the hell was he thinking casting Ben Affleck.In one scene he sounded like Batman.3 stars for driver, Damon and Jodie Comer, who acted well.",The Last Duel
189,Jake_Mansur,Exceeds Expectations,8,17 October 2021,"Ridley Scott turned what I believed to be a rather straightforward plot into a well crafted, enjoyable movie experience. The special effects and cinematography are top tier, the chapter format works perfectly for the narrative, and the acting (if you can get over the accents) is very good.The film rewards the audience in the long run by providing bits and pieces of the story throughout the characters' perspectives, and the tension buildup in each chapter creates a satisfying payoff when the actual duel takes place. Each character's motivations make sense in the plot and explain why they act a certain way based on their personal perspective.I initially thought the film would be too long, but the way the story weaved characters' experiences together left me wishing for more scenes to further saturate the plot. It was a satisfying Medieval Drama, and one that I know I will revisit again.",The Last Duel

191,spencermcook,Jodie Comer may have just won herself an Oscar,8,3 November 2021,"It had been 24 years since Matt Damon and Ben Affleck collaborated to co-write a screenplay following the massive success of their film ""Good Will Hunting"" which debuted in 1997. In this gritty, authentic story, Damon, Affleck, and critically acclaimed Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien, The Martian) provide a direction of story telling that we don't get the privilege of seeing often enough on screen.Synopsis:""Jean de Carrouges is a respected knight known for his bravery and skill on the battlefield. Jacques Le Gris is a squire whose intelligence and eloquence makes him one of the most admired nobles in court. When Le Gris viciously assaults Carrouges' wife, she steps forward to accuse her attacker, an act of bravery and defiance that puts her life in jeopardy. The ensuing trial by combat, a grueling duel to the death, places the fate of all three in God's hands.""What You See, Feel, and HearIn other circumstances, you may come into a film based on a true story from the 14th century and find plenty of faults in the historical representation, but not with this film. With small details such as hairstyle, narrative, and gender perception you feel fully immersed within this era. The color gradient remains consistent with a cold, blue and gray scale to enhance emotions similar to those from a rain-filled environment.The major standout from this film is Jodie Comer and her performance. Coming off a fun performance in Free Guy, Comer transitions herself into this emotionally driven role with a character arc that is nothing short of impressive. The acting performances stood out collectively. This story is told from three perspectives; that of Sir Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) and Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Comer) which felt unique and refreshing. With each perspective came slight detail changes which affected the personality, facial expressions, and body language of each character and were executed brilliantly.This film is a complete STORY. If you're walking in hoping for a lot of action, this isn't that film. With a 2h 32min runtime, you're presented with a story filled with intricate dialogue, character development, and relationship building. In certain scenes, Scott portrays intimate moments in one take from many camera angles to allow the viewer to feel a raw emotion of empathy with the character's circumstances. Why is this admirable? Our emotions are usually emphasized or inflated by the score, a story climax, or character defeat whereas in these raw moments the story itself, without the influence of the score or a plot climax, brings out the viewer's emotions simply because of what is taking place and how it is being shown cinematically.My TakeThis film is impressive, and I enjoyed it. There's something about a film when directed, produced, acted, and filmed authentically that appeals to me most. Because of this, the two words that stick out to me in describing this film are quality and authentic. There's a moral message of integrity, an acting performance that will come up in conversation afterwards, and a format of story telling that you'll walk away admiring. I have two main critiques with this film. First, I feel as if the score was underutilized. This film is filled with emotion and persuasion and the score wasn't used to maximize those moments or emotions. Second, I feel that certain scenes could have been compressed throughout this film. Because of the way the story is told, you feel a sense of repetitiveness heading toward the climax. Instead of drawing scenes out, I think Scott could have compressed the story a bit while keeping major details in play. Overall, I encourage you to take time and experience this story and pay attention to the minor details, you won't be disappointed.Grade: 8.2/10.",The Last Duel
192,TRIDENT1745,A stark exploration of historical and modern feminity,8,21 October 2021,"As a personal fan of Matt Damon, Jodie Comer and Adam Driver, I was very curious with this film, and I can say that it indeed delivers.Set in 14th century France & Scotland, this film explores the futile land of the time, intertwined with the historical values of feministic ownership, abuse and treatment that often filter unnoticed into the modern age.This film is a thought provoking piece of art with exceptional performances from the cast all around, especially Jodie Comer, who carried a personally difficult role with ambition, courage and zest.I applaud the cast and crew for their efforts and urge everyone to watch this film in theaters.You will be shocked at the indifference a mere 800 years makes on the wretched hearts of humanity.",The Last Duel
193,alyssarod-34435,"The plot and acting were great, but something felt off",6,19 October 2021,"I was constantly pulled out of this movie. I could never remember a character's name; I constantly referred to them by their actors name. Halfway through the film I googled ""the last duel accent"" only to find articles saying the point of the ambiguous accents was specifically to not take you out of the movie- ironic.The message of this film is important but the comparisons between the setting and our current time were drawn so easily that the movie feels like a movie and not like a real story one wants to invest in. Of course the fact that these comparisons can be drawn is a fault of society, but it greatly amplified the other problems like the accents and some of the dialogue so much so that in the end this felt like a parody more than a period drama.The differing viewpoints was such a creative and refreshing idea and it kept my interest the entire time. The acting, especially from Jodie Comer, is spectacular. The message of the film is relevant and necessary, I was reminded of some of the ways I felt during Promising young woman last year while watching. Unlike promising young woman however, some of the writing and production choices I've mentioned don't allow the story to ever fully come together, and as a result the film doesn't stick the landing.Overall an enjoyable film with important things to say, but one whose minor problems in execution prevent it from being something great or easy to get invested in.",The Last Duel

It didn't get really good till about an hour in but I was pleased the rest of the way as the acting by Jodie Comer I thought made up for the lost time. Driver and Damon had some good moments too while Affleck had small parts. I also thought they should've had one consistent accent throughout the whole movie as it seemed weird and less authentic that individuals had American, British, and French accents. Preferably British because it's hard to replicate a French one. Really good ending though and a bit emotional. I would recommend this movie!",The Last Duel

It's the weirdest performance. Like he's preoccupied and he's fitting in this acting role in between something more important. He's troubled. Certainly not the dashing carefree blade we saw in Shakespeare in Love. He's had to give up his drug of choice and it weighs on him. Forever stuck in the mundane present, never again to elevate his mood ending the day feeling much better than he started it ( Dean Martin)

It did feel a little leaden in parts, but for mine Comer saves the picture. Her turn as the lady wronged amidst some at times wooden performances from the other stars, was simply breathtaking. Without her, I'm not sure I would have been so kind with my review. Does anyone else have a hard time believing that Affleck and Damon are actually writers? Hmmm just a sideways thought.",The Last Duel
199,sclarke-22895,A solid historical drama with a unique structure,8,25 October 2021,"As too be expected with a Ridley Scott film, The Last Duel looks incredible. The cinematography, production and costume design as well as the direction itself is a sight to behold for any film fan. The performances all around are terrific, the stand-outs in my opinion would be Adam Driver and Jodie Comer, who has proven with in this film and Free Guy earlier this year, that she has terrific range as an actress(both as a comedian and a dramatic actor). The battle sequences are gritty, brutal, and marvelously edited. While filmed mostly in hand-held, wide-shots and close-ups are edited in at the perfect moments to let the audience breathe as well as supplying us a moment to quickly gain an understanding of the scope of the fight. The musical score, or rather the lack of one, benefits the action as well, it makes the action feel more intense and visceral. The film is structured in a unique and interesting way, allowing each principle character to have a moment to shine(especially Comer). However, the first act can feel very rushed at times, jumping between different time periods and settings. Sometimes it can be hard to follow where our characters are, both emotionally and physically speaking. The edit is sometimes not as tight as it could be as well, some shots go on too long while some scenes feel cut short. Overall, a solid historical drama from Ridley Scott, one of the best directors of this generation.",The Last Duel

It's not about the fights, it's not about honour, rather it is about how people perceive things and how some people are harmed because of that. It's brilliant, and very very intense, and honestly not easy to watch. It doesn't adapt modern point of views, it's completely authentic and believable which makes it even better.

Matt Damon is excellent as usual and although I'm not a big fan of Adam Driver, his performance was strong. Ben Affleck was even decent as a contemptible Duke. My only issue is that the hero of the movie doesn't inspire me to like him even though he is the most righteous but most cold and insufferable character we have the misfortune to root for. Ridley did not try to make us like him. We were only asked to understanding him. My wife only identified with the wife but failed to transport her thinking back to the 14th century, therefore leaving her angry for the wife allowing such a situation to take place in the first place. Me? My love of history AND being a man, I got it. Sir Jean was a medieval warrior and his honor was currency. He would rather die than surrender his honor. Overall...great movie visually, entertaining and smart. When available on cable or Blu-ray, will rewatch many more times.",The Last Duel
205,appledude101,Should have been straight to Netflix release,5,20 October 2021,"The cinematography was incredibly lazy. Is the DP losing his touch, or does he simply not care anymore? The story did not make any sense for the first 30 minutes nor did it emotionally hook me. The retelling of the same plot 3 times did not have the effect it intended. If they wrote it in a way to where you didn't know who was telling the truth, it would have hooked the audience a lot more without having to go through the agonizing 3 retelling a of them story. As in History goes, we actually don't know what the truth is other than the result of the duel. Adam Drivers character could have been innocent for all we know. This would have been better if it was like Gone Girl. You make the audience keep guessing themselves who the real liar is. Very disappointed as this movie is way below the caliber of what Ridley Scott, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck are capable of.",The Last Duel
206,mentrik-tjen,Editing issues under a male gaze (mostly)- could have been a Gladiator!,6,24 October 2021,"SPOILERSWhy was this shown as 3 acts? I was pulled in by the trailer and the cast and director STAR billing but as a woman, the whole movie left me frustrated that it could have been better and more impactful with its underlying social messages. The whole movie was edited to show the POV of the 2 leading males and 1 woman ( 2 male writers and 1 woman writer) Why? You can guess which side I am on.... It would have made more sense if the movie was told from a male director and a female director and the whole movie cut into 1 (the objective POV of camera/audience gaze) which would've cut down the running time to under two hours- there was too much talk dribble and little fight action. Did we need to watch the actual rape scene twice?! NO!! I don't care to see the perpetrator's perverted POV even if it is been played by HOT Kylo Ren. If the view was to get more sympathy for his bad boy character, then it utterly failed. Yes he was handsome but that is no excuse. It really interrupted the pacing of the film and I preferred the traditional way of storytelling. Don't get me started on the fake (English) accents which is set in FRANCE! I can already see the disclaimer in the French screening of this Hollywood film. They actually have a right to be offended and protest (for once) ;) You can count on Matt Damon to play a loyal knight but their celebrity clouds the rationality of playing in a period film. Ben Affleck with his peroxide haircut looked like he stepped off from Shakespeare in Love and wrote this movie to make up for his own murky past in the ME TOO uprising and I am a fan of the actor.The movie really picked up and came alive in the climatic third act where we were treated to the actual duel. This sequence is where we see Ridley Scott's skilful direction shine with the dynamic camera movements (in the last 30 mins!) where you feel the tension with the lances violent clashing, wood splittering and in the brutal sword fight choreography reminiscent of Gladiator. (you will get your ticket value here and appreciate the BIG SOUND AND SCREEN HERE!) I think the general public (male) will hate this film and too 'auteur' and 'independent' for them.

208,TimelessCinema,Great Production with Difficult Subject Matter & a Disappointing Message,5,17 October 2021,"I usually avoid reading a synopsis before watching a film. But in this case I regret not doing so. As the the story is centered around the truth regarding the events involving a woman being taken against her will. With the story being told from her perspective, her husband's, and also her defilers. Ultimately leaving you with nothing worthwhile to walk away with.The film covers many themes through the character and story plots, such as: ambiguity, honor, honesty, integrity, faithfulness, and duty. When it comes to the overall narrative, the film at first seems to say that no matter what in life you must stand against those who have done you wrong in a firm and truthful manner. Then pivots to notions that perhaps it (at times) may be best to remain quiet for the sake of a greater purpose worth serving (such as survival or duty to your family).Bear in mind, I found the film well executed and believable. So much so that when I had to see a character I cared for put thru such tribulations it deeply disturbed me. So the film was successful in moving my emotions in a visceral way. But by leaving certain events ambiguous and lacking a worthwhile point to it all, you're only left with the idea that people can be cruel and reality traumatizing.",The Last Duel
209,GeneralHail,Jean de Carrouges vs. Jacques Le Gris. Ridley Scott strikes once again!,9,21 October 2021,"What a monumental movie this was. Not only the way how it was built up, starting with a preview of the (ultimate) duel, then leaving the remaining duel open, leading through this kind of criminilastic view and showing the three different perspectives from the varying characters and finally regaining to the battle at the end of the movie.This story is really captivating and Ridley deals great with it. It tells a story, that if you love medieval tales and stuff (like me) is really worth watching. It starts with the duel in 1386, then jumps back to 1370, leading through the years until we reach the year 1386 again. The battles are brutal, but believable. The actors and cast are fantastic, well chosen, Adam Driver shows why he is an upcoming talent, Matt Damon & Ben Afflek are great and fit well and Jodie Comer was the perfect choice for this role. The costumes are well made and believable (maybe the helmets aren't for the historical nerds and lunatics that take everything too serious, if it ain't correct, but at least the costumes are better than e.g. The Witcher or this worse Robin Hood production from 2018, but I wouldn't rate a whole movie bad, just because I didn't like the helmets. Ridley Scott still delivers), the scenery and setting is great. The soundtrack is subtle, but fits well.When I first saw the runtime I was worried that it could be too long, but I loved every minute of it and can only say that Sir Ridley Scott still knows how to make a great and decent movie. Well done Mr. Scott, my hat's off to you!",The Last Duel
210,bmariusmrdr,10 for putting back the color into medieval world.,10,1 November 2021,"Visually it impressed me much. It felt like the characters from the illuminati manuscripts came to life. The dialogs and the actors play were immersive. No compromise was done with the script, no attempt to sweeten the medieval reality. The ""Rashomon"" narrative style put the actors into the spotlights. The movie revolves and evolves around their acting. Each retelling of the story brings new details, and the subtle variations into interpretation avoids skillfully the redundancies. The kiss scene between Legris and lady Marguerite de Carrouges at the banquet in Crispin is one of my favorite scenes and shows how a simple gesture can change the perception on the hole story. The duel is exceptional. Despite some historic discrepancies it's absolutely brilliant. Well played, perfectly paced and vivid, almost like the script was written by Jean Froissart. A must seen.",The Last Duel

I watched this film about an actual historical event 600 years ago. I thought with horror that in many countries of the world, there are still no laws against domestic violence (including Russia). The anti-abortion legislation in Texas is actually the same medieval notions about the female body as the silent property of the man/state/church.Director Ridley Scott combines his signature style of the historical film drama with Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon Effect,"" where the same event is shown from the point of view of different characters.And we see three stories: a noble husband, a courtly knight, and Margarita, a victim of violence.

Sorry but this was a terrible casting decision, he's so wooden and his attempts to not sound like Matt Damon fail miserably.I found it quite boring. I think this is due to it being separated into three chapters and seeing the same story unfold from three different perspectives but with very little difference.Pretty ridiculous sound design in the battle scenesThe same lengthy rape scene repeated. I know why it's there three times but there must be a better way to convey the differences in how it occurred.With all this I'm only giving 4* for it 😕",The Last Duel

215,Gus-69,Brilliant writing and engaging performances,7,22 October 2021,"Apart from the coincidental fact that both are period pieces featuring two dueling Frenchmen, Ridley Scott's The Last Duel and the 1977 debut The Duellists share one relevant trait in common: they are character-driven historical dramas in which the spectacle is at the service of a story that, uninterested in myth-making, casts a dark shadow over the honor of men. This more recent incursion in the past of soldiers and kings goes beyond the perceived slight that sparked a decades-long feud between Harvey Keitel's and David Carradine's characters in the latter, however: flexing his worldbuilding muscles to materialize the best script he has worked with in a long time, Scott uses the big screen canvas to paint a most unflattering picture of nothing less than the patriarchy.Men are driven solely by their ego, need for money, or lust, abetted by religion and the law. Women are valued inasmuch as their dowry can make a future husband solvent and their bodies, able to breed male heirs. Each successive perspective (dubbed ""truth"" in the intertitles) in the tripartite narrative structure gets increasingly knottier and revealing. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, along with Nicole Holofcener, wrote themselves indefensible roles that inspire almost as much revulsion as Adam Driver's smarmy rapist, while making sure Jodie Comer's Marguerite stood out as the film's one source of light. She may be a rape victim, but she's also the one brave soul amongst all the hypocrites shielded by the sociopolitical infrastructure.The Last Duel marks Scott's seventh entry in this subgenre. It's entertaining and well-crafted, with lots on its mind. It's also something Scott can do in his sleep.",The Last Duel

217,mrobertson-33677,Me Too Ridley,5,4 November 2021,"The visual landscapes and cinematography are stellar. The costumes, makeup, and attention to ambient detail are exceptional. I went to see the movie without researching the story line and was disappointed to find that it was about a domestic dispute and criminal rape. The subject matter gets me thinking about the me too movement and how difficult it was for women throughout history. The problem is that I don't want to think about modern politics when I watch movies about the 14th century. Aside from the story and subject matter there is another major problem: it is Ben Affleck. Every Ben Affleck line is cringe-worthy. He has zero ability and belongs in reality television not movies (he makes Orlando Bloom seem like Marlon Brando). Affleck's look in the film is consistent with the 1980s punk rock scene and takes away from the feel of the time. His orgy scenes and behavior toward women and sex do nothing to improve the story, and have no place in historic time period movies. Adam Driver was as bland as usual - he looks and acts like a high school guidance counselor, and I don't understand how he lands so many lead roles. On the other hand, Matt Damon was surprisingly good. Damon and Jodie Comer saved the movie from the other headliners. Unfortunately it's not enough for me to revisit this.",The Last Duel

How she planned the rape in a conspiracy with Jacques Le Gris and leave the castle with all servants. Jacques knew as part of the conspiracy when to enter the castle and would ensure continuation of the family .

They do go fairly deep into Ben Aflecks story about why he became a blonde bee keeper but Matt Damon's gardener is somewhat pushed aside in favor of the more action packed story regarding honey collection and colony upkeep. It's riveting seeing Ben Afleck in action as he goes about the tasks of being a bee keeper and trying not to get stung in the process! Matt Damon looks old and tired but it must be from all that squash he keeps trying to grow, to no avail.

The questions lawyers asked in the historical documents, and others involved in the trial of 1387, made it into this movie and it tried to answer them in the most intelligent way.No women would falsely accuse a man of rape knowing she would burn if found giving false testimony. I love the risks The Last Duel took knowing that it would also burn if it didn't tread the line between #metoo and #cancelculture, while still being truthful.Beautiful cinematography.

To a fault, even.This is going to be a hard movie for some dudes to watch. I can hear the male outrage echoing through the privileged halls of Regal Cinema already.The Last Duel needed to be told three times for guys the like one sitting behind me at our viewing today. He said ""She lead him on!"". He marched out of the theater after Jean's less that triumphant march through Paris. We have all learned to look at the world through the male gaze. When we are asked not to, it's uncomfortable and disorienting. It's this disorientation that you leave the theater with. Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Who do we cheer for? Why do we stay silent? Because it is easier and more reassuring to stay within our map of the world than to destroy it. How you felt about this movie after viewing says so much more about your view of yourself and your place in the world than it does about the movie. Bored? Crying? Angry? Or all of the above like me? I wanted to be entertained! I wanted a thunderous ending to tell me when to clap! I wanted Jean's to see the error of his ways and redeem himself with a understanding embrace! I was left with the empty feeling that there are far more Jean's and Jaques in this world than heros. There are far more Madame de Carrouges than Marguerites.

224,briellemckendry,somehow exceeded my expectations,8,16 October 2021,"I feel like the trailer for this film was a bit misleading, and I mean that in the best way. I think it was a deliberate choice and it paid off. I saw something much different than I had been expecting to see, knowing Ridley Scott, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck were all involved. Being a fan of each of their work, I knew this film wouldn't be just another mid grade, medieval action film. That you can tell by the genius in casting Adam Driver. But the performance that truly blew me away was Jodie Comer's. Her role in the film is much larger than I had been expecting and she most certainly steals the show. I love that these men who have been in the business so long were able to make such a wise move here and tell the stories of those who have long been forgotten in films like these, without sacrificing any of the classic period piece elements of that people love. The costuming was well done and the filming techniques and scenery were incredible. I love that the fight scenes were gory and realistic, but the film wasn't overly riddled with them and they weren't made to be the main focus. I think it was very tastefully done and the acting was very memorable. I wouldn't say it was Damon's best performance, but as always Adam Driver impressed me. But the real hero here is Jodie Comer, and I hope she gets the recognition she deserves for this role. I also loved how they told the story from all three character's perspectives; it was well done and didn't feel boring or redundant, and I never once felt like the film was too long or dragging on despite the run time of two and a half hours.

227,xboyjd,Great film that can be hard to watch at times.,9,29 October 2021,"Amazing performances from Matt Damon, Adam Driver and especially Jodie Comer. The beginning of the film was a bit hard to follow because they kept jumping forward in time without any warning, but thankfully it got easier to follow as it went on. The film is broken up to three different points of view, and it did a great job on showing how different people viewed the same events. Due to dealing with a very sensitive subject matter (rape), there were parts of the film that were hard to watch, but to me, that means that they did their job because something like that very much should be uncomfortable to watch. This is a film that could have very easily become a film where a rape is nothing more than a plot point to ignite the feud, but thankfully, this film does not fall into that hole, as Comer's Marguerite is a completely fleshed out character and is arguably the star of the film over Damon and Driver.

Ridley Scott knows what he's doing behind a camera. Great visuals and a great score. Brutal battle sequences and nuanced characters round out the good with this film.Now for the bad... Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Adam Driver have zero talent when it comes to accents. Every time they spoke, I had to remind myself that they are supposed to be French and not from French Lick, Indiana. There performances were actually strong but their accents or lack of accents took me out of the movie a little bit every time they spoke. The movie also gets a little repetitive as it recounts the same story 3 times from 3 different perspectives. And lastly, they dropped the ball with a dull ending.

Throughout the duration you feel like you're in the hands of a capable director (surprise, surprise). All the acting is top notch led by the excellent Adam Driver. And the final duel is pretty damn good.However for a movie that makes the audience invest their time in watching parts of it 3 times it just doesn't create the adequate intrigue or make you conflicted enough for that investment to pay off. As soon as we see Le Gris's account, there isn't much doubt as to how things went down besides some subtle differences. And from that point onwards instead of being conflicted about who to believe and who not to, instead of being afraid that someone might be wrongly punished, you're left no choice but to root for just one party.That lack of complexity and doubt means the movie just ends up being a simple story of crime and justice with Jodie Comer's character's courage in a male dominated time the only thing to appreciate narrative wise.",The Last Duel

Some adults are so stupid these days, so lost in fear that they actually prefer to be babysat. To me it's pathetic. This film is a total joke. It doesn't even try to be realistic or thought provoking in it's portrayal of three different accounts of the same event. People over and over keep saying in their reviews that the woman is raped or sexually assaulted twice on screen. Perhaps you clowns weren't paying attention to the film at all. The one perspective is that she wasn't raped. Duh! She's only raped once on screen, in which we mostly only see her face. Wake the hell people and realize that hell has come to our planet, now! The other view of the scene is I guess Ben, Matt, Ridley and Nicole Holofcener's view of consensual extramarital sex in medieval times. She gave the ""standard protest"" or something to that effect says Jacques Le Gris but ""It was consensual"". The whole film is a ridiculous mess. The fact that anyone thought this was good makes me both laugh, and want to throw up. The fact that anyone thought that it was great makes me fall over laughing.

I wish they hadn't done the three perspectives just from a personal standpoint but i think the writing was really good and they did a good job of telling it from the men's perspective without trying to justify the act. It was a lot of metal tin can sounds but overall the cinematography and sound design was good too. The acting was fine at least for the men. They were good, but matt damon and adam driver didn't like ""wow"" me. I think there's other movies where they're significantly better. Jodie comer is a whole other story though...she elevated act 3 and outshone the rest of the cast easily. Even during the final duel, the thing the movie is named after, you weren't focused on the men. You were focused on her, just standing on a wooden structure because her acting was so good. Overall good movie, i would recommend, and ben affleck is funny to a certain extent. 8/10.",The Last Duel
241,elijahsmith-24400,Wasn't what I thought it would be but it was good,7,19 October 2021,"Overall I think The Last Duel was a pretty good movie and I definitely recommend it but the trailer was very misleading I came into this movie thinking it was a war movie or about Duels but it's actually about 3 different people one was raped, one was the rapist, and one was the Husband of the girl that was raped and it does a great job showing each side of the story because in the rapist head he was thinking that she said no but think that it was just because she was married and she wasn't doing anything about it. In her side of the story she was screaming and wanting him to stop telling him to stop. Another instance of this is when Matt Damon's character is finding out that she was raped on his side of the story he was nice about it and was pissed at Adam Drivers character but in her side he was pissed at her and choking her asking if she is tell the truth. The only real problem I have with this movie is that it is way too long for the story it is telling I think they should keep the three sides in but there is so much unnecessary stuff that doesn't really have to go along with the story and I get that they were trying to show that she couldn't get pregnant with Matt Damon's character but they did not need that many sex scenes.",The Last Duel

The splitting in three different viewpoints was genius. I loved the little details added in to be accurate, such as Queen Isabeau being pregnant at the Palais de Justice (She gave birth to a son called Charles, who died the day before the duel), and the beliefs that a child couldn't be concieved in rape and that it was necessary for a woman to have the big O in order to concieve.The only things I didn't like was the fact the lighting of the film was quite dark, and Count Pierre.I didn't like the way the character of Count Pierre was written. He just wasn't serious enough for me. Jacques had more redeeming qualities. The f bombs were just unecessary and took away form the experience.

The language, fashion, culture etc is not relatable so I usually get bored. This movie nails it though, the fact it's set in the 13th century is irrelevant. The action scenes are brutal and incredible, with suspense built before them. The plot provokes thought, causes you to invest in the characters, all the while providing perfect escapism. The only reason it didn't get 10 stars from me is the terrible wardrobe department who for some reason can't make a woman look pregnant without making her look like she's got a pillow stuffed up her dress.Initially I had some criticism into the fact the lead female "" marguerette "" had poor character development and her recollection of interactions with the lead male characters seem dim and lack lustre. However, having digested the movie for 48 hours now, it makes sense and is actually very clever. The woman's testimony and story will have been poorly documented in that time due to the fact that women had little importance in society. Her recollection of the interaction with the male characters lacking lustre is exactly how she experienced those interactions. Her personal life, and work achievements are what she remembers with the most detail because that's what she found the most self worth and pleasure from.Simply a brilliant movie.",The Last Duel

It had the potential to be classic Scott film with beautiful cinematography and memorable performances from A-list talent but the plot was obvious even more so with the actors like Adam Driver in their traditional tropey roles. Usually Ridley Scott will bring big name actors only if they serve to enhance any role no matter how small or minor and contribute outside the box of a usual film's limits, but here you can see the ""Netflix effect"" of stuffing the bill with big names like SEO keywords to draw attention in press. The industry-wide adopted negative effect of continuing to use Netflix actors (Jody Comer) in big features continues unabashed plus the wokeness of a woman's plight added to the redemption of Affleck and Damon to champion their cause with the denouement of this film, its Hollyweird in full effect.A shame.

It almost feels like Scott's name was used to give credibility to a message that was not his own.The Last Duel manages to drive your emotions into a corner to side with the female character, while devaluing the male character's brave actions by assuming he's fighting solely for his pride. The movie creates an emotional split between them, further emphasising the gender conflict.Yes, gender inequality was real in the Middle Ages.

258,fivefooteskimo,SPOILER ALERT: POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!,1,20 October 2021,"Here's my review of it for IMDB where it got 7.7 freaking rating/I am confused by the 7+ rating. I don't like to go into movies having read reviews, I like to go in open minded and ready to be surprised. The Last Duel was certainly surprising. I walked out after 2.5 excruciating hours of disjointed crap, confused and angry. I feel that the trailer straight up tricked me. This is a boring and repetitive rape movie that vilifies men to the worst, most gratuitous domestic degrees, and is just plain painful for women to sit through. The timeline of what was happening was unclear for the first 45 min., there was no character development (as it was presented in segments from each different characters perspective), each segment was very very similar aside from wildly differing degrees of callousness and cruelty between how the men had seen themselves in their own piece and how they had actually behaved. I do NOT care how this movie ended, nothing could justify sitting through another minute of the MAIN EVENT of the movie which was NOT a duel, but a repeating chase and subsequent rape scene. I would have been embarrassed if I had spent another single minute watching this. I'm not out of touch, I think I see where they were going with various elements, but my mind is boggled as to how or why anyone would pay for this particularly SOMEHOW simultaneously boring and triggering movie to be made. It wasn't empowering, it wasn't enlightened, it wasn't relevant, it ISN'T indicative of society today; at least not here in the US. Did it portray that people can do horrible things and justify them to themselves, possibly actually thinking they really did nothing wrong? Yes, and hammering that home is the only thing it did well, and it could have made a MUCH more thoughtful impact if they'd taken that SOLE concept, scrapped the rest of the movie, and then gotten someone else to write something that wasn't this.",The Last Duel
259,Beyond82,Masterpiece!,10,20 October 2021,"Another masterpiece from Ridley Scott!Stunning imagery and beautiful Sound design,
Score and a great castBeautiful performances from everyone
Involved, especially Jodie Comer and
Adam Driver.",The Last Duel
260,johnwest-22811,"Has a lot to say, most of which is pointless.",3,21 October 2021,"Firstly, all performances in this film by key actors were of a high quality; Adam Driver, Jodie Comer and Matt Damon were obviously directed with grace and detail, and that effort in directing them can be seen in their performance. However, there are periods in the film, especially during conversations, where it becomes apparent that this same level of detail cannot be seen in the script.The first thirty minutes of the film operates like a carnival ride, with scenes that don't last any longer than two minutes, and function without any meaningful connection between them. Time that could have been taken to establish the world, or the characters, or the intrigue of the political world in which the story takes place is instead spent on frivolous scenes that leave the viewer dizzy and bored.After an abysmal beginning to the film, the viewer is treated with a fairly interesting story told from the perspectives of Carrouges (the husband) and Le Gris (the accused) in two chapters. However, where accounts could have been contrasted against each other, which would tell a story of two perspectives, and prompt internal discussion about the events the film is based upon, the movie simply shows additional scenes and makes minute changes in the accounts of specific events. Additionally, in these first two chapters, the film tries to create a story about the deterioration of a friendship between Carrouges and Le Gris, but fails to actually show a genuine deterioration beyond childish antics during land disputes. There is no palpable development to either of their characters, nor any emotional impact to the breakdown of their relationship As a result, the climax of the story holds hardly any weight.The third chapter tells the story of Marguerite (the victim). It opens with the title card ""The truth according to Marguerite de Carrouges"", then fades out all words except ""The truth"". It is at this point where any and all nuance and intrigue about the events of the film is stripped away and replaced with an unending slew of pointless messages about rape, domestic abuse, and women's rights. This messaging beats the viewer over the head for no reason other than to score political points with prospective critics. Obviously, Ridley Scott is hoping to regain some sort of relevance in today's political sphere. This chapter suffers from the same pacing issues as the first two chapters, and meanders along until it falls upon the rape scene.Many critics have said this rape scene was crucial to the development and emotional weight of the story; a great many critics have also said this rape scene was insensitive and inconsiderate toward survivors of rape. Nevertheless, this scene is completely lacking in purpose and importance to the script; the rape scene exists solely to invoke a visceral response in the viewer, whether through disgust, or outrage, or offence, or empathy. The gratuitous and emotional nature of the scene operates for the sole purpose of trying to impress a committee of critics- which is otherwise known as ""Oscar Bait"". I will admit that this scene is brilliantly done; the choreography is great, the acting is sublime, and the dramatic effect of the scene is concrete. However, I cannot shake the fact that the gratuitous depiction of a rape is flippantly used to boost the film's ratings as a whole.The film ends with Carrouges besting Le Gris in combat, using his wife's accusations to restore his name and honour. Then Carrouges and Marguerite parade through crowds of commoners, who appear to only cheer on Carrouges while Marguerite appears to look on in dismay or jealousy- a strange decision by Ridley Scott, considering that her character had continually stated that she wished for the matter to be settled quietly and in court. Ironically, this final scene reminded me of Ridley Scott's decision to use a rape scene; he sits atop his high horse, showered with praise, while he facetiously depicts a rape in order to invoke compliments from his peers. He uses the horror of real world events to improve his standing in the industry.",The Last Duel

262,rlesconde,Another Ridley Scott Medieval Epic,7,24 October 2021,"The Last Duel (2021) 7.88 out of 10Ridley Scott is back with another medieval epic and this time with the help of writers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon with Nicole Holofcener. The Last Duel tells of the final judicial duel permitted by the parliament of France where one is accused of raping another's wife. It is told in three different narratives; Jean de Carrouges' (Damon), Jacques Le Gris' (Adam Driver), and Margueritte de Carrouges' (Jodie Comer). Stories of the quest for honor, quest for lust, and as highlighted in the film, the truth.At first, the story is slow and going in with zero information, it was confusing. But by the final narrative, I was fully into the film and during the ""last duel"", I actually held my breath. I did not know what was going to happen and the performances made it even more intense and heightened. Jodie Comer was the breakout star of this film as her performance in all three narrative was so real and you can really feel for her on screen. Expect nominations during awards season. Matt Damon and Adam Driver also delivered amazing performances as they portray the two sides of the patriarchy that is sadly still strong in our society today.The Last Duel is a grim, dark, and almost claustrophobic film that is even bolstered by the very little music it had. In contrast though, it is also a beautiful looking film with the environment taking you into the world. The costumes are amazing, the make-up is grittily realistic and the scenery is breathtaking. Be warned though, that a certain scene that is shown a couple times may be triggering. It's a tough watch, but I thought it was directed well by Ridley Scott. The fights and battles are also done well. I felt immersed into the action and felt every hit and blow as emphasized by the sound mixing. The only negative thing I have to say is, whenever Ben Affleck's Pierre d'Alencon comes in, his goofy character takes you out of the film. Overall, this is another great film by the 83-year-old and I'm excited for his next film this year, House of Gucci.In conclusion, I want to highlight a line in the film, ""Perhaps I would have done what many before me has... Nothing."" Please speak up. Do not just stand by and let things happen as they do. If you are horribly wronged, specially by way of this film's subject, which is rape, please speak up. Do not let these people go. As a man, I won't fully understand every emotion that goes into this subject, but I know that it is wrong and wrongs must be corrected. Please speak up.",The Last Duel

The dialogue is really good written and I laughed many times during the movie, not because it was comedic, but how ironic and painfully accurate some things were.A lot of different topics had been covered in the movie: Medieval politics, lifestyle, classes, church, medicine, believes...My only remark is that the battle scenes should've been longer and more detailed.

But because movies, like mythology, can be viewed as the collective dreams of our society.And like dreams, movies show us our faults, our triumphs, and can be the skeleton key to understanding the deepest mysteries that dwell inside us all.THE LAST DUEL examines human nature at its finest and most destructive, all through the lens of three subjective truths.From one perspective, we are beings capable of the highest honor that will bravely defend our land and faith by any means necessary.From another perspective we are creatures of desire, driven by forces that may well be out of our control.From a third perspective, we are individuals incapable of remaining silent in a world that is built to silence dissenters.Regardless of perspective, one pervading theme echoes throughout the entirety of this film: Does an objective truth exist?Maybe. Maybe not.In the end, this movie gives no clear cut answers and (fortunately) we are left to decide for ourselves.We all know Hollywood has its issues. Like our own subconscious minds, it is full of dark shadows, avarice, and carnal desires. But at its finest, Hollywood films hold up a mirror to society. And by doing so we are served art that can elevate the culture.So again, I implore you, please go see this movie, if for no other reason than to show Hollywood that films like this deserve to be made and we can continue to dream in the dark with strangers searching for stories that speak to the common nature inside us all.",The Last Duel

Exceeded beyond my expectations in both technical and artistic aspects of film.It is simply masterful and near perfect, reminding us of the horrific reality of the medieval past and that the nature of perspective is incredibly fragile, and at the same token, incredibly dangerous.",The Last Duel
282,matthewiman-62074,Absolutely Incredible,10,21 October 2021,"Worth the watch. Great acting, great writing, not a wasted scene in the movie. Must watch! So refreshing to see a real movie in theaters. I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD.",The Last Duel
283,wanthonygerard,Graphic Medieval Sword Fight,8,25 October 2021,"Ridley Scott has produced a spine-chilling medieval drama. Based on the historical novel, ""The Last Duel: A True Story of Trial by Combat in Medieval France"", it tells the story of what led up to the duel in three chapters from three different points of view.It is a bracing historical drama that alludes to the #MeToo moment and takes aim at misogeny. An epic story, often brutally graphic, it tells the story of a 14th century noblewoman who was raped by an aristocrat ( Adam Driver). Matt Damon plays the husband, who is rough shod knight and challenges him to a duel to the death. ( Ben Affleck does some of the best acting in the movie as arrogant royalty)The movie has three chapters, offering three different points of view, including the noblewoman's. Although the climax of the story is the graphic battle between the two knights on horseback, the most powerful part of the movie is the virtue and intelligence of the noblewoman. She pulls us in remorselessly into her interior world, challenging the misogeny of the 14th century. (Women in 14th century France were considered their husband's property).It's not as good a movie as ""Gladiator"", but Ridley Scott gives us a solid, often-disturbing tale of misogeny with graphic bloodshed.",The Last Duel
284,leedeeba,A great watch!,9,29 October 2021,"A lot better than expected, was the feeling I had when I left the cinema, I was fully in grossed in story and way it was told. The acting from all three main characters was amazing and complying, thumbs up Ridley!",The Last Duel
285,ketoned,Masterful storytelling,9,15 October 2021,"The Last Duel tonight was everything that I had hoped for from the trailer & more. The film is set in the Middle Ages with some stunning musical pieces from the time. The premise is that Marguerite (Jodie Comer) alleges that while her husband Carrouges (Matt Damon) was away fighting for King and country, squire Le Gris (Adam Driver) made his way in to her house and raped her. It is shown as the lead up to the alleged crime from 3 differing perspectives. With each differing account I was shocked and I loved the detail of the subtle differences in each experience the most. By the end you understand how each person can genuinely believe a different tale which is masterful. Jodie Comer is perfect but what made the film for me was that my head was consistently swapping between my support for Le Gris (Adam Driver) and Carrouges (Matt Damon). My heart was in my mouth throughout the final duel as you'd expect and despite it getting gory I could not take my eyes off the screen. I was engrossed for the full 152 minutes. Superb storytelling.(P. S did it take anybody else half of the film to deduce that Pierre was Ben Affleck? The goatee is ridiculously deceptive...)",The Last Duel
286,belyanovalexander,"Good movie, yet not a spectacular one",7,16 October 2021,"First of all let me say that I am a huge fan of historical movies. And thus, Sir Ridley Scott happens to be one of my favorite directors, having made movies like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. So, obviously, I had high hopes for this one. And even though I can't say that I was disappointed, the movie certainly did not excite me as much as I had hoped.The actors were well chosen and the cinematography was amazing, as one might expect from such a director. I especially liked the way the battle scenes were shot - the total chaos of medieval combat, with arrows, spears and swords flying around. The cacophony of the fully armored knights with their large battle horses charging lines of infantry... All in all very well delivered.What I disliked was the length of the movie. The story is told from 3 different perspectives, and even though I agree that the points of view of Sir Jean and le Gris are different enough and worth taking a look at, the third one from Lady Marquerite is pretty much a summary of the first two. The only thing I learned from her perspective, which I did not know, was that she was not as happy as her husband had thought. In my opinion, the story in itself is not long enough to make a nearly 3 hour movie, and I found the third perspective quite unnecessary.All in all I liked the movie, despite it being a bit repetitive for my taste.",The Last Duel
287,wrightwells,Poor attempt at a French vibe,5,16 October 2021,"Even with the very real issues of the story, was this really about the French, such a shame all the rich history was turned into a Disney.Visually effective but then so was the unreal world of Game of Thrones.Not even the correct English & French pronunciation from Matt Damon, was he still playing the kid from Good Will Hunting?We don't expect a French spoken film but wow, no attempt to make us believe this is set in France, other than an extra singing and a CGI of Notre Dame being built, when it would have been finished 60 year before the story.Started the review as a 6 but after reconsideration a 5.5.",The Last Duel
288,tltlarsen,Ridley made a stinker,2,17 October 2021,"I can't believe IMDB gave this a 7.7 rating. This movie is so boring. There are no surprises. You get to sit through three different perspectives of something that happened. Not for a moment did I forget I was watching an actor, rather than watching a ""character."" This film obviously cost a lot of money. It was money not well spent.",The Last Duel
289,markmalinousky,Someone Stop Ben Affleck,1,20 October 2021,"His acting is laughable at best, his writing is deplorable and he's nothing to look at.THIS FILM SUCKED!Not even Matt Damon could save this garbage!",The Last Duel
290,sophienapier,Absolutely nothing to enjoy,1,31 October 2021,"Hated every minute of this movie. Brutal, violent and way too realistic is how I would describe it.Not a single likable character except for female lead.",The Last Duel
291,griesarmand,"A good movie, a wonderful scenario and an amazing acting",8,12 October 2021,"First, I'm french and I've seen the movie with french dubb, which is alright (but feels sometimes a little bit mixed « on » the soundtrack and audio effects), so I can't tell about the original « not frenchy » voices.The movie presents itself through a hard and violent duel, which only by the trailer we know is about a woman. But with a length of 2h38, it's not just about that obviously. And without any spoiler, it's in fact almost three hours of a very good scenario. It shows stuff, and hide or untell others. We get out with more of a society questionning than a moral one, in my opinion.Acting is really good, Matt Damon nailed it with his fierce and violent knight. Ben Affleck, dispite his strange look is a brilliant lord. Adam Driver is a good vilain, but his origins seems a bit odd in the context. And finally, Jodie Comer manage a difficult play ; only drawback, she is far too perfect and dressed for a harsh environnement like the late middle-age.The overall movie is fine to watch, it seems historically accurate, with some anachronisms. The duel is a great piece of battle, with a general « show everything, including blood, guts and ass » vibe, which is in all middle-age movie these days (or GoT). The end is not to my taste « graphically ».Finally, the soundtrack is really good and I would have loved to heard it more.",The Last Duel
292,paulblest,A tale worth telling but...,8,25 October 2021,"Jodie Comer is luminous, Harriet Walker never fails to impress - and Adam Driver is convincing, but I feel that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are miscast - particularly the latter. I respect both as actors, but I think it was the inconsistencies with the 'British' accent that were a distraction, detracting from a context that was otherwise very convincing.Despite that, it is a tale worth telling and it is told well; something of a mediaeval 'Me too, it is dark and, brutal in interpreting the life of a woman who, in the era represented, must have been extraordinarily courageous. Historical records confirm this.",The Last Duel
293,mrnb-39155,"Good story & directing, sadly no French actors",8,4 November 2021,"This film is gripping, well written and the cinematography is amazing. Really enjoy Ridley Scott films in general and the master didn't disappoint again! The end is a fight as good as ever seen on the screen. Performance wise I really think that Jodie Comer has shown out with her grace, beauty and acting. Sadly the overexposed Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have been cast by Hollywood for the main roles. A Vincent Cassell or Jean Reno instead Matt and a Jean Dujardin instead Ben would have been much more appropriate and beneficial for a film of medieval France/Europe. But I guess Warner Brothers still thinks that American big name actors attract audiences. Apart of that though well worth a visit for the full cinema experience.",The Last Duel
294,rickh-64329,3 plot lines,3,20 October 2021,"Production value and performances were very good. However, the editing was disasterious. This movie would have been been much more compelling had the plot been linear instead of having 3 plot lines. It became very tedious after the start of second of three perspectives. When the third perspective started you just wanted it to be over with and get on with the duel.",The Last Duel
